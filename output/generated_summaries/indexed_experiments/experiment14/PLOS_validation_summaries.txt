Researchers studied how genetic variations in DNA affect gene expression in human lymphoblast cells, which are a type of immune cell. They found that changes in the way genes are processed at the end of their RNA, called polyadenylation, play a significant role in how much of the gene is made. This is different from previous studies that focused on changes in the DNA sequence before the gene is made into RNA. The team looked at how polyaden signals and other elements at the end of genes vary between individuals and found that they predict how much of the gene is made. They tested this in lab and found that changes in polyaden signals affect how much of the gene is made and that elements at the end of the gene control how much is made. They looked at one gene, IRF5, and found that changes in polyaden affect how it responds to antigen. The study shows that polyaden and elements at the end of genes are important in how genes are made and can be used to understand genetic variation in humans.
Researchers have studied the effectiveness of the SIVΔne vaccine, a weakened form of the simian immunodeficiency virus, in inducing protection against the wild-type virus. They used deep sequencing technology to analyze the CD8 T cell response, a type of immune cell that fights infection, in vaccinated animals. The study found that the initial CD8 response targets variable parts of the virus, but the virus quickly mutates and escapes. However, the CD8 cells adapt by targeting conserved parts of the virus and generating new responses to mutated variants. This adaptation correlates with the vaccine's protection. The researchers also found that the vaccine expands the CD8 cell repertoire, increasing its ability to fight the virus. The study highlights the importance of two key principles in vaccine design: anotropic specificity, targeting conserved parts of the virus, and repertoire depth, the range of responses. The SIVne vaccine, a gold standard in HIV research, demonstrates the significance of these principles.
Researchers studied how the body's immune system fights off a common fungal infection called Candida albicans in the mouth. They found that a protein called interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a crucial role in this fight. IL-1 helps by controlling the number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell, that attacks the fungus. It does this in two ways: by recruiting neutils from the bloodstream to the infected area and by making more neutils in the bone marrow. Without IL-1, the body can't fight the fungus as well, and the infection spreads. The researchers also found that IL-1 helps make a protein called granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) that helps neutils fight the fungus. G-CS is made by special cells in the mouth called endothelial cells, which respond to IL-1 released by other cells called keratinocytes. This shows how IL-1 talks to different parts of the immune system to fight the fungus. The study found two ways IL-1 helps neutils fight Candida in the mouth, which is important to prevent the fungus from spreading and keep the body healthy.
Between 2000 and 2007, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filari (GPE) delivered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via mass administration of anti-filar drugs in at-risk areas for 4-6 years. The economic benefits of this achievement were calculated by quantifying the number of clinical manifestations averted and associated with disease prevention in the context of direct costs, indirect labor, and healthcare for affected individuals. Reviewing multiple sources, including the World Health Organization, International Fund, and Labour, an estimated $21.8 billion in economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million treated during the first 8 years of GPE. This includes $2.3 billion from protection of nearly 3 million and individuals from acquiring lymphatic filari as a result of being born in areas freed transmission. Additionally, 28 million infected benefit from GLF halting progression, resulting in $19.5 billion economic benefit. At-risk individuals decreased services with reduced morbidity save health systems $2.2 billion. The Programme offers significant economic benefits, with favorable implementation largely due to donated drugs from the industry, showing a high return on investment.
Scientists have created a new animal model to study a rare genetic disorder called Gaucher disease, which affects the brain and nervous system. Gaucher disease is caused by a mutation in the GBA gene, which leads to a lack of an enzyme called glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme helps break down a fatty substance called glucocerebroside. Without it, the substance builds up in cells and causes problems. The new model, called GBA- medaka, is a type of fish that lacks glucerebrosase activity. Unlike humans and mice without the enzyme, G- medaka lived for months, allowing researchers to study the progression of the disease. They found that G- medaka developed brain problems similar to humans with Gaucher, including brain cell invasion, nerve loss, and inflammation. A key finding was the accumulation of a protein called alpha-synuclein (α-s) in nerve cells. Alpha-s is also linked to Parkinson's disease, another brain disorder. Surprisingly, removing α-s did not improve G- medaka's lifespan, nerve damage, or inflammation. The study shows G- med as a new model for Gaucher disease and how α-s builds up due to lack of glucerebrosase. It also suggests α-s plays a minor role in Gaucher's brain damage. Gaucher patients have higher risk of Parkinson's and α-s builds up in their brains. This study helps understand Gaucher and Parkinson's and may lead to new treatments.
Listeria monocytogen is a type of bacteria that can live inside cells and trigger a strong immune response from the body's immune system. To cause long-lasting protection, the bacteria must escape from a cell's digestive compartment called the phagosome and enter the cell's inner space called the cytosol. Researchers found that the immune system's response to bacteria trapped in the phosome is not weak because it can't present the right signals, but because it's actually suppressed. This suppression not only affects the response to bacteria in the phosome, but also to those in the cytos. When both phosome and cytos bacteria are present, the body can't develop immunity and the number of immune cells that fight the cytos bacteria is reduced. Bacteria in the phosome stop the production of pro-inflammatory signals and create a protein called IL-10, which blocks the immune response. Blocking IL-10 or removing a key protein called MyD restored immunity. The study shows that bacteria in phosome can affect the immune system by blocking signals for inflammation and creating immune cells.
Researchers have identified six genetic variants in the SIX gene associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a leading cause of blindness worldwide. The variants were found in a study of 262 POAG cases and 256 controls, and included five rare and common changes. One variant, AsnHis (rs12345), was significantly associated with PO (OR=1.27, p=4.2×10-10) in the NEIGH/GLUGEN datasets. The variants were tested in a zebraf (zebrafish) model to evaluate eye and optic nerve structure. Five variants found in PO cases were hypomorphic or null, while one found in controls was benign. One variant increased SIX expression and disrupted its regulation. The study found a feature of PO patients dependent on SIX genotype: those homozygous for the risk allele (His) have a thinner retinal nerve layer than those homozyg for the non-risk (As) allele. This, combined with previous work, suggests SIX variants disrupt retina development, reducing ganglion cells and increasing glcoma risk.
Researchers have discovered a genetic switch that controls the production of flagella and toxins in the bacteria Clostridium difficile, a human intestinal pathogen that causes diarrhea. The flagella, or whip-like structures, help the bacteria attach to intestinal cells, while toxins cause disease. The genetic switch, called the "flagellar switch," is a 154-base pair sequence that can flip between two orientations. When in one orientation, the bacteria produce flagella and toxins, when in the other, they don't. The switch is reversible in the lab and requires a specific factor to degrade early flagella genes when in the "off" orientation. A tyrosine recombinase, RecV, is responsible for flipping the switch in both directions. 

The flag switch affects toxin production by impacting the gene σD, which makes glucyl toxins and cytotoxic C difficile. RecV also controls cell wall protein CV variation. Bacteria with the switch in the "on" orientation are motile, produce toxins, while those in the "off" orientation are not. Mutants with the switch locked in "on" or "off" show similar results. Toxin production is lower in bacteria with the switch in the "off" orientation.
Researchers studied the process of spore formation in the bacterium Clostridium difficile, a pathogen that causes infections in the intestines. This process, called sporulation, involves the creation of a highly resistant spore that helps the bacterium survive. In the model organism Bacillus subtilis, two types of RNA polymerase subunits, sigmaF and sigmaE, control spore development in the forespore and mother cell, respectively. These subunits are replaced by sigmaG and sigmaK at later stages. The researchers found that in Clostrid difficile, the main periods of activity of sigma factors are conserved, but activity of sigmaE is independent of sigmaF, sigmaG is dependent on sigmaE, and sigmaK does not require sigma. They also found that sigmaK is not necessary for spore formation. The study suggests that the level of spore network is conserved in evolution, with sigma factors acting as key regulators, established 2.5 billion years ago at the base of Firmic Phylum.
Researchers have developed a new framework to model the behavior of proteins that are activated by multiple sites, called alloster multisite proteins. These proteins are important in many biological processes, including cell growth and signaling. The model simplifies the complex behavior of these proteins by using a single variable, making it easier to understand and analyze. This is useful for studying systems where many proteins interact at once. The team applied the model to a new pathway in yeast that monitors cell growth and found it forms a "switch" that turns on when growth reaches a certain size. This pathway is made of three parts: a sensor that measures growth, a mechanism that reads the signal, and a response that triggers when the signal is strong enough. The model shows how these parts work together to control growth. The framework can also be used for other types of protein modifications, such as binding or methylation, and is a useful tool for understanding complex biological systems.
Scientists have long known that bacteria can communicate with each other through a process called quorum sensing, or QS, which helps them make decisions as a group. However, the inner workings of this process have been unclear. A team of researchers used a combination of experiments and math to study the QS system in E. coli, a type of bacteria. They broke down the system into smaller parts to understand how signals are sent and received. A new feedback mechanism was discovered and a key player, called Lsr, was found to be important. The team built a model to show how these parts work together, revealing how the "switch" in E. coli's QS system works. This approach can help understand other complex networks in bacteria and guide new uses for QS in technology.
In rural areas of Gabon, where both schistosomiasis and malaria are prevalent, a study investigated the effect of schistosias on Plasmod falcum infection in school-age children. The study found that schosias increased the risk of Plmod infection, especially when combined with Trichuris trichi or hookworm infection. Children infected with schos had a higher incidence of malaria over time, 0.51 per-year, compared to non-infected, with a significant delay in time to first malaria event in those aged 6-10 years. The study suggests that schos enhances susceptibility to malaria in young children, but not older children. This contradicts previous findings on schos-malaria co-infection, which may be due to unaccounted confounding factors. In areas where schos is endemic, its effect on malaria outcome is a concern. The study area is co-endemic for both infections, with up to 30% of children co-infected with Plmod and schos parasites. The results indicate that schos and STH co-infections cumulatively impact malaria in school children, and should be considered in malaria control programs.
Researchers have found that a protein called IRF-5 plays a key role in the body's inflammatory response to the parasite Leishmania infection. IR-5 triggers the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF, which are necessary for a strong immune response. However, the study shows that IR-5 also limits the expansion of CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that fights infection. IR-5 does this by inducing a protein called HIF-1 in dendritic cells, a type of immune cell that presents antigens to T cells. When H-1 is present, dendritic cells produce less IL-12, a cytokine that activates T cells, and more IL-10, which suppresses them. Without H-1, dendritic cells produce more IL-12 and less IL-10, allowing T cells to expand and fight infection more effectively. Mice without H-1 in dendritic cells had fewer parasites in their spleen, suggesting that H-1 helps Leish establish chronic infection. The study suggests that Leish uses H-1 as a way to evade the immune system.
American visceral leishmanias (VL) is a serious health problem in regions like the Indian subcontinent, North Africa, and South America. It's one of the world's most neglected diseases, linked to poverty, with limited and expensive treatments. In Brazil, the Ministry of Health recommends platelet transfusions for patients with less than 10,000 platelets/mm3. Leishmanias-HIV coinfection is a risk factor for poor VL outcomes, as studies show coinfected individuals have higher risk of poor prognosis.

A review of 14 studies in Latin America found predictors of adverse outcomes: jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age under 5 or over 50, neutropenia, dyspnea, bacterial infections, edema, and low hemoglobin. These were associated with unfavorable outcomes. The main limitation is the lack of validation for prognostic models. Combining results from 10 years identified consistent variables to recognize patients at risk. Developing externally validated models is a priority.

VL is a public health issue, especially in poor areas. Effective treatments are scarce. The Brazilian Ministry recommends platelet transfusions for low platelet counts. Leish-HIV coinfection is a risk factor for poor outcomes, as studies show coinf individuals have higher risk. A review of 14 studies in Latin America found predictors: jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrh, HIV, diarrhea, age under 5 or over 50, neutropenia, dysnea, infections, edema, and low hemoglobin associated with poor outcomes.
Researchers in Algeria studied the susceptibility of Leishmania parasites to antimonial drugs over a 30-year period. The country's treatment for visceral and cutaneous leishmanias has been based on antimonial drugs, but resistance is suspected due to high drug pressure. The study analyzed 106 isolates, including 88 from humans, dogs, rodents, and phleomines, and 18 from dogs in France, collected between 1976 and 2013. The isolates were tested for susceptibility to potassium antimony tarate and sodium stibogluconate. The results showed a trend of increasing susceptibility in visceral leishmanias isolates, but an increase in resistant isolates causing cutaneous leishiasis. The emergence of resistant isolates correlates with Leishmania kili, which causes cutaneous leishias and has emerged in Algeria. The study highlights the need for monitoring ant susceptibility to prevent resistant strains.
Researchers have found a link between acute gastroenteritis and the development of Crohn's disease (CD), a chronic inflammatory condition. They studied mice infected with Salmonella Typhimium or Citrobacterium, bacteria, which are known to cause gastroenteritis, and found that those colonized with Escherichia coli (AIE), a bacteria linked to CD, had a worse outcome after infection. The study showed that IE expanded in the gut tissue, increased inflammation, and delayed healing of the gut lining after infection. This was due to IE's resistance to host defenses and a strong inflammatory response to the pathogen. The results suggest that people colonized with IE at the time of gastroenteritis may be at higher risk for CD. The study also found IE as a potential target for developing interventions after gastroitis in at-risk individuals.
In flowering plants, the female gamet of Arabidopsis is made up of two cells: the egg cell and the central cell, surrounded by five accessory cells. These cells are all important for fertilization, but how they become what they are is not well understood. Researchers looked for genes that control the egg cell's fate and found a mutation called lesis (lis) that makes extra egg cells. In lis mutants, the accessory cells become egg cells, showing that lis is involved in a process that stops accessory cells from becoming egg. Lis is similar to a protein in yeast that helps with cell decisions. This suggests all cells in the gamet are capable of becoming egg, but lis stops it from happening in accessory cells. The central cell in lis gametes also becomes egg, showing another lis process stops it from becoming egg. The lis mutant shows two levels of control: between egg and accessory, and egg and central cells. A marker genes show Arabid cell types are decided after cell formation.
Researchers conducted a study in a rural Ethiopian highland community to understand why people don't wear shoes, which can help prevent Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). They used the PRECE-PRO model to assess social, behavioral, environmental, and educational factors that influence shoe-wearing. 242 people participated in focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and case studies. The study found that shoe-wearing is changing, going barefoot is seen as shameful, and shoes give dignity and protection against injury. However, practical and social barriers prevent people from wearing shoes. Limited resources mean people can't buy more than one pair, can't afford quality shoes, and shoes are saved for special occasions. Children often don't get shoes until a certain age. Some barriers, like fit and fear of labeling, are specific to certain diseases, but underlying barriers like poverty, price, unsuitability, and low perception are relevant to many NTDs. Using health behavior models, researchers identified barriers to shoe-wearing that can be intervened and will benefit NTD prevention through shoe distribution.

In a community with podoiosis, a NTD caused by soil exposure, researchers found behaviors and practices relevant to other NTDs. In Ethiopia, shoes are distributed to children to prevent podoiosis. Barriers mentioned were financial and suitability of shoes for common activities. Financial constraints influence possession, type, age, consistency, replacement, and activities. Theories suggest targeting beliefs and attitudes about shoe-wearing influence podoiosis risk and effectiveness. The study aimed to understand barriers to consistent shoe-wearing in a rural setting. Respondents aspired to wear, but reality was different. Many had shoes, but not worn regularly. Barriers included financial, access, perceptions, and disease risk. Podoiosis patients faced difficulty finding sizes and stigma.
Pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us protein plays a crucial role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of sympathetic neurons. Without Us, mutants are defective in anterograde transmission in vivo. Researchers wanted to understand how Us promotes axonal sorting of many viral proteins. They found that glyroteins B, C, D, and E are associated with lipid microdomains on infected cells and directed into ax in Us-dependent manner. They discovered Us is associated with lipid rafts and this association is critical for Us-mediated sorting viral proteins. They used non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a cell line that acquires sympathetic neuron characteristics in presence of nerve growth factor (NGF). In these cells, Us is highly in detergent-resistant membranes (DR). Reducing Us affinity for lipid ra inhibited antograde transmission from neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. They conclude association Us with ra is key for targeting proteins to axons and consequence for spread PR from pre-synaptic to postynaptic neurons in mammalian nervous system.
Biologists have long known that genetically identical cells can exhibit different behaviors under the same conditions, a phenomenon called nongenic heterogeneity. This has important implications in medicine, as cancer and microbial cells show nenic heterogeneity in growth and response to drugs. Researchers studied the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which shows nenic heterogeneity in growth rate and heat stress. They found that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels through the Ras/c protein kinase (PKA) pathway and transcription factors M2 and M4 underlies this nenic heterogeneity. Lower cAMP levels correspond to slower growth, and a reporter of this pathway's activity correlates with growth in individual cells. The paralogues M2 and M4 have different roles in nenic heterogeneity, with M2 required for growth and M4 for expression of T1, a subunit of trehalase that contributes to heat tolerance. Perturbing nenic heterogeneity by mutating genes in this pathway or culturing cells with cell-perme cAMP or PK inhibitor significantly impacts survival of heat.
Researchers studied the genetic diversity of the Chikungunya virus (CHV) during its rapid spread from Asia to the Americas in 2013. They analyzed viral samples from infected individuals in Guadeloupe and Martinique, two islands in the center of the outbreak, using deep-sequencing and bioinformatics. They found changes in the virus sequence and a range of minority variants present at different levels in the population. The diversity was reduced after single passages in cell lines. A new 3' untranslated region (UTR) structure was identified, not found in nature, which increased replication in insect cells. This study highlights the need for continued viral surveillance as the epidemic evolves to understand CHV's potential.
Researchers have identified a new gene called UOR that plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and tumor formation through a key signaling pathway called mTOR. This pathway is involved in many human diseases, including cancer. The study found that reducing UOR in brain cells and nerve cells promotes growth, while overexpressing it suppresses tumor formation in cancer cells. Experiments in zebraf fish and mice showed that UOR inhibits m signaling by stabilizing a component of the mTOR complex, leading to reduced tumor formation. Disrupting the UOR gene increased m activity and worsened cancer in zraf. In mice, UOR depletion also promoted tumor growth and m signaling. The study suggests UOR regulates growth and tumor through m signaling.
Scientists have created a detailed map of the proteins in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African trypanosomiasis, a disease that affects humans and cattle. This parasite is difficult to study because most of its proteins are not similar to those in well-studied organisms like yeast and mammals. To understand its biology and how it causes disease, researchers looked at how proteins interact with each other. They used a method called biochemical fractionation to study over 3,500 proteins in the parasite's procyclic stage. This led to the identification of 128 protein complexes, including 635 with unknown functions. These complexes match known pathways and proteins found across the parasite's life cycle, providing clues for many uncharacterized proteins. The researchers also found a protein involved in RNA editing, a process that regulates the parasite's genes. This study provides a new view of the parasite's protein map and a resource for further research.
Lymph nodes are a common sites of prolonged bacterial persistence for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in macaques. While tuberculosis is typically considered a lung disease, extrapulmonary infection can occur in any organ. Lymph nodes (LN) are among the most common sites of extrapul Mtb infection, and thoracic LNs are frequently infected in humans. However, the dynamics and effect of Mtb infection on LN structure and function is relatively unstudied. Researchers surveyed thoracic LNs from M-infected cynolg andhes macques using PET scans, bacterial burden, LN structure, and immune function. They found that lymph nodes have different trajectories (increasing, decreasing in activity over time) even in the same animal. Rhes macques are more susceptible to M infection than cynolg macques due to extensive LN pathology. Mtb grows to same level in cynolg andhes mac LNs, but cynolg macques control M at later points post-infection whilehes do not. Notably, compared to lung granulomas, LNs are poor at killing M, even with treatment. Granulomas in L lack B-rich structures, disrupt LN, push out T and B cells, introduce macrophages that serve as niches for M, and destroy vasculature.
Researchers have identified 47 new species of microsporidia, a type of fungus that infects animals, and studied their interactions with the nematode Caenorhabis elegans and other related nematodes. They found that Noc paris is the most common microspor infecting C elegans in the wild and described six new species in the Nemat genus. Phylogenetic analysis identified two subclades distinct from Nematida, named Entersect and Ptospora, which belong to the main clade of microidia that includes human pathogens. All microidia are horizontally transmitted and infect intestinal cells except Ptos, which replicates in the epidermis of C elegans. At the cellular level, Entersect spores show apical distribution and exit via budding, unlike Nematida which exit via exocytosis. Host specificity varies among microidia, some infecting Osche but not its sister Osche, and vice versa. Nauseli fails to induce C eleg transcription of genes induced by Nematida, suggesting evolved mechanisms to prevent host response.
Chemokine receptors, a type of protein receptor, play a crucial role in the human immune system and are involved in cancer and HIV infection. Research has shown that these receptors can form pairs or groups of three or more and this affects their function. Cholesterol also affects how these receptors work. However, little is known about how these receptors pair up and interact with cholesterol. This study used computer simulations to look at how chemine receptors CXCR, CCR, and CCR pair up and interact with cholesterol. The results show that closely related receptors CCR and CCR pair similarly, but differently from CXCR. Cholesterol affects how these pairs in a specific way. Chemine receptors also pair up in different ways, such as CXCR and CCR, and CXCR CCR. Notably, CX and C pair more with cholesterol than CXCR and C. This study provides a detailed look at how chemine receptors interact and how pairing with cholesterol changes their function.
Researchers have identified a new form of systemic leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the Leishmania parasite, which presents with symptoms that are not typical of the classical form of the disease. In addition to fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting, this new form, called "atypical", presents with one or two of these symptoms missing and other symptoms such as lymphadenopathy and anemia. A study of 160 patients with depressed immunity found that 19.4% had normal laboratory profiles but had macrophages laden with Leish parasites. This suggests that systemic lemanias presents a wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than previously thought and is more common than previously diagnosed. The disease is not limited to the pediatric age group, as 31 of the patients were adults. The researchers recommend considering atypical systemic leishiasis in patients with unexplained immunity and no obvious immunologic defect.
Researchers have analyzed millions of genetic mutations and variations in the human genome to understand how they relate to diseases, reactions to medications, and age-related conditions. They found that predicting the impact of a genetic variation on the body is challenging. A new approach is to look at variations in similar proteins, called paralogs, which have the same function but different sequences. This study used a database of known disease-causing variations to identify pairs of variations at the same positions in paralog proteins. The results show that variations in paralog proteins are connected and if one is disease-causing, the other is likely to be too. This information can help identify potential disease-causing variations, improve existing methods, and provide candidates for diagnosis and treatment.

A dataset was created to identify pairs of variations at the same positions in human genes. Variations co-occur at amino pairs more than expected, suggesting similar constraints on paralog sequences result in coordinated distributions of disease and non-disease variants. Data show paralog genes and variantairs can be used for hypothesis generation and clinical research. Extending to paral genes not associated with disease can identify new candidates and uncharacterized variants with phenotyp consequences.

A collection of disease-causing variations was assembled from databases and mapped to genes and sequences. This suggests algorithms based on sequence conservation miss instances. Paralog human might provide additional information for in silico characterization, complementary to approaches like SIFT and PolyPhen. Rare disease variants in paralog tend to pair. Alignments provide a resource for genomics.
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falcum in people with severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papua New Guinea. They used a technique called RNA sequencing to analyze the parasite's genes in 44 cases of severe and uncomplicated malaria. The results showed that parasites causing severe malaria had changes in their gene expression, including a decrease in glycolysis, altered chromatin structure, and reduced expression of surface antigens called Pf1. These antigens are targets of protective immunity. The parasites also had down-regulated multiple chaperone proteins. The study found associations between disease severity and Pf1 transcripts, domains, and smaller segments, and confirmed previous associations between expressed Pf1 sequences and disease. The findings can help identify targets for a malaria vaccine and how parasites adapt to the host environment in severe malaria. 

The study differed from previous reports of increased expression of genes involved in Pf1 surface in severe malaria. However, 17 of these genes were down-regulated, including skeleton protein 1, involved in Pf1 expression. Severe patients had lower levels of antibodies to Pf1 and recognized fewer Pf1 than uncomplicated patients. Parasites were older in uncomplicated patients, who had more immunity to Pf1. Severe patients had down-regulated genes in Pf1 expression. Antigens are encountered early and recognized by sera from immune children than uncomplicated. Expression of conserved Pf1 by severe parasites explains rapid immunity to severe than uncomplicated.
Scientists have been exploring a new approach to prevent HIV infection by delivering antibodies that can neutralize the virus directly into the body. In a recent study, researchers used a virus-like particle called AAV to deliver antibodies into rhes macaques, a type of monkey. The goal was to see if these antibodies could protect against a difficult-to-neutralize strain of the virus, SIV239. The results were promising: six out of the seven monkeys that received the antibodies showed protection against the virus, even though the antibodies didn't neutralize the virus on their own. They had lower levels of the virus in their blood, delayed the time it took for the virus to peak, and some even resisted multiple challenges with the virus. One monkey even resisted six challenges, including a high dose of the virus. This approach is promising for preventing HIV in people, but the body's response to the delivered antibodies is a problem that needs to be solved.
Researchers studied the way proteins myosin and kinesin K1 respond to changes in their shape when they bind to or release molecules. They used a simplified model to analyze the proteins' movements and found that the traditional assumption of a linear response to these changes doesn't hold true. This is especially true for kines K1, where the traditional model completely fails to describe how the protein moves. Even though the protein's movements are not random, they can't be explained by a single mode or a combination of modes. The study suggests that the current understanding of protein dynamics may need to be revised.

Researchers have found that caveolins, proteins play a crucial role in regulating clathrin-independent endocytosis, a process by which cells take in substances from outside the cell membrane. They discovered that specific caveins, Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, but not Cavin-2 or Cavin-4, inhibit the clath-independent/GPIAP enriched endosomal (CL/GC) endytic pathway. This pathway is independent of cave formation. Caveolin-1 and Cavin-3 also inhibit the CL/GC pathway when overexpressed. Expression of caveolar leads to a reduction in formation of early CL/GC carriers, detected by electron microscopy. The CL/GC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking Cavin-1/Cavin or with reduced Cavin-1 and Cavin. Inhibition by caveins can be mimicked by isolated caveolin scaffolding and associated with perturbed lipid diffusion components, revealed by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies. In absence of caveins and caveol, CAV is endocyted preferentially through CLC pathway but loses polarization and sorting with consequences for membrane and endytic dynamics in migrating cells and muscle tissue.
Researchers have identified a new type of signaling system in bacteria and plants called Aspart-L Receiver (AL) domains, which are different from the typical two-component systems that sense and respond to environmental stimuli. These systems usually have a histidine kinase that phosphorylates a conserved aspartate (Asp) residue on a Receiver (REC) domain. However, some REC domains lack this residue, and it was unclear how many exist, their roles, and how they function without the conserved aspart. The study found that AL domains are common and often attached to rare effector proteins. Analysis of AL structures and data showed that AL have reorganized their active sites to take a constitutive role or accommodate signals other than phosphorylation, while retaining post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimer interface. This defines AL as an atypical REC subclass and provides insights into shared mechanisms between AL and REC domains.
Researchers have developed a new type of oncolytic herpes virus (OV) that targets cancer cells with a specific protein called HER2, which is found in many types of cancer. This virus is different from others because it is fully virulent, meaning it can cause an immune response in the body. They tested this new virus in mice with cancer and found it was safe and effective. The virus, called R115, was more effective than another version, R113, in stopping the growth of tumors. All mice that survived the primary tumor were protected from new tumors growing in other parts of the body. Some mice were even protected from new tumors for a long time after the virus was gone. The virus changed the environment around the tumor, making it harder for cancer to grow. It also made immune cells that fight cancer, like T cells, increase in the tumor. This showed the virus can be used as a vaccine to help body fight cancer.
A recent study investigated the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors to HIV infection. The research focused on two vectors: Adenovirus 5 (Ad) and ALVAC, used in clinical trials RV144 and HVT204, respectively. The study found that Ad-specific CD T cells were highly susceptible to HIV, while ALAC-specific T cells were less susceptible. This difference was linked to lower expression of HIV entry receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 on ALAC cells. Phenotypic analysis showed ALAC cells had a strong Th1 profile, producing IFN-γ and CCL4, but little IL-17. In contrast, Ad and ALAC induced distinct CD8 and CD4 responses in PBMC, with ALAC favoring CD8 proliferation and Ad CD4. Depletion of ALAC CD8 cells increased HIV infection of ALAC CD4 cells, suggesting a protective role for ALAC CD8 cells. The study highlights the importance of evaluating vector responses in HIV vaccination, as different vectors induce distinct susceptibility in CD4 cells.
Scientists have studied how female mammals choose which X chromosome to silence in a process called X-inactivation, where one X chromosome is turned off in each somatic cell. The choice of which X to silence varies among species, ranging from strict paternal X-inheritance (PX), where females are haploid for maternal alleles, to random X-inactivation (RX), where both maternal and paternal alleles are equally expressed. The reasons for this diversity are unclear. Researchers analyzed how dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection influence X-in evolution. They found that a single interaction between allelic dominance and sex-differential can select a wide range of X-in strategies, including unequal inactivation between maternal and paternal X. RX is favored over PX if alleles are recessive to female fitness, and criteria for RX is more restrictive when variation is sexually antagonistic. Evolution from PX to RX increases female fitness at the expense of male. This provides a framework for predicting X-linked gene expression and leads to predictions for future studies on allele variation.

Species properties and genetic variation predict selection for X-in strategies. Sexual and sex-based mutation rates vary, influencing transmission of deleterious alleles between maternal and paternal X. X-in is female-limited, so selection favors inactivation of the chromosome with more deleterious alleles. An analysis showed evolutionary stability of X-in strategies. Sex-differential selection, where fitness differs between males and females, affects large genomes, influencing X-in diversification. Stronger selection against males decreases paternal X deleterious alleles. Sex-differential might favor biased X-in (unequal expression of maternal and paternal X) and predict biases to evolve. Results suggest conditions for biased-in are permissive.
Researchers have identified a protein called ZAP that can block the infection of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a type of flavivirus. ZAP is a host protein that restricts many viruses by degrading their RNA, inhibiting translation, and triggering immune responses. However, only one flavivirus, yellow fever virus, was previously known to be resistant to ZAP. The study tested ZAP's antiv potential against three flaviviruses: JEV, dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIK). JEV infection was blocked by ZAP overexpression, but not DENV or ZIK. Depletion of endogenous Z enhanced JEV replication. Z hampered J translation and targeted viral RNA for 3-5' exosome degradation. Zinc-finger motifs of Z were essential for RNA targeting and anti-J activity. JEV 3'-UT, especially region with dumbbell structures and high CG content, was mapped to bind Z and confer sensitivity to Z. The study found JEV as the first Z-sensitive flavivirus. Z may act as intrinsic antiv factor through RNA binding against J infection.
Rift Valley fever virus (RVV) is a highly pathogenic virus that causes severe disease in humans and animals, particularly in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Researchers studied the response of mice to wild-type and vaccine strains of RVV to understand its pathogenesis. Mice infected with a live-attenuated vaccine strain survived with minimal disease and cytokine response, while the wild-type strain caused severe disease, lymphocyte and platelet depletion, and strong cytokine response. The virus targeted the liver, causing necrosis and hepatitis, but no significant inflammatory response was seen. Instead, a chemokine response was observed, indicating neutrophil infiltration. In the brain, a chemok and cytokine response was seen, but little pathology. The study suggests RVV pathogenesis in mice is liver failure due to necrosis, but long-term disease is neurologic, supported by human and mouse model observations.
Chemotherapy resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a significant challenge for improving patient survival. Researchers investigated the mechanisms of taxane chemoresistance in TNBC and found that C motif chemokine ligand 20 (C20) is elevated during tax-containing chemotherapy in patients with non-pathologic response. C20 promotes self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCS) through protein kinase Cζ (PKζ) or mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-mediated activation of nuclear factor B (NF-κ) pathway, increasing taxane resistance of BC. C20 also increased ATP-binding subfamily member 1 (ABCB1)/multidrug 1 (DR) expression, leading to extracellular efflux of taxane. A feedback loop between NF-κ and C20 provides impetus for chemoresistance in cancer cells. C20 can be a predictive marker for taxane response, and blocking C or its pathway might reverse tax resistance in breast cancer. Tax-induced C20 promotes self-renew of BC through activation of NFκ, mediated by PKζ and MAP activity. Studies offer a strategy to reverse tax resistance in breast cancer by combining tax treatment with adjuvant pharmacological inhibition of AB1. C20 promotes chemores in BC through positive loop mediated PK/38-NF. Tax-induced C20 activates NF through PKζ or38 and promotes expression of AB, leading to chemores of breast cells. Increase of C20 by tax depends on NF activity, suggesting activated NF regulates C level in feedback to enhance effect on chemores.
Toxoplas gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, infects virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals. Its ability to infect and manipulate host cells depends on transporting "GRA" proteins from secretory organelles called dense granules into host cells, where they reside. GRA proteins have diverse roles in Toxopla's lifecycle, including hijacking host functions like cell cycle and p38 MAP kinase. Some GRA proteins, like GRA16 and GRA24, are secreted into parasitoph vacuole (PV) where Toop replicates and transported across PV membrane (PVM) into host, but translocation process and machinery not understood. Researchers previously showed TMY1, cleaved by TASP into fragments, localizes PVM and essential for GRA transport into host. To identify additional proteins for effector transport, Toopla mutants defective in cyc-regulation screened for ability export GRA and GRA to host nucleus. Researchers report novel MY2 and MY3 play crucial role in translocation subset GRAs into host. MY2 and MY3 secreted PV, co-localize with PVM and MY1. Consistent predicted transmembrane domains, all proteins membrane-associated, MY3 but MY stably with MY1, N-terminal C-terminal disulf-linked. Results reveal novel complex PVM essential effector translocation into host.
Scientists have studied how a virus called papillomavirus (PV) replicates, or makes copies of itself, inside cells. They found that a protein called E2 binds to a factor called origin recognition complex (ORC) to start the replication process. ORC is a group of proteins that helps initiate DNA duplication. PV has three stages of replication: initial amplification, cell cycle maintenance, and differentiation. The study showed that E2 binds to OR2, but OR2 is not found at the viral origin. Depleting OR2 increased PV replication in some cells, but not in others. This suggests OR2 is not necessary for E2 to start replication, but instead suppresses it. The study also found that over-expressing E2 reduced OR2 at host cell origins, suggesting E restricts pre-OR assembly that competes with viral replication. This implies OR2 restricts viral replication in the maintenance phase and elevated E levels during differentiation subvert OR loading and DNA synthesis at cellular origins.
Researchers investigated the presence of Brucella bacteria in the milk of cows in urban and peri-urban areas of Dush, Tajikistan. They found Bruc DNA in 10.3% of 564 milk samples, which is concerning since unpasteurified dairy products are commonly consumed in the region. Bruc was detected in the milk of all seropositive cows, but also 8.3% of seronegative cows had Bruc DNA. Sequence analysis suggested one cow was infected with B. abortus and another likely infected with B. melensis. The study highlights the need for complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false negatives in Bruc surveillance and control programs. Vaccination of cattle with S19 and small ruminants Rev1 may be necessary to control Bruc infections, but further research is needed to understand Brella circulating in the region.
Researchers studied the role of histone H3 lysine 27 methylation in maintaining chromosome stability in the fungus Zoseptoria trici. This fungus has eight accessory chromosomes that are unstable during meiosis and mitosis, and are transcriptionally repressed, with high enrichment of repetitive elements and heterochromatin marks, such as trimethylation of H3 lysine 9 or lys 27 (HK9me3, HK27me). To understand the impact of heterochatin on genome stability, the researchers deleted genes encoding the methyltransferases responsible for HK9me and HK27, mt1 and mt6, respectively, and generated a double mutant. They used experimental and genomic analyses to determine the impact of these deletions on chromosome and genome stability in vitro and in planta. Whole genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq were used to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure and differences in gene expression between mutant and wild-type strains. Results showed dramatic chromatin reorganization in HK9-deficient strains, with HK27me mostly localized in regions with HK9 in wild-type. Many rearrangements and formation of new chromosomes were found in absence HK9, accompanied by activation of transposable elements. In contrast, loss HK27 increased stability of accessory chromosomes under normal conditions in vitro, without large changes in gene activity. HK9 is important for maintaining genome stability by disallowing HK27 in constitutive heterochatin. HK27 reduces overall stability of accessory, creating a "metastable" state for quasi-essential genome regions.
Evaluating Cost-Effective Strategies for Rabies Post-Exposure Vaccination in Low-Income Countries

Rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is crucial in preventing the onset of the fatal disease in individuals exposed to rabies. However, life-saving vaccines and biologicals are often inaccessible and unaffordable, particularly to the poorest sectors of society who bear the largest burden of rabies. Increasing accessibility, reducing costs, and preventing delays in delivery of P should be prioritized. Researchers analyzed P vaccination regimens and their relative costs and benefits to victims and healthcare providers, finding P to be an extremely cost-effective intervention ($200 less than $60/death averted). Switching from intramuscular (IM) to intradermal (ID) regimens resulted in significant savings in vaccine volume required to treat the same patients, mitigating shortages and reducing costs. Financing mechanisms to make P more accessible could subsidize costs for those in need and support existing rabies control programs. A universal switch to ID delivery would improve affordability and accessibility of P, reducing human rabies deaths and being economical for providers.
Toxoplas, an obligate intracellular parasite, replicates within mammalian cells in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that does not fuse with host organelles. One mechanism for nutrient acquisition is attracting host organelles to the PV. Researchers examined lipid droplets (LD), fat storage organelles, exploited by Toxopla. Toxla replication is reduced in cells depleted of LD or impaired lipolysis or fatty acidolysis. In infected cells, host LD number and LD-associated gene expression (AP, DG2) increase until parasite replication onset. PV are surrounded by host LD. Toxla accesses lipids in LD and incorporates them into its membranes and LD. Exogenous oleic acid stimulates LDogenesis in host, resulting in neutral lipid accumulation in large LD inside parasite. Tox intercepts and internalizes LD, some associated with Rab7, wrapped in intravacolar network (IV) membranes. Mutants impaired IV display diminished lipid uptake from LD. Parasites lacking IV-localized phospholipase2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from LD in PV, suggesting IV's major role in LD processing and lipid release. Gavage parasites unveil presence of endytic structures containing lipid material from PV lumen. This study highlights Toxla's reliance on LD for intracellular development and scavenging lipids from LD.
Researchers have been searching for new ways to control a disease called fasciolosis, which affects cattle and sheep, caused by liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica. Currently, the main treatment is chemotherapy with a drug called tricendazole, but resistance to this drug has been reported in several countries, making it urgent to find new options. A library of flavonoids, a type of plant compound, were tested for their ability to inhibit key enzymes of the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica. Chalcones, a type of flavon, were found to be good inhibitors of these enzymes, especially those with phenyl and napht groups. One compound, C34, was found to bind to the enzyme FCL with an IC50 of 5.6 μM, making it a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with the enzyme's active site. This compound was also found to reduce the ability of the fluke to penetrate the gut and cause death within a week in vitro, while not being non-toxic to bovine cells. This is the first report of non-peptide inhibitors of Fasciola catheps in vitro and opens new avenues for developing novel agents to control fluke infection and other helminthic diseases.
Researchers have discovered how the visual system processes fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways. They used a technique called in vivo imaging to study how bipolar cells send signals to the retina. They found that the size of the terminal, a part of the cell, affects how it transmits signals. Cells with smaller terminals transmit faster and respond to higher frequencies, while larger ones respond to lower frequencies. This is because smaller terminals release more vesicles with higher gain, followed by more adaptation. Larger terminals transmit lower frequencies more effectively. The size of the presynaptic compartment, a part of the cell, contributes to these differences in response. This shows how neurons can transmit different temporal components of the signal through terminals with varying properties.
Researchers have developed a new method to detect and analyze individual synapses in the brain using fluorescence microscopy images. Synapses are the tiny connections between brain cells that allow them to communicate with each other. Current methods to study synapses have limitations: fluorescence microscopy is fast and cheap but hard to distinguish between real and fake signals, while electron microscopy is accurate but slow and expensive. The new method uses a combination of fluorescence and electron microscopy to create detailed images of individual synapses. It uses a computer algorithm to identify synapses in the images and produces a map of the probability of each point being a synapse. The researchers tested the method on images and found it worked as well as human annotators and accurately reproduced known features of synapse distributions. This opens the door to discovering new types of synapses and their density. The method can also be applied to other types of microscopy images where electron microscopy is not practical.
Zinc is a vital element for many cellular functions, including DNA synthesis, gene expression, cell division, and immune system, and wound healing. Impairment of zinc homeostasis leads to various pathologies. Mammalian zinc transport occurs via two families, ZnT and ZIP. However, the mechanism of Zn2, responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and secretion during lactation, is unknown. Researchers modeled Zn2's action computationally and experimentally and found it to be a proton-coupled zinc antiporter. Bafomycin A, a vacuolar ATPase inhibitor, abolished Zn2-dependent transport into vesicles. Lyso Red and Ly-pfluorin showed ves pH alkalization upon Zn2 overexpression and zinc addition. TP, a zinc chelator, reversed this effect. Computational calculations propose Zn2 as an antiporter with 2H+/Zn+ stoichiometry. Zn2 is a motive-driven, electrutral ves zinc exchanger, concentrating zinc in vesicles at the expense of proton extrusion to cytoplasm.
Researchers have found that a group of proteins called 14-3 proteins play a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the genome by helping to fix errors that occur during DNA replication. They do this by interacting with a protein called Exonuclease 1 (Exo), which is responsible for processing stalled replication forks. In cells without 14-3 proteins, Exo becomes overactive and creates gaps in the DNA, leading to persistent activation of the cell's error-checking mechanism and defects. The researchers also found that 14-3 proteins promote the progression of replication forks under low nucleotide conditions. They propose that 14-3 proteins control the activity of Exo and other targets, ensuring fork stability and restart in response to DNA stress. This study sheds light on processes at stalled forks and suggests 14-3 as central regulators of stability and processing. Further research is needed to identify other proteins involved and how 14-3 modulate Exo activity.
Researchers studied the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV) infection and pathogenesis using a humanized mouse model. They found that pDC are critical in producing type I interferons (IF-I), which suppress HIV-1 replication. However, p also contribute to HIV-induced immunopathogenesis by promoting death of human leukocytes, including CD4 T cells. A monoclonal antibody was developed to deplete p in lymphoid organs of humanized mice. When p were depleted before HIV-1 infection, IF-I and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were abolished, and HIV-1 replication increased. In chronic infection, p depletion reduced IF-I and IS, but increased HIV replication. Surprisingly, p depletion reduced death of human cells in lymphoid organs, but not blood, despite increased replication. p play opposing roles in suppressing HIV replication and promoting immunogenesis. Findings suggest p-depletion and IF blockade as novel strategies for treating HIV non-responsive patients with immune activation despite antiretroviral treatment.
Researchers have discovered that sulforaphane (SF), a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, can block the infection of HIV in macrophages, a type of immune cell, but not in other cells. This is the first time this has been shown. SF works by activating a protein called nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), which is also used by other viruses like Marburg, Kapos's sarcoma herpes and Dengue. When Nrf is activated, it changes gene expression in the cell, making it harder for HIV to infect. Experiments showed that blocking Nrf with siRNA increased HIV infection in macroages, and reduced the effect of SF treatment. This suggests that SF's anti-viral activity is through Nrf. SF blocks HIV infection after reverse transcription, but before 2-L circle formation, similar to other proteins induced by type I interferon. However, these proteins were not upregulated. This is the first time Nrf has been shown to block HIV infection, and a new way to trigger this inhibition has been found.
A study in rural western Kenya found that 76.2% of pregnant women had at least one geohelth infection, with 52.3% having Ascaris lumicoid, 39.5 hookworm, and 29% Trichuris trichi. Infections were associated with using an unprotected water source (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3) and not treating drinking water (OR 1.8, 95 CI 1.1-3). Geelth infections were not linked to symptoms or low body mass. Hookworm infection was linked to lower upper arm circumference (mean -0.7 cm, 95 CI 0.3-1). Women with hookworm egg count 100/gram had lower hemoglobin (mean -1.5 g/dl, 95 CI 0.3-2). Pregnant women 2 and 3 with Ascaris lumic were less likely to have malaria (OR 0.4, 95 CI 0.2-0.8) compared to those without.
Mycolone, a compound produced by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans, has been found to have anti-inflammatory effects on the nervous system. Research has shown that mycolone blocks the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells, leading to its analgesic and immunomodulatory properties. This study investigated myone's effects on the inflammatory responses of nervous cells involved in pain perception and transmission, as well as neuroinflammation associated with chronic pain. Sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia were isolated from mice to assess myone cytotoxicity and immunomod activity. Results showed that prolonged exposure to myone induced cell death at concentrations >10ng/ml, but nanolar concentrations suppressed production of pro-inflammatory mediators without affecting viability. Notably, myone prevented pro-inflammatory polarization of microglia, which contribute to neuroinflammation. In a rat model of neuropathic pain, myone injected in the spinal canal decreased local production of inflammatory cytokines without cytotoxicity. This study provides evidence that myone suppresses inflammatory responses of neurons, Schw cells, and microia without affecting viability, supporting previous studies suggesting myone analgesia is partially due to anti-inflammatory properties.
Researchers studied how genetic variations in human genes affect the outcome of African trypanosomiasis, a deadly disease caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambense, in West Africa. They collected blood samples from 425 people in Guinea, including 232 with the disease, 79 with long-term carriers, and 114 without the disease. They looked at 28 genetic variations in 8 genes and found that one, IL6 rs1819, was linked to a lower risk of progressing from latent to active disease. Another, MIF36071, was linked to higher risk, but not after adjusting for multiple tests, it was not significant. MIF12459 was linked to latent infection. They confirmed earlier findings that AP1G2 was linked to higher risk and AP1 to lower risk. No links were found with other genes. The study shows genes play a role in controlling the parasite and may lead to new control tools.
Researchers have conducted a study on the genetic diversity of South Asians by whole-genome sequencing 38 individuals from Singapore, descendants of immigrants from Dravid-language-speaking states in south India. The results show that these individuals have greater genetic diversity and higher heterozygous-to-homozygous ratio compared to other Asian populations. When compared to a panel of well-defined Indians, the genetic makeup of these samples is closely related to South Indians, but distinct from Europeans. However, some samples were assigned to mitochondrial haplogroups predominantly present in Europeans and had higher European admixture. Analysis of relatedness to archaic humans Denisovan and Neanderthal found higher ancient admixture in East populations than these samples. The study provides a valuable resource for understanding South Asians in the 1,000 Genomes Project. 

The Singapore Sequencing Indian Project sequenced genomes of 36 South Asians at 30X coverage, complementing 96 Southeast Malays and 1,092 samples from 1,000 Genomes. Principal component analysis revealed greater heterogeneity in Indians from northern India, while southern were more homogeneous. An independent analysis with Gujarati Indians found a third clustered with Singapore Indians. The majority of Singaporeans are descendants of south Indians who settled after Singapore became a trading center in the 19th century. The project aims to sequence 38 healthy Indians for insights into genetic diversity.
Researchers studied the molecular basis of antibiotic resistance in Burkholderia pseudalle isolates from Thailand. They found that most isolates are resistant to aminoglycos and macrolides due to the AmABpr efflux pump. However, three isolates 708, 218, and 9 were susceptible to aminogcos and macides. RT-PCR showed that isolate 708 had no Amr transcripts, while 218 and 9 had reduced levels. When exposed to gentamicin, 218 and 9 became resistant to other amincos and macides, but 708 did not. Transcript analysis showed that resistance in 218 and 9 was due to upregulation of Ampr expression. PCR revealed that the Ampr operon was missing in 708, associated with a 70kb deletion. Rescue of the Ampr region from a fosmid and sequencing showed a 131kb deletion in 708 compared to K43 and 10. This deletion removed not only Ampr but also genes for malleactin and cobal synthesis, and anaerobic arginine deiminase. Whole genome sequencing confirmed absence of these genes in 708. Despite missing virulence genes, 708 was virulent in a murine model.
Researchers studied how CD4 T helper cells, a type of immune cell, differentiate into two distinct types: Th1 and Th2. They found that these cells can express both Th1 and Th2 markers at the same time, not just one or the other. This is different from previous studies where cells were forced to choose one type. The team looked at individual cells and found that some express Th1 cytokine, but not Th marker, and vice versa. This variation is more common in early stage of differentiation than when cells are fully formed. When they blocked signals from outside the cell, Th1 and Th markers became exclusive, showing that signals from outside control what happens inside. This suggests that cells can have mixed Th1/2 state early on, influenced by signals from outside. The study shows how signals from outside and inside interact to decide cell fate, a common strategy for cells to handle variable signals.
Researchers have identified a protein called PAQR-2 in the nematode worm C. elegans that plays a crucial role in adapting to cold temperatures. PA-2 is similar to a protein in mammals that helps regulate insulin and fat metabolism. To understand how PA-2 works, the researchers looked for mutations that suppress its function and found genes involved in phospholipid synthesis and fatty acid metabolism. They discovered that PA-2, phospholip, and a type of enzyme called Δ9 desaturase form a pathway that increases unsaturated fatty acids to keep membranes fluid at low temperatures. This pathway is important for C. elegans to survive at 15°C, a temperature that's usually too cold for it. The researchers also found that PA- suppressors normalize saturated fatty acid levels and detergents that increase membrane fluidity can rescue PA-2 mutants. This suggests that PA-2 is a transmembrane protein that regulates fatty acid metabolism during cold adaptation.
Researchers have used electron microscopy to study the structure of the Herpes Simplex-1 virus, a common human pathogen that causes cold sores and other diseases. They found a previously unknown feature at the top of the virus, a "tail-like" structure that connects the virus to the cell membrane. This structure is similar to that found in a different type of virus that infects bacteria, suggesting it may play a role in releasing the virus's genetic material into the cell. The study suggests this structure is important for the virus's shape and how it enters the cell.
Researchers studied how the parasite Schistosoma mansoni egg antigen (SEA) affects HIV-1 infection in the body. They found that SEA can block HIV-1 from entering cells by binding to a protein on the surface of immune cells called DCIGN. They also found that when immune cells are exposed to SEA, they become less susceptible to HIV-1 infection, but not to a different type of HIV called HIV-4. This is because SEA reduces the production of a protein called IFN-γ, which helps fight off infection. Additionally, SEA reduces the expression of a protein called CCR5 on the surface of immune cells, which HIV uses to enter. A similar effect was seen with a protein called recombinant omega-1 (r-1), which is similar to SEA. This suggests that SEA and r-1 can modulate HIV-1 infection and potentially influence the course of the disease in people co-infected with the parasite.
Researchers have found that when neurons are stimulated, the space between neurons and surrounding cells called astrocytes in the brain shrinks by about 30%. This phenomenon is important for understanding how potassium and astrocyte function, but was not fully explained. A new model was created to explain the shrinkage in normal and gene-deficient individuals. The model shows that release of potassium and sodium from neurons, uptake of potassium and sodium by astrotes, action of the Na/K pump, and osmotically driven water transport through the astrote membrane are enough to cause shrinkage. However, taking into account the concentrations of ions and astrotes with stimulation, the actions of the NK and NBC transporters are key to achieving the observed levels of shrink. The model is detailed and constrained to guide future experiments and pave the way for comprehensive astro-glia-neuron models in normal and pathological situations.
Scientists have long known that certain types of DNA, called transposons and repetitive elements, can be detrimental to an organism's health if expressed. In plants like Arabidopsis, these elements are silenced by a process called RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing. This process involves a protein called Argonaute (AGO) and a type of RNA that guides it to chromatin, where enzymes establish repressive modifications. But how these enzymes are recruited to chromatin was unknown. Researchers found that a protein called SPTLTF1 binds to chromatin at locations where transcription is silenced. This binding happens after an enzyme called RNA polymerase V, but not because of a specific type of RNA called siRNA. They also found that AGO and SPTL1 are recruited to chrom together, but independently of each other. Experiments showed that both AGO and SPT1 are needed for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications at certain locations. The study suggests that AGO and SPT create a platform for chrom modifying enzymes to be recruited.
Researchers have studied how the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease, spreads from ticks to mammals. They found that the Rpo regulon, a set of genes, is crucial for the bacteria to move through the tick's digestive system. Without Rpo, the bacteria get stuck in the midgut and transform into unusual round bodies. These round bodies are reversible and seem to be caused by low levels of an enzyme that helps the bacteria make energy. The study shows the bacteria have a backup plan to form round bodies when they can't get enough energy to spread to the mammal. This is a new role for Rpo in the tick phase of the disease cycle. The researchers also found that Rpo is needed for nymphs to transmit the disease, but not larvae. The findings suggest that the bacteria adapt to survive in the tick by forming round bodies when it's hard to spread to the mamm.
Scientists have long known that two plant hormones, gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA), play a crucial roles in flower development, particularly in the male part of the flower called the stamen. However, the relationship between GA and JA in stamen development was not well understood. Researchers found that three genes, MY21, MY24, and MY57, are controlled by GA and are important for stamen growth. Without these genes, the stamen is short and the plant is sterile. They discovered that GA promotes JA production, which in turn controls the expression of MY21, MY24, and MY57. This is a key step in normal stamen development. The team also found that GA triggers the degradation of proteins that suppress JA production, allowing JA to be made. Without JA, the stamen does not grow properly and the plant is sterile. The study shows that GA and JA work together to control stamen development, with GA being a necessary for JA production. This is a new understanding of how GA and JA interact in plant development.
Researchers have found that a protein called hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) plays a key role in extending lifespan in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans. H-1 is a transcription factor that helps regulate oxygen levels, cell growth, and metabolism, and response to stress. The study shows that H-1 deficiency leads to longer lifespan, similar to the effect of inhibiting the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway. TOR is a protein that regulates growth and metabolism in response to nutrients. H-1 is one of the targets of TOR in mammalian cells, but its role in lifespan was unclear. The study found that H-1 modulates lifespan in a nutrient-dependent manner, extending lifespan under rich conditions but not under dietary restriction. A mutation in egl-9, which increases H- activity, diminishes lifespan under dietary restriction. This effect is rescued by expressing egl- in specific neurons and muscles. Increased lifespan by H- is dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inos-requiring-1 (I-1) and associated with lower ER stress. The study suggests a tissue-specific role for H- in lifespan involving the I-ER stress pathway.
Researchers have discovered that human skin cells called keratinocytes can change their behavior in response to different situations, such as when they differentiate or migrate. They found that these cells have unique groups of enhancers, which are like switches that turn on specific genes, for each state. These enhancers are also linked to genetic variations that cause skin diseases. A protein called GR3, which promotes differentiation and migration, binds to different enhancers when keratinocytes differentiate, but to promoters when they migrate, it suppresses genes that inhibit migration. GR3 is located within enhancers and binds to regulate them, and also suppresses formation of non-keratinocyte enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes. This study shows how a single protein can control different gene programs in the same cell type by changing where it binds on chromatin. GR3 regulates divergent expression in differentiating and migrating keratinocytes by switching chromatin binding in distinct enhancer landscapes. The research highlights the relationship between protein GR3 and chromatin, including enhancers, which applies to cell specification and reversible state. GR3 is essential for normal keratin migration in eyelid closure and wound healing, modulating programs that promote movement and suppress progenitor differentiation.
Researchers studied the relationship between endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and exogenous retroviruses in sheep. ERVs are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that are passed down from generation to generation. Some ERVs may help the host fight off pathogenic retroviruses by interfering with their replication. However, it's been hard to find evidence of this happening. Sheep are a good model to study retroirus coevolution because they have both exogenous (horizontally transmitted) and endogenous retroviruses. The team isolated and studied 27 endogenous retroviruses (enRVs) in sheep, which have been in the host for 5-7 million years. Two enRVs, JS56 and JS-20, got into the genome 3 million years ago and gained a defective gag protein that blocks exogenous retrovir replication. These dominant proviruses became fixed in the genome before sheep domestication 9,000 years ago. A new enRV emerged recently, likely in the last 200 years, that escapes dominant enRV. This study shows sequential events of evolutionary antagonism between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses. It suggests hosts use ERVs as restriction factors to fight retroiral infections.
Researchers have developed a new method to diagnose schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma worms, using real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction). This method is more sensitive than traditional microscopic examination of stool or urine samples. The study tested 412 samples from patients suspected of having schosomiasis, including urine, stool, biopsy, and serum samples. Compared to traditional methods, PCR increased sensitivity from 4.5% to 10.5% and 33.7 to 48.8% in urine and stool samples respectively. In serum samples, PCR sensitivity was 72.7% and 94.1% in patients with positive microscopy. Specificity was 98.9%. After treatment, PCR positivity declined from 93.8% at 30 days to 8.3% at 360, while antibodies remained positive for a year. The new method outperforms traditional microscopy in stool and urine and can be used with serology, the gold standard for diagnosis. When serology is positive and microscopy is negative, PCR provides information for further exploration.
Researchers have used machine learning to estimate the energy of different shapes of a complex molecule called Archaz A, which is a powerful inhibitor of a type of enzyme found in a certain bacteria. This approach can speed up simulations of the molecule's behavior, which is important for understanding how it works and how it interacts with other molecules. The team used a method called Gaussian process regression, a type of machine learning, to predict the energy of different shapes of the molecule based on previous calculations. They tested the accuracy of the predictions by comparing them to more detailed calculations at a higher level of theory. The results showed that the predictions were very accurate, with an average error of less than 1 kilocalorie per mole. This demonstrates that machine learning can be used for complex and important molecules, potentially speeding up simulations of larger structures. The team used a simple way to represent the molecule's shape, focusing on charges and distances between atoms, which worked well for finding relationships between shape and energy. This is similar to how experimentally determined properties are estimated in chemistry. Machine learning has been used in other areas of quantum mechanics, such as predicting atom energies and transition states, and has been around since the 1990s. This study is a step towards using machine learning with molecular dynamics to simulate long-term behavior of complex systems.
Researchers have developed a new method to detect Ebola virus in wild apes in Africa, where the disease is a major public health concern. They tested fecal samples from gorillas and found that 10% of them had Ebola antibodies, showing they had been exposed to the virus. This is important because it means Ebola is not always deadly for gorillas. The team also found antibodies in gorillas that were thought to be protected from the virus by natural barriers. This new method can help protect apes by detecting early exposure, identifying at-risk populations for vaccination, and tracking vaccine effectiveness. Since humans get Ebola from contact with infected ape carcasses, controlling ape outbreaks can impact human health in local communities where the virus kills up to 88% of people. The study is the first to detect Ebola antibodies in ape feces and has implications for ape management and survival. It's relevant because strategies to protect apes from Ebola are being explored, as vaccines have shown to work in lab monkeys. The team developed a non-invasive assay to detect Ebola in ape feces, allowing insight into ape infections and surveillance. This may aid in epidemiological studies in wild ape populations. The method is sensitive and specific to detect multiple Ebola species with few false results. It's the first to screen large ape populations for Ebola exposure and estimate prevalence.
Researchers have discovered a new type of bacterial protein, called Xop, from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicator, that can manipulate plant cells and evade the immune system. This protein, known as a type III effector, is delivered into plant cells by a nanomachine and has E ubiquitin ligase activity. Ubiquitin is a protein that marks other proteins for destruction. Xop's E ubiquitin ligase activity is associated with its C-terminal region, which interacts with plant enzymes and creates K-linked ubiquitin chains. The structure of Xop's C-terminal revealed a novel fold, called XL-box, not seen in any other E ubiquitin ligases. Mutations in the XL-box disrupt its activity and prevent plant cell death. Xop's N-terminal has a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which may recognize protein targets for ubiquination. While E ligase is needed for cell death, suppression of immune responses depends on N-terminal RR. This unique fold highlights bacterial pathogen's ability to mimic eukote activity.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to HIV in the early stages of infection and how antiretroviral treatment (ART) affects it. They focused on a specific type of immune cell called follicular helper T cells (cTfh) that helps B cells produce antibodies to fight the virus. The study used a group of people with HIV at different stages of infection: early (stage 1 and 2) and late (stage 3). They found that cfh function was impaired in stage 3 compared to stage 1 and 2. This meant that cfh cells couldn't help B cells produce antibodies as well, and there was more inflammation and less B cells. The study also found that higher viral load in stage 3 was linked to lower cfh-mediated antibody production. This suggests that high virus levels of HIV can damage cfh function and the body's ability to fight it. The researchers also saw changes in the B cell compartment, with fewer memory B cells in stage 3 compared to stage 1 2. This was linked to higher viral load. The study suggests that starting ART early in HIV infection can prevent immune problems and preserve cfh function and B memory.
Researchers have developed a miniaturized screening method to identify new treatments for the parasitic disease schistosomiasis, which affects over 200 million people worldwide. Current treatment relies on a single drug, praziquel, but it has limitations. The team pharmacologically profiled a schistosome serergic protein-coupled receptor (Sm.5TR), a potential target for new anthelmics. They used a high-throughput screening approach with a luciferase biosensor to measure cellular cAMP levels in intact cells. The study found a divergent pharmacological signature between the paras serergic receptor and its human homolog (H.5TR), supporting the development of parasite-selective ligands. New compounds with potency and selectivity for Sm.5TR over H.7 were identified and validated in vitro and in vivo against schistosules and adult worms. Sm.5 also displayed irreversible inactivation, a phenomenon also seen in H.7, making it a promising target for anthelmic design. The study highlights the feasibility of profiling flatworm GPCRs in high-throughput format and the potential of Sm.5 as a chemotherapeutic node for next-generation anthelmics.
During embryonic development, the formation of the three primary germ layers - ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm - is crucial for the organization of the metazoan body. In some organisms, such as flies, fish, and amphibians, the ectoderm layer not only separates the germ layers but also serves as a substrate for meserm migration. Researchers have found that the separation of these layers is not solely due to differences in adhesion between cells, but rather to contact-induced detachment signals at the boundary between ecterm and meserm. This process involves Ephrin/Eph signaling, where multiple Eph ligands and receptors are expressed on each side of the boundary and tissue separation depends on forward signaling in both directions, involving redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and Rho. This mechanism differs from a simple adhesion-based layer formation and involves localized responses to signals at the boundary and an attachment/detachment cycle allowing cell migration across a substrate.
Researchers analyzed blood samples from 83 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers to identify biochemical markers of the disorder. They used multivariate analysis to classify participants as ASD or neurotypical, achieving 96.1% accuracy for neurotyp and 97.6% for ASD. Additionally, they used partial least squares to predict adaptive behavior, measured by Vineland Adaptive Composite score, with 5 metabolites from folate one-carbon and transulf pathways, achieving R2 of 0.45 after cross-validation. This level of accuracy exceeds previous approaches in the field, indicating strong correlation between metabolites and ASD diagnosis. The study used advanced statistical tools to examine metabolites of folate one-carbon and transulf pathways in neurotyp and ASD children, as well as their siblings. Children aged 3-10 were assessed for oxidative stress, with ASD defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Disorders, Autism Observation Schedule, and Childhood Rating Scales. Folate metabolites from 83,47,76, and 47 ASD, sibling, and age-matched neurotyp children were used for classification. The multivariate analysis provided unprecedented classification separating ASD and neurotyp cohorts based solely on biochemical data.
Researchers used a statistical method called Bayesian geostatistical modeling to study the spread of Leishmanis in Brazil. Leishias is a disease that affects 350 million people in 98 countries and causes 2 million cases annually. Brazil is one of the most affected countries. The study looked at data from 2001 to 2010 and found that precipitation and socioeconomic factors were important for both cutaneous and visceral leishias. The models predicted 30,189 cases of cutaneous leias and 4,889 of visceral leias in 2010. Maps showed the highest numbers of infected in Minas Gerais and Para states. The study identified areas where leias control efforts should be targeted to reduce the disease. 

The researchers used data from the Ministry of Health in Brazil and a method called INLA to fit the models. They looked at climate, environmental, and socioeconomic factors that affect leias. This is the first study to use this method for leias in Brazil. Previous studies mapped leias at state level but didn't use statistical models that account for space and time. The study found that precipitation and socioeconomic factors were important for both types of leias.
A large study in Vietnam looked at the differences in symptoms and complications of deng between adults and children. The researchers compared 647 adults and 881 children who were hospitalized with deng at the same hospital. They found that children had more severe signs of bleeding and shock, while adults had more bleeding and organ problems. Adults also had lower platelet counts, which is a type of blood cell that helps with clotting. This was true even after they recovered from the illness. The study suggests that adults and children have different patterns of complications from deng due to their age. This is important for understanding how the disease works and creating treatment guidelines for different age groups.
Researchers studied the infection of sooty mangabeys, a type of monkey, with a virus called SIVm, which is similar to HIV in humans. They found that despite the virus replicating well in the monkeys, it doesn't cause disease. They discovered a new mutation in the CCR5 gene, a protein that helps the virus enter cells, which is present in 26% of the monkeys. This mutation makes a non-functional protein that doesn't appear on the cell surface and can't support virus entry. 8% of monkeys are homozygous for this mutation and 41% are heterozygous. The mutation is also found in wild monkeys in Africa. CD4 and CD8 T cells show a gradient of C5 expression across groups, more in CD8 cells. Surprisingly, the prevalence of SIVm infection is not different in monkeys lacking C5 compared to heterozygous and wild-type. Monkeys lacking C5 have robust viral loads, only modestly lower than wild-type. SIVm isolates infect both homozyg mutant and wild PBMC in C5-independent manner in vitro and Envs from C5-null and wild animals use CX6, G15 and G1 in addition to C5 transfected cells.
Researchers have been trying to understand how a protein called MEF2 contributes to the development of tumors, but its role has been unclear. A new study found that M2 can both promote and suppress tumor growth depending on the partners it interacts with. When M2 works with certain proteins, it helps turn on or off genes by changing histone marks like H3K methylation and H3 acetylation. In a type of tumor called leiomyosarcoma (LMS), M2 has two faces: it can be good or bad. In 22% of MS, class II HDs are overexpressed, and high levels of M2, HD4, and HD9 are linked to poor survival. Knocking out HD9 in MS cells makes them less cancerous by restoring M2's ability to turn on genes. HD9 also removes H3me3 from M2's target genes. Surprisingly, class II HDs don't bind M's regulatory elements, so M2 can turn on and off genes at the same time. Repressed M2 genes are ready to be turned on in chromatin. The study suggests class II HDs and HD9 are potential targets for treatment in MS.
Researchers have studied the structure and formation of hydrophins, proteins produced by the fungus Trichoderma rei, using a combination of protein docking, molecular simulation, and cryo-electron microscopy. The study focused on two types of hydrophins, HFBI and HFBII, and found that they form a unit cell composed of six proteins with a hexagonal symmetry. However, experimental results showed a unit cell with three proteins and a smaller size of 56 angstroms. Computational simulations suggested an alternative structure with three proteins and a smaller size, which was tested using a Monte Carlo model. The model showed that this structure could increase the rate of hydroph film formation, indicating a possible mechanism for both biological and technological applications. Hydrophins are important for fungi to interact with their environment and have various uses in industry. The study used cryo-EM, protein docking, and dynamics to get a detailed view of the hydrophin film at the air-water interface. The structures of HF and HII were studied at high resolution. The experimentally, the unit cell size matches a hexagonal arrangement of proteins, but would be seen as a uniform sheet by AFM. The unique properties of hydroph films come from interactions between proteins in the surface network. Hydrophins have been used in industry and biology, and similar models have been used to study self-assembly. The study aimed to understand the role of P3 symmetry in film formation and designed a Monte Carlo algorithm to mimic protein motions. The first high-resolution structure of hydroin was HII, found to be cross-linked with disulfide bridges and 2nm diameter, with an amphipathic structure.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for treating leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania donani. They studied the enzyme aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, LThr, which is essential for protein synthesis in the parasite. Recombinant LThr was expressed and purified, and its kinetic parameters were determined. Immunofluorescence analysis showed LThr is localized in the cytosol and mitochondria. Heterozygous mutants of LThr in Leish promastigotes showed restricted growth and reduced infectivity, and were more susceptible to the inhibitor borid. Several attempts to create Thr homozyg null mutants failed, indicating its essentiality for the parasite. Borid showed strong affinity for LThr and inhibited its activity. The study suggests LThr is a potential target for drug discovery.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is recognized as non-self by the protein RIG-I through the presence of a 5- triphosphate (5-pp) on viral RNA associated with a 3 poly-UUC tract. Researchers have defined the HCV pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and criteria for R-I non-discrimination of HCV by examining RNA-function attributes that impart PAMP to the poly-UC tract. They found that the 34 nucleotide polyuridine core of the sequence was essential for R-I activation and interspersed ribosine nucleotides between poly sequences in RNA were required for optimal R-I induction. 5-pp poly-UC variants stimulated R-I efficiently in vitro and interaction with the repressor and helicase domain of R-I was required for signaling. When appended to 5-pp RNA lacking P activity, the polyUC-core sequence conferred non-recognition of RNA and innate signaling by-I. Importantly, H polyUC variants strongly activated-I triggered anti-H responses in vitro and hepatic immune responses in vivo using a mouse model of P signaling. These studies define a multi-mot P signature of non-recognition by-I that incorporates 5-pp with polyuridine composition and length. The H P motif drives-I to induce the immune response to infection.
Researchers have found that eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, play a crucial role in supporting the growth of a parasitic worm called Trichella spiralis in the host's skeletal muscle. Eosinils produce a protein called IL-4, which helps the worm grow by enhancing glucose uptake in the host cells. This process occurs without the involvement of the immune system's adaptive response. In fact, the presence of eosils suppresses inflammation and maintains nutrient balance in the infected tissue. The study suggests that the worm has evolved a strategy to co-opt the host's innate response to facilitate its growth. Further research is needed to confirm this mechanism.
Researchers studied how DNA replication occurs in human cells, specifically in a type called HeLa cells. They found that DNA replication origins, where replication starts, are spaced about 40,000 base pairs apart and fire in clusters. As the cell replicates, more origins in a cluster fire at the same time, increasing the number of replication forks. The speed of replication remains constant, about 0.7 to 2 kilobases per minute, throughout the process. Analysis of the entire genome shows that replication timing is not uniform, with some regions taking less than 2 minutes and others more than 10 minutes to replicate. This suggests that forks do not move in a single direction, but rather in both forward and backward directions. In fact, most of the genome is replicated by activation of multiple origins, not a single fork. The study also found that the speed of replication depends on the number of forks moving forward and backward, not just the speed of a single fork. The results provide new insights into how mammalian genomes replicate and a model for their replication.
Researchers investigated how the brain's ability to recognize objects despite changes in context, such as lighting or perspective, is achieved. They proposed that this is done by exploiting the fact that object identities change slowly over time, while context changes quickly. The study explored how this "temporal stability" or "slown" approach can be implemented in biologically realistic learning rules. A slow analysis algorithm, based on slown, was implemented in a continuous model using a modified Hebbian rule, linking it to the trace rule, another slown learning implementation. For linear neurons, slown was shown to be implemented by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific window. Analyzing STDP, it was found that the window alone is not relevant, but its convolution with the postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is. This led to STDP windows that implement slown and the trace rule, compatible with physiological data in shape and timescale. The analysis showed the window can be split into reversible and irreversible components, sensitive to input statistics. Irreversible statistics generate oscillatory weight dynamics. The study offers a new interpretation of ST's role in neurons.
Researchers have discovered a new way that cancer cells in non-small lung cancer (NSCL) tumors work together to become resistant to chemotherapy. This is called cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT). Normally, when cancer cells are exposed to treatment, they become resistant due to genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. However, this study found that cells can induce resistant phenotypes in neighboring cells, even if they don't have the same genetic or phenotyp features. This is called cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT). The researchers used a CRISPR/Cas toolkit to create diverse NSCL cells with mutations in Dicer, a gene involved in non-coding RNA. They grew cells in a 3D culture system and monitored their growth under drug pressure. Mathematical modeling and flow cytometry showed that co-cultures of wild-type and mutant cells allowed sensitive cells to grow despite drug pressure. This was due to a game-theoretic change in fitness. The study also used an ex vivo model to predict clinical response to drugs and found that cellular heterogeneity correlates with failure of multiple drugs in NSCL patients. This suggests that targeting druggable mutations alone may not be enough for effective therapy.
A study in the Mbeya region of southwestern Tanzania found that 67.9% of the population above the age of 5 had IgG antibodies against Spotted Group (SFG) rickettsiae, a type of bacteria that causes spotted fever. The study involved 1,228 participants from nine communities, stratified by age, altitude, and ownership of domestic mammals. Higher temperatures and lower elevations were associated with higher seroprevalence. Male gender and lower population density were also associated with higher seropval. Cattle density was associated with higher seropval at higher elevations. The study suggests that SFG ricketial infection is common in the rural population of Mb Region and spread is limited by temperature and elevation. Further research is needed to determine the contribution of SFG to febrile illnesses and estimate the disease burden in the population.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a type of fatty acid called oleate in the immune system of a tiny worm called Caenorhabditis elegans. This fatty acid is important for the worm's ability to fight off infections. The scientists found that the worm needs oleate to turn on its immune genes to defend against bacteria. Without oleate, the worm is more likely to get infected by different types of bacteria. However, adding oleate back to the worm helps it fight off the infection. But oleate alone is not enough to activate the immune system. This study adds to what is known about the benefits of a certain types of fatty acids and suggests a link between how the body uses fatty acids and its ability to fight off infections.
Scientists have discovered a new way to create antibiotics that target a specific type of molecule in bacteria, called guanine riboswitch, which is involved in making the building blocks of DNA and RNA. These molecules, called riboswitch ligands, can be designed to bind to guanine ribwitch and prevent it from working, stopping the bacteria from growing. Researchers found a pyrimidine compound, called PC1, that binds to guanine ribwitch and kills certain types of bacteria, including some that are resistant to antibiotics. This compound only works when a specific gene, guA, is controlled by gu ribwitch, showing it targets a different pathway. In a mouse study, PC reduced Staphylococcus aureus infection in mammary glands, showing its potential as a new antibiotic. Guanine ribwitches are part of the purine class, which also includes adenine and 2-deoxyguanine, and regulate transcription at high guanine levels in Bacillus subtilis. The guanine aptamer is a three-way junction of helices with a critical nucleotide in Watson-Crick pair with the ligand. Break group used purine derivatives to target guwitch and found molecules that inhibited growth, but only one repressed expression of guwitch-controlled gene, suggesting different mechanisms.
Researchers studied how macaque monkeys navigate a virtual reality maze to find a reward. They looked at how their behavior, visual exploration, and brain activity in the hippocampus. The hippocampus is a part of the brain that helps with memory and navigation. The researchers found that some cells in the hippocampus responded to one or more things like direction, point of gaze, or task. These cells fired when the monkey saw a landmark and in a specific way that depended on the task. They also encoded the monkey's situation within a set of actions to reach the goal. Overall, hippocampus activity was best described by a fine-grained space of current position, view, and context. The study shows that primate place cells embody multidimensional, task-situated knowledge to the target of gaze, supporting self-awareness in space construction. This type of coding is common in mammals, similar to rodents. The study shows space in primates self-position with respect to target gaze and carries cognitive information to current trajectory to goal. The researchers probed the nature of hippocampus coding in a goal task, separating goal and landmarks, and how cells code position, direction, and gaze. They found that task context modulated activity of cells. Previous studies in primates, including humans, showed hippocampus encoded spatial views, place, or a mix of place and view. The study shows hippocampus display fine tuning to one landmark being viewed and self-position to landmark. The results give a comprehensive analysis of variables controlling hippocampus cells, bridging rodent and primate studies in real and virtual environments.
Researchers have studied the development of the midbrain and hindbrain in vertebrates, focusing on the midbrain boundary (MHB), where a specific pattern of gene expression is established and maintained by a network of regulatory interactions between transcription and secreted factors. They used a computational approach to analyze the spatial expression patterns at the murine MHB, revealing key interactions in the network. The study found that fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) maintains, rather than induces, wingless 1 (Wnt) expression, a previously unclear issue. Experiments on mouse neural plate explants showed F8 only maintains, but does not induce ectopic Wnt expression. The researchers constructed a regulatory network of key transcription and secret factors at the M and analyzed it using Boolean equations and reaction-diff models, confirming it explains the maintenance of M and expression patterns in wild-type and knock-out conditions. The study demonstrates that spatial expression patterns can provide information about regulatory networks, helping to understand the maintenance of M on a systems level.
A parasite called Theileria annulata infects host cells, causing them to multiply uncontrollably. After the parasite enters the cell, the host's cell membrane dissolves and microtubules (MTs) surround it, forming a structure called a schizont. Instead of invading other cells, the schizont stays attached to the host MTs and uses them to divide the cell during mitosis and cytokinesis. To do this, it interacts with the host's astral and central MTs. Scientists wanted to know how the schizont recruits and stabilizes host MTs. They focused on the plus ends of MT, which are dynamic and constantly growing or shrinking. They found that the schizont recruits a protein called EB1, which regulates host MT dynamics. EB1 binds to a parasite protein called p104, which is on the schizont's surface. This binding depends on a specific sequence in p104. The interaction is regulated by the cell cycle. This is the first time a pathogen protein has interacted with EB via a specific sequence. The study shows how Theileria interacts with the host's cytoskeleton.
In yeast cells, broken replication forks can lead to DNA breaks that are normally repaired through a process called homologous recombination or break-induced replication (BIR). When the enzyme replicase Cdc9 is deficient, cells accumulate DNA damage, likely due to broken forks, and activate a DNA damage checkpoint, leading to longer telomeres. Telomere length requires telomerase, the DNA signaling cascade Mec1-Rad-Rad53, and BIR pathway components Rad51, Rad52, 32, and P1. The phosphorylation of P1 by Mec-Rad53, necessary for inhibiting telomerase at double breaks, is also crucial for P1's role in BIR and telom elongation in c9 cells. Two other mutants, c44 and r3, similar to c9, have long telomeres dependent on P1 phosphorylation. We propose that B forks passing through telomeres promote telerase activity, leading to telom lengthening.
Researchers have developed a new tool to diagnose Onchocercias, a disease caused by the filarial nematode Onocerca volulus, which is a major public health concern due to its debilitating symptoms and resurgence in areas where control measures have been implemented. The tool, called luciferase immunoprecitation system (LIPS), is a rapid, specific, and standardized assay that can differentiate between infected and uninfected individuals with 100% sensitivity and 100 specificity. Four recombinantly produced Onoc volulus antigens (OvAR-1, API-1, A-MS-1, and CPI-1) were tested on a large cohort of sera from uninfected controls and patients with proven infection, including Onoculus, Wucher bancfti, Loa loa, Strongloides storal, and other cross-reactive infections. Antibody responses to the four antigens allowed unequivocal differentiation between infected and uninf with 100 sensitivity and specificity. Analysis of antibody titers to each antigen in infected sera revealed they were different and did not correlate with each other. Compared to infected, patients with W, L, S, and other conditions had lower mean antibody titers to each antigen. The method using a mixture of four antigens in standard or 15-minute format showed 100 sensitivity and specificity distinguishing infected from uninf. The 15-minute format had best performance with sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing from W, L, and S-infected. The multi-antigen IPS can be a rapid, high-throughput tool to diagnose individual infections and sensitive point-of-care for early detection in areas control and mapping.
Researchers conducted a 54-month study in rural Vietnam to evaluate the effectiveness of weekly iron-folic acid supplementation and deworming in reducing anemia, iron deficiency, and soil-transmitted infections in women of reproductive age. The study found that 76% of participants took the ironolic supplement and 95% received dewing treatment. Hemoglobin levels rose from 122g/L to 131/L and anemia prevalence fell from 38% to 18. Iron deficiency decreased from 23% to 8 and iron deficiency anemia from 4%. Hookworm infection dropped from 76 to 11 and moderate or heavy infestation to less than 1%. The study suggests that population-based interventions can efficiently reduce anemia and eliminate iron deficiency and moderate to heavy soil-transmitted infections below public health concern levels.
Researchers have discovered a new way that the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) evades the immune system. EBV is a type of herpesvirus that can cause life-threatening reactivations in people with weakened immune systems. To avoid being detected by the immune system, EBV produces a protein called gp150. This protein forms a shield on the surface of infected cells, making it harder for the immune system to recognize the virus. The shield is made of sugar molecules that cover the protein, making it invisible to the immune cells. This is a new way for EBV to escape the immune system, different from other herpesviruses. The protein gp150 does not break down the molecules that help the immune recognize the virus, nor does it need a part of the protein inside the cell to work. The study found that cells infected with a mutant EBV without gp150 had higher levels of surface molecules that help the immune recognize the virus. This suggests that immune cells other than T cells, like B cells, play a role in fighting EBV infection. The results also show that EBV gp150 helps the virus survive at a vulnerable stage of its life cycle.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Tarp plays a crucial role in the invasion of certain bacteria called chlamydia into host cells. Tarp is found in all pathogenic chlamial species and helps the bacteria to bind to actin, a protein that makes up the cell's skeleton. The team created an antibody that specifically targets the actin binding part of Tarp and found that it prevents the bacteria from entering host cells. They also found that different chlamial species have different numbers of actin binding sites on T, but all can still form actin filaments. This suggests that T mediated actin binding is a conserved among diverse chlamial species and plays a key role in bacterial invasion. The study shows that the actin activity of T is necessary for the bacteria to enter host cells.
Researchers have developed a new method to accurately count Schistosoma japon eggs in animal feces, a parasite that causes schistosiasis in humans. The method, called formalin-ethylate sediment-digestion (F-SD), removes most debris in feces, making it easier to see eggs under a microscope. This is important because debris often hides eggs, making it hard to determine how many animals are infected and how severe the infection is. The new method was tested on water buffaloes in China and carab water buffalo in the Philippines, showing it's effective and accurate. It's also cheaper than another method, real-time PCR, and can be used in areas with low infection rates or after control efforts to eliminate schosiasis. The FSD method is a tool to track animal reservoirs of S japon, particularly in areas with low to high infection.
Researchers have long known that mutations in the genes encoding cartilage protein (CRT) and proly 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) cause a rare genetic disorder called osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). These proteins, along with cyclophilin, form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a single proline on the α1(I) chain of collagen, which is essential for its proper folding. Recent studies suggest that this 3-hydroxylation is not crucial for collagen's structural stability, but its absence may disrupt protein interactions that help collagen fold properly, leading to overmodification. A new study created mice with a single amino acid substitution in PH's catalytic site, which abolished its 3-hydroxylase activity but not its ability to form a complex with CRT. These mice lacked 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 of α(I) and α(II) collagen chains but showed no overmodification at other residues. They were normal in appearance, had no growth defects, and normal cartilage plate histology but decreased trabecular bone mass. This model recapitulates some of OI's bone but not cartilage phenotypes caused by losing the 3-hydroxylation complex. The study suggests different tissue consequences from inactivating PH's 3-hydroxylase versus ablating the 3-hydroxylation complex.
Scientists have discovered that a genetic element called the P-element has invaded a species of fruit fly called Drosophila simulans, causing a condition called hybrid dysgenesis, which leads to abnormal phenotypes such as sterility. This is similar to what happened in a closely related species, Drosila melanogaster, where the P-element spread rapidly in just a few decades. Until now, D simul was P-element free. Researchers found that around 20% of D simul strains induce dysgenesis and used genomic and transcript data to show this is linked to the P-element invasion. They surveyed 631 simul strains on three continents over 27 years and found the P-element invaded rapidly and simultaneously in regions. Strains with P-elements were rare in 2006 but common by 2014. Strains from the latter phase of invasion have adapted to suppress the P-element's effects, showing resistance to dysgenesis.
Researchers have developed a new method to mark and track male Aedes aegypt mosquitoes using a fluorescent dye called rhodamine B. This dye is given to the mosquitoes through sugar, which they eat, and stains their bodies and seminal fluid. The study tested different concentrations of rhamine and found that 0.4% and 0.8% were the most effective and longest-lasting. Importantly, the marking did not affect the males' ability to mate with females. In field tests, marked males were released and recaptured, and their seminal fluid was found in the females they mated with. This shows that rhamine can be used to evaluate the success of male-based control methods to reduce mosquito populations. It's also a cheaper and faster alternative to other methods like genetic analysis and isotope labeling.
Bacterial superantigens, a family of toxins, induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock. Researchers found that superigens bind directly to the CD28 homodimer, a protein on T cells, to elicit cytokine expression and toxicity. Preventing superigen access to CD28 blocks lethality. Mice were protected from superigen challenge by peptides mimicking the CD28 interface and competing with superigen for binding. Superigens use a conserved β-strand/α-helix domain to engage CD28. Mutation of this domain abolished cytokine induction and lethality. Structural analysis showed superigen binds to T cell receptor and MHC on antigen-presenting cell, CD28 accommodates as third receptor in complex with CD interface towards β-str/and/α-helix. Findings identify CD28 interface as critical target for superigens, broadening pathogen recognition mechanisms.
Researchers have discovered that the Wnt/β-caten pathway plays a crucial role in regulating the cell cycle and proliferation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Unlike somatic cells, ESCs have a fast cell cycle with a short G1 phase due to the lack of cell cycle inhibitors, which maintains their pluripotency and prevents differentiation. The Wnt/β-caten pathway controls pluripotency through the W-effector T3, but its effect on the cell cycle of ESCs was unknown. The study found that W-eff T1 is recruited and triggers the transcription of the Ink/Ar tumor suppressor locus, restoring G1 phase and reducing proliferation of ESCs without affecting pluripotency. T1, not T3, is recruited to palindromic motifs in promoters of cycle repressors, such as p15k, p16, and p19, mediating W-dependent anti-proliferation in ESCs. Ablation of β-caten or T1 impairs W-dependent cell regulation. Activation of W results in downregulation of differentiation genes while plurotency remains unpert. Cell effects depend on βaten and T1, but not T3, indicating non-overlapping functions of T/L factors in ESCs. T1 is enriched at promoters of cycle genes like Ink/Ar locus. Data show GSK inhibition βaten transcriptionally regulates expression of Ink and Ar members in T3-independent manner. T1 KD ESC lines show decreased T1 levels, but not impaired plurotent markers. W pathway induces expression of negative cycle regulators, such as tumor suppressors p16, p19, and p15. Results show W/βaten triggers anti-proliferative effect in ESCs via T1 activity, contrasting its mitogenic effect in somatic cells.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection can cause a wide range of symptoms, from mild to severe and even fatal, and can lead to plasma leakage and hemorrhages due to a cytokine storm caused by monocytes and dendritic cells during DENV replication. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are innate immune cells that respond to virus exposure by secreting IF-α and expressing membrane TRAIL (mTR). Researchers aimed to characterize DC activation in deng patients and their function under DENV-2 in vitro. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that pDC of mildeng patients exhibit higher frequencies of mTR compared to severe or healthy controls. Plasma of IF-α and TR are increased in mild compared to severeeng patients, correlating with DC activation. Experiments showed that in vitro exposure to D-2 induced mTR expression on p. Microscopy highlighted TR was relocalized from intracellular to plasma membrane. Chloro treatment inhibited D- inducedTR localization and IFα by p. Endosomal degradation by chloro allowed viral antig detection inside p. Data suggest endocyt pathway activation by D in p. Coculture p/D- infected monocytes revealed dramatic antigen reduction by. This was also observed after exogenous IFα treatment, indicating DC effect on viral load dependent on IFα production.
Researchers studied how the role of tumor necrosis factor (TN) in fighting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. TN helps the body defend against TB in both active and latent phases of infection. However, TN-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory diseases have been linked to increased risk of TB in animal studies. This study used a computational approach to understand TN's role in TB. They extended previous models to investigate soluble (sTN) and transmembrane TN (tmTN). Analyzing anti-T therapy in clinical trials, they simulated two common treatments, anti-T antibody and TN receptor, to predict differences in TB reactivation rates. The study found that TN availability after anti-T therapy is the main cause of latent infection reactivation and that even low levels of TN are essential for control. Using a model, they distinguished anti-T treatment mechanisms and TN's role in TB control and pathology. The study suggests a TN-modulating agent could balance reduction of inflammation with resistance to infection. Alternatively, anti-T therapy timing and dose could be modified.
Researchers have found that genetic variations in the human genome, known as retroduplication variations (RD), can lead to differences between individuals. These variations occur when a copy of a gene is either present or absent in a person's genome. A study used data from the 100 Genomes Project to investigate how often these variations occur in different human populations. They also looked at how often these variations are expressed in the body's cells. The researchers developed a new way to detect variations not listed in the human genome and confirmed their presence in 17 populations. They found 193 variations, mostly from gene deletion. Most were not previously known. Some variations were expressed in certain individuals, but not others were not. The frequency of deletion was low, except for one. The remaining variations' low expression and deletion rate suggest they may have a function. The study also found differences in expression levels between populations, with 9 variations expressed differently.

A new approach was developed to detect undiscovered variations in the genome. Previous studies found 208 variations in populations, but many questions remained. This study found 193, more than previous studies individually, but less than all together. It focused on variations from deletion, not recent events. Many were missing in some genomes. The study used 4,927 variations and genomic data from 1,092 individuals. It found 214 variations affected 190. The variations can provide insight into human history and ongoing processes. RNA data from the Geuvis Consortium allowed studying changes and implications.
Inflammation caused by praziquel treatment depends on the location of Taenia solium cysts in porcine neurocysticosis. Researchers studied the effect of the location of cysts in the brain on inflammation after treatment in pigs. They used histological specimens from naturally infected pigs to investigate the characteristics of the inflammatory reaction around Taenia solium cysts according to their location in the brain tissue, meninges, or both, and the effect of anthelmintic treatment on these variables. 

The study found that cysts located in the parenchyma (brain tissue) provoked a higher level of inflammation after treatment compared to those in the meninges (tissue surrounding the brain and spinal cord) and those partially in contact with both. Inflammation in meningeal cysts was not affected by treatment, but increased in corticomeneal cysts correlated with the extent of cysts adjacent to the parenym. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier was associated with treatment in parenym tissue. Inflammatory response to cysts in meninges was decreased compared to parenym cysts. The study suggests that suboptimal inflammatory response to cystidal drugs may be the reason subarachn neurocysticosis is refractory to treatment compared to parenym.
Researchers conducted a study in Ghana to investigate the presence of yaws, a disease caused by Treponema pallidum s. pertue, in two districts where azithrom was previously distributed to control trachoma. They found no evidence of ongoing transmission of y in these areas, but detected Haemophilus duyi DNA in some lesions. The study suggests that H. duyi may be associated with some skin lesions, but most cases remain unexplained. The researchers recommend integrating diagnostic testing into pre- and post-treatment surveillance to inform y control programs. The study found no active or latent y in the Northern Region of Ghana, with all patients having negative treponal and non-treponal serology, indicating they had never been infected with y. The districts had completed several rounds of azithycin MDA for trach in the past decade. The study's findings have implications for the WHO's y eradication campaign, as Ghana is a major focus of y worldwide. A range of organisms can cause ulcerative skin lesions, including Mycobacterium ulcer, which is endemic in Ghana. Accurate data on y epidemiology is needed to guide eradication efforts.
Researchers have been trying to find ways to get rid of the HIV virus that stays in the body even after treatment. This virus hides in a type of immune cell called memory T cells. A pathway called Jak-STAT helps keep these cells alive and active. Two drugs, tofacitinib and ruxitin, block this pathway and were tested to see if they could get rid of the virus. They worked in lab tests and showed that blocking Jak-STAT reduced the number of cells with the virus. The drugs also stopped the virus from making more copies of itself and spreading to other cells. This could be a way to prevent the virus from coming back. The study also looked at people on treatment and found that blocking Jak-STAT was linked to the virus staying in the body.
Researchers studied the immune response of Spodoptera exigua larvae to two different types of baculoviruses, SeNP and AcNP. Contrary to the expected "host shut-off" of gene expression, the larvae showed a balanced mix of up- and down-regulated genes in the first 36 hours after infection. Many immune-related genes, including pattern recognition proteins and signaling pathways, were down-regulated after baculirus infection. This down-regulation was also seen in the larval gut, where immune-related genes affect the status of gut microorganisms responsible for growth and development. The researchers wondered if this down-regulation affected the amount of gut microbiota. They found an increase in bacterial load and hypothesized it as a consequence of viral infection. Experiments showed that gut bacteria enhanced baculirus virulence and pathogenicity. The study discusses host response pathways affected by baculiruses and the role of microbiota in infection.
Scientists have made a breakthrough in understanding of apomix, a type of asexual reproduction in plants, by creating a new genotype called Mi that replaces meiosis with mitosis. Meiosis is a process where cells divide to produce gametes with half the number of chromosomes, while mitosis is a process where cells divide to produce identical copies. In Mi plants, meiosis is replaced by mitosis, resulting in diploid gametes that are genetically identical to the mother plant. This is a significant step towards understanding and engineering apomix, which could be useful in agriculture.

The researchers isolated a gene that controls entry into second meiotic division and combined it with two other genes that affect meiotic processes to create the Mi genotype. They tested it in plants and found that meiosis was completely replaced by mitosis. The plants produced functional diploid gametes that were genetically identical to the mother. This is different from previous attempts where only 0.2% of gametes were viable, making it unusable for apix engineering. In contrast, Mi plants produced wild-type levels of viable gametes and pollen.

The Mi plants underwent mit-like division instead of normal meiotic division without affecting sexual processes. Gametes retained the mother's heterozygosity for genetic markers, confirming mitosis instead of meiosis. When meiosis is replaced by mitosis, ploidy is expected to double with each generation.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify genes that cause diseases by looking at how they interact with other proteins in the body. Current methods use a general map of protein interactions, but this doesn't account for how different tissues in the body work. The new method uses data on how genes are expressed in specific tissues to create a map of interactions for each tissue. This improves identifying disease-causing genes and predicts new associations between diseases and tissues. 

The researchers tested the method on 60 human tissues and found it worked better than the general map. They also found that most disease-causing genes are expressed in the tissue where the disease occurs. By adding tissue information, they were able to identify more disease-causing genes and new tissue associations. The method was tested on different ways to create tissue maps and found some worked better than others.
Researchers have developed a two-locus model to study the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes that transmit diseases such as malaria. The model accounts for differences in male and female mosquitoes' exposure to high or low concentrations of insecticide and varying selection pressures depending on the concentration. They tested the model by comparing sequential use of insecticides versus deploying them as a mixture to minimize resistance spread. Results showed mixtures outperformed sequential use in 56% of runs, while 44% favored sequential. Mixtures are favored when insecticides are highly effective and exposure is low. If insecticides don't kill homozygous mosquitoes, sequential use is more robust. Resistance spreads slower with mixtures, but may not always outperform sequential. For example, a mixture may last 5 years while individual insecticides last 3-4, giving 7 years total lifespan. The model can identify control strategies to minimize resistance spread, not advocate for mix or sequential as a policy. Results depend on insect attributes, application, behavior, and genetics. Mixtures are favored with effective insecticides, which may be the case with new ones under development.
Researchers have studied the saliva of Rhodnius neglectus, a type of kissing bug that transmits Chagas disease. They used next generation sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify the proteins in its saliva. They found 636 proteins that are likely secreted by the bug, 73 of which were confirmed by proteomic analysis. The saliva contains serine proteases, lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, antigen-5 metalloproteases, disins, and odor binding proteins. These proteins are similar to those found in other kissing bugs that transmit the disease. The study improves understanding of how these bugs interact with their hosts and how they transmit the disease. It also opens up new possibilities for finding new molecules in the saliva of blood-sucking insects that could be used to fight the disease. The researchers cataloged the proteins in the saliva of Rhnius neglect, highlighting the presence of serine proteases. Other proteins predicted to be secreted by the bug include metalloprotease, antigen-5, serpin, and trypsin-like protease.
Researchers used the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans to study how nematodes interact with bacteria in soil. They exposed C. elegans to different types of bacteria found in grassland soils and used a technique called transcription profiling to see which genes were turned on or off in response. Many genes related to metabolism and immunity were affected, suggesting they play a role in nemode community dynamics in natural systems. The researchers then disabled 21 of these genes and found most affected lifespan and fitness in specific bacterial environments. Even though these bacteria aren't a natural food source for C. elegans, changes in food source due to environmental disturbance had a big impact on gene expression and fitness. They used analysis to show that the degree of gene difference between environments predicted the effect of gene loss on life traits in those environments. C. elegans is not found in abundance in grass soils but is related to relevant nemodes, making it a good model for studying nemode-bacteria interactions.
Scientists have studied how the early stages of mammalian embryo development, specifically the formation of the inner cell mass surrounded by the trophoblast, a layer of cells that forms extra-embryonic structures. They used multi-scale modeling to investigate the principles behind this process. The study made three predictions, supported by quantitative imaging. First, gene expression noise promotes cell plasticity and plays a crucial role in organizing the mouse blastocyst. Second, asymmetry in levels of Cdx2 and Oct4 noise variation provides a means to benefit from noise plasticity while reducing detrimental effects of stochasticity. Third, the embryo controls timing and pace of cell specification to modulate plasticity, creating a window for cells to read environment and adjust fate. Results suggest noise is crucial in maintaining plasticity and organizing the blastocyst.
Researchers have discovered that germline-encoded antibodies, which are antibodies produced by the immune system before exposure to antigens, can bind to multiple antigens with high specificity. This is different from mature antibodies, which are produced after exposure to antigens, that typically bind to one specific antigens. The team used a computational tool called Rosetta to design antibodies that can bind to multiple antigens or a single antigen. They found that designing antibodies to bind multiple antigens resulted in sequences similar to those encoded by germl genes, while designing to bind a single antigen resulted in sequences similar to mature antibodies. This suggests that germl-encoded antibodies have flexibility that allows them to bind diverse antigens. The team also found that certain positions in the germl gene, such as CDR1, CDR, and immunoglobulin framework, contribute to polyspecificity. Designing antibodies that can bind multiple antigens may allow for rational design of antibodies that retain polyspecific for diverse epitope binding. The study demonstrates that Rosetta design captures aspects of antibody-antigen recognition and provides a step towards rational antibody design without prior knowledge of germl or mature sequences.
Locusts exhibit two main behavioral phases: solitary and gregarious. Solitary locusts are repelled by other locusts, while gregar insects are attracted to conspecifics and form large aggregations like hopper bands. Research has shown that crowding converts locusts to the gregar form. To understand hopper band formation, scientists studied phase change at the collective level. A mathematical model was created to predict the dynamics of hopper formation at the population level. The model reveals conditions for an outbreak, characterized by a large transition to the gregar phase. It also predicts the proportion of the population that will gregarize and the time for this to occur. Numerical simulations show aggregation's structure and traveling clumps of gregar insects. The model suggests possible future biological experiments.

The problem was addressed by creating a mathematical model to describe collective gregar, a key process before destructive locust outbreaks. It linked individual phase change and interactions to the gregar hopper band. The onset of an outbreak was studied by constructing a behavioral model for gregar and solitary locusts. Dynamics were classified in wide parameter space, a challenging by numerical techniques alone. For low densities, both phases are spread and solitary dominates. For large populations, a dense gregar patch emerges and solitary locs become scarce. Clustering at high densities is the hop band. The model calculates the critical density for gregar forms and the ratio gregar to solitary. Behavioral is plastic and dependent on density: gregar to solitary in sparse and vice versa in crowded. This is summarized in a figure. Analysis yields the most unstable spacing from the number of modes. Simulations show rapid transitions once gregar is initiated. Dense gregar packs form and sweep solitary in vicinity.
Scientists have been trying to understand how viruses fuse with host cells, a process called membrane fusion, for a long time. Viruses have proteins on their surface, called fusion proteins, that change shape to trigger fusion. However, it's hard to capture the middle stages of this process because they are short-lived. Researchers studied tick-borne encephalitis virus, a type of flavivirus, to see how it fuses with cells. They found that by changing the pH, or acidity, of the environment, they could trap the virus in a middle stage where the fusion proteins break apart and attach to the cell membrane, but don't merge. When they changed the pH back to normal, the virus fused with the cell. This shows that there are two steps in the fusion process: first, the proteins break apart and attach, then merge. This helps us understand how viruses work and how they infect cells.
Scientists are concerned that we are experiencing an extinction event on a scale similar to the mass extinctions seen in the fossil record, with present-day extinction rates estimated to be several orders of magnitude higher than background rates and projected to increase if current trends continue. While research has focused on vertebrates, such as body size, fecundity, and geographic range, as predictors of vulnerability, knowledge of plant extinctions and vulnerabilities is lagging. This study focuses on the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot, comparing Red List data for British and South African floras to demonstrate that taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs between regions, inconsistent with a trait-based model of extinction. A phylogenetic tree for the Cape reveals phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant risks, but most threatened species cluster at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to trends in mammals. Analyzing 11 exemplar clades, mode of speciation explains the phylogen structure of extinction risks in plants of the Cape. Results show that extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages, not explained by correlations with simple traits, and most vulnerable species are marching towards extinction at a rapid pace, independently from anthropogenic effects. This has implications for conservation and casts doubt on the utility of Red List criteria for regions with rapid speciation, aiming to preserve the tree-of-life.
Researchers have identified two new proteins, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (TK) and Vav, that contribute to the immune system's ability to engulf and destroy the fungal pathogen Candida albicans. This process, called phagocytosis, is crucial to prevent infection. The proteins interact with the major phagytic receptor Dectin-1, which plays a key role in anti-fungal immunity. TK and Vav are recruited to phagytic cups containing C. alb yeast or hyphae, but are absent from mature phagosomes. They localize to regions surrounding the hye, while Dect-1 lines the length of the phosome. TK and V colocalize with lipid (3,4,5)P3 and F-act at the phytic cup, but not diacylglycerol (DAG) which marks mature phagomal membranes. Using a TK inhibitor, researchers show TK contributes to DAG synthesis at the phytic cup and subsequent recruitment of PK. TK or V-deficient peritoneal macrophages display defect in C. alb phocytosis. Bone-derived macrophages lacking TK or V1 show reduced C. alb uptake, comparable to Dect1-deficient cells. TK or V-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic C infection than wild-type mice.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a vector-borne disease that affects ruminants and humans. Madagascar was heavily affected by RV in 2008-2009, with a large spread of the disease. To optimize resources for RV surveillance in Madagascar, identifying at-risk environments is essential. This study aimed to identify factors favorable to RV transmission in cattle and humans and human behaviors in Malag contexts. We characterized Malag environments using Multiple Factor Analysis (FA) and analyzed cattle and human serological data using Generalized Mixed Models. Cattle and human seroprevalence were associated with humid environments and high cattle density. Areas with high cattle density were at risk. Frequent contact with raw milk contributed to human infection. Our study highlighted eastern, western, and northwestern parts as high-risk for RV transmission in cattle. Analyzing environmental and human datasets brought new insight on RV transmission patterns in Madagascar. Association between serreval, humid, and cattle density suggests conitant and direct transmissions critical to RV enotic transmission. In at-risk environments, western, northwestern, and eastern areas, suitable Cx and Anophe mosquitoes transmission occurs in cattle and human.
Researchers studied how a type of protein called a prion, which is a self-propagating protein conformation, is transmitted between identical and non-identical proteins. They used a yeast-based system to explore the nature of transmission barriers between prions. Prion Rq, a common in wild and laboratory yeast, has a prion domain with four Q-rich regions. The study found that Rq has multiple prion determinants that can drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the prion state in vivo. Analysis of transmission between Rq fragments with different pr determinants showed that one Q-rich region is required and sufficient for transmission, but barriers of different strength exist despite identical sequences. This indicates that multiple prion determinants act cooperatively to attain the pr conformation and transmission is determined by this fold.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze genetic data from multiple individuals using a technique called deep learning, a type of machine learning. This method uses multiple layers of neural networks to learn from input data, such as summary statistics, and output genetic parameters of interest. They applied this method to a challenging problem of inferring natural selection and population size history in Drosila melanogaster, a type of fruit fly. The method can separate selection from demography, or population size change, without needing to do them step by step. This is important because selection can confound demographic analysis. They applied the method to 197 Drosilaogaster genomes from Zambia and found many regions of the genome have experienced strong selection, soft, or balancing selection. Soft and balancing selection occur more often near the center of chromosomes. Demographic inference suggests previous bottlenecks for Dilaogaster were too extreme. This work shows the potential of deep learning for population analysis, which is still in its infancy. It can distinguish between informative and uninformative statistics. Deep learning has been used in other fields like neuroscience and biology, but not genetics. It can accommodate complex models and provide a new approach to likelihood-free inference. It can be used with other methods like ABC or SVM. Other approaches are possible and it's unclear which will be most accurate.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes disrupt the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway by impairing localization and deubiquination of FANCD2. Persistent expression of high-risk HPV oncogen is necessary for the development of anal and oropharyngeal cancers. Researchers found that E6/E7-expressing cells are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agent cisplatin and have defects in repairing interstrand crosslinks (ICL). The study reveals how E/E7 attenuates the FA DNA repair pathway. E7 activates the pathway by increasing FAN2 monoubiquination and foci, but inhibits completion of repair by multiple mechanisms. E7 impairs FAN2 localization with double-strand breaks (DSB), hindering recruitment of downstream protein Rad51 to DS in E cells. Further, E expression delays F2 deubiquination, an important for ICL repair. Delayed F2 deubination is associated with chromatin retention of F2, hindering US1 deubiquinating activity and persistently activated ATR/CHK-1/p565F signaling. Emediated p53 degradation does not hamper cell cycle process F2 modifications but abrogates repair by disrupting F deubination. E reduces and foci formation of Pal2, a repair protein downstream F2.
Researchers in Mexico's Southern Chiapas region have made significant progress in reducing the transmission of Onchocerca volulus, a parasitic worm that causes river blindness and skin disease. Since 1998, 559 communities in the area have received semi-annual treatment with ivermectin, a medication that kills the parasite. In 50 of these communities, the treatment frequency was increased to four times a year in 2003, and 113 more communities were added to the quarterly regimen in 2009. To assess the impact, researchers collected black flies and tested them for the parasite DNA. None of the 67,924 flies collected in 2011 had the parasite, indicating an infection rate of less than 0.06 per 1,000 flies. Blood tests on 4,230 children under 5 years old showed only 2 were exposed to the parasite, a rate of 0.05%. These results meet the criteria for interrupting transmission set by the World Health Organization.
Listeria monocytogen is a type of bacteria that invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate in the host cytos. To grow and spread to adjacent cells, it uses a transcription activator called PrA. However, the signal that triggers PrA activation was unknown. Researchers found that L monocytogen secretes a small peptide pherone, pA, which helps the bacteria escape from vacoles and may activate PrA. The pA pherone is made by cutting a protein called PAlipop, which is not needed for pathogenesis. Without pA, bacteria are less virulent in mice and less likely to escape vacoles of non-phagocytic cells. Mutating PrA restores virulence and eliminates pA need. The pA peptide may signal monocogen its presence in the vacole, turning on genes for escape and PrA to grow in the cytos.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Vibrio cholera, which causes cholera, adapts to the hostile environment of the human intestines during infection. They found that Vibrio cholera uses a strategy to overcome the high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by the host cells. The scientists used a technique called whole-genome transposon sequencing (T-seq) to identify the genes involved in this process. They compared Vibrio cholera's ability to colonize the intestines of mice with and without the antioxidant N-acetyl cystine, which reduces ROS levels. The results showed that mutants of the methyl-directed repair system, such as MutS, had an advantage in untreated, ROS-rich mice but not in N-treated mice. Further analysis suggested that accumulation of catalase-producing mutants and rugose variants in N- mice was the cause of Mut mutant enrichment by oxidative stress during infection. Rugose variants could revert to smooth colonies in vitro. The mutation rate of wildtype colonized in N- mice was higher than in N+ mice. These findings support a paradigm that Vibrio employs a temporal strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in enriched phenotypes.
Researchers studied the role of the Mlh3 protein in baker's yeast, a type of fungus, in meiotic recombination and DNA repair. Meiotic recombination is the process by which genetic material is exchanged between chromosomes during reproduction. Mlh-M3 is an enzyme that helps resolve Holliday junctions, a type of recombination intermediate, into crossovers. It also plays a minor role in mismatch repair, fixing errors in DNA. To understand how Mlh-M3 works in both meiotic recombination and repair, scientists analyzed 60 new Mlh alleles. Five disrupted mismatch repair, one disrupted meiotic crossover. They purified and characterized Mlh-M representatives from each class. Both displayed wild-type endonuc activities in vitro. M2sh, a protein that acts with M-M in repair, stimulated enduc activity of M-M but not M, suggesting M is defective in interactions. Whole-genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type, mismatch, crossover, mismatch, enduc defective, and null M mutants. Compared to wild-type, all M mutants showed increases in non-crossover events, consistent with recombination intermediates being resolved through alternative pathways.
When antibiotics are used to treat diseases like tuberculosis, malaria, and Staphylococcus aureus, or gonorrhea, the bacteria can quickly become resistant to the medication. This leads to a switch to new drugs and discontinuing the old ones, but resistance often persists or declines slowly. Researchers thought this was due to the low fitness cost of resistance in the bacteria. However, a new study shows that the structure of the host population, specifically the number of contacts, also plays a role in reversion dynamics. During treatment, host structure leads to non-random distribution of resistant bacteria among the population, and after treatment stops, it affects competition, reducing fitness advantages. This results in lower reversion rate and probability on the population level after treatment is stopped. Simulations show the impact of heterogeneity in host structure is largest in biologically plausible range when fitness costs are small.

The study confirms contact heterogeneity lowers reversion to sensitivity even when a fraction of bacteria is sensitive when treatment is stopped. Large differences between sensitive and resistant strains cause non-trivial distribution of infections over the network, influencing reversion once treatment is stopped. Since costs are small for many pathogen-drug combinations, the relevant range is where effects are expected to be largest. Fitness variance affects reversion probability and shifts closer to 1 with system size. During treatment, resistant infections increase while sensitive decline. Once resistant has risen to a level, treatment is stopped and dynamics are governed by wild-type and resistant in absence. Modulating host structure on reversion is strongest in relevant when differences are small. This allows studying resistance emergence and competition between strains after treatment.
Researchers studied how genetic variations in the human genome, known as copy number variants (CNVs), contribute to autism spectrum disorders (ASD). They used fruit flies, Drosophila, as a model to examine interactions between genes affected by CNVs in individuals with autism. They found that pairs of genes, affected by the same CNV, interacted synergistically, meaning their combined effect was greater than the sum of their individual effects. This was observed in three out of four CNVs with complete ortholog relationships. The study supports the idea that multiple genes, not just one, contribute to autism. The researchers used Dophila to model the effects of gene changes on neurological phenotypes, like those seen in autism. They focused on genes from CNVs identified in patients, whose products participate in autism networks and neural functioning. Many CNVs affect genes in the same pathway, and 33% affect multiple interacting genes in that pathway, suggesting combined copy change causes autistic phenotypes. Autism is highly heritable, but only 30% of cases have identified genetic cause, suggesting many rare and numerous alleles. Large numbers of autistic individuals with family members have de novo CNVs.
Researchers have long known that a type of immune cell called CD8 T cells plays a key role in the development of a severe form of malaria called cerebral malaria. However, they didn't understand how these cells contribute to the disease. To investigate, scientists used a technique called intravital two-photon microscopy to observe CD8 cells in the brains of mice infected with two different types of malaria parasites. They found that these cells accumulated in the spaces around blood vessels in the brain, but behaved differently depending on the type of parasite. In one type, Plasmodium berghei AN, CD8 cells formed long-term interactions with other cells that present antigens, but blocking this interaction didn't prevent the disease. The cells were also found near dying brain cells, but this didn't cause damage to the blood vessels. The study suggests that CD8 cells getting stuck in these spaces is a sign of severe malaria and important for its development.
A study was conducted in Viga County, Kenya to determine the burden of Tungis, a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tunga, also known as jigger. The study involved 437 participants aged 5 and above from 21 villages in 3 sublocations. The overall prevalence of Tungis was 21.5% (95% CI 17.7-25.3%). The disease was more common in areas with low economic status, such as monthly income of Ksh 100 or less, no toilet facilities, and age 14 or less. Wearing closed footwear and resting inside the house also increased the risk of Tis. Tungis is a significant problem in Viga due to the economic status of the affected people. Factors contributing to the disease include poverty. The study suggests the need for cost-effective and accessible strategies to control Tungis.
Researchers have developed a new model to understand how two hormones, auxin and cytokinin, work together to shape the root of a plant, Arabidopsis. Auxin is a hormone that helps roots grow and develop, while cytokinin is involved in cell growth and division. The two hormones interact in a feedback loop, where auxin affects cytokinin and cytokinin affects auxin. The model shows that a pattern of cytokinin levels is not necessary for correct auxin patterning, but rather how auxin modifies cytokinin response. This allows the feedback loop to amplify and stabilize auxin. The study also found that auxin influx, not just efflux, is important for patterning and that pericycle cells on opposite xylem poles compete for auxin, which is why lateral roots are not initiated opposite each other. The model is an extension of previous work on longitudinal auxin transport and considers regulation of transporters under control of aux and cytokinin. It reveals a novel role for aux influx and connection between subcell polarity and tissue robustness. The findings will help construct three-dimensional models of aux transport and growth in Arabidopsis.
Researchers have discovered a key player in the migratory locust's ability to change its behavior in response to its environment. The protein CRE-B acts as a mediator in the NPF/NO signaling pathway, which regulates the locust's locomotor activity between solitary and gregarious phases. CRE-B directly activates the expression of the NOS gene by interacting with its promoter region. Phosphorylation of CRE-B changes in response to population density and is controlled by N2. The involvement of CRE-B in N2-regulated locomotor plasticity is confirmed by RNA experiment and behavioral assay. Protein kinase A transmits the effects of N2 on CRE-B phosphorylation and N transcription. The study reveals a precise cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity.
Researchers studied the role of the protein Zelda (Z) in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster embryos. Zelda is a protein that helps turn on the expression of certain genes. The team used a technique called chromatin immunoprecipitation with high-through sequencing (IP-Seq) to see where Zelda binds in the embryo at different stages. They found that Zelda binds to thousands of regions in the embryo even before the zygotic genome is active. Most of these regions stay bound until the zyg genome is active. They expected Zelda to bind to promoters and enhancers of genes that are expressed early, but also found it binds to promoters of genes that are not expressed until the zyg genome is active. This suggests Zelda plays a role in activating the zyg genome at the maternal-to-zyotic transition (MZ). The team found that Zelda alone can identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with high specificity and selectivity. This means Zelda is not only needed for early transcription but also plays a role in activating the zyg genome at the MZ.
Scientists have long known that proteins interact with each other to carry out biological processes, but the timing of these interactions is crucial for proper function. The body's internal clock, or circadian rhythm, regulates many physiological processes, but the timing of protein interactions on this scale is not well understood. Researchers identified 109 new interactions between circadian proteins using a two-hybrid approach. One interaction, between phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL, led to BM1 destabilization. A dynamic circadian protein network was created using circadian data to predict protein timing. Systematic analysis of RNA and overexpression suggested crucial roles for components in interactions. Analysis of a global network in liver showed interacting proteins are expressed at similar times, likely restricting interactions to specific phases. Circadian proteins connect many processes, such as signaling and cell cycle, contributing to temporal organization in a new way.

A previous studies have analyzed protein interactions at specific stages or phases, but this study provides a comprehensive view of circadian dynamics. Modulators of CLOCK/BMAL function were found, indicating phosphatase 1's role in BM1 regulation. The network was expanded with validated interactions from literature, some essential for circadian dynamics. Timing of expression, protein interactions, and post-translational modifications are essential for circadian rhythms. The study focused on CLOCK and BM1, central to the circadian network, whose modulation by proteins is relevant for rhythms. Examples demonstrate timed interactions' importance for the clock, but the network is not comprehensive. The extent of regulation via time-dependent interactions is largely unknown.
Scientists have solved the structure of a protein called ABA-1 from the nematode Ascaris, a parasite that infects humans. This protein, called a nematode polyallergen (NPA), is unusual because it binds to lipids and is found only in nematodes. It's made up of many copies of a small protein unit that are identical or very similar in amino acid sequence. ABA-1 is the most common unit of NPA in Ascar and is similar to another parasite that infects humans, Ascaris lumicoid. Immune responses to NPA are linked to resistance to infection and are controlled by genes. The structure of ABA-1 was determined using a technique called nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. It has a unique fold with a long helix in the middle and two helical bundles on sides. Two distinct lipid-binding pockets are found in the ends, and amino acids that bind fatty acid were identified. Recombinant A-1 has a tightly bound ligand from bacteria in one site. This is the first processed unit of a repetitive protein to be structurally characterized and belongs to a new class. NPA have no counterparts in vertebrates, making them targets for drug or immunological intervention.
Ciguater poisoning is a serious health issue in tropical regions, particularly in Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PITCs). Between 1998 and 2008, there were 39,677 reported cases of cigu poisoning, with an average of 194 cases per 100,000 people per year. This is a 60% increase from the 104 cases per 100,000 reported between 1973 and 1983. Estimated 500,000 Pacific islanders may have suffered from cig poisoning in the last 35 years, making it a major public health concern. Cigu poisoning is often underdiagnosed and underreported, with only 2-10% of cases reported to health authorities.

Cigu poisoning is caused by eating fish contaminated with cigatoxin, a toxin from dinoflagates and cyanobacteria. The toxin builds up in the food chain, from herbivorous fish to carnivorous fish. Symptoms include severe neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac issues, and in some cases, chronic neuro symptoms lasting weeks to months. Diagnosis is difficult as it can only be detected in specialized labs and is based on symptoms after eating contaminated fish.

Factors associated with cig poisoning include the presence of cigato dinlagates, climate change, coastal degradation, and exploitation of marine resources. The incidence is predicted to increase due to these factors, making it a human and ecological concern.
Researchers studied the impact of benznazole treatment on a specific type of immune cells called CD4CD+8 T cells in patients with Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. These cells play a key role in fighting off the parasite, but are impaired in chronic disease. Thirty-eight patients with Chagas, 20 asymptomatic and 18 symptomatic, and 12 healthy donors were studied. Blood cells were stimulated with parasite antigens to analyze cytokine and cytotoxic molecule production before and after treatment. Benznazole reduced CD4CD+ T cells and improved their function, increasing IL-2 and TN-α production. Inhibitory receptors on these cells were higher in Chagas patients, especially in severe cases. Treatment reduced these receptors and improved multifunctional capacity. CD+8 T cells produced effector molecules to control parasite. Benazole partially reversed exhaustion caused by T cruz infection, improving CD4CD+ T response.
Researchers have identified a key enzyme called Arabidopsis phosphoinide-specific phospholipase 2 (AtPLC2) that plays a crucial role in the breakdown of phosphoinides, a type of lipid involved in plant development and stress response. Phosphides are important signals that help plants grow and respond to their environment. However, multiple forms of the phosphide biosynthetic genes make it hard to understand which enzymes are involved in each step of the pathway and their roles in plant growth. The study found that AtC is the primary phospholase in phosphide metabolism and involved in seedling growth and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in Arabidopsis. Lipid profiling of multiple mutants showed that plc-1 had higher levels of its substrates phosphidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, suggesting the phosphide metabolic pathway is impaired. At displayed a distinct expression pattern and localized at the plasma membrane in different cell types where phosphide signaling occurs. Seedlings of plc- showed growth defect that was complemented by heterologous expression At, suggesting phosphide-specific phospholase activity by At is required for growth. Moreover, plc- showed hypersensitive response to ER as evidenced by changes in phenotypes and gene profiles. The study revealed primary enzyme in phosphide metabolism, involvement in seedling and emerging link between phosphide and stress.
Researchers challenge the idea that causation in the world only occurs at the microscopic level, known as reductionism. They use a measure called intrinsic-effect power-integrated (Φ) to show that macro-level systems can have more causation power than their microscopic parts. This was tested on various systems of different sizes and time scales, considering all possible combinations of micro and macro elements. The study found that macro systems can have more inputs and outputs than their micro parts, revealing new mechanisms and constraints not seen at the microscopic level. This means macro systems can have more causation than their parts, especially when they are more interconnected. The researchers also found that for a given system, there can be multiple maxima of Φ across space and time. This was demonstrated on a biological system, the fission yeast cell cycle, where local maxima were found during its function. These max correspond to levels where emergent properties appear and provide a new perspective for scientific inquiry. The study uses intrinsic power as a measure of causation and shows examples of macro systems with more causation than micro. This refutes the idea that causation is only at the microscopic level. Evaluating macro systems across space and time shows there can be multiple maxima of causation, where integrated information decreases to zero. Local max capture emergent roles of macro elements, corresponding to system descriptions as NOR, OR, AND, or MAJ. The study assesses causation explicitly as intrinsic power and determines space-time levels where new properties emerge.
Scientists have studied how reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which is crucial for energy production in cells. ROS can be both helpful signals for adapting to the environment and damaging to cells under certain conditions. To understand this, researchers extended a model of complex III to account for electron transport, proton movement, and chemical reactions in the chain. They measured electron flux in rat mitochondria fueled by succinate and pyruvate malate, and NAD reduction by reverse transport from succinate through complex I. The model fit gave insight into the formation of free radicals that can transfer electrons to oxygen, producing superoxide and ROS. Analysis showed association of ROS with specific radicals and their combinations in complexes I and III. The phenomenon of bistability in complex III remains valid for the whole chain. Conditions for high radical content in III were predicted and confirmed. These findings provide new insights into ROS production mechanisms.

 ROS are products of electron transport in the respiratory chain. They start with superoxide formation from oxygen and free radicals. Superoxide can be deactivated by superoxide dismutase. Changes in radical content and ROS match the model and validate it. Inhibition of reverse transport by roten decreases ROS in succ-fueled mitochondria. Measurements show ROS inhibition after roten addition. Sets of parameters fit data show similar patterns for radicals in I and III, giving insight into respiration and ROS.
Researchers have studied how motor proteins transport cargo within cells, which is essential for various cellular functions. These proteins convert chemical energy into kinetic energy, enabling unidirectional and bidirectional transport of cargo over long distances. Disruptions in this process, often caused by mutations, lead to neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's. A recent study found that phosphorylation of a motor protein's kines domain at serine residue is linked to Huntington's disease. This article investigates the effects of similar mutations on transport properties of cargo carried by wild-type and mutant motors. Results show that mutants with altered stall forces determine average velocity and run-length, even when outnumbered by wild-type motors. Mutants gain an advantage and increase run-length when the load is near their stalling force or multiple of stalling. A new semi-analytical method was developed to analyze transport by multiple motors of different types, determining transition rates between configurations and computing biologically relevant quantities like velocity and run-length. This method can model single parameter alterations and deduce effects on transport by multiple motors. It's easily implementable and a software package is provided.
Researchers studied how a specific gene, CAC1, affects learning and behavior in mice. They used a task where mice had to choose between two options based on a light on a screen to get a reward. The goal was to see how mice with a modified C1 gene would learn compared to those with a normal gene. The results showed that mice without the C1 gene still learned, but used a different strategy than those with the normal gene. Most without C1 mice learned based on the outcome of their choice, while most with the normal gene learned based on the light on the screen. This suggests the C1 gene plays a specific role in learning. The study also found that looking at how mice use different strategies to learn can give more insight into how learning works. This has implications for understanding and treating psychiatric disorders linked to the C1 gene.
Aedes aegypt mosquitoes infected with Wolbach bacteria are being released worldwide to suppress arboviruses, but their ability to invade and persist depends on environmental conditions, particularly fluctuating temperatures in the field. Researchers reared Ae aegypt larvae with different types of Wolbach (wMel, wAlB and wMel-CLA) under diurnal temperatures. They found that rearing Mel and Mel-CLA-infected larvae at 26-37°C reduced cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive manipulation by Wolbach, and decreased Wolbach density in adults. Mel and Mel-CLA infections were not transmitted to the next generation when exposed to 26-37°C across life stages. In contrast, wB infection maintained high density, complete cytoplasm incompat, and transmitted to offspring with high fidelity under this cycle. This has implications for Wolbach interventions across environments and highlights temperature control in rearing.
Researchers studied adenoviruses in non-human primates, such as chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans, and macaques. They found that these animals shed substantial amounts of adeniruses in their stool, even when they were healthy. This was surprising, as previous studies suggested adenir infections were self-limiting in immunocompet hosts. The team purified and sequenced 30 adeniruses from apes and 3 adenir from macques. Analysis showed ape adenir could be classified into human adenirus species B, C, and E, and there was evidence of intras recombination between adenir. Phylogenetic relatedness of adenir across primate hosts suggested cross-species transmission had occurred. Asymptomatic shedding of adenirus in non-human primates and zoonotic transmissions warrant caution for primate handling. Persistent adenirus infections in gut should be considered in human and non-primate studies with adenirus vectors.
Scientists have long known that DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones to form a structure called chromatin in the cell's nucleus. To function, chromatin must be unwrapped, but the details of this process at an atomic level were unclear. Researchers used a computer simulation method to calculate the energy needed to unwrap the outer turn of chrom. They found it takes about 11.5 kilocalories of energy to unwrap, which matches experiments. The simulation showed many paths to unwrap, but one is most likely. It starts at one end, unwraps 5 base pairs, then 5 more at the same end, then moves to the other end and unwraps 10, and finally unwraps the rest. This gives insight into how chromatin is made, broken, and reassembled in the cell.
Scientists have discovered a new way to protect cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress can harm cell membranes, and lysosomes are particularly vulnerable because they need a stable acidic environment to function. A protein called Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) helps cells cope with stress by binding to lipids and has antioxidant properties. In the nervous system, astrocytes secrete Apo to help neurons. Apo's role is known, but its mechanism was unknown. Researchers studied Apo's traffic and role in lysosomal homeostasis under oxidative stress. They found Apo is endocyted and targeted to vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner. Apo is stable in acidic environment and helps lysosomes recover from oxidation, preventing membrane permeabilization. This is crucial for processes like myelin phagocytosis in astrocytes and autophagy in neurons. Results show Apo regulates lysosomal membrane integrity, a new mechanism for many neurodegenerative diseases. This opens therapeutic opportunities for repairing lysosomes in pathological situations.
Researchers studied two colonies of Phlebotus orientalis sandflies from different locations in Ethiopia to understand their biology and susceptibility to Leishmania donovani, the parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis. One colony was from a non-endemic area in the lowlands of Melka Wer and the other from an endemic area in the highlands of Addis Zemen. They found differences in life cycle parameters between the two colonies, such as requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. However, genetic analysis using DNA sequencing did not reveal any differences between the two colonies. The researchers also found that hybrids of the two colonies had higher fecundity than the parental colonies. They tested the susceptibility of P. orient to L. donani by infecting them with the parasite and found that even the lowest dose of 2,103 per ml was enough to infect 50% of the sandflies. Using higher doses, infection rates were around 90% for both colonies. The parasite developed quickly in the sandflies, with metacyclic promastigotes in the thoracic midgut and colonization of the stomal valve by haptads recorded in 5 days. Both colonies were highly susceptible to Ethiopian L. donani strains.
Researchers in China studied the quality of life and disability of patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica, a serious parasitic disease that affects millions. They used a questionnaire and physical exams to evaluate 506 patients in a high-risk area and found that most had impairments in at least one health dimension, such as pain or discomfort, usual activities, and anxiety or depression. The overall quality of life was 0.447, with age-specific values ranging from 0.378 among 30-44 year-olds to 0.510 for those over 60. Factors associated with poor quality of life included loss of work capacity, abnormality, ascites, and hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and high albumin were protective. These findings can help update the global burden of disease study and inform decision-making for China's schistosomiasis control program.
African trypanosomias, also known as sleeping sickness in humans and nagana in animals, are prevalent parasitic diseases in sub-Saharan Africa. People get trypanosias from a tse fly bites infected with protozoa Trypanosoma brucei. A study used national census data from 1999 to estimate vulnerability and disability in Kenya's tse belts, where tse flies spread the disease. The study found that tse belts were associated with increased disability, both directly from bites and indirectly, as diseased livestock led to poverty and malnutrition. The census data is a promising tool for future surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa. Both human and animal trypanias and agricultural losses contribute to disability in tse-infested areas. Future research will examine the relationship between tse infestation and disability after the 2009 census.
Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) is a compound that induces cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells, but its mechanism of action was not well understood. Researchers found that HM activates the PI3/Akt pathway, which leads to the phosphorylation of HEXIM and release of active transcription elongation factor (PTEF) from its complex with 7 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). As a result, PF is recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription and production. Despite HM presence, released PF rapidly reassembles with 7sn and HEXIM. A mutant HEX protein that cannot be phosphorylated and released via PI/Akt pathway antagonizes HM-mediated viral production. Studies reveal how HM induces HIV and suggest modifications between active and inactive PF contribute to cell differentiation.
Researchers have identified a virus called Leish RNA (LRV) in Leish parasites that can cause a severe form of the disease called mucosal leishmanias (ML) and disseminated cutaneous leishias (DCL). This form of the disease occurs when the infection spreads to other parts of the body from a primary skin lesion caused by a Leish-infected sand fly bite. LRV is linked to high levels of parasites in the blood, inflammation, and damage to nasal tissues in ML and skin lesions in D. Studies show LRV is present in some Leish species, but not all. To detect LRV, scientists need better methods that don't rely on knowing the virus sequence, as it changes over time. This study presents new techniques, including an antibody called J2 that recognizes LRV in a specific way. J2 is used in tests like immunofluorescence, ELISA, and dot blot. These methods complement others like nucleic acid purification and real-time PCR. Researchers tested J2 on several Leish strains, patient samples, and mouse biopsies, showing it can detect LRV. They suggest these methods can be used in the field to diagnose LRV and predict risk of complications in cutaneous leishias. Leish is a major disease with 12 million infections and 350 million at risk in 98 countries. It has two forms: cutaneous (self-healing) and visceral (fatal). LRV is found in some Leish species, but not all. LRV is linked to high parasite levels, inflammation, and damage in ML and D. In mice, LRV is recognized by the immune system, making disease worse. Leish has a life cycle with two forms: one in sand fly and one in mammal. Researchers tested J2 on Leish from a patient and mouse biops, showing it can detect LRV.
Researchers studied how two types of bacteria, Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHE) and Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), infect intestinal cells. These bacteria attach to the cells, flatten microvilli, and create structures called actin pedestals. To form pedestals, EPEC uses a protein called Tir, while EHE uses a protein called EspFU. Both bacteria form communities on cells, called macrocolonies, which grow over time. The proteins Tir and Esp, as well as a host protein called Arp2/3, are important for macrocolony growth. Surprisingly, EspFU helps bacteria move faster to cell junctions, where they form a new pedestal on a neighboring cell, allowing one to infect the second cell. This shows Esp enhances colonization by increasing actin-based movement and efficient cell-to-cell transmission.
Researchers compared two methods for purifying extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the secretions of a parasitic worm, Fasciola hepatica: differential centrifugation (DC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). DC is the most commonly used method, but SEC has been used for other pathogens. The study found that SEC-purified EVs were smaller and less diverse than DC-purified EVs. Protein analysis showed SEC-pur EVs had a higher purity of free-secretory protein (ESP) yield, with less contamination from soluble cathepsin and tegument proteins. Proteomics analysis showed DC-pur EV had more protein identifications and peptide hits, indicating contamination from ESP and tegument. SEC-p EV had less tegument proteins. This suggests DC and SEC do not isolate the same EV population, and caution is needed when choosing purification method. The study proposes using SEC for downstream studies.
Researchers used a method called reverse engineering to study how genes in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) control their development. They wanted to see if a process called post-transcription regulation is important for creating patterns in the fly's body. This process happens after genes are made into proteins, not just when they are made. They looked at three genes: Krpp, knps, and giant. They had detailed data on how much of these genes' mRNA and proteins were made at different times in the fly's development. They used this data to create a model of postcription regulation and checked if it worked well. The results showed that postcription is not needed for creating patterns, but is important for controlling how much protein is made. This method can be used to study other complex biological processes, like development. 

The researchers made sure their model was good by checking if it had a unique solution and could be repeated. They fitted it to protein data using mRNA as input. If it worked, they knew postcription wasn't needed. If not, they found what relied on postcription. They did this for Kr, kn, and gt and got results that were specific and biologically plausible. They applied this to how patterns in the fly's early embryo. They wanted to know if postcription was important for development. Many studies focus on gene transcription, not postcription. They created high-resolution data on mRNA for Kr, kn, and gt during the fly's development.
Rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea worldwide and primarily infects the small intestinal epithelial cells. Infants and newborn mice are highly susceptible, while adults remain asymptomatic and shed low viral particles. Researchers investigated age-dependent mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial immune response to rotavirus in an oral infection model. Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) expression was low in suckling mice but increased during the postnatal period, inversely correlating with rotavirus susceptibility, shedding, and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in TLR3 or its adaptor molecule TRIF had higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial pro-inflammatory and antiviral gene expression compared to wild-type. In contrast, neonatal mice deficient in TLR or TRIF did not display impaired stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. Chimeric mice showed a non-hematopoietic cell contribution to TR-mediated antiral response in adults. Age-dependent TLR increase was also detected in human intestinal biops. Upregulation of epithelial TLR during infancy might contribute to age-dependent rotavirus susceptibility.
Researchers analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 1,039 individuals with autism spectrum disorders and 870 controls from the National Human Genome Repository to identify rare genetic variations. They used two different methods to sequence and call variants, ensuring the distribution of rare variations was similar across data from both centers. To combine results from the two centers, they chose gene-based analysis, but debated whether to use meta-analysis (combining statistics across centers) or mega-analysis (combining data then analyzing). Simulations showed mega-analysis had more power than meta-analysis. Before analyzing, they explored how population structure affected rare variant analysis, finding it could confound case-control studies by clustering variants in ancestry, but principal component analysis controlled for it. Using gene-based tests and both meta and mega-analysis, they found no new risk genes for autism in this sample. Their results suggest gene-based tests require larger samples to be effective, even for a complex disorder like autism.
A study investigated the link between genetic variations in the chitriosase and AMCase genes and the risk of developing myetoma caused by Madlla myetom in Sudanese patients. Madlla myet is the most common cause of myet in Sudan, but only a small number of people exposed to the fungus develop the infection. The fungus contains chitin in its cell wall, which can trigger the human immune system. Researchers looked at 112 patients with myet and 103 healthy controls for variations in the chitrios and AM genes. They found a variation in the chitrios gene that reduced its activity and a variation in the AM gene that decreased its activity. These variations were associated with a higher risk of developing myet. The study suggests that the immune system's ability to break down chitin, a key component of the fungus, may play a role in the development of myet.
Researchers have re-examined the concept of herpes simplex virus (HSV) latency, a state where the virus remains dormant in the body without causing symptoms. Traditionally, HSV was thought to have two phases: lytic (active) and latent (dormant). However, new evidence suggests these phases are not as clear-cut as previously believed. A study used a sensitive model to show that lytic genes can be expressed during latency, and that half of the virus spread to latent sites occurs after initial infection. The study also found that lytic promoters drive protein expression during latency. This is the most direct evidence to date that lytic genes are active during latency. The researchers linked this to CD8 T cell activation in latently infected nerve cells with viral gene expression during latency. This could be due to either limited lytic gene expression being part of latency or early presentation of proteins to CD8 cells halting reactivation. To further investigate, the relationship between immunity and viral expression, the study used a virus driven by the ICP47 promoter. This showed some virus spreads with lytic expression after first week of infection, but not during latency. This matches previous findings for I0 promoter, which does not lead to protein expression during latency. Other studies using reporter models have not shown ly expression during latency, but this is the first to test a major anti-HSV CD8 target. HSV latency is defined as viral DNA persistence without infectious virus. In mouse models, latency is profound, with reactivation hard to induce. Historically, transcription was restricted to latency-associated transcripts (LAT).
Researchers studied the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brains of mice infected with three different strains of scrapie, a type of prion disease. They used a technique called dual-staining immunohistochemistry to see where the misfold protein, called PrSc, accumulated in the brain cells. The results showed that each strain had a different pattern of accumulation, with one mainly in astroglia, one in neurons, and one similar to both. The researchers also looked at the expression of genes involved in neuroinflammation in the brain and found that despite the differences in PrSc accumulation, the pattern of upregulated genes was similar for all three strains. The upregulated genes correlated with activation of both astrogl and microglia early in the disease before vacu pathology or clinical signs. The profile of upregulated genes in scrapie differed from two viral diseases that caused similar gliosis in mice.
Researchers have developed a new strategy to study the 3D organization of chromosomes, which is crucial for gene expression and cell function. Chromosomes are long, densely packed, and topologically constrained, making it challenging to model their behavior. The team created a coarse-grained model for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice, accounting for entanglement and volume density. This model captures steady-state and dynamic properties and tracks dynamics at different scales, offering a significant numerical efficiency gain and a way to define reliable coarse-grained models for chromosomes. They used this model to study the evolution of chromosome 3R (20Mbp) in Drosophila during a cell cycle (20 hours). A combination of coarse-graining and a block copolymer model with epigen-driven interactions quantitatively reproduces experimental data and predicts chromatin is dynamic during the cycle. Introducing rigidity to the model and controlling volume achieves high numerical efficiency while maintaining spatial and temporal resolution. The model simulates chromosome dynamics in a day on a desktop. The team also built a coarse-grained model for chromatin with a copolymer framework based on epigen data, investigating folding and dynamics of a large chromosome in Doph. This is the first study to describe large regions (20M) during a cycle (20 hours) with high precision (10bp). The approach is generic and can be applied to self-avoiding polymers and off-lattice systems. Neglecting topological constraints leads to erroneous fine-scale description, and supplementary interactions may lead to misinterpretation.
Researchers analyzed genetic data from 11 studies on 7 different cell types to identify genetic variants that influence gene expression. They combined this data with information on regulatory elements that control gene expression, such as enhancers and promoters, to understand how these variants affect gene expression in specific cells. The study found that variants associated with gene expression in one cell type are often overlap with regulatory elements specific to that cell, such as enhancers, promoters, and proteins that bind to DNA. This helps explain how genetic variants affect gene expression in specific cells. The researchers also developed a method to predict which type of cell a variant affects using data from regulatory elements. They tested this method on data from genome-wide association studies, which identify genetic variants linked to diseases, and found that regulatory elements from a specific cell can help explain associations even without expression data from that cell. This approach can improve understanding of how genetic variants affect human traits and diseases.
Scientists have been working to develop a vaccine against HIV, a virus that causes AIDS, by creating proteins that can trigger the body's immune system to fight it. These proteins, called immunogens, need to have a specific sugar coating, or glycosylation, to work properly. However, current cell lines used to make these proteins add too many sugars, making it hard to produce the right kind. Researchers used a new tool, CRISPR/Cas9, to create a new cell line that adds fewer sugars, just the right amount. This cell, called MG1-deficient CHO, can make proteins that bind to some antibodies that fight HIV, but not others. This is a step towards making a vaccine that can protect against HIV.
Researchers have identified a potential target for developing new treatments against parasitic nematode diseases, such as lymphatic filariasis, a major cause of long-term disability in tropical regions. Trehalose-6-phosphatase (TPP) from the nematode Brugia malayi is essential for the parasite's survival and has no mammalian counterpart, making it a promising target for inhibitors. The researchers determined the X-ray structure of TP from B. malayi, revealing a stabilizing N-terminal domain and catalytic C-terminal C2-type H phosphatase fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses with a competitive inhibitor, treose-sulfate, identified key residues for binding and catalysis. A model of the TP-trehose-phosphate complex shows substrate binding driven by shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions, unlike hom sucrose-phosphatase which relies on hydrogen bonds. This suggests high-affinity inhibitors will bind to the phosphoryl pocket and non-native to treose pocket. The treose site is dominated by hydrophobic residues, unlike other carbohydrate binding proteins. Key residues are conserved among TP phosphates from nematodes and bacteria, suggesting a common strategy for inhibitor design. A model of TP with treose-phosphate bound was constructed for inhibitor design. TP is present in bacteria, fungi, plants, and invertebrates, but not mammals, making it a potential target for anthelmics.
Researchers have developed a new computer model to simulate how fluids move through tumors in the body. Tumors are made up of leaky blood vessels that don't work well together, which makes it hard to treat them. The new model uses real images of tumors to predict how fluids move through them. It combines two descriptions of blood and fluid flow to make accurate predictions. The team tested it on mouse and human tumors and found that normalizing blood vessels is key to understanding fluid movement. They also found that lowering pressure in tumors doesn't help fluids move in, but creating a pressure gradient does. They think stabilizing blood vessel sizes and permeability is important after treatment, and normalizing the environment may help fluids move better.
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, can spread through two main ways: from cell to cell and in a free state. But how important cell-to-cell transmission is in natural infection and how it's blocked by antibodies and inhibitors is unclear. Researchers used a new method to study how neutralizing antibodies and inhibitors work in cell-to-cell transmission. They found that antibodies that target the CD4 site on the virus are less effective in blocking cell-to-cell transmission, while those that target the gp41 part of the virus remain active. This suggests that antibodies that target the CD site prefer to block free virus spread, allowing it to spread through cell contacts. This explains why HIV can evade and escape strong antibodies that target the CD site in the body. The study shows that antibodies and inhibitors work differently in cell-to-cell and free transmission. HIV uses both ways to infect, so blocking one may not be enough.
Researchers have proposed a new model to explain how attention affects neural responses in the brain. They found that attention changes neural firing rates and receptive fields, both in space and feature space. Current models suggest attention modulates inputs, but anatomy and physiology show attention targets higher areas like V4 or MT, not lower areas like V1. The new model proposes top-down modulation on higher areas produces effects on neural responses. It requires feedback connections between areas and short inhibition within each area. Feedback redistributes modulation to lower areas, altering inputs of higher cells, including those not initially modulated. This produces rate changes and field shifts. Simultaneously, short inhibition between cells creates competitive effects, scaling field size in each area. The model reproduces attention effects on rates, response, gain, and field shifts without changing parameters. It also predicts response curves shift from gain to contrast as attention drifts away from cells.
In the fruit fly Drosila, a group of specialized cells called the posterior signalling centre (PSC) controls the balance of blood cells in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland. This role is similar to the "niche" environment of hematopoietic stem cells in vertebrates. The P acts in a non-autonomous manner to maintain janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators (J/STAT) signalling in hematietic progenitors, preserving their multipotent character for differentiation into lamlocytes, a dedicated immune cell type to fight specific threats like wasp parasism. A new study shows that a type I cytokine receptor, CG142/Lat, is required to switch off J/STAT signalling in hematiet progen. This is necessary for massive differentiation of lamytes upon wasp infection. In vivo and cell assays indicate Lat forms heteromers with Dome, a Dila type cytokine receptor related to mammalian GP130, and antagonizes Dome activity dose-dependently. The immune response to wasp infection is a decrease in cytokine levels in the gland, followed by increase in Lat/Dome ratio. This sequence leads to complete inhibition of J/STAT signalling by Lat.
Scientists have studied how two types of viruses, Tomato yellow curl virus and Tomato leaf curl virus, that infect tomatoes. These viruses can swap genetic material with each other when they infect the same plant, a process called recombination. This helps them evolve and change over time. Researchers looked at how often and where this swapping happens in 120 infected tomato plants. They found that the viruses swap genetic material in complex ways and that depend on how similar the viruses are to each other, but not on their structure. They also found that some swapped viruses don't survive because they disrupt important interactions between proteins and genetic material. The study shows that selection favors viruses that keep these interactions, even if it's hard to find the exact parts involved. This is important for understanding how these viruses evolve and spread.
Scientists have long believed that nucleosomes, the basic units of eukaryotic chromatin, play a crucial role in shaping eukotic genomes by influencing DNA mutation and selection. However, research has shown that archaea, a distinct group of microorganisms, also have histone proteins, the building blocks of nucleosomes. Despite differences between archaeal and eukotic nucleosomes, researchers found a striking similarity in the association between nucleosome footprints and evolution in humans and the archaeon Halofer volcanii. To understand this, they compared substitution patterns around nucleosomes in humans and Halofera, a group of halophilic archaea. They discovered that neither mutation nor selection can explain the observed association between nucleosomes and sequence. Instead, they found that nucleosome substitution patterns are consistent with a model where sequence divergence leads to frequent repositioning of nucleosomes during evolution. This means that nucleosomes move to new locations in response to changes in DNA sequence. The study highlights the importance of considering the direction of causality between genetic and epigenetic change.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify key positions on a protein that are crucial for its ability to change shape when binding to a ligand. This shape change is important for the protein's function. The team used a dataset of 188 protein structures in both with and without a ligand. They found that some positions are more important for this change than others. These positions are mostly buried, non-polar residues in regular parts of the protein like beta-sheets and alpha helices. Mutations in these positions can affect the protein's ability to bind a lig. The team also found that these positions are evolutionarily conserved, meaning they stay the same across different species. This suggests they are important for the protein's function.
Researchers studied the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M), a bacterium that causes tuberculosis. They engineered an M strain with low levels of FBA and found that it was cleared in both acute and chronic infections in mice and lost viability when cultured on single carbon sources. However, it could grow on mixtures of glycolytic and gluogenic carbon sources, suggesting M's ability to co-catabolize multiple sources. Further studies showed that lack of F could be compensated by specific balance of glucose and butyrate, with growth and metabolism of butrate determined by M's ability to coatabol glucose. These results suggest F as a potential target for both replicating and persistent M, and expand understanding of conditions that define M's FBA essentiality in vivo. M's metabolism is crucial for understanding pathogenesis and identifying new chemotherapies, as M mutants lacking enzymes are most attenuated in tuberculosis model. F is central to glycol and gluogenesis and has been studied structurally, enzymatically, and developmentally.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called mitochondrial peroxiredoxin (mTXx) in the parasite Leishmania, which causes leishmaniasis. They created a version of the parasite that lacked this protein and found it was unable to infect mice. Surprisingly, this was not due to the protein's ability to remove oxidants, but rather a new function as a molecular chaperone. A chaperones help proteins fold correctly and prevent them from aggregating. The researchers found that TXx suppressed the aggregation of a protein called citrate synthase in a test tube. They also found that the parasite lacking TXx was more sensitive to temperature changes, like some organisms lacking chaper genes. This changes the understanding of how trypanosid 2-cys peroxins work and shows that they can be important for infection even if they don't remove oxidants.
Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the accuracy of the Histoplas urine antigen (HAg) test for diagnosing disseminated histlasis (PD) in HIV patients. They tested 288 patients with suspected of having PD and compared the results to blood, bone marrow, and tissue cultures or histopath exams. The test showed a 67.1% sensitivity and 97.5 specificity. The test may be useful for starting antifungal treatment but a culture-based approach is necessary since co-infections are frequent and a negative result does not rule out PD. A previous study in Brazil reported 100 sensitivity and 92.9 specificity, while another in the US had 22.7 sensitivity and 30 specificity. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a test with 84 sensitivity and 94 in a Colombian population. The results are difficult to compare due to study design. A multicenter comparisons against cultures and histology are lacking. The test is preferred for regions outside the US due to logistics and costs. The study found 66 patients with other infections and AIDS-defining malignancy, nine co-infecting or coexisting with PD.
Researchers analyzed stool samples from 12 children with diarrhea using a new method called "microass" sequencing, which requires only a small amount of stool, minimal purification, and limited sequencing. This approach allowed them to detect known viruses and novel viruses with limited similarity to viruses in a database. The study aimed to explore the diversity of viral communities in pediatric patients with diarrhea, anticipating that they would vary from specimen to specimen. The goal was to obtain a broad perspective on the diversity of viruses present. Micro sequencing enables systematic and unbiased exploration of viral diversity, including known and novel, in stool during acute diarrhea episodes, laying the foundation for future studies on novel viruses' role in diarrhea. The study showed that microass can define viral communities in fecal samples from diarrhea patients, detecting known and novel viruses with few colonies from each sample. This will serve as a starting point for further investigation of these viruses' roles in the gastrointestinal tract. The study is the first metagenomic investigation of viral diversity in human diarrhea, with previous studies limited to analysis of 4 specimens from 3 healthy patients. Pediatric samples provide smaller stool volumes, so the strategy minimized purification steps to analyze as little as 100mg of fecal matter. The study presents data from microass of several hundred reads per sample from 12 patients with acute diarrhea.
A recent study in the Dominican Republic compared the Zika and deng outbreaks using national surveillance data. The study found that 75% of deng cases occurred in people under 20 years old, while Zika infections were more widespread among the population. Dengue rates were higher in males, 25.9 per 10,000 vs 21.5 per 10,000 in females. Zika was highly clustered among females, 73.8% (95%CI 72.6,75%), with adjusted rates 7.64 per 10,000 in females vs 2.72 per 10,000 in males. Stratification by sex showed higher rates in females 1.84 (1.82,1.87) vs males 1.72 (1.69,1.75). However, GBS rates stratified by sex showed higher risk in males 0.62 vs 0.57 per 10,000. The study suggests little impact of existing deng immunity on Zika attack rates at the population level. Confounding R and risk by sex-specific reporting can alter metrics, which can be addressed with proxy syndromes or conditions. The findings indicate awareness campaigns influenced short-term health behavior in women of reproductive age, although biological susceptibility can't be ruled out. Media and screening are recommended for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Future research should focus on Zika outcomes in deng seropositive individuals.
Researchers have found that in Arabidopsis thaliana, a type of plant, the enzyme PAR2 (poly AD-ribose polymerase) plays a more significant role in responding to DNA damage and immune responses than PAR1. This is in contrast to animals, where PAR1 is the main contributor. PAR2 has a different structure than PAR1, with a SAP binding motif instead of a zinc finger domain. PAR2 also contributes more than PAR1 to plant immune responses, such as restricting bacterial growth and reducing DNA breaks. The enzyme PARG (poly AD-ri glycohydrolase) responsible for removing poly AD-ri from proteins in Arabid is P1, not P2. The activity and abundance of PAR2 is influenced by PAR1 and P1. PAR2 and PAR physically interact with P1 and P2, suggesting direct regulation. Plant PAR and PARG proteins are distinct from animal counterparts, indicating different regulation of poly AD- in plants.
Researchers have identified a new signaling pathway in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that regulates the formation of synapses, the connections between neurons that allow them to communicate. This pathway, called the M-15/JNK-1, opposes the action of the RPM-1 protein, which is involved in synapse formation and axon termination. The M-15/J-1 pathway includes four kinases: M-15, NS-1, JKK-1, and JNK-1, which work together to suppress synapse formation but not axon termination in the mechanosensory neurons of RPM-1 mutants. Overexpressing these kinases in the M-15/J-1 pathway in wild-type animals impairs synapse formation. The M-15/J-1 pathway functions autonomously in mechanensory neurons and localizes to presynaptic terminals, indicating its role in synapse development. Loss of M-15/J-1 signaling also suppresses habituation to repeated stimuli in RPM-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit likely due to impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. Habituation is consistent with M-15/J-1 functioning as a parallel pathway to RPM-1, indicating it can restrict glutamateric synapse and short-term learning.
Scientists have discovered that a protein called TR-1 plays a crucial role in determining the sex of sperm cells in a type of worm called Caenorhabditis brigae. This protein can either activate or repress genes, depending on the signals it receives from other proteins. Researchers found that TR-1 is bipotential, meaning it can do both activate and repress the same target genes. They identified a co-factor that helps TR-1 work and studied how its structure changes during evolution. Experiments showed that TR-1 is needed for spermatogenesis and works with a complex called Tip60 Histone Acetylase. It also promotes the expression of a gene called fog-3, necessary for sperm development. TR-1 works with TR-1 to activate fog-3 and control the sperm/oocyte decision. Previous studies showed TR-1 can repress fog-3, demonstrating it's bipotential. TR- also regulates the development of the tail in sperm. Mutants that lack TR- and TR-1 resemble those lacking TR-1, showing both control TR- activity. However, the relationship between the two parts of the switch changed during evolution. In Caenorhabitis brigae, TR- mutants prevent hermaphrodite spermat, but fog mutants don't. In Caenorhabditis, fog mutants prevent spermat, but TR- mutants don't. Experiments confirm both parts of the switch exist in each species. The relationship between the two parts can shift rapidly, producing same phenotype by alternative mechanisms.
Researchers have developed two new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, to quantify the extent to which a system generates more information than the sum of its parts as it transitions between states, reflecting levels of consciousness generated by neural systems. These measures can be applied to time-series data, unlike the previous measure ΦDM, which is only defined for discrete Markov systems and rare in biology. Simulations demonstrate the practical applicability of the new measures and explore their properties. The results provide opportunities for examining integration in real and model systems and carry implications for relations between integrated information, consciousness, and neurocognitive processes. However, findings pose challenges for theories ascribing physical meaning to measured quantities.

The new measures address limitations of previous integrated information measures, such as Φ, which is a candidate that has received attention in consciousness science. Previous measures were formulated in the context of the theory of consciousness, the integrated theory of consciousness (IT). According to IT, consciousness is integrated information and a fundamental property of the universe, equivalent to mass and charge. A low value of integrated would correspond to low conscious level. The distinction carries implications for theories, such as IT, that ascribe meaning to measures of integrated. The IT characterizes consciousness in terms the capacity of a system, not process.
Researchers have been studying the spread of Rhodesian African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda, a disease that has been increasing in recent years. They wanted to understand how environmental and climate factors affect the spread of the disease. A previous study used simple methods to look at the relationship between H and social, environmental, and climate factors in two areas most affected by the disease, suggesting it spread due to movement of infected, untreated livestock. This study goes further by accounting for spatial correlation, uncertainty in data and model parameters, and predicting future risk of H prevalence. Using a spatial analysis, a general linear model was used in a Bayesian framework to account for correlation and uncertainty, resulting in more accurate estimates and increased predictive power. The study supports that H was brought to the area by movement of untreated, infected livestock. Health care and land temperature also affect the distribution of H. Predictive mapping shows increased risk in areas surrounding markets, highlighting importance of trading for spread. Treating livestock at sale is key to prevent spread.
Researchers have challenged the idea that complexity leads to stability in ecosystems, a concept that has been around since the 1970s. They looked at networks inspired by ecology and found that a key assumption is not tested: the existence of an equilibrium, where all species have positive abundances. Analytical results and simulations show that equilibrium disappears in systems with many species. This leaves us with a problem: assuming equilibrium is not granted in stability criteria. The team looked at interaction strength and structure, and found that equilibrium and stability don't depend on species richness with weak interactions. They also found that ecological networks behave differently than unstructured systems. The study suggests that understanding ecosystems requires the balance between interaction strength, structure, and how interactions are distributed in the network. 

The researchers think it's essential to study feasibility in complex systems. A paradox is that complexity decreases stability in models led to exploring structure's effect on dynamics. Some works have shown architectures can stabilize networks. However, the feasibility of different architectures for interactions has not been explored. Feasibility can be easily evaluated. The results show that focusing on the interplay between structure, interaction strengths, and how they're distributed in architecture will give information on natural systems' dynamics. Other aspects should be considered to reach conclusions about feasibility and stability that fit natural systems better. The team refined May's approach by mixing interaction types. The conclusion is that in species-rich communities, interactions should be moderate for equilibrium stability. They simulated stability in systems with architecture like empirically observed food webs. Species richness and connectance are usually treated independently, but decrease in different systems, limiting the space to explore. Topology has been suggested to play a minor role in stability, but the team found it plays a role in equilibrium abundances. The existence of equilibrium is not guaranteed, as the probability decreases exponentially as the network grows. With weak interactions, non-trivial equilibria are found in ecological systems in a way that's ecologically sensible.
Researchers conducted a study in Western Kenya to understand the spread of Coxiella burnii, a bacteria that causes Q fever, in humans and cattle. They took blood samples from 204 humans and 955 cattle in 416 households and found that 2.5% of humans and 10.5% of cattle had the bacteria. There was no link between cattle and human infection within households or nearby households. The study found that factors like buying cattle from markets and living in areas with low rainfall increased the risk of infection in cattle. For humans, the youngest age group had the highest risk, variations between ethnic groups, and frequent contact with livestock was a factor. These results show that Coella burnii is widespread in Kenya, but prevalence is relatively low. The study suggests that environmental factors play a role in cattle exposure, but human patterns are driven by contact with livestock.
Researchers have analyzed the genome of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, a type of blood fluke that causes schistosomiasis, a major neglected tropical disease. They identified 33 DEAD-box RNA helicases, a type of enzyme, in the parasite's genome. Three of these enzymes, Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3, are similar to Vasa, a protein found in germ cells of animals. Vasa is a marker of primordial germ cells in animals. The researchers found that Sm1, Sm2, and Sm3 are expressed in Schosoma's reproductive organs, particularly in the ovary where oocytes mature. This suggests that these genes could be used to track germ cells in the parasite. Germ cells are difficult to culture, making it hard to study the parasite's life cycle. However, this could be a way to develop new treatments. The study also found that Sm1, Sm, and Sm are in adult worms, eggs, miracidia, and sporocysts, with high expression in undeveloped eggs. This is important for understanding the parasite's life cycle and developing treatments.
Researchers have found that a protein called VGL4 plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of heart valves in the body. Heart valve disease is a major problem worldwide, and understanding how valves form and stay healthy is essential. V4 is a partner in a signaling pathway called Hippo, which is important for development and health of organs and tissues. However, its role in valve formation and maintenance was unknown. The study found that V4 is mainly in valve cells called interstitial at a certain stage of development and stays until adulthood. Removing V4 in specific cells showed that losing it in endothelial cells, which line blood vessels, led to abnormal valve formation and expression of a protein called YAP. Further study showed that removing Y in V4-deleted hearts restored normal valve formation. These findings suggest V4 is important for valve development and Hipp signaling could be a potential treatment for preventing congenital valve disease. The study found that losing V in endothelial cells resulted in abnormal valves and severe heart growth in mice, while removing Y rescued malformation caused by V deletion. The study shows V and Hipp signaling are required for proper valve development and maturation. The Hipp pathway in endothelial cells is necessary for post-development valve formation and maintenance. Precise regulation is needed for proliferation of cells and valve elongation. The study identifies a new function of V4 in development and maintenance. Findings suggest mutations in V may cause human heart valve disease. This is the first study showing the role of Hipp in valve development and maturation.
Recent studies have suggested that soft sweeps, a type of positive selection where beneficial mutations become fixed in a population, are common across various organisms, including humans, fruit flies, and viruses. However, other research has questioned the validity of these findings, arguing that sweeps are likely rare. This study re-examines three recent studies and their methods, using population theory and simulations. It finds that all three are prone to high false positives, incorrectly identifying sweeps under both hard and neutral models. Demographic histories combined with hard sweeps provide a more parsimonious explanation. This challenges the tendency to use complex models of positive selection, neglecting proper demographic models. The lack of testing and analysis led to inaccurate views of evolutionary processes and misleading answers to population genetics questions, suggesting a dominant role for selection in shaping variation. The claim of soft sweeps in humans is based on excess intermediate haplotype frequencies, relying on prior knowledge of fitness and demographic history. However, hard sweeps of weak mutations are classified as soft, and demographic models result in similar haplotype structures. Given non-equilibrium histories and rare beneficial mutations, sweeps are unlikely explanations. The examples span different population parameters, including humans, fruit flies, and viruses.
Researchers studied the behavior of female Aedes aegypt mosquitoes, which spread deng fever to millions of people each year. They found that after feeding on blood, these mosquitoes stop seeking hosts for three days due to a hormone called Peptide. But how Peptide works and the receptor it signals through were unknown. Peptide is similar to Neurope-F peptides, which control feeding behaviors and signal through Neurope Y-like receptors (NLR). The team found eight NLR in Ae aegypt and tested them against a panel of peptides. Four NLR responded to one or more ligands, but NLR1 responded to Peptide and Neurope-F. Two NLR homologs in the Lyme disease vector Ix scular were also sensitive to Peptide. Injecting synthetic Peptide and Ne-F inhibited host-seeking in non-fed mosquitoes, while buffer or inactive Pe had no effect. To see if NLR is needed for host-seeking, the team created N mutants and tested behavior. Mutants were normal in movement, egg-laying, feeding, feeding, and host-seeking, but not host-seeking after meal. The team identified four Ae aegi NLR and NLR as a candidate Neurope receptor sensitive to Peptide. However, NLR alone not required for host-seeking, suggesting other receptors, peptides, or both regulate this behavior.
Researchers in Nigeria used satellite imagery and spatial analysis to identify areas with suitable conditions for schistosomiasis transmission in Akure Local Government Area of Ondo State. They focused on temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use/cover as factors influencing schosiasis incidence. The study used multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and Sa's Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to map the importance of each schosias risk factor. Weighted analysis showed 82% of the area falls under high and very high risk, with one community (Ole) having the lowest risk and four others (ju, Igoba, It Oolu, Ogbese) having increased risk. Predictions correlated with field observations, with high zones corresponding to endemic communities. Environmental factors can be used to predict and monitor schosias transmission in rural areas.
Researchers have found that a bacterial toxin called pneumolys, produced by the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, plays a key role in causing damage to the brain during meningitis, a serious infection of the brain and spinal cord. The toxin disrupts the regulation of glutamate, a chemical messenger in the brain, leading to damage to synapses, the connections between brain cells. In a study of brain samples from people who died from pneumoccal meningitis, researchers found loss of synapses in the frontal cortex, a part of the brain. Similar damage was seen in mice with pneumoc meningitis when the bacteria produced the toxin pneumol. Exposure to the toxin in mouse brain slices caused permanent damage, including loss of dendrites and synapses. Blocking glutamate receptors reduced the damage. The toxin increased glutamate levels in the brain and triggered its release from astrocytes, a type of brain cell. The researchers propose that pneumol causes damage by releasing glutamate from astrotes, leading to damage to synapses. This is the first study to show synapse loss in pneumoc meningitis and that a bacterial toxin can disrupt glut regulation in the brain, causing damage.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a type of virus linked to several human cancers, and researchers are interested in developing new ways to prevent infection, such as vaccines and microbicides. To do this, they need a better understanding of the virus's life cycle. The HPV life cycle is closely tied to the state of the skin cells it infects, with new virus production happening in the final stages of cell differentiation. It's known that HPV first establishes infection in the lower layer of skin cells, but why this wasn't understood. One reason might be the specificity of entry receptors, but this doesn't fully explain the restriction of infection, as many cells can be infected in a single layer culture. Researchers used a chemical approach to reveal that cell progression through cell division is critical for HPV infection. They used HPV16 particles with a complete genome, synchronized human skin cells, and early gene expression as a sign of infection, and found that cells must enter the division phase for infection to happen. Late phase inhibitors had no effect, but G, S, G, and early phase inhibitors prevented infection. This means cells need to go through early division for successful transcription of HPV genes. This explains why HPVs establish in the lower layer of skin, as only these cells go through the cycle. This finding has implications for controlling HPVs.
Researchers have identified microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) in the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marnei, a common cause of systemic infections in China and Southeast Asia. These small RNAs play a crucial role in regulating gene expression in animals and plants, but their function in fungi was not well understood. The team used high-throughput sequencing to find milRN in mycelial and yeast phases of P. marnei and found 24 potential candidates, with 17 in mycel and 7 in yeast. Two genes, d-1 and d-2, encoding Dicer-like proteins, and q-2 encoding Argonaute, were identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed d-2 is closely related to homologs in other dimorphic fungi, suggesting co-evolution. Expression of d-2 was higher in mycel than yeast by 7-fold. Northern analysis confirmed two milRN, PMil-M and PMil-M, only in mycel. Knockout mutants showed biogenesis of mil dependent on d-2, not d-1 or q-. Targets of PMil-M were upregulated in knockdown PMilKD, supporting regulatory function of milRN.
Zika virus (ZIK) emerged in French Polynes in 2013 and spread through the Pacific between 2013 and 2017. Several Aedes mosquitoes may have contributed to ZIK transmission, including Aedes aegypt, the main vector in the region, and Aedes polynensis, vector of lymphatic filariasis and secondary vector deng virus. This study analyzed the ability of these vectors to transmit ZIK at a regional scale by comparing the competence of wild Ae. aegypt and Ae. polensis populations from Pacific islands for ZIK strain circulated during 2013-2017 outbreak. Field Ae.egypti (three) and Aepolensis (two) populations from Pacific were collected. Female mosquitoes were exposed to ZIK (107 TCID/mL) isolated in 2014. At 6, 9, 14, and 21 post-infection, mosquito bodies, thorax and abdomen, and heads were analyzed to measure infection, dissemination, rates, and transmission, respectively. Results showed ZIK infection rates were heterogeneous between Ae.egpt populations, but dissemination rates were moderate and homogenous between these. For Aeolensis, infection rates were less heterogeneous between two tested. Transmission and efficiency revealed low competence for ZIK of different Ae vectors. Results indicated low Z transmission by Ae.egpt and Aeolensis from Pacific. This was unexpected, suggesting other factors, such as vector density, lifespan, or immunologically naive fraction of population, contributed to rapid ZIK spread in Pacific during 201-2017.
Researchers have developed a new method called Targeted Structure-Seq to study the structure of non-coding RNA (nc) Xist, a key regulator of X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. This method combines chemical probing of RNA structure with massively parallel sequencing to provide high coverage of the target RNA with few reads, making it a targeted and scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells. They used Targeted-Seq to study the full-length Xist lncRNA and developed new models for functional elements within X, including the repeat element at the 5' end of X. The analysis also identified new structural elements in X that are evolutionarily conserved, such as an element proximal to the repeats that is important for X function. The study provides insight into the conformation of X and its role in gene regulation, and demonstrates the utility of Targeted-Seq to study lnc conformation in mammalian cells.
Researchers have identified many genetic variants linked to complex diseases, but it's unclear if using genomic profiles to predict risk will be useful. To evaluate the performance of genetic prediction models, new statistical measures are needed. Previous studies mainly used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to judge the value of genetic tests, but it has limitations and should be complemented by other measures. A new framework connects various predictive indices together, showing that given disease probability and heritability explained by variants, many metrics can be estimated, such as AUC, risk difference between cases and non-cases, net reclassification, proportion of cases at highest risk, variance of risks, and risk at any percentile. Graphs can visualize performance, like ROC, risk density, and predictiveness curves. Simulations match theoretical estimates. The framework is applied to nine diseases, evaluating predictive power of genetic tests on known variants.
Researchers have developed a new rapid diagnostic test for Trypanosoma brucei gambense infection, a parasite that causes African trypanosomiasis, a disease that affects 70 million people in sub-Saharan Africa. The test uses recombinant antigens, which are easier to produce than native antigens used in current tests. The study tested the new test in 57,632 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo and found it was most sensitive, detecting 71.2% of cases, compared to 62.5% for the current test and 59% for another test. The new test was also as specific, 98.1%, while the current test was 99.2%. Combining two tests increased sensitivity to 98.4% in passive screening and 83% in active. The new test was as sensitive as the current but less specific. The study suggests using two or more tests could enhance diagnostic algorithms, but decrease specificity.
Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of Latin Americans, has been effectively controlled in most of Guatemala through indoor insecticide spraying. However, a few areas with persistent Triatoma infestation remain. One such area is the municipality of Comapa in southeastern Guatemala, where control efforts have been less effective. Researchers conducted three surveys in Comapa to evaluate a decade of vector control activities. Baseline serological and entomological surveys in 1999 and 2002 were followed by three rounds of insecticide applications 2005 and intermittent spraying of infested houses until 201. Household inspections determined entom indices and materials in 200, 7, and 201. Serological surveys in school children 199, 200, and 201, and women of childbearing age 15-44 in 201. After spraying, infestation decreased from 39 to 27 and household materials predicted less than 10 infested houses. Chagas seropreval in children declined 10-fold from 10 to 1. However, serreval in women of child age remains over 10. A decade of control in Comapa shows reduced transmission, but continued risk for vector-borne and congenital transmission threatens the 202 Chagas elimination goal. Systematic control and Chagas screening for congen and vectororne disease are needed in regions with persistent infestation.
Citrobacterium is a natural pathogen that causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions in mice. It shares a virulence strategy with human pathogens Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) and is used to model pathogenesis. The complete genome of Citrobium ICC168 was previously sequenced, showing characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen. This study used PFGE sequencing, isolates variation, whole transcriptome analysis, and mobile elements to find the genome of Citium is unstable due to repeat-mediated large recombination and active transposition of prophages. An additional Citium strain EX-33 was sequenced, showing ICC168 is representative of the species and mutations likely occurred early in evolution. This parallels other pathogens, Citium is a recently evolved path that emerged with inbred mice as a human disease model.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework to analyze stochastic gene expression, which is the random fluctuations in protein levels across cells. Despite many theories explaining this phenomenon, there was no efficient way to infer the underlying mechanisms without assumptions. The new method infers biochemical rates of chromatin modification, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation from protein distributions. It asks if these rates can be estimated from expression without assumptions. The researchers derived analytical solutions for the first four moments of the distribution, found they capture the shape, and developed an efficient algorithm to infer constants from moments. The method finds most distributions consistent with many rate sets, but still informs the underlying mechanism. For example, it distinguishes between transcription bursting and constitutive production. It agrees with the standard method in its operating regime and identifies previously unobtainable rates. Without assumptions, it estimates 91% of rate constants or ratios, and all in some cases, all rates. This framework will help deduce molecular contributions to gene expression patterns.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine approach to protect against monkeypox, a disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPV). MPV is a neglected disease in rural areas of Africa and can be spread from animals to humans and humans. Smallpox vaccination protects against MPV, but the vaccination campaign ended in 1980, leaving many people unprotected. There are no approved treatments for MPV and current vaccines are limited due to safety concerns. A new study used a bovine herpesvirus 4 (Bo-4) vector to deliver MPV proteins to mice. The Bo-4 vectors expressed different MPV proteins and were tested for protection against a lethal MPV challenge in mice. The study found that Bo-4 vectors were safe and effective in protecting 100% and 80% of mice against mortality and morbidity. This shows the potential of Bo-4 as a vaccine platform for MPV.
Researchers have discovered that in trypanosomes, a type of parasite, use a unique enzyme called ApH phosphatase AL1 (AL1) to remove the cap from mRNA, a crucial step in mRNA degradation. Unlike other eukaryotes, trypanosomes lack the usual decapping complex, but still have 5-3' exonuclease. AL1 co-localizes with the 5-3 exonuclease to a granule at the cell's posterior, suggesting a connection between the two. Depleting AL1 is lethal and causes deadylated mRNAs that haven't started 5-3 decay, indicating AL acts downstream of deadenylation and upstream of degradation. Experiments show recombinant, N-terminally truncated AL1 sensitizes capped trypan spliced RNA to yeast X1, but only with 5' phosphatase included, indicating different decapping mechanism from D2. This is the first reported function of eukotic ApH phosphatase, a bacterial-derived enzyme present in all eukotic supergroups. The substrate of eotic ApH phosphat is unknown, but related bacterial ApH diadenine tetraphosphate is similar to eotic mRNA cap.
Researchers have discovered a new way to convert pancreatic cells that produce a hormone called glucagon into cells that produce insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. They found that by turning off a specific gene called Arx in these glucagon cells, they can be converted into insulin-producing cells. This process also triggers the growth of new cells in the pancreas that can become glucagon cells, which are then converted into insulin-producing cells. The study shows that Ar is the main trigger for this conversion and that it's possible to regenerate insulin-producing cells even in adults. This could lead to new treatments for diabetes, a condition caused by a lack of insulin-producing cells.
Eukaryotic cells have thousands of replication origins in their genome and must prevent initiation at most of them to maintain genome stability. To achieve this, they use multiple mechanisms that reduce the activity of replication proteins. It was thought that all origins were inhibited equally, but some initiate with different efficiencies when these mechanisms are disabled. This suggests an additional layer of control that can regulate initiation at distinct origins. Researchers found genetic elements necessary for preferential initiation of two origins and sufficient to confer preferential initiation on others when control is partially deregulated. These elements don't affect the timing or efficiency of adjacent origins, acting as initiation promoters (RIPs). The IPs are ∼60 AT-rich sequences that act in distance and sequence-dependent manner. During replication, Mc2 associates with origins that preferentially initiate and those that don't, indicating IPs can overcome the block to initiation imposed by Mc2 association. This identifies a local level of control to initiation. This control creates a complex landscape of replication potential that's revealed when global mechanisms are compromised. If replication contributes to alterations, as in cancer, some regions may be more susceptible than others.
Invasive amebias, caused by Entamoeba histolytica, is a growing problem among men who have sex with men (MSM) and those co-infected with HIV-1 in East Asian countries. Researchers studied 170 HIV-1-infected patients with amebias and found their clinical features were similar to those without HIV. Fever, high white blood cell count, and high C-reactive protein were linked to severe ameb diseases. Two patients died from ameb colitis and three from unrelated causes. Treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was successful in 165 cases. Luminal treatment after was given to 83, but amebis recurred in 6, similar to those without. Recurrence was more common in HCV-antib positive and those with syphilis. Various E histoly genotypes were found, but no link to clinical features or outcome. Metronidazole tinazole treatment was excellent for uncomplicated amebis in HIV-1 individuals. Lum treatment after did not prevent recurrence in high-risk groups due to re-infection.
In the Mandouli area of South Chad, a persistent focus of Gambian sleeping sickness, also known as African trypanosomiasis, has been a public health concern with around 100 cases diagnosed and treated annually until 2013. The disease is caused by Trypanosoma brucei and transmitted by tse flies. A global program aims to eliminate the disease as a public health problem by 2020 and stop transmission by 203. To assess whether adding tse control to detection and treatment could reduce transmission and incidence, a study was conducted. Before tse control, a census of the population was conducted and settlements mapped, and a pre-intervention of tse distribution was implemented. 260 targets were deployed in riverine habitats in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Impact on tse and incidence was assessed through monitoring and medical surveys in 2014 and 201. Modelling was used to assess the impact of tse control on incidence compared to active and passive screening. The study found a population of 74 inhabitants lived in the area. In 2013, the dominant tse species was Glossina fuscipes with a mean catch of 0.7 tse/trap. After deployment, the catch declined to 0.005se/trap. Modelling attributed 70.4% of the reduction in cases between 2013 and 201 to tse control and 62.8% of new infections to tse control and 8.5% to passive detection. Predictions anticipate elimination by 2018 if control and screening continue and virtually no transmission since 201.
Imported strongyloidiasis, a parasitic infection caused by the Strongyloides stercoralis worm, is increasingly being diagnosed in non-endemic areas, including Spain. A study of 124 cases registered in the +IV Spanish Collaborative Network from 2009-2017 found that most patients were immigrants from South America, with 66.9% of the total, and 82.2% had eosinophilia at diagnosis. Detection of larvae in stool samples was observed in 21.9% of patients, while serological tests made the diagnosis in the rest of cases. Treatment with ivermectin compared to albendazole was the most associated factor to achieve cure, with an odds ratio of 2.34. Given the long latency of infection and risk of severe presentation, screening for S. storalis should be mandatory in patients from or traveling to endemic areas, especially with immunosuppressed conditions.
Researchers have found that the amount of antigen or live pathogen used in a vaccine, known as the inoculum dose, plays a crucial role in how well the body responds to the vaccine. Higher doses can stimulate a stronger immune response but may cause more side effects and limit the number of people who can receive the vaccine during shortages. To find the right amount of inoculum, a combination of mathematical models and experimental data can be used. A study used data from mice infected with influenza virus and rats with parainfluenza virus at different inoculum doses to develop a model that maps inoculum to level of protection and morbidity. The framework can be used to determine the optimal inoculum for a vaccine. The study found that the impact of inoculum on protection and morbidity depends on the pathogen and protection and morbidity do not always increase with higher inoculum. The framework can help design vaccines and determine the right amount of inoculum for specific goals of protection and acceptable morbidity. A model was developed to predict the optimal inoculum for a vaccine using data from two experiments, influenza virus and parainfluenza. The framework can be applied to other vaccine candidates to efficiently determine the optimal dose. A generic model was used to explore the impact of inoculum on protection and morbidity, showing that more inoculum does not always lead to more protection. The study contributes to the development of a framework to rationally design vaccines and determine inoculum for any pathogen.
Researchers studied the expression of the HetR gene in Anaba filaments, a type of cyanobacteria, under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-poor conditions. HetR is a transcription factor essential for heterocyst differentiation. They used a chromosomally translational Het-gfp fusion to track Het expression at the individual cell level in wild-type and mutant filaments. Statistical analysis showed that Het fluctuations in nearby cells are coupled, with a characteristic range of two to three cells, setting the scale for cellular interactions along a filament. Correlations arise from intercellular molecular transfer and less from cell division. Under nitrogen-rich conditions, basal Het expression is influenced by Pat, a cell communication protein, and Het auto-regulation. Under nitrogen-poor conditions, fluctuations build on those under rich conditions. The study highlights differences between Het inhibitors Pat and Het, as well as sept proteins Sep and Fra/Fra. Activation and cell communication are key to developmental processes. The results show proteins combine to control fluctuations in gene expression, giving a one-dimensional pattern in the organism.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype has shifted from genotype III (GIII) to I (GI) in China, as shown by molecular surveillance data. To confirm this shift at the seroepidemiological level, a serosurvey was conducted in non-vaccinated pigs, revealing an average ratio of GI/GIII of 1.87, indicating co-circulation of both genotypes with GI being more prevalent. To understand the reasons behind this shift, the replication of seven recently-isolated JEV isolates, including three GI and four GIII strains, was compared in C/36 cells, chicken fibroblast (DF-1) and porine artery endothelial (PIE) cells. GI strains replicated more efficiently than GIII in DF-1 and PIE cells, particularly in DF-1 with titers 22.9-225.3 higher than GIII. This suggests enhanced replication of GI in avian cells. In vivo, young ducklings were used as a model and inoculated with GI and GIII at 2 post-hatching. GI-inoculated ducklings showed higher viremia and longer vmic duration than GIII-inoculated. These results support the hypothesis of enhanced efficiency for GI in birds. There are 36 amino differences between GI and GIII, which may be responsible for the replication of GI in birds. The findings suggest that enhanced replication of GI in birds leads to higher exposure and infection in mosquitoes, increasing transmission in the birds-mosquito-bird cycle, contributing to JEV shift.
Researchers studied the genetic network of transcription factors that regulate biofilm formation in Candida albicans, a fungus that causes disease in humans. They created all possible double-mutant versions of the six genes in the network and measured how they affected biofilm formation. The results showed the network is sensitive to genetic changes, with six mutants altering biofilm formation and many as severe as single-gene deletions. The network is a "small-world" network, efficient but not robust, meaning small changes can have big effects. The study found Tec1 is sensitive to changes in other transcription factors and Rob1 is regulated by itself and other factors. Ndt80 deletion affects biofilm and hypha formation in a Tec1-dependent way. The research provides insights into individual transcription factors and the network's role in biofilm formation.
Researchers studied the enzyme asparagine synthase A (AS) in Leishmania infant, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis, a disease. AS converts aspartate to asparagine using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source. There are two types of AS: one that uses ammonia and one that uses glutamine. AS is absent in humans but present in trypanosomatids, making it a potential drug target. A previous study found AS was essential in Leish donani, a related parasite, making it a promising target. However, this study found that Leish infant AS can use both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen sources. They created AS mutants by replacing the gene in Leish infant and found no significant growth or infectivity defects. Only under aspar limiting conditions, growth was severely impaired. This suggests AS is not essential for parasite survival or infectivity in normal conditions, making it not a suitable drug target.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between toxocariasis and epilepsy. The study included 11 case-control studies from 13 countries with a total of 474 participants, 215 with epilepsy and 259 without. The pooled odds ratio (OR) was 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.01) for the association between toxocari seropositivity and epilepsy. A positive association was found in restricted analysis of Western blot confirmatory test, population, and population-based studies. Meta-regression showed no significant association between covariates and outcome. The meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between toxari seropitivity and epilepsy, mainly supported by population studies. Health strategies to reduce toxara spp are advised. Further research is needed to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of toxara-associated epileptogenesis.
Researchers have discovered a new way that cells respond to DNA damage caused by radiation. When cells are exposed to radiation, a protein called ATM is activated, which leads to the downregulation of a microRNA called mi-335. This microRNA targets a protein called CtIP, which is important for a type of DNA repair called homologous recombination repair (HRR). The researchers found that a protein called CREB is responsible for most of the mi-335 expression, and that radiation reduces CRE's activity by phosphorylating it. When mi-335 is overexpressed in cells, Ct levels decrease and cells are more likely to die after radiation. In some cancer cells with a "radiosensitive" phenotype, mi335 is high, Ct is low, and BRCA foci are reduced. Treating these cells with a microRNA that blocks mi335 rescues colony survival, BRCA foci, and Ct levels. This suggests that an ATM-dependent CRE-mi-335-Ct axis influences the choice of DNA repair for certain damage.
Researchers investigated how people's ability to attribute mental states, such as beliefs and emotions, to others affects learning in social interactions. They created a game where participants played against artificial agents with varying levels of mentalizing sophistication, or the ability to think about others' thoughts. Participants believed they were either playing against other people or in a casino, but results showed they performed better against sophisticated agents in the social framing and worse in the non-social. This suggests mentalizing enhances learning in social interactions. The study shows that deciphering behavior requires attributing mental states to others. 

The researchers drew from economics and psychology studies on sophisticated mental processes, such as persuasion and deception, which involve recursive thinking like "I think you think I think...". They extended cognitive models to repeated games with Bayesian recognition of others' intentions. Results support the idea social learning relies on specific processes predicting others' behavior. In the social context, priors involve mentalizing others' beliefs, leading to recursive updates. The "social brain hypothesis" suggests our brain assumes others are also Bayesian, implying mentalizing involves updating beliefs from observing others' behavior. The task information is the same in both framings, but social framing induces mentalizing and recursive inference, while non-social relies on general heuristics vulnerable to artificial agents.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called FastGM to efficiently infer Gaussian graphical models in biological networks. These models help analyze relationships between many variables, like genes or proteins, to understand diseases. Current methods are either not accurate or too slow for large datasets with thousands of variables. The new algorithm, based on a 2015 proposal, is faster by several orders of magnitude without losing accuracy. Simulations showed this. It was applied to asthma and Alzheimer's disease data, creating networks for healthy and diseased samples. The results revealed interesting interactions and differences between cases and controls, relevant to the diseases. The algorithm is computationally fast and statistically sound for high-dimensional biological data. It's implemented in an R package called FastGM.

Researchers studied how the striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) network in the brain responds to changing activity from the cortex, the outer layer of the brain that sends signals to the striatum. They found that the MSN network has an optimal balance between being too stable and too unstable. If the connections between MSN are too strong, the network becomes too stable and only a few cells respond to changes in the cortex. If the connections are too weak, the network is too unstable and cells don't respond consistently. However, at a certain level of connectivity, the MSN network responds well to changes in the cortex, creating patterns that last for hundreds of milliseconds. This is important for learning and executing movements. The study used a simple model of the MSN network and found that it can create assemblies of cells that fire together in response to a stimulus, as seen in real brain activity. They also showed that the MS network can transform cortical input in a complex way, making it harder to predict. The study suggests that the MSN network is optimized to respond to changes in the cortex in a way that is neither too stable nor too unstable, but just right for learning and movement.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the protein Sec4 in yeast cells, which is involved in both exocytosis and endocyt. Exocyt is the process of transporting components to specific locations on the cell surface, while endyt is the retrieval of these components before they can diffuse away. Sec4 is a GTPase that couples exocyt with actin polymerization, which induces endyt. After exoc to the plasma membrane, Sec4 binds to actin subunits and promotes their assembly. Mutations in Sec4 or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec2 inhibit actin formation, while activating Sec4 accelerates assembly. In vitro assays, Sec4 overcomes Sla inhibition of Lasp-dependent actin nucleation. This suggests Sec relocates along the membrane from exytic sites to endytic sites, promoting actin polymer and compensatory endyt, which controls cell expansion and refines polarization.

In addition to exyt, Sec4 also regulates endyt: it transiently localizes to endytic sites, disrupts actin assembly, interacts with Lasp, and induces Arp/3-dependent actin polymerization. Sec and Sec2 have a specific role in actin assembly, and their temporal and spatial relationship with Lasp suggests a direct interaction. Sec might be involved in endyt apart from exyt. In yeast, exytic and endytic sites overlap, and maintenance depends on both exyt and endyt. Sec4 also regulates actin assembly and endytic internalization, co-localizing with actin subunits S1, Lasp, and Abp.
Acetamin-induced liver injury in mice is a widely used model for drug-induced liver injury in humans. Researchers have made progress in understanding the molecular events and pathways involved, but a key question remains: how and why liver cells die in a specific pattern, starting from the center of the liver lobule and moving outward. One theory, the NQI zonation hypothesis, suggests that differences in the formation of a toxic metabolite, NQI, within the liver lobules are necessary and sufficient to explain this pattern. To test this, researchers created a virtual liver model that mimics the liver's anatomy and biology. The model showed that NQ formation alone is not enough to explain the pattern of cell death. They then added two features to the model: a decrease in glutathione in the center of the liver and a decrease in ability to repair damage in the center. With both features, the model successfully replicated the pattern of cell death. This merged mechanism provides a detailed explanation of how acetamin-induced liver injury in mice works and can explain why different strains of mice react differently to the same dose of acetamin.
Researchers studied how to improve the early diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in babies born to infected mothers. Currently, diagnosis relies on detecting parasites in the blood or specific antibodies at 10-12 months old. They measured parasite levels in 51 congenitally infected children at 3 times: 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year after birth. Infants with high parasite levels were diagnosed by microscopy at 1 month, while those with lower levels required a second test at 6 months. Babies with undetectable parasites by microscopy were diagnosed by antibodies at 1 year, but had low parasite levels at 6 and 12 months. Parasites were isolated from 19 children, mostly from a specific lineage. This is the first study to quantify parasite levels in over 50 congenitally infected children. Results show some babies had parasite levels below detection limit of microscopy. Current treatment is effective, but more sensitive methods are needed for early diagnosis. The study correlated parasite levels with antibodies and genotyped parasites to understand congenital transmission and improve diagnosis.
Researchers have developed a simplified model of E. coli, a type of bacteria, to understand how its growth and composition are affected by the number of copies of a specific gene called the rRNA operon. The model assumes the bacteria are growing in a constant environment with plenty of resources. They applied the model to data from experiments where the growth and rRNA-to-protein ratio were measured in seven E. coli strains with different r operon copy numbers, ranging from one to seven, the normal number. The results showed that growth decreased in strains with fewer copies. The model reproduced these results and suggested that the volume of molecules inside E. coli doesn't change with r operon number variation. It also predicted that increasing copies beyond seven leads to a crowded cytoplasm with ribosomes and proteins, which weakens binding affinities and doesn't increase growth. The model suggests that changing r operon number in normal E. coli in a constant environment doesn't increase growth. Other observations, like nucleoid compaction and r operon feedback, are consistent with the model. The model proposes principles and suggests further experiments to test its validity.
Arabidopsis MYB protein R1 (RSM) plays a crucial role in seed germination and seedling development in response to abscisic acid (ABA) and salinity. Previous studies suggest R1 may be involved in plant development, stress, and hormone signaling, but the mechanisms of R1 action to abiotic stresses are unclear. Researchers found that down-regulation or upregulation of R1 alters sensitivity of seed germination and cotyledon greening to ABA, NaCl, and mannitol in Arabidopsis. The expression of R is dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl. Transcription factors ELONG HYCOTYL5 (HY) and HYHOMOLOG (HY) regulate R via binding to R promoter. Genetic analyses reveal R mediates multiple functions of HY in seed germination, post-germination to ABA and abiotic, and seedling to salinity. Pull-down and Bi assays show R interacts with HYHY in vitro and vivo. R and HY may function as a module in responses A and abiotic. R binds ABI5 promoter, regulating its expression, while R also stimulates HY binding ABI. However, no evidence supports R enhances activation ABI by HY. HY and R may converge ABI promoter independently or dependently regulate ABI and ABI-down A and stress genes, improving plant adaptation to environment.
Mitochondrial complex I, the largest and most complex proton pump in the respiratory chain, links electron transfer from NAD to ubiquinone to pumping four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space. In humans, defects in complex I are involved in a range of degenerative disorders. Recent X-ray analysis of prokary and eukotic complex confirmed red reactions are confined to hydrophil peripheral of L-shaped molecule and take distance from membrane. This implies proton pumping within membrane of I is driven indirectly via long conformation coupling, but mechanism, number, identity, and localization of pump sites unclear. Researchers deleted gene for small subunit of complex I, a stable sub (nbmΔ) formed, lacking dist part of membrane domain. Analysis of subunit composition of holo and sub by proteomics revealed two subunits (ND4 and 5) with homology to bacterial Na+/H antiporters missing in nbm. Despite this, nb still pumps protons at stoichi of complete enzyme. Results show membrane of I harbors two distinct pump modules connected by long helical element identified by X-ray analysis.
Researchers investigated how fever affects the binding of antibodies to malaria and deng antigens in the body. They used a technique called Isothermal calorimetry to measure the strength of the bond between antibodies and antigens at different temperatures, including 37°C, 40°C, and 42°C. They found that at 40°C, the bond between antibodies and antigens was stronger than at the normal body temperature of 37°C or the higher temperature of 42°C. This suggests that fever may help the body fight off infections by making antibodies bind more strongly to the antigens. The researchers also found that if the proteins were allowed to adjust to the temperature for a while before measuring, the bond was even stronger. This could be important for understanding how the body's immune system works and how to improve tests for diseases like malaria.
Researchers have studied how cells control the flow of a protein network called the actomyosin cortex, which is important for cell shape and movement. This network is made up of actin filaments and myosin motors, which produce force and resist deformation. To keep flowing, the network must be remodeled by breaking and reforming links between filaments. The study used a computer model to see how force and dissipation depend on motor activity, link dynamics, and filament turnover. They found that filament turnover is needed to keep stress against resistance and steady flow. Stress increases with filament lifetime up to a point, then decreases. Viscosity increases with lifetime up to a point, then becomes independent of lifetime and depends on link dynamics. These dependencies define different flow states. When filaments are short, flow is not affected by turnover and depends on motor and link dynamics. This study helps understand how cells control flow by remodeling the network.
Researchers have identified a gene in Arabidopsis thalian that makes seedlings insensitive to high sugar levels of glucose and fructose. This gene, called GS11, was found in a population of Arabidopsis plants and confirmed in near-isogenic lines. The GS11 gene encodes a transcription factor called AN060, which is part of the NAC family. The AN060 allele makes seedlings insensitive to sugar, while the C allele makes them sensitive. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in AN060 affects its splicing, creating a stop codon and a truncated protein without a transmembrane domain. This version of AN060 is found in 12% of natural Arabidopsis accessions. Glucose induces GS11/AN060 expression, which requires abisic acid (ABA) signaling. ABI4 binds to the GS11AN060 promoter to activate transcription. AN060 reduces ABA sensitivity and ABA accumulation, and ABI expression is also reduced in AN060 lines. The sugar-ABA cascade induces AN060, but the truncated AN060 protein attenuates ABA signaling, making seedlings insensitive.
Researchers have discovered how the molecule c-di-G (cyclic guanosine monophosphate) signaling pathway works in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of bacteria, to control its behavior. c-G is a second messenger molecule that helps bacteria switch from swimming to forming communities called biofilms. The team found that c-G synthase enzyme, called Hsb, interacts with the Hpt pathway, which controls biofilm formation, motility, and other behaviors in P. aeruginosa. They showed that H controls biofilm and motility by working with H and an anti-sigma factor H. The interaction between H and H allows H to control its location at the cell poles. This helps c-G signaling be specific, avoiding unwanted effects on other behaviors. The researchers also found that H and Sad, another c synth, have different effects on biofilm and motility, suggesting they act at different points in the c-G network. They propose that H acts at the cell poles and that H and Sad work together in a hierarchical order in the G/R cascade, which helps biofilm formation.
Researchers investigated how people learn to associate visual shapes with motor responses, such as pointing to a target on a screen. They found that people can learn multiple associations between shapes and motor responses, but it's not clear how they generalize to new, similar shapes. In the study, participants pointed to targets on a screen with varying shapes that morphed from circular to spiky. The shapes were associated with different motor responses, such as pointing left or right. Participants were trained on a subset of shape-motor pairs and then tested on new shapes. The relationship between shape and motor response was always linear. After training, participants were tested without feedback on shapes not seen before. A model predicted that people would use the most similar shape to the current one learned, which was confirmed. The model also predicted learning slows with more pairs, which was also found. The results match the model, suggesting it's a possible mechanism for learning multiple shapeotor mappings.
Researchers studied how climbing fibers, one of the two main inputs to the cerebellum, transmit information from the inferior olivary nucleus. Climbing fibers are believed to be involved in timing motor commands and learning. They cause large action potentials in cerebellar Purkin cells, silencing them for a brief time. Previous studies showed that climbing fibers can transmit bursts of spikes, potentially increasing information transfer to the cerebell. The researchers used a model of an inferioriv cell to investigate what determines the size of the climbing burst. They found that the phase of the burst is related to the subthreshold oscillation of the olary cell, but only in a limited range. Charge between the soma and dendrite is a major determinant of the burst. This suggests that phenomena like cell synchrony can affect the burst through dendritic junctions between olary cells.
Researchers have created a detailed computational model of how the liver regulates iron levels in the body. Iron is essential for life, but too much of it can be toxic. The liver plays a key role in controlling iron levels, and misregulation is linked to many diseases. A new understanding of iron's fate in the body has led to a map of its metabolism, but how its components interact to regulate it is unclear. The model includes core components and regulatory mechanisms, based on known properties from publications. It was validated by comparing results with published data and recreated multiple findings. A simulation of iron intake matched a clinical study's dynamics. A disease simulation of hereditary hemochromatosis was created by altering a reaction, mimicking a human mutation. The model provides insight into liver overload in this disease. It supports the liver's role as an iron sensor and a framework for further modeling to identify targets and design experiments.
Researchers have created a computer model to simulate how molecules move in and out of the cell's nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC). The NPC is like a gate that controls what enters and leaves the nucleus, and it's crucial for cell function. The model takes into account the interactions between proteins called karyopherins and FG repeat domains, which are important for transport. The simulation shows that it takes about 2.6 milliseconds for a 15 nanometer-sized molecule to pass through, and it sticks to the wall of the NPC as it goes through. The interaction between karyin and FG is dynamic and fast, allowing for efficient transport. Almost all binding sites on kary are used during transport. Without filaments, the NPC is more permeable to molecules, showing their role in selectivity.
Researchers have developed a new method to determine the optimal dose of a pathogen for non-human primate (NHP) models, which are commonly used to test interventions against human diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The goal is to find a dose that infects 50% of the animals, called the ID50. This method minimizes the number of animals and resources needed while providing an accurate estimate of the ID50 within 1.5-fold of the true value. The traditional method involves iterative exposure of cohorts of animals to a dilution of the pathogen, adjusting the dose between rounds to achieve 50% infection. However, this requires understanding of the relationship between probability of infection and dose, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. The new method, called "parsimonious determination," uses a smaller number of animals, 15-25, and 3-5 rounds, to estimate the ID50 within 40% of the true value. It is generalizable to any pathogen and animal model, but critical for NHP due to ethical and economic constraints.
Researchers studied how the auditory neuron AN2 in crickets adapts to changing sound stimuli. They found that the neuron's response to sound intensity increases over time, with a time constant of 1.5 seconds, and decreases for low-intensity sounds. The team tested whether this adaptation improves signal representation and compared it to two theories: infax, which maximizes information about the entire signal, and selective, which enhances foreground and suppresses background signals. They presented signals with two or three peaks in amplitude, which infax and selective predict conflicting changes. Using Bayesian analysis, they measured response shifts and found slight decreases in slopes and higher thresholds than infax predicted. Contrary to infax, adaptation reduces information for the whole signal. The response also doesn't match selective, as loudest signal information doesn't increase but remains constant. Less is transmitted for lower-intensity signals.

The study explored properties of a single neuron in the cricket's auditory pathway and tested two principles: infax and selective. Adaptation times in crickets range from 100ms to 10 seconds. This study reports 1-second adaptation in AN2, not seen before. The first stage's task is to maintain and condense information for object recognition. Several adaptation scales are observed, similar to vertebrates and other senses.

The team designed stimuli with two or three peaks, mimicking scenes with multiple signals. Principles predict conflicting changes for more than one signal. Optimal selective shifts response to highest intensity, infax maximizes information.
Researchers studied how a protein called prion, which is linked to a brain disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, interacts with other proteins in the brain. They found that a part of the prion, called the polybasic domain, helps it bind to other prions and spread the disease. To see if this was true for the whole prion, not just a piece of it, they made prions without the poly domain and tested them in a lab. Surprisingly, these prions without the poly domain could still bind to other prions and make them spread, but they were less likely to cause the disease. This shows that prions can interact with other proteins in different ways, not just one way, and that the poly domain might be needed for the disease to happen.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify the strategies animals use to control their behavior in certain situations. This is important for understanding how animals make decisions and how their nervous system processes information. The method, called inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), was applied to the behavior of C. elegans, a type of worm, in a temperature-controlled environment. The worms were either fed or starved, and placed on a temperature gradient. The IR approach showed that fed worms used both the temperature and its change over time, using two strategies: directed migration (DM) to reach a specific temperature and isothermal (IM) to track a constant temperature. Starved worms used only the temperature, not its change, to escape. The researchers also looked at the neural basis of these strategies by applying the method to worms without thermosensory neurons. The IR-based approach can identify strategies from behavioral data and be applied to various studies, including decision-making in other organisms.
Scientists have sequenced the genome of Chrychromina tobin, a type of algae that plays a crucial role in aquatic ecosystems. Algae are important for absorbing carbon, forming harmful blooms, and serving as a food source for various species. They dominate fresh and marine waters due to their mixotrophic nature. The Chrychromina tobin genome is small, compact, with 40% coding for proteins and 16,777 genes. Genes related to fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct patterns over a 24-hour light-dark cycle. The genome harbors a hybrid polyketide synth/non-ribosomal synthase complex, anti-microbial peptides, and proteins for multidrug and toxic compound extrusion. A new algae xanthorhodin and two RuBisCOases were identified, shared across algal lineages. The Chrychromina tobin genome provides information on evolutionary, ecological, and economic importance of algae.
Researchers have found that breast cancers that lack the markers ESR1, PGR, and HER2 are often belong to the Basal molecular subtype, which is associated with defective BRCA1 and p53 pathways. Studies in mice show that inactivating both BR1 and p53 pathways can suppress cell death in the mammary gland, and concomitantly inactivating all three pathways in the mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant metastatic adenocarcinomas. These tumors are poorly differentiated and have features common with human BRCA-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene analysis shows they share attributes of Bas-like and Claudin-low signatures, two subtypes of the broader triple-negative class defined by clinical markers. p53 is mutated in 20-30% of human breast cancers and defective pathways increase breast cancer risk. Nearly all Bas-like cancers with BR1 have conitant p mutation. BR1 mutation predisposes early breast cancers that are triple-negative and correlate with Bas-like in microarray. Mouse models that mimic TNBC will be tools for defining cellular behavior and triaging new candidates. Bas-like cancers inactivate three tumor suppressors infamous for roles in cancers: RB, p53, and BR1.
Researchers studied the population of Aedes aegypt, the primary vector of deng virus, in rural Kampha Phet, Thailand. They wanted to understand how to control the mosquito population and prevent deng transmission. They found that Aegypt develops in artificial water containers and most adults don't travel far from where they were born. Containers in areas with many other containers are more likely to be used for laying eggs and produce more mosquitoes than isolated ones. The study looked at 84,840 water containers from 2004-2007 and used regression modeling to see how larval site density, access to piped water, and season affected mosquito production. They found that the number and density of larval sites and containers were key to Aegpt abundance. Productivity increased with more containers in an area. Accounting for site density is important for predicting Aeg population and control.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called TORC2 plays a crucial role in how the nematode worm C. elegans responds to its environment and food. This protein helps the worm decide whether to grow or enter a dormant stage called dauer. TOR2 acts in the intestine to send signals to the brain about the worm's feeding status. It does this by controlling the expression of two genes, daf-7 and d-28, which reflect the amount of bacteria in the worm's food. This allows the worm to make decisions based on both internal and external cues. In the adult stage, TOR2 also helps regulate foraging behavior through a different signaling pathway. The study found that genetic variation in TOR2 affects the worm's traits and identified genes linked to these traits. This suggests that TOR2 acts as a hub for gut-to-brain communication, influencing brain function based on the worm's state.
Researchers have identified specific DNA sequences that control the behavior of embryonic stem cells, which have the ability to develop into any cell type. These sequences, called cis-regulatory elements, were found in mouse and human embryonic stem cells. They are involved in gene expression, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. A new algorithm, Compoby, was developed to identify these sequences by combining aligned and non-aligned genome data. Compoby found conserved motifs in upregulated genes in pluripotent cells. These motifs are active in undifferentiated embryonic and germ cells and act as enhancers with endogenous promoters. Importantly, their activity is conserved in human cells. A transcription factor, NF-Y, binds to one motif and is differentially expressed during cell differentiation and required for cell proliferation. This study provides insights into transcriptional networks of pluripotent cells. The approach can be applied to mammalian species.
Scientists have studied the structure of a complex made up of two proteins from the vesicular stomatitis virus, a type of virus. This complex is necessary for the virus to replicate its genetic material, a single-stranded RNA. The complex is made of two proteins, nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P). The researchers created a version of N without its first 21 amino acids and a 60 amino acids of P that binds to RNA-free N. They crystallized this complex and solved its structure at a resolution of 3.0 angstroms. This showed how the part of P binds to N and competes with RNA polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR experiments confirmed this binding and showed flexible regions of P. The structure suggests how the virus starts RNA synthesis and encapsulates new RNA.
Researchers studied how the fly's visual system processes motion using a network of cells called the vertical system. This network is unique because its cells primarily communicate with each other through electrical synapses, or gap junctions, rather than traditional chemical synapses. By analyzing a realistic model of this network, they found that within 10 milliseconds of visual input, the presence of gap junctions enables the system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation, or direction, of the fly's motion. This efficiency is near-optimal, or as good as it can be, given the physical limits of the visual input. The network is connected to downstream pathways through a subset of cells, and they found that gap junctions make this subset encode motion more efficiently than the whole network, and is robust to noise. This efficient encoding is necessary for the fly's visually guided behaviors, such as sharp turns. Gap junctions only affect the system's output, not input, suggesting neural circuits may be more complex than previously thought. The study shows how specific connectivity leads to efficient sensory encoding.
Enterovirus 71 (EV) is a major causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease, a common fever in children, and has been associated with neurological diseases, including fatal cases in large outbreaks in the Asia region. Researchers identified human-select glycoprotein ligand-1 (PS-1) as a receptor for entry and replication of EV in leukocytes. PS-1 is expressed on the surface of leukocytes and serves as a counterceptor for selectins, mediating leukocyte rolling on endothelium. The PS-1-select interaction requires sulfation of at least three tyrosines and O-glycan sial Lewis in N-terminal of PS-1. To elucidate the basis of PS-1-EV interaction, researchers generated PS- mutants and identified post-transl modifications critical for PS binding to EV. They expressed PS mutants in 293 cells and transfected cells were assayed for abilities to bind EV by flow cytometry. Results showed O-gly on T, critical for PS-select interaction, is not necessary for PS binding to EV. On the other hand, site-directed mutagenesis one or more tyrosine sulf sites in N-terminal PS significantly impaired PS binding to EV. Inhibitor of sulf, sodium, blocked PS-EV interaction and PS-mediated replication in Jurkat cells in dose-dependent manner. The study reveals tyros sulf, not Oly, in N-terminal PS may facilitate entry and replication EV in leukocytes.
Researchers have found that inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) can be effective in treating leishmanias, a serious health problem affecting many people worldwide. Current treatments for leishiasis can be toxic and lead to resistant strains, making them ineffective in the long run. In this study, three mTOR inhibitors, rapamycin, G-645, and K-379, were tested on mice infected with Leish major. The results showed that a clinically relevant dose of rapycin or G-645, but not K-379, reduced foot swelling and parasite load in the lymph node. Importantly, rapycin did not kill the parasite in vitro. The treatment also reduced IL-4 production and increased IFN-γ:IL-4 ratio, indicating a T1-skewed cytokine profile. CD69 expression on T cells was enhanced in rapycin-treated mice. The findings suggest that select m inhibitors may be used for leishias management, with beneficial effects from immunomodulatory properties.
Scientists have studied how bacteria called Neisseria take in DNA from their environment and change their genes. This process, called transformation, helps create genetic diversity and spread genes between bacteria. To avoid unwanted changes, Neisser prefer to take their own DNA, marked with a specific sequence called DUS. Researchers found a protein called Com is the main receptor for D in Neisser species. They tested how Com affects transformation with and found it's essential for taking in D and without it. The inner bases of D are crucial, while outer ones are less important. Some naturally occurring D variants in human Neisser species, differing by one or two bases, are impaired for transformation in Neisser meningidis. A similar mechanism is used by all Neisser species to promote their own or related DNA. This study sheds light on the first step of transformation and reveals a way to control gene transfer between bacteria in the same niche.
In the process of cell division in yeast, a contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and septum formation are crucial for cell separation. Researchers have identified many CAR proteins, but how they interact with septum enzymes to form septum is unclear. A study in yeast shows cooperation between Pxl, a protein required for ring integrity, and B1, enzyme for septum formation, is essential for CAR anchorage to the plasma membrane before division and furrow formation. Without Pxl and B1, ring fails to contract and cell grows towards the lumen without septum. Pxl concentration at CAR increases during cytokinesis and depends on the SH domain of protein C15. B1 depletion in cells with C15SH allele causes ring disassembly and sept block, as in P1 lacking cells. Absence of P1 is lethal when C15 function is affected, causing CAR sliding with septum material along cell cortex. Findings indicate CAR anchorage through C15 and Pxl, and conitant B1 activity are necessary for CAR and septum formation in yeast. B1 and P1 cooperate to maintain CAR position and integrity during cytokinesis, and are essential for septum synthesis. In yeast, temporary R1 inactivation is required for septum formation. P1 increases R1 activity, impeding septum upon B1 repression in P1 cells. Results suggest C15 through SH and P1 cooperates with B1 to confer stability to CAR and form septum during cytokinesis.
Researchers investigated a recent outbreak of glanders, a highly infectious disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia malle, in Bahrain. They used high-resolution genotyping and whole-genome sequencing to analyze samples from infected horses and a camel, and compared them to samples from a 2004 outbreak in the United Arab Emirates. The results showed that the Bahrain outbreak was caused by two different B. malle strains, suggesting multiple introductions. The strains from Bahrain were closely related to B. malle from horses in the UAE in 2004, indicating repeated importation from similar sources. High-resolution genotyping and whole-genome analysis revealed the same phylogenetic patterns among samples. The relationship between Dubai/UAE B. malle populations may indicate a shared geographic origin yet to be identified. The emergence of glanders with horse trading poses a new risk for human infections.
American cutaneous leishmanias (ACL) is a disease that affects about 67,000 people every year. The severity of the disease depends on the parasite species, but most cases are not confirmed. The World Health Organization recommends Leishmania brazili as the first treatment, using pentavalent ant derivatives like Glucime or Stiboglucon. However, these treatments show a 75% healing rate, and reasons for failure are unknown. A study of 43 patients who didn't respond to Glime was conducted in Colombia. Clinical, parasitological, and epidemiological data were recorded. Parasites were confirmed by histopath and PCR. Glime IC50 and infectivity were estimated. Leish brazili was the main species (95.4%) and 35% showed decreased susceptibility. Lesion size and infectivity were negatively correlated with Glime (r=-0.548 and r=-0.726). Le brazili was associated with treatment failure or relapse. A second treatment is discussed for Leish braz with pentant derivatives.
Researchers studied the relationship between two biosynthetic pathways in Escheria coli that produce small molecules called siderores and genotoxin. These molecules are important for the bacteria's survival and virulence. The pathways require an enzyme called 4-phosphantin transferase (PT). Two PTases, Ent and Clb, have been identified. Ent is part of the bacteria's core genome, while Clb is encoded on a pathogenic island called pks. This island is associated with a high pathogenic island (H) in some virulent E. coli strains. H carries genes for yiniact synthesis, but not its PTase. The researchers investigated if Clb could contribute to siderore synthesis. They found Clb can. Inactivating both Ent and Clb abolished virulence in a mouse model. Either functional Ent or Clb was needed for survival. This is the first report of multiple PTases leading to distinct metabolites in a microorganism. They hypothesize pks association with H is due to Clb's ability to synthesize genoto and siderores. The study highlights complex interaction between virulence features and functions. Identifying these points is crucial for understanding virulence and developing anti-vir strategies.
Researchers have developed a new probabilistic model for phylogenetic inference that accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions. This model, called probabilistic phylogenetic inference with insertions and deletions, is based on a continuous Markov process and a non-reversible birth-death evolutionary model for insertions and deletions. The model assumes that insertions and deletions occur one residue at a time. The researchers applied this model to phylogenetic inference by extending the program dnaml in phyl, a widely used tool for phylogenetic inference. They tested the new model on simulated data and real ribosomal RNA alignments and found that it improved accuracy compared to ignoring gaps while retaining the efficiency of the Felsen peeling algorithm. The Felsen peeling algorithm is a fast method for calculating the probability of a multiple alignment given a phylogenetic tree and evolutionary model, but it only accounts for substitutions, not insertions and deletions. The new model is a step towards integrating evolutionary modeling into probabilistic models used in other sequence analysis, such as hidden Markov models and stochastic context-free grammars, which already account for insertions and deletions.
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infects the skin through mucous membranes before entering nerve endings. In the skin, epidermal Langerh cells (LCs) are the first dendritic cells (DCs) to encounter HSV, but it's CD103 dermal DCs that carry viral antigen to lymph nodes for presentation, suggesting cross-talk in the skin. This study compared topically HSV-1 infected human skin explants with biops of initial genital herpes to show LCs initially emigrate into the dermis, forming clusters with BD3+ dermal DCs and DC-S+ macrophages. HSV-expressing LC fragments were inside dermal DC/macrophages and BD3 dermal DC upregulated damaged uptake receptor CLEC9. No epidermal cells interacted with dermal DCs. LC isolated from skin infected with HSV-1 in vitro underwent apoptosis and were taken by BD3 dermal DC and DC-S cells. A viral relay takes place where infected LCs undergo apoptosis and are taken by dermal DC for antigen presentation. This provides rationale for targeting these cells with mucosal or intradermal immunization.
Researchers studied how Leishmania parasites, a type of parasite that causes leishmaniasis, interact with host cells called macrophages in the body. They compared how two types of Leish parasites, L. major and L. amazonensis, and how they form structures called parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) inside macrophages. PVs are like bubbles that form around the parasite and help it survive inside the cell. The study used special imaging to look at live cells and see how PVs form and change over time. They found three main differences between L. major and L. amazon PVs: L. major PVs are small and hold one or two parasites, while L. amazon PVs are big and hold many parasites. They also found that L. amazon PVs change shape by fusing with other bubbles inside the cell, while L. major PVs don't. The study used a tool called Lysacker, a fluorescent dye that shows acidic parts of the cell, to see how PVs form and change. They found that L major PVs have less acidic parts, while amazon PVs have more. This study helps us understand how Leish PVs work and could help us learn about other parasites that live inside cells.
Chromatin plays a crucial role in regulating gene conversion, a process that helps maintain and alter genomic structure by using homologous sequences. Researchers used chicken cell line DT40 as a model to study how chromatin contributes to using homolog donors for repair. Immunoglobulin genes in DT40 undergo sequence diversification through gene conversion templated by pseudogene donors. The immunoglobulin V pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. The study demonstrated chrom structure's importance for conversion using a regulatable system where heterochrom protein1 (Drosoph melanogaster Su) was expressed as fusion to Escheria lactose repressor, tethered to polymerase integrated within pseudoλ array. Tethered HP diminished histone acetylation within pseudoλ, altering V diversification outcome to templated mutations rather than templated mutations. Chromatin regulates homology repair, suggesting histone modifications contribute to genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences.
Researchers have long believed that the cerebellum helps us adjust our movements by comparing what we want to do with what we actually do, and correcting the difference, or error. This error not only helps us now but also in the future, as it changes the connections between brain cells called Purkin cells, which help us adjust our movements. Climbing fibers, which connect to these cells, were thought to only send information about the error at the moment, not store it for later use. However, a new study in monkeys shows that climbing fibers send a signal not only at the time of error but also later, before a new movement to improve it. This challenges the idea that climbing fibers only send instant error information.

A previous studies have supported this idea, but not all agree. One study on short-term sacc adaptation, a model of cerebellar learning, found patterns that don't fit the theory. Researchers wondered if climbing fibers might be related to changes in another type of brain signal, simple spikes. To test this, they used a random sacc adaptation, which avoids changes in behavior and error, making it easier to see the error signal. They found that climbing fibers send a signal before a new movement to improve it, not just at the moment of error. This goes against the idea that climbing fibers only send instant information. The study suggests that climbing fibers might play a bigger role in learning than thought.
Researchers have been studying a protein called TDP-43, which is linked to a devastating neurodegenerative disease called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). They used a yeast model to test how T-43 affects cells and found that overexpressing T-43 causes cell damage and disrupts the cell's ability to break down misfolded proteins. They also found that overexpressing a protein called S1 reduces T-43's negative effects on cells and protein breakdown. The study suggests that S1 and its mammalian homologue, DNA1, may have a protective effect against ALS. T-43 is often found in the cells of people with ALS and other diseases, and overexpressed T-43 forms toxic clumps in yeast and mammalian neurons. The study found that T-43 inhibits the cell's ability to break down misfolded proteins, which may contribute to its toxicity. There are many heat shock proteins, like S1, with different functions in mammalian cells. The researchers tested the mammalian S1 homologue, DNA1, in rodent neurons and found it reduced T-43 toxicity. The study used a yeast model to identify proteins involved in T- toxicity and found S1 as a new modifier. The study suggests S1 and its homologues may have a protective effect against ALS.
Researchers studied the parasite load and diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in 65 patients with chronic Chagas disease from different regions of Brazil. They used PCR and real-time PCR to type and quantify the parasite directly from blood samples. 53.8% of patients were positive, with 30.7% having the indeterminate form and 23.1% the cardiac form. The parasite load ranged from 0.12 to 153.66 parasite/mL, with a median of 2.54. The load was higher in patients over 70 years old. They genotyped the parasite to 0.5 parasite/mL with high specificity. 80% of patients had T cruzi DT, while 20% had partial results. Analysis showed 40% TVI, 17.1% TII, and 14.3% mixed infection. Two were infected with TV and one with TIII+VI, all in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy and from Bahia region. Loads were higher in TII (7.56/mL) compared to TVI (2.35/mL). However, 50% of TVI and 16.7% TII evolved to CCC. The study contributes to epidemiological knowledge of T cruz DT in Brazil and highlights age and TII infection as factors for higher parasitemia levels.
Researchers conducted a study on rabies in bats in Guatemala between 2009 and 2011. They tested 672 bats from 31 species for the rabies virus (RV) and found a low prevalence of 0.3%. The virus was detected in the brains of two vampire bats, Desmodus rotus, and also in their oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys. Sequencing showed the viruses were 100% identical, but had a small difference in the glycoprotein gene. The viruses were related to those found in vampire bats in eastern Mexico and El Salvador. 7% of 398 bat sera showed RV neutralizing antibodies, with variation across troph guilds. This study is the first to isolate RV from bats in Guatemala, with a low prevalence of 0.3% among all bats and 1.3% among vampire bats. The viruses were similar to those found in Peru, Grenada, and Trinidad.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a type of protein called lamin in the regulation of gene expression and replication of the herpes simplex virus. Lamin is a protein that helps maintain the structure of the cell's genetic material, called chromatin, and is also involved in silencing gene expression. The study found that lamin plays a role in reducing heterochatin, a type of chromatin that suppresses gene expression, and promoting viral replication. Herpes virus replicates near the edge of the cell's nucleus, excluding histones from these areas. In cells lacking lamin, viral replication is reduced and fails to target the periphery, and chromatin is associated with heterochatin. This suggests lamin is necessary for viral expression, replication, and growth, with greatest effect on replication at low infection levels. Lamin serves as a scaffold for DNA and proteins that regulate both euchatin and heterochatin modifications. Little is known about where chromatin modification occurs beyond lamin's role in heterochatin maintenance. This study shows lamin-dependent targeting of the genome to the periphery is associated with reduction of heterochatin on viral genes. Data suggest lamin's role in heterochatin maintenance and silencing. Viruses have been used to study cellular processes, and chrom regulates HSV expression. HSV DNA is not associated with histones. By regulating chrom, HSV determines productive or latent infection in cells. Further studies should determine lamin's mechanism in keeping the genome active during infection. Lamin may provide platform for viral and chrom-modifying enzymes to keep genome active. Requirement for lamin by replication was multiplicity-dependent, with 5-fold reduction at high MOI and 100-fold at low MO.
Mitochondria originated from proteobacterial endosymbion, and their transition to organelles was linked to the establishment of protein pathways. The initial import of proteins is mediated by the transloc of the outer membrane (TOM). Although TOM is common to all forms of mitochondria, unexpected diversity of subunits between eukotic lineages has been predicted. Here, we analyzed the TOM in hydrogenosomes, a metabolically anaobic form of mitochondria found in the excav Trichomonas vaginal. We demonstrate the highly divergent β-bar T vaginal TOM (Tv)40 forms a trans channel to conduct hydrogenosomal import. Tv40 is in high weight complexes, and analysis revealed the presence of four-anchored (TA) proteins. Two, Tom36 and Tom46, with shock protein (H) and tetratopeptide (PR) domains, bind hydrogenosomal proteins and likely function as receptors. A sub, Tom22 protein has short domain and conserved transmembrane but lacks domain. Fourth, hydrogenosomal outer protein 19 (Hom) no homology. Our data indicate TvOM with sorting assembly (SAM) involved in β-bar assembly. Visualization TvOM by microscopy forms three pores and skull-like shape. Our results suggest the tripletore TOM, composed of conserved subunits, present in last eukotic ancestor (LE), while receptors for binding evolved in eotic lineages.
Researchers have studied how genetic variations in immune cells called CD4 and CD8 T cells contribute to autoimmune diseases. These cells play a key role in the body's defense against infection, but can also cause problems when not working properly. The study looked at genetic changes in these cells and how they relate to diseases like type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. They found a specific change in a gene called IL27 that affects how cells work in people with type 1 diabetes. This change makes cells less active, leading to less inflammation in the pancreas. They also found a change in a gene called R26 that may affect how cells work, but more research is needed to understand its role. The study used a technique called eQ mapping to look at how genes work in these cells and how they relate to disease. This method is more precise than previous studies that looked at all cells together. The results show that genetic changes in these cells can lead to autoimmune diseases and highlight potential new targets for treatment. The study also found that a type of CD4 cells, regulatory T cells, play a key role in controlling autoimmune diseases. These cells help keep the body from attacking itself, but can be affected by genetic changes. Overall, the study provides new insights into how genetic changes in immune cells lead to disease and how to develop new treatments.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, people with sleeping sickness, also known as African trypanosomiasis (HAT), is a major public health concern. Despite efforts to control the disease, many people avoid screening and treatment due to cultural and economic barriers. A study in two provinces, Bandu and Kasai Oriental, found that community members and healthcare workers believe certain restrictions must be followed after treatment: no work, no sex, no hot food, and no walking in the sun. Violating these rules is thought to cause serious and deadly complications. These restrictions were meant to prevent side effects of old medication but are no longer needed with new, safer drugs. People avoid screening because they fear these taboos if diagnosed. To improve control, understanding these prohibitions and their origins is key. Health providers should talk to the community to keep up with changing information. 

The study included current and former patients, healthcare workers, and program managers. Interviews and discussions were recorded and analyzed. Restrictions are a major reason for suboptimal uptake of screening and treatment. If safer options are available, these tabos might be abandoned, as seen with new treatment. The nature and duration of these restrictions affect participation and adherence. It's unclear where they came from, whether self-imposed or provider, and their basis. Given their impact, the study aimed to document perceptions. Conducted in provinces with high prevalence, where tabos were known. Not explored in areas with lower prevalence.
In Eastern Sudan's Gedare State, visceral leishmanias (VL) is a significant health burden. Médecins Sans Frontières has treated patients with VL at Tabarak Hospital since 2009. A survey was conducted to estimate VL incidence in villages around Tabarak. Between May 5 and June 17, 2011, an exhaustive door-to-door survey was done in 45 villages of Alure locality. Deaths were investigated by autopsies. Individuals with fever for at least two weeks, VL diagnosed and treated in previous year, and clinical post-kala-azar dermal leishiasis (PKDL) were referred to medical teams for ascertainment. A new VL case was clinical with positive rk39 rapid test or direct agglut test. In 45 villages, 17,702 households were interviewed for population 94,369. Crude rate over 409 days was 0.13/10,000 people. VL was possible probable cause for 19% deaths. VL-specific rate was 0.9/100 per year. Teams examined 551 individuals for fever at least weeks, 16 diagnosed primary VL. Incidence over year 7.0/100 persons or 7.9/100 when deaths included. 12.5% of population reported past treatment. VL represents significant burden in Gedare State. Active case detection had low yield with access to care, not priority to enhance in similar contexts.
Scientists have studied how supercoiling in bacterial chromosomes, which is crucial for compacting DNA into a small space. They found two types of supercoiling: diffuse and constrained. Diffuse supercoiling moves freely around the chromosome, while constrained supercoiling is caused by proteins binding, bending, or unwinding DNA. Both types contribute equally to total supercoiling in normal cells. However, Escherichia coli has 15% more supercoiling than Salmonella. To understand how diffuse supercoiling changes, researchers inserted a sensor into Salmonella's genome to monitor supercoiling and transcription rates. They found that transcription increases supercoiling upstream and decreases it downstream of highly expressed genes. Topoisomerase I relaxes excess supercoiling, while gyrase replenishes it to maintain balance. Mutations in gyrase cause supercoiling loss, which is reversed by blocking transcription with rifampicin. Gyrase mutants also slow transcription rates throughout the genome. The study shows a link between transcription speed and gyrase efficiency, suggesting fast-growing bacteria have more supercoiling than slow-growing species.
Researchers have found that the parasite Leishmania amazonensis, which causes cutaneous leishmaniasis, grows and replicates in parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) within host cells. PVs are similar to late endosomes and lysosomes and expand during infection, but their impact on parasite survival was unknown. The study shows that host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate LYSTBe, a protein that regulates lysosome size. Mutations in LYSTBe caused PV expansion and enhanced L. amazon replication, while overexpression led to small PV that did not sustain parasite growth. Treatment of LBe overexpressing cells with vacolin reversed this, expanding PV and promoting growth. The opposite was seen with E-64, which reduced PV in LBe mutant cells and inhibited amazon replication. Large PVs protect parasites from damage, as inhibition of nitric oxide synth had no effect on amazon viability within, but enhanced growth in LBe small PVs. The study suggests that upregulation of LBe in infected cells is a host response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV and survival.
Researchers have been trying to understand and treat psychomotoration, a condition characterized by motor and cognitive impairment, for a long time. Allan-Hndonudley syndrome (AH) is a type of psychotoration linked to the X chromosome, causing delayed development, intellectual disability, muscle weakness, and spastic paralysis, and thyroid hormone imbalance. Mutations in the monocarboxyl transporter 8 (MCT) gene, a thyroid hormone transporter, are associated with AH. To study the pathophysiology of AH, researchers created M8 knockout mice, but they showed abnormal thyroid levels but no neurological symptoms. A new study used zinc-finger nuclease gene editing to create M8 mutant zebraf. Eliminating M8 decreased thyroid hormone receptors but not other related genes. Like AH patients, M8 zraf showed neurological and behavioral deficiencies. High-throughput tests showed reduced locomotion, response to light and dark, and increased sleep. Deficiencies were linked to myelin and neuron formation. Time-lapse imaging of single axons and synapses in M zraf revealed reduced filopodia, axon branching, and synaptic density. Researchers tested thyroid analogs that enter cells without M8, restoring myelin and axon growth in zraf. This suggests M8 regulates neural assembly, mediating sensory and motor performance. Administering analogs early may reduce damage in AH patients.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a common virus that affects newborns and people with weakened immune systems. It infects various cells using different entry pathways involving forms of the gL glycoprotein and the fusion glycoprotein B. Researchers found that the minimal machinery for cell fusion is just gL and B. They discovered that CMV B and g form a stable complex early after synthesis without other viral proteins. This complex includes up to 16-50% of total gL in virus particles. In contrast, small amounts of gLO and gUL-131 complexes were found with B. Herpesviruses express B and gL molecules, and most models suggest g interacts with B to mediate fusion. However, there's no direct evidence for this. For herpes simplex virus (HSV-1), it's suggested that after binding, gL binds B either before or with membrane fusion. The results have major implications for these models, showing CM B and g form stable B-gL complexes in virions without receptor or fusion.
Researchers have discovered a new gene called Gimap that plays a crucial role in how mitochondrial DNA (mt) is sorted and segregated in different tissues in the body. Mitochondria are the energy-producing structures within cells, and their DNA is separate from the rest of the cell's DNA. The way mt DNA is sorted can affect the severity and onset of certain diseases. The study used a mouse model to show that Gimap, a protein on the outer membrane of mitochondria, is key to how mt is sorted in white blood cells. Gimap is important for cell survival and development, suggesting that white blood cells may be a factor in regulating mt DNA variants and diseases.

The study found Gimap is the first gene that influences mt sorting in mammals. It regulates the rate of mt sorting in blood cells. The sorting of mt types in blood is a complex trait that changes with age, but not related to the number of mt. A variation in the G3 gene changes the protein sequence, but not the part that anchors it to the membrane. Sorting mt in blood is age-dependent, but Gimap's role in young mice is unclear. The study shows Gimap is critical for mt sorting in blood cells.

Gimap is an outer membrane protein, but doesn't interact with mt directly. It doesn't enter the space between membranes. Overexpressing G3 in cells didn't affect mt levels. This suggests a specific pathway or context is needed for mt sorting. The number of mt has been linked to sorting and mt mutations in humans.
Researchers studied the incubation period of Buruli ulcer (BU), a skin infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, in Victoria, Australia. Most people who get BU live in areas where it's common, but in Victoria, some get it from visiting these areas. They looked at 443 cases from 2013-2016 and found the mean incubation period, or time between exposure and symptoms, was 143 days (4.8 months). This is similar to a previous study from 2002-2012. They also found no link between incubation period and age, sex, location, or how long they were in the area. The study confirms the incubation period is 4-5 months. This can help doctors and suggests the way BU is spread is similar in different areas of Victoria.
Researchers have identified a protein in the Toxoplas parasite that is related to a human protein called Niemann-Pick type 1 (NPC). This protein, called TCR1, plays a role in regulating lipids within the parasite. TCR is similar to human NPC, which helps move sterols and sphingolids across membranes in cells. However, TCR does not target endosomes like human NPC and instead localizes to vesicles beneath the parasite's membrane. When expressed in human cells lacking NPC, TCR restores cholesterol and GM1 from endosomes. To understand TCR's role, the researchers created a parasite without TCR and found it had normal cholesterol but high levels of other lipids like cheryl esters, sphingomyins, and ceramides. This strain also had storage bodies and membranous tubules from parasitoph vacuoles and replicated fast in vitro and was more virulent in mice. This suggests TCR helps control lipid levels in Tooplas, leading to stimulation of storage, biosynthesis, and division.
Researchers have identified a gene called SMOC1 as the cause of a rare genetic disorder called ophthalmic syndrome, also known as Waarden anphthalmia. This condition is characterized by missing or underdeveloped eyes and extra fingers or toes. They found mutations in the SM1 gene in eight families with the disorder. Four of these mutations were nonsense, two frameshift, and two missense. The missense mutations were in the Thyrogulin-1 domain of the protein. The mouse version of the gene, Sm1, shows specific expression during eye, limb, and face, and body development. They also created a mouse with a partial loss of Sm1 and found similar eye and limb problems. This suggests SM1 has a similar function in humans and mice. SM1 is one of two mammal versions of a fly gene that blocks a protein called decaplegic. The frog version of Sm1 also blocks a protein called Bone Morphogenetic Protein in early development. Loss of this block in mammals could explain the eye and limb problems in humans and mice.
Researchers have found that a protein called TRIM22 plays a key role in restricting the replication of the HIV virus. They treated human cells with type 1 interferons, which are proteins that help fight off viruses, and found that TR22 was one of the most highly activated genes. They confirmed that overexpressing TR22 in cells blocked HIV replication. To see if TR22 worked naturally, they knocked down the gene in cells and found that HIV particles were released more easily, showing that TR22 acts as a natural antiviral agent. Further studies showed that TR22 blocked the release of HIV particles containing the G protein, but not other viruses. This suggests that G is the target of TR22. The protein was found in the cytoplasm, not at the cell membrane, indicating that TR22 disrupts its trafficking. Mutations of TR22 showed that two specific amino acids are needed for its antiral activity. These findings reveal a pathway by which type 1 interferons stop HIV replication.
Researchers studied the relationship between fig trees (Ficus) and their specific wasp pollinators (Agaonidae). These wasps lay their eggs in the fig's "fruits" (syconia) and pollinate the tree in the process. However, not all wasps lay eggs in the same part of the fig, with some in inner ovules and others in outerules. This pattern suggests that wasps avoid laying eggs in outerules, making the mutualism stable. But why wasps don't exploit outerules was unknown. In one fig species, Ficus rubosa, wasps found that outerules are vulnerable to parasitic wasps that lay eggs from outside the sycon. The risk of parasitism decreases towards the center of the sycon, where innerules are safe. This may cause wasps to focus on innerules, reducing galling rates and contributing to mutualism stability.
Researchers studied how plant height in a type of grass called Setaria is influenced by genetics and environment. They grew a special population of Setaria plants in different conditions to see how genetics and environment affect plant height. They found that plant height is reduced when water is limited and when plants are close together. They also found that genetics play a big role in plant height, but environment also has an effect. The study suggests that plant height is a complex trait that changes over time and is influenced by genetics and environment. Some genetics from the wild parent of Setaria increase height early, while others from the domesticated parent increase height later. The study used controlled and field experiments to understand how genetics and environment affect plant height. They found 37 genetic locations that affect plant height at different stages of growth. The study shows that plant growth is influenced by genetics and environment in a dynamic way, which is important for understanding how traits are formed.
A recent study in the Pantanal region of western Brazil found evidence of a virus called Ilus virus (ILV) circulating in the area. The Pantanal is a large wetland with diverse wildlife and mosquitoes that can spread diseases to humans and animals. In 2009-2010, researchers collected 3,234 mosquitoes from 16 species and tested them for the virus. One pool of 50 female mosquitoes tested positive for ILV, showing a rate of 2.5 in 1,000. The virus was 95% similar to the known ILV genome. This confirms ILV is present in the Pantanal. 

The Pantanal has many species of mosquitoes that can spread diseases, but little is known about them. In 2009, horses in the area had antibodies to several viruses, including ILV, but it was not confirmed. To find out what viruses are present, researchers tested mosquitoes for virus and RNA. The Pantanal is a large area with many animals and mosquitoes that can spread diseases. In 2009, horses in the area had antibodies to several viruses, including ILV, but it was not confirmed.

Researchers conducted a preclinical study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a new oral treatment for scabies called Moxidin (MO) compared to the current treatment ivermectin (IVM) in a pig model. Scabies is a common skin infection that affects millions worldwide, but current treatments are insufficient and resistance is emerging. MO has a better pharmacological profile, making it a promising alternative. In the study, 12 pigs were given MO (0.3mg once) or IV (0.2mg twice) or no treatment. Efficacy was measured by mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and antibodies. Plasma and skin pharmacokinetics were also determined. At 14 days post-treatment, all MO-treated pigs were mite-free, while only two IV-treated were. MO was 100% effective until the end, compared to 62% for IV, with one remaining infected. Clinical scabies, pritus and antibodies disappeared in all MO-treated but 75% IV-treated. MO lasted 9 times longer in plasma and skin, covering the mite's life. The study shows single-dose MO is more effective than two-dose IV, supporting MO as a potential treatment for scabies.
Scientists have discovered that the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus can survive with a minimal peptoglycan synthesis machine, but sacrifices virulence and antibiotic resistance. Staphlococcus aureus is a pathogen known for its resistance to many antibiotics and prevalence in hospitals. It has a low number of proteins for peptoglycan synthesis compared to other organisms, making it a good model for studying the minimal synthesis machine. Researchers deleted seven of nine genes encoding synthesis enzymes from the St aureus genome without affecting growth or cell shape, creating a strain that synthesizes peptogly only by two proteins, penicillin-binding protein 1 and bi-functional protein 2. However, these proteins are important in real-world environments, as bacteria with minimal synthesis became highly susceptible to cell-targeting antibiotics and displayed impaired virulence in a fly infection model dependent on peptogly receptor proteins. The study shows that Stus can grow with only two active synthesizing enzymes, indicating most are redundant in vitro and identifies minimal synthesis of Stus.
Researchers studied the bacterium Burkholderia pseudallei, which causes a difficult-to-treat disease called meloidosis. They wanted to know how it infects, invades, and survives in hosts, and how it gets the nutrient iron it needs to grow. Iron is essential for bacteria, but it's scarce in most environments. Most bacteria use siderophores or heme to get iron, but Burkia pseudalle's main siderore, malleactin, was previously thought to be key to its virulence. However, a strain without mactin was still virulent, suggesting other iron systems might be involved. The researchers deleted mact and pyelin genes in a strain and found a new siderore activity not related to known Burkia siderores or chelators like citrate. Deletion of hem uptake genes showed Hmu is needed for hem and hemoglobin use, but H can't complement H deficiency. Prolong incubation of H mutant in hemoglobin medium showed alternate pathways for hem and hem use. Loferrin was dependent onact, not pyelin. A quadruple mutant used ferritin as iron and was lethal in murine meloid model. This suggests Burkia may use a ferritin-iron pathway for growth in vivo.
Researchers have developed a new tool called COMM (COnsensus Metabolic Model GENeration) that helps create more accurate and comprehensive models of how cells work. These models, called genome-scale constraint metabolic models, are like a combination of a dictionary and a math problem-solving tool. They contain information about thousands of chemicals, reactions, and genes, and help scientists understand how cells function. However, making these models can be inconsistent and hard to use because of differences between them. COMM automatically identifies and fixes these issues, making a more complete and accurate model. This tool was tested on four organisms and showed that the new models were better and more accurate than the original ones. It's especially useful for complex cases where manual work is not possible, such as bacteria, communities, and host-pathogen interactions.

The tool works by comparing two or more models of the same organism and finding similarities and differences. It uses algorithms to solve problems that come up during integration. It also helps identify same reactions in different parts of the cell, which is hard to do automatically. This tool is a bridge between automatic and manual work for creating models. Models made with COMM are more accurate and powerful than original ones and can be as good as ones made by hand. This is important for understanding how cells work and how they interact.
Researchers have discovered that cartilage plays a crucial role in controlling the timing of bone development by regulating the maturation of cartilage cells, also known as chondrocytes. Chondcytes interact with their environment through a protein-rich matrix called proteoglycan (PG) and undergo a process called maturation, where they express genes that induce bone formation in the surrounding tissue, perichrium. In a study using zebraf mutants, scientists found that cartilage PG inhibits chondcy maturation, which determines the timing of perichral bone development. Mutations in two genes, famb and xylosyltransferase1 (xt), responsible for PG synthesis, were identified. Mutants lacked normal levels of chroit sulfate PG, a key component of cartilage, and formed perichral bone earlier than normal siblings. Chrocy defects may induce bone formation secondarily due to premature maturation, shown by increased expression of markers such as run2, collagen 10, and ih coorths. Ultrastructural analysis revealed aberrant matrix and cellular features of chro hypertrophy in mutants. The study confirms previous findings that famb and xyl1 are involved in PG synthesis and reveals their role in cartilage production and timing of skeletal development.
Topoisomerase II is a crucial for the proper separation of heterochromatic regions during Drosila female meiosis. Heterochromatic homology ensures the segregation of achmate chromosomes during meiosis in Dila females, as a result of the heterochromatic threads connecting achmate homologs during prometaph I. Researchers investigated how these threads and other heteroch entanglements are resolved prior to anaph I. They found that knocking down Topoisomerase II (Top) in later stages of meiosis resulted in a defect in separation of heteroch regions after spindle assembly. In Top-expressing oocytes, heteroch regions of achmate and chmate chromosomes failed to separate during prometaph and metaph I. Heter regions were stretched into long projections with centromes localizing near the tips in some oocytes. Despite anomalies, bipolar spindles were observed in Top-express oocytes, but achmate 4 chromosomes failed to move towards poles during promaph. Both ach and chmate displayed defects in orientation. Euchromatic regions separate earlier in prophase, no defects were observed in ability to separate during pro upon Top knockdown at midphase. Embryos from Top-express females failed to initiate mitotic divisions.
Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of using deltamethrin-impregnated collars to control and prevent visceral leishmanias in dogs in a highly endemic area in Brazil. The study took place in two areas: an intervention area where dogs were collared and a control area where conventional measures were applied. Dogs were tested for the disease at the beginning and end of the study, and every 7-8 months in between. Those that tested positive were removed, and new ones were included. Local authorities were notified of positive dogs in both areas, which were euthanized as per Brazilian law. Initially, seroprevalence was similar in both areas, but at the second evaluation, a significant reduction was seen in both areas, with 6.0% in the intervention and 11.0% in control. The intervention showed a 55% protection against the disease. Although incidence didn't differ, a tendency was seen in the control area, possibly due to low conversion rates or loss to follow-up. The study suggests deltamrin-impregnated collars may provide protection over time, but its effectiveness as a public health measure was inconclusive.
Scientists have long wondered why the X chromosome, one of the two sex chromosomes in mammals, has fewer genes than the other chromosomes. One theory is that this is due to sexual selection and the avoidance of activity in the male germ cells. However, a new research suggests that the X's gene content may be shaped by a different factor: its haploid expression. When the X is transcribed, or read, at a lower rate than other chromosomes, it can't handle high levels of expression due to "transcription traffic jams". This means that genes on the X can't be as highly expressed as those on other chromosomes. Researchers tested this idea using data from the Encyclopedia of DNA (ENCODE) and Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANT5) projects. They found that genes on the X have lower maximal expression than those on other chromosomes, with an average of three times lower. Additionally, genes on the X have less increase in expression than those on other chromosomes compared to the human-chimpanzee ancestor. The traffic model also explains why genes on the X have lower breadth of expression and why highly expressed genes are rare on the X. Genes that are highly expressed in specific tissues are also rare on the X, and those that are broadly expressed tend to be low. This suggests that the X's gene content is shaped by its expression level, not breadth. A limit on expression also explains biased tissue profiles of X-linked genes. Genes that are highly expressed in certain tissues, like secretory and structural, are rare on the X. This can't be explained by other models of biased expression. The study suggests that the X's haploid expression is a key factor in its gene content and evolution.
A recent study investigated the prevalence and population structure of the Helicobacter pylori bacteria in the Baka Pygmies, a subgroup of the Pygmy people in Cameroon. The researchers found that the Baka Pyies had a significantly lower infection rate of H. pylori (20.8%) compared to their neighboring agriculturalist non-Baka (80.2%). Multilocus haplotypes were generated for each H. pyl isolate, but no Baka-specific lineages were identified, and most isolates were assigned to the hpAfrica or hpAfrica populations. The hpAfrica population, associated with the Nilo-Saharan language family, was divided into East and West African subpopulations, and a new hp1 population, mainly among Cameroonians, supported the eastern and western expansions of Bantu languages. An age-structured model showed that the low H. pyl prevalence among Baka is achievable in a few hundred years, suggesting demographic factors like small size and low life expectancy can lead to eradication of H. pyl from human populations. The Baka were either H pyl-free or lost their lineages during demographic fluctuations. Coalescent simulations and phylogenetic inference showed the Baka acquired their extant H pyl through contact with agricultural neighbors.
Dengue virus NS5 is a highly conserved protein that plays a crucial role in capping and replication of the virus genome, as well as interacting with host proteins to modulate immune responses. Unlike other flaviviruses, DENV2 NS localizes to the nucleus, but its role in replication and pathogenesis is unclear. Researchers studied NS of DENV1 and 2, which differ in localization, using a combination of functional and structural analyses. They found that the C-terminal 18 amino acids (C18) of NS direct the protein to cytoplasm or nucleus. A low-mic affinity between NS C18 and nuclear receptor importin-alpha (Imp) was purified and visualized at 2.2 Å resolution using x-ray crystallography. Structure-guided mutational analysis revealed important residues for NS subcell localization. Notably, a proline 884 allows Imp binding, and mutating it to threonine in D1 NS results in mislocalization to cytoplasm without affecting virus fitness. In contrast, mutating arginine 888, conserved in all flaviviruses, to alanine results in non-viable virus, while R888 mutation leads to attenuated phenotype, though NS is in nucleus. R forms hydrogen bond with Y conserved in alliviruses. Data suggests conserved function C18, possibly in RNA interactions critical for replication, independent of subcell localization.
Researchers have developed a new method for mapping neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) that can be used by health ministries in endemic countries to determine when to start public health interventions. The Integrated Mapping (IT) Methodology combines data for lymphatic filariasis (LF), trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and is designed to be efficient and practical. It uses World Health Organization (WHO) recommended indicators for each disease in specific age groups. The study tested the protocol by comparing it to current mapping methods for each disease in one district in Mali and Senegal. Results showed IT reached the same conclusions as WHO for trach, LF, and STH, but more targeted recommendations for schosiasis. IT was practical and saved costs compared to standard, non-integrated WHO methods. This tool can help implement much-needed programs in endemic countries.
In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the phosphatase C14 plays a crucial role in the exit from mitosis. It is anchored to the nucleolar chromatin by the C1/Net protein until anaphase, at which time it is released into the nucleoplasm. Two pathways, the FEAR (C fourteen early release network) and MEN (mitotic network), promote C14 release. Researchers found that histone H2 ubiquitination by the Bre1 ubiquitin ligase is necessary for C14 release from nucleolar chrom when MEN is inactivated. This is mediated by histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79, but not histone deacetylase (HD) Sir2, which associates with C14 onolar chrom as part of the RENT complex. Defects in C14 release were also seen in cells lacking H3 lys 36 methylation and in cells with HD recruited by this modification. These histone modifications are new factors for the FEAR network to act on nucleolar chrom.
Researchers have developed a new computational method called GeneProgram to identify groups of genes that work together to perform specific functions in the human body. These groups, called programs, can be involved in normal processes or disease. The challenge in finding these programs is that human cells and tissues are different, and data is collected at different times and in different ways. GeneProgram uses a new approach to organize genes and tissues into groups that work together, and assigns a score to each group based on how often they work together. The method was tested on synthetic and real data and outperformed other methods. It was then applied to a large dataset of human gene expression data to see how cells respond to infections and immune molecules. Gene found 104 programs, many of which are involved in key pathways and signaling. It also discovered new pathways involved in response to infection, including Wnt and neurotransmitter receptors. The map of programs will help guide future experiments, genes with low scores may be new targets and genes with high scores may be common in disease states. The method is general and can be applied to other biological data.
Researchers have discovered that a specific type of immune cell, called NKGChi NK cells, plays a crucial role in fighting off a common virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV). These cells can remember past infections and respond quickly to future threats. Scientists found that NKGChi cells in people who have been infected with CMV have a specific epigenetic mark on the IFNG gene, which helps them produce a key protein called interferon-gamma (IF-γ). This mark is similar to what's seen in memory T cells that help fight off infections. The researchers showed that this mark is necessary for NChi cells to produce IF-γ when triggered by a specific receptors. This epigen mark is a hallmark of NChi cells that have been exposed to CMV and helps them remember past infections. It's not clear how often this happens in healthy people with CMV, but it's a key part of how NChi cells adapt to fight off the virus.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the bacterium Legionella pneumophila regulates its effectors within host cells. An effector proteins are molecules secreted by the bacterium to manipulate host cellular processes for infection. Temporal regulation of these effectors is crucial for distinct activities at different stages of infection. The study found a protein, Lub, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, hijacks the host proteome to target another effector, Sid, for degradation. Delayed delivery of Lub to the cytoplasm leads to shutdown of Sid in host cells at later stages. This shows a sophisticated co-evolution between host and bacterium involving an effector as a key regulator of cognate effector function. Lub acts as a negative regulator of Sid within host cells, the first example of an effector targeting a cognate eff within host. The study proposes the term "metaeffector" for this class of bacterial effectors. Determinants of susceptibility are encoded in effectors themselves. Lub controls Sid instability in host cytoplasm by targeting for ubiquination. Lub is a bona fide metaeff, regulating another eff function within host. Targets of bacterial E ligases are largely unknown, previous studies aimed at host proteins. Sid is first target of bacterial E ligase effector. Future studies will reveal bacterial effectors manipulating ubiquitin system functions as metaeff coordinating effector expression spatiemporally.
Researchers studied the early stages of HIV-1 infection in 81 individuals to understand how the virus evolves and adapts to its new host. They found that some parts of the virus's genetic code changed rapidly, more than expected, which could be due to the host's immune system trying to fight it off or the virus adapting to its new environment. The team identified 24 sites that changed quickly, 14 of which were in areas targeted by the immune system's T-cells or in specific to the host's genetic makeup. Some of these sites were also changed due to a process called APOB, which helps the virus escape the immune system. The study also found that insertions and deletions in the virus's genetic code were due to selection, not random mutations. This research provides insight into how HIV-1 evolves in new hosts and how the immune system and virus interact in early stages of infection.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how epigenetic silencing works in yeast. They focused on two key chromatin marks, H4 acetylation and H3 methylation, and found that both are essential for stable epigen states. The model shows that having both modifications leads to a robust epigen silencing and a new state with both active and silenced marks under certain conditions. This bivalent state appears under perturbations and results in patchy silencing. The study also found that limited supply of silencing proteins can cause counterintuitive responses. The researchers investigated the design of the silencing system and compared it to experimental observations. They looked at the behavior of Sir protein, spreading of silenced regions in mutants, and the role of Dot1 in yeast silencing. The model can be extended to include other silencing and active marks and inform which are essential for epigen fate.
Researchers in Uganda studied the gut microbiota (GM) of children hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) to see if it differed between those with edemat and non-edemat forms of the condition. Edemat malnutrition, also known as kwashiork, is the most severe form of SAM. The study included 87 children aged 6-24 months, with 62% having edemat malnutrition and 66% being boys with a mean age of 16.1 months. Fecal samples were taken at admission, DNA extracted, and analyzed using two methods: Denaturing Gradient Electrophoresis (DGGE) and high-throughput sequencing. Results showed GM composition differed between the two groups, with non-edemat children having lower diversity. However, beta diversity analysis did not reveal differences between edemat and non-ed SAM. The study suggests non-ed children have lower GM diversity, but no clear compositional differences were found. A link between GM and malnutrition has been reported, with pathogenic bacteria found in malnour children. Transplanting fecal samples from Malian twins with edemat malnutrition into germ-free mice showed a direct relationship. GM dysbiosis is associated with mal, but unknown if it differs between edemat and nonemat SAM. The study justifies further research on probiotics for SAM in developing countries, where mal remains a major problem, accounting for 12.6% of deaths in children under 5.
Researchers studied the variation in telomere length in 112 wild-type yeast isolates of Saccharomyces sensu stricto. They found extensive variation in telom length, with European strains having extremely short telomeres (<150bp) and American isolates having telom approximately three times longer (>400bp). Inserting a URA gene near telom allowed analysis of individual telom lengths and telomere effect (TPE). Crossing American and European strains resulted in F1 spores with a continuum of telom lengths consistent with multiple quantitative loci (QTL) involved in length. Variation in T is quantitative but weakly correlated with telom length. Genotyping F1 segregants indicated several QTL associated with telom length and silencing variation, including candidate genes and regions with no known telom properties. Transgressive segregation was detected for both phenotypes, validated by reciprocal hemizosity that YU and TLC are telom-length QTL in S paradox subpopulations. Sequence divergence within Kuod generates negative epistasis in allelic combinations (American-YU and European-YU) resulting in short telom.
Researchers have been trying to understand how people make decisions, but also when they decide to make them. Traditional models, called sequential sampling models (SMs), assume decisions come from a process that builds up over time, making response times (RTs) predictable. However, these models don't work when people are not forced to respond right away, but can take their time. A new study shows that people can choose to delay and stop the process, a scenario not accounted for by SMs. The researchers developed SMs using brain data from electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, where participants bought or rejected stocks based on cues and could respond at any time. Standard SMs didn't fit the data well, but adding a mechanism for delaying decisions improved the fit. Time analysis of EEG data showed states of increasing and decreasing power in beta frequencies (14-30Hz), indicating responses were prepared and inhibited, supporting the idea of a decision to not decide. The model also explained results from a version of the study where participants pressed a button for more information. The study shows computational modeling supports understanding of hidden dynamics in cognition.
Researchers identified a genetic mutation in the SUVH2 gene as the cause of hereditary nasal parakerosis (HN) in Labrador Retrievers, a rare skin disorder causing crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. A genome-wide association study of 13 HN cases and 23 controls found a strong association on chromosome 2. Resequencing of one case's genome revealed 3 non-synonymous variants in the SUVH gene, with one perfectly associated with HN in a cohort of 500 dogs. The candidate variant is a missense in SUVH, a histone lysine 9 (H9) methyltransferase, mediating chromatin silencing. The variant c.972G>T changes a conserved asparagine to lysine in the catalytically active domain. Histopathological studies suggest HN is not due to hyperproliferation but delayed differentiation of kerocytes. SUVH is involved in epetic regulation of kerocyte differentiation, ensuring proper stratification and sealing of mammalian epidermis.
Researchers studied how the mixing of avian and swine influenza viruses in pigs can lead to the creation of new, potentially pandemic-causing strains. They found that when pigs are infected with both avian and swine flu viruses, genetic mixing occurs in the lower respiratory tract, and the type of virus that is shed is influenced by the type of cells in the pig's nose. The study showed that pigs can serve as a "mixing vessel" for creating new viruses that can be transmitted to humans. By housing pigs infected with both avian and swine viruses, the researchers found that many new viruses were created in the lower respiratory tract, but only a few were shed. The type of cells in the pig's nose helped select which virus was shed. The study suggests that tissue type is a key factor in selecting which virus is transmitted.
Researchers studied the effect of maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and prazantel treatment during pregnancy on Schistoma mans infection and immune responsiveness among offspring at five years old. They found that offspring of infected mothers in schistosia-endemic areas may be sensitized in utero, which can influence their immune response to schistosome and schosiasis morbidity. However, the effect of prazant treatment of S mans during pregnancy on risk of S mans infection among offspring and their immune response when exposed to S is unknown. The study examined prazant treatment of S mans during pregnancy on prevalence of mans and immune among offspring at five years in a trial in Uganda. Offspring of treated or untreated mothers were examined for mans infection and cytokine and antibody responses to SW and SEA, as well as T cell expression FoxP at five. Of 134 children, 2.4% had mans at five based on single sample. Infection did not differ between treated or untreated. Cytokine IF, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13 and antibody IgG, Ig4 IgE responses to SW and FoxP expression were higher among infected than uninfected. Prazant treatment S during pregnancy had no effect on responses, except IL-10 to SW which was higher in offspring of women received prazant than did not. No evidence found that S mans infection and treatment during pregnancy influence prevalence or intensity mans infection or immune response among offspring five, but IL-10 to SW suggest maternal mans and treatment may affect immunoreg responsiveness in schos.
Scientists have discovered a new way that the body's immune cells, called macrophages, can quickly get rid of harmful invaders like bacteria and viruses. Normally, macrophages use a process called phagocytosis to engulf and digest invaders, but this process is slow. Researchers found that when macrophages are activated by inflammation, they switch to a faster process called macinocytosis. This allows them to quickly transfer the invaders to lysosomes for destruction. The key to this switch is a protein called coronin 1, which is activated by a chemical signal when macroages are inflamed. When coron 1 is activated, it turns on an enzyme called PI-3-kinase, which helps with macinocytosis. Even without inflammation, a modified coron 1 protein can still trigger macinocytosis. This means macroages can get rid of invaders quickly, even when not inflamed.
Researchers conducted a study in Arua District, North Uganda to assess the acceptance of tset baits (insecticide-treated targets) in areas where they had not been used before. The study involved 16 focus group discussions with male and female participants in 8 villages across the district. Results showed that villagers who had never seen baits before expressed fear and anxiety, associating them with witchcraft and "ghosts from the river", which are linked to illness, death, and misfortune. In contrast, villagers in areas where ba had been used previously had positive attitudes and were aware of their purpose and benefits. They reported similar negative perceptions when tse control started a decade ago. The study suggests acceptance varies between villages and is related to duration with tse programs. Success of community-based interventions against tse will depend on engagement and sensitization that reaches all communities, especially new areas. 

The study is part of efforts to eliminate neglected diseases, including sleeping sickness (African trypanosomias or HAT) and develop cost-effective tse control methods. In West Uganda, new ba are being deployed over 500km. The area covers villages where tse control has not been conducted. Effectiveness of ba depends on acceptance by the community. 

In other areas, negative attitudes towards ba led to damage, vandalism, and operational failure. Community acceptance is vital for effective tse control. The study was in an area where ba have been used in government programs against H. Examples of community participation in tse ba range from encouraging to active construction, deployment, and maintenance. In all, acceptance was crucial for success. Three years before the study, 70 ba were deployed per parish, but efforts did not result in sustainable tse control.
Scientists have long known that recombination, a process that shuffles genetic material during reproduction, plays a crucial role in evolution. However, understanding its impact has been limited due to lack of detailed data on recombination rates across and within species. Researchers studied Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly species, to better understand recombination. They analyzed 5,860 meioses and genotyped 139 million SNPs, mapping 106,964 recombination events at 2-kilobase resolution. This allowed them to create whole-genome recombination maps and describe variation among individuals. Results show recombination rates vary greatly, with hotspots and coldspots on chromosomes. Gene conversion, a type of recombination, is more evenly distributed than crossing over, another type. At local level, recombination linked to sequence motifs and occur in transcript regions, suggesting chromatin structure affects breaks. These findings highlight need to be considered for accurate re rate estimates and population models of selection and linkage.
Researchers have identified a protein called ID2 (ID2) that plays a crucial role in a process called RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdM) in plants. They found that ID2 forms a complex with two other proteins, ID1 and ID2, which are similar to ID2 but have different functions. ID1 is needed for making new DNA methylation, RNA accumulation, and gene silencing, while ID2 has some of the same roles as ID1. ID and ID2 can't bind to double-stranded RNA, suggesting their roles are different from ID2 in the complex. The researchers also found that ID2's coiled domain helps it bind to itself, but not ID1 or ID2, and ID's X domain is needed for the complex to work. They tested ID2 with mutations and found that its X domain is essential for its function in RM and gene silencing. ID2 is similar to another protein, SGS, which helps silence genes after they're made. Both have zinc finger and coiled domains, but only ID's X domain is conserved. The study shows ID2 forms a complex with ID1 and ID2 for RM, which is needed for the process.
Exposure to Leishmania braziliensis triggers neutroph activation and apoptosis. Neutrophils, the first line of defense against invading pathogens, are rapidly recruited to the site of Leishmanial inoculation. During Leish braziliensis infection, depletion of neutrophils significantly increases the parasite load, whereas co-culture of neutils with L braziliensis has an opposite effect. The co-culture of infected macrophages and neutils induced parasite killing, leading to the question of how neutils respond to L brazili exposure. Here, we focused on the interaction between neutils and Lili, exploring activation and apoptotic fate. Inoculation of serum-opsonized Lili promastigotes mice neutroph accumulation in vivo, peaking at 24 hours. In vitro exposure of thioglyateelic inflammatory bone neutils to Lili modulated expression of surface molecules such as CD18 and CD62, and induced oxidative burst. Using mCh-expressing Lili, effects were mainly observed in infected and not bystander cells. Neutil activation with Lili was confirmed by release of TN-α and neutilase. Neutils with Lili displayed markers of early apoptosis. We show Lili induces neutroph recruitment in vivo and neutils exposed to the parasite in vitro through activation and release of inflammatory mediators. This may impact parasite elimination, particularly at early stages of infection.
Researchers explored the potential benefits of vaccination as a supplementary control measure for bovine tuberculosis (TB) in cattle. Currently, vaccination is not used in international control programs and is banned in the EU. Candidate vaccines, based on Mycobacterium bovis BCG, interfere with the tuberculin skin test, used to determine if herds and countries are TB-free. New diagnostic tests, Differentiated Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIV), can introduce vaccination into existing eradication programs. Using herd models from Britain, they estimated the feasibility of supplemental vaccination. The economic impact of TB on farmers is dominated by testing costs and restrictions. Farmers will adopt vaccination if it reduces burden and restrictions. In Britain's testing sequence, the DIV test's specificity, not sensitivity, is the barrier to herd benefit. Relaxing testing could mitigate negative effects, but increase hidden infection in officially free herds. Models explored DIV characteristics for a protective benefit. A specificity of 99.85% and sensitivity >40% is required. Data from infected animals suggest a cocktail of three DIV antigens can achieve 99.85% specificity and 73.3% sensitivity relative to post-mortem detection.
Researchers have identified a new class of compounds called dihydrobenoxazepones that can kill the parasitic worm Trichis, which infects over 500 million people worldwide, causing growth and educational problems. Current treatments are limited and ineffective, so new options are needed. Using a mouse model of the parasite, they screened 480 small molecules and found dihydroazepoxones with anthelmint activity. Further screening and synthesis led to 20 active dihydroazepones, a new class not previously implicated in nematode control. The most active compounds killed adult Tris with an EC50 of 25-50μM, comparable to existing levamisole. They showed low toxicity to mouse gut cells, demonstrating selectivity for the parasite. Developing a treatment for a neglected disease is challenging, but dihydroazone O029 reduced embryon Tris eggs' ability to infect mice in vivo. This suggests an alternative strategy to develop a therapeutic that acts in the environment, interrupting the parasite lifecycle. The dihydroazones are a new anthint active against both egg and adult stages of Tris, showing selectivity and potential for further optimisation to improve potency and pharmacokinetics for a clinical agent.
Researchers have re-examined the concept of "date" and "party" hubs in protein-protein interaction networks, where "date" hubs have low expression with their partners and "party" hubs have high expression. They found that the importance of "date" hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small number of extremely central hubs that don't display low expression, contradicting the idea of a link between quantity and function. The "date/party distinction was motivated by a bimodal distribution of hub-expression, but this feature isn't robust to method changes. Topological properties don't correlate with expression, but centrality does with functional similarity of interacting proteins. They suggest thinking in terms of "date/p dichotomy is not meaningful, and it's more useful to consider roles of protein-protein interactions than individual.
Researchers have been using whole-genome sequencing to track the spread of infectious diseases, but a major limitation of this approach is that it requires genetic changes to occur over a short period of time to identify the source of an outbreak. To address this, the concept of "transmission" was introduced, defined as the number of mutations between two pathogen sequences from the same transmission event. Using data from the literature, simulations were run to estimate transmission for 10 major pathogens and found that it is generally low, with many pairs having identical sequences. This limited the ability to reconstruct outbreaks, especially for pathogens with low transmission like Streptococcus, Shigella, and Clostrid. In contrast, rapidly evolving pathogens like RNA viruses provided valuable information on individual transmission events. The study highlights the limitations of genetic data in certain scenarios and the need to expand tools to include other types of epidemiological data. Accurate transmission trees are not available for most pathogens, so a simulation approach was used to estimate transmission using parameters like genome length, mutation rate, and generation time. The limited diversity had a significant impact on reconstruction and identified transmission as a limiting factor for many pathogens. The diversity depends on genomic and epidemiological factors and can be quantified by transmission, defined as the number of mutations between pairs. This may be problematic for methods relying on phylogenetic trees and the impact on reconstruction remains to be investigated. The study introduced transmission as a measure of informativeness of WGS for reconstructing chains and estimated for 10 pathogens using a simulated approach.
Researchers studied how genes on the X chromosome that escape inactivation in female mammals, a process that silences most genes on one of the two X chromosomes in females. They analyzed gene expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with different X inactivation patterns based on single nucleotide polymorphisms. They found a continuum between complete silencing and expression from the inactive X chromosome, with few genes escaping in most tissues but more in embryonic-kid-derived cells. Alle-specific RNA polymerase occupancy and DNase hypersensitivity at gene promoters correlated with escape levels, suggesting open chromatin structure. Alle-specific CTCF binding on the inactive X was denser in brain compared to embryonic cells, possibly due to compartmentalized structure and fewer escape genes. A minority of genes escaped X in tissue and cell-specific manner, indicating X and escape are tightly controlled in vivo. The probability of bi-allelic versus monoallelic expression was calculated using a new algorithm applicable to any gene. Surveys in human/mouse cells showed 8-15% consistently escape, 10-13 variable, and 10-20 between cell/individuals. Escape results in sexual dimorphisms and bi-alle expression is important for normal females. Mouse 3-7 genes may be exceptional compared to other mammals. Escape were distributed along the X, not influenced by distance from the X center, and play roles in regulation and are dosage-sensitive. Tissue-specific genes will help understanding sex differences.
Researchers have identified a new cystine protease enzyme in the Plasmod viv, a parasite that causes malaria, which affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide. This enzyme, called VX-4, has unique properties that allow it to break down different proteins in different environments within the cell. It is most active at acidic pH 5.5, where it breaks down a protein called Z-Arg-MCA, and at neutral pH 6.5-7.5, it breaks Z-Arg-MCA. VX-4 prefers positively charged amino acids at the first position and less specificity at third and fourth positions. Three amino acids in its pocket are different from similar enzymes VX-2 and VX-3. Replacing one of these amino acids abolishes activity at neutral pH. VX-4 is found in the food vacuoles and cytoplasm of the erythrocyte stage of P. viv. It breaks actin at neutral pH and P. viv plasmin 4 and hemoglobin at acidic pH. VX-4 has pH-dependent switching, allowing it to break different substrates in different environments. It might break hemoglobin in acidic food vacu, P viv plasmin at neutral or acidic, and cytoskeleton in erythrocyte.
Scientists have created a new model to better understand how a type of microbe called Clostridium ljungahli works. This microbe can turn many different substances into useful products, making it a good candidate for sustainable production of chemicals. However, scientists didn't know much about its biology and couldn't predict its behavior. The new model, called iL965ME, includes all major pathways for making proteins, amino acids, nucleotides, lipids, and vitamins, as well as RNA and protein synthesis. It's the first model of its kind for a Gram-positive bacterium and makes predictions more accurate. The model shows how protein and media composition affect metabolism and energy in this microbe. It also predicts overflow metabolism, which is useful for designing new products, like glycerol, a new product for Clostridium ljahli. The model also shows how changing metal availability affects secretion, opening up new ways to optimize fermentation and understand how the microbe uses carbon and proteins.

The model includes all major metabolic, amino, acid, nucleotide, lipid, and vitamin synthesis pathways, as well as RNA and protein synthesis necessary for reactions. It also includes cofactors and mechanisms for energy conservation. The model predicted secretion of acetate, ethanol, and glycer during carbon and metal availability, and how protein and media influence metabolic and energy in this microbe.
Researchers used a panel of human osteoblast cells to study the genetic control of transcript variation, similar to previous studies in lymphoblast cell lines. They found that osteoblast and lymphlast cells have distinct gene expression patterns, with some genes specific to each cell type. By analyzing genetic variants, they found that some transcript forms of genes in osteoblast are controlled by genetic variants, and these variants can be tissue-specific or not. The study also found that multiple transcript forms of a gene can be present in both tissues and genetic variants can affect the expression of one form over another, not just an all-or-nothing effect. Examining top genetic associations from a bone density study, they found overlap with their results. One gene, FAM118, was tested in additional studies and a new transcript variant was found. This approach to studying transcript variation in multiple tissues is useful for detecting genetic variation between cell types and identifying specific variants that may be important.
Scientists have discovered a new way to make yeast, called Saccharomyces eayan, use a type of sugar called maltotose. This sugar is important for brewing beer production, but Sacomy eayan can't normally use it. Researchers took a gene from another yeast, Saccharces cerevisiae, that can use maltose, and combined it with a gene from Sacomy eayan that can use maltose. This created a new gene that allows Sacomyayan to use maltose. They tested this new gene in a lab and found it worked. They also looked at the structure of the new gene and found it's similar to another gene from a different yeast that can use maltose. This suggests that the ability to use maltose may have evolved in a similar way in different yeasts.
Researchers have found a link between the severity of the flu and how much the virus has changed from previous strains. They used a new model to show that the more the virus has changed, the more deaths it causes. This helps them develop a way to quickly estimate how many deaths a new flu strain will cause. This is important for planning and preparing for flu outbreaks, as it can help balance public health and economic costs. The study used a simplified model to look at how the virus interacts with the body and found a direct link between how much the virus has changed and how many deaths it causes. They tested this method on the H1N1 flu virus and found it worked well. This method can be used to predict the impact of future H1N1 flu strains and with some changes for H2 and B viruses. The researchers used a simplified model to look at how the virus interacts with the body and found a direct link between how much the virus has changed and how many deaths it causes. They tested this method on H1 flu and found it worked.
Researchers have identified a protein from the Asian soybean fungus Phakora pachyri that suppresses the plant's immune system. This protein, called PEC23, is a small, cysteine-rich protein that is secreted by the fungus. It interacts with a soybean transcription factor called GmPL12, which is a negative regulator of the plant's immune response. When GPL12 is silenced, the plant becomes more resistant to the fungus. The study suggests that PEC23 is a virulence factor, meaning it helps the fungus infect the plant, and that it interacts with GPL12 to suppress the plant's immune response. The protein has a unique feature, a repeat of 10 cysteine motifs, which is also found in other rust fungi. This suggests that PEC23 may be part of a conserved protein platform that fungi use to manipulate the plant's immune system. The researchers tested PEC on soybeans with silenced G12 and P23, but found no change in disease symptoms, possibly due to redundancy of other fungal proteins. The study shows that G12 acts as an immune suppressor, ensuring plant growth without infection. The cystine motif is found in other rust species, indicating a possible conserved interaction.
Researchers have discovered that the EphA receptor, a protein on the surface of host cells, plays a crucial role in the invasion and replication of the bacterium Chlamydia trachatis. Chydia invades host cells and replicates inside a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion, where multiple host proteins are recruited to support its development. The researchers found that EphA activates the PI3 signaling pathway, necessary for efficient replication, by interacting with the bacterium's serovar L2 protein. Interfering with this interaction, downregulating EphA, or inhibiting its activity reduced infection. During replication, EphA accumulates around the inclusion and interacts with the PIK regulatory subunit to activate the PIK/Akt pathway. Overexpressing full-length EphA, but not a mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain, enhanced PIK activation and infection. Despite depleting EphA from the surface, infection upregulates it through the ER pathway, keeping infected cells resistant to apoptosis. The study shows EphA is both an entry and intracellular signaling receptor for Chydia. Engagement of a surface receptor at the membrane is a new mechanism by which Chy subverts the host and induces resistance.
Researchers have long known that neurons have active channels in their dendrites, the branching parts of the cell that receive signals from other neurons. These channels allow dendrites to be excitable, meaning they can generate electrical impulses. However, the role of this excitability in dendritic computation has been unclear. A new study shows that the output of a model of an active dendritic tree is highly dependent on the rate of signals it receives, with a large dynamic range of over 50 decibels. This means it can amplify weak signals and saturate strong ones. The model also predicts that neurons with larger dendritic trees will have a larger dynamic range and blocking active conductances will decrease it. The researchers propose that dendrites amplify weak signals and saturate strong ones, solving the problem of sensitivity and saturation in signal processing. This is important for individual neurons, neural networks, sensory organs, and organisms. The study suggests that dendritic spikes are not just a result of excitability, but also a way to increase dynamic range. The neuron function is not a simple Hill-like curve, but a double-sigmoid, as seen in retinal ganglion cells.
Researchers studied how to improve the accuracy of models that infer gene regulation from time-series data. Current methods assume mRNA levels represent protein concentrations and changes in gene expression are solely due to transcription factors, neglecting other effects. They investigated this bias using a combination of experiments and models on the Fli-FlM module in E. coli. coli, measuring protein and physiological effects with kinetic models. Results show correcting these assumptions improves model quality, especially for systems with longer protein half-lives and varying expression machinery activity. A new approach is proposed for using time-series data to learn regulatory networks, demonstrated on Fli-FlM, highlighting global effects and regulation of Fli and FlM halfives for promoter dynamics. 

To address bias, they used constitutively-expressed genes, mathematical models, and procedures to reconstruct protein concentrations and integrate physiological effects. A reporter gene driven by a constitutive promoter was used to measure global effects, but model fit was only marginally improved. Concentrations of Fli and FlM were estimated from promoter activities and physiologically plausible halfives, providing a data set to test mRNA and protein influences on inference. They inferred regulatory and quantitative function of a Fli-dependent gene, not regulated by other factors, from reporter data. Estimating protein concentrations from promoter activities and physiological halfives improved inference of interactions and regulation. A model with Fli and FlM as regulators and expression activity was compatible with data.
Researchers studied the spatial and temporal distribution of Oligyomys fulcens, a rodent species that carries diseases, in the Agua region of Panama. They collected data from 2006 to 2009 and analyzed it using maps and statistical tests. The study area was 6.43 square kilometers and divided into four periods: dry season, rainy season, and two transition months. The population of O. fulcens varied across seasons and years, typically absent in late transition months and re-established in subsequent years. Spatial analysis showed that populations were around 300-600 meters apart, with sharp borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats. The species showed a changing pattern over time, with shifting hotspots of abundance. This was due to seasonality and human activities like agriculture. These factors define the occurrence, timing, and duration of rodent populations affected by humans, and possible human exposure.

The study found multi-annual dynamics of O. fulens populations, with seasonal and yearly heterogeneity in abundance and distribution. This variation in zoon reservoirs makes pathogen identification challenging. Results provide a spatio-temporal characterization of hotspots of rodent habitation and persistence. Populations are subject to fluctuations within and among years, and geographically restricted, even in their range. Suitable habitat change, but dynamics on the landscape is poorly understood. Rod-borne zoon are sensitive to population size, demographic, persistence, and changes in host distribution, determinants of pathogen establishment and transmission.
Researchers have developed a new method to understand how genetic changes in the influenza A (H3) virus affect its ability to evade the human immune system. This is crucial for creating effective vaccines. The method, called "antigenic tree," assigns weights to each change in the virus's surface protein to show how much it impacts its ability to evade the immune system. It was tested on data from 1968 to 2003 and found known and new sites that affect the virus's ability to evade the immune system. This method can be used for other viruses and systems where genetic and phenotypic data is available. 

The researchers applied this method to the major protein of the influenza A (3) virus over 35 years. Branches on the tree represent the impact of changes on the virus's ability to evade the immune. This method is faster and less expensive than lab experiments to determine the impact of changes. It was tested on data from 1968 to 200 and found areas of the tree that correspond to known changes in the virus's ability to evade the immune. This can be used to identify changes that need to be updated in vaccines. The method can be used for other viruses and systems with genetic and phenotypic data.
Researchers used a large-scale RNA interference (RNAi) screen to study how human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infects cells. They found that a group of genes involved in cell division, or mitosis, are necessary for the virus to enter the cell's nucleus. Normally, the cell's nuclear envelope blocks the virus's DNA from entering, but during cell division, the envelope breaks down, allowing the virus to enter. The virus then attaches to the cell's DNA on the division plate. The study suggests that HPV needs the nuclear envelope to break down for its DNA to enter the cell's nucleus. This research highlights the power of RNA screens in studying virus-host interactions and provides a list of genes involved in HPV infection for future studies.
Black Sigat or black streak disease, caused by the Dothideomyc fungus Pseudocospora fiji (previously Mycoserella fiji), is a major threat to global banana production. The disease requires frequent fungicide applications, which increase economic and environmental costs, and lead to rapid evolution of fungicide-resistant strains. To combat this, two strains of P. fiji were sequenced and assembled with a new genetic map. The 74b genome of P. fiji is expanded by LTR transposons, making it largest in Doideomycetes. Electrophoretic karyotyping and molecular markers showed chromosome polymorphisms and genetic diversity. Genetic differentiation was detected using neutral markers, suggesting selection and limited gene flow. Frequencies of fungicide in fung-treated plantations were higher than untreated P. fiji populations. A homologue of Cladospor fulum Avr effector Pf4 was identified in P. fiji genome. Infiltration of Pf4 into leaves of resistant banana variety Calcut 4 resulted hypersensitive response, suggesting Cal 4 carries unknown gene recognizing Pf4. The P fiji genome will aid fung treatment and banana breeding programs.
Scientists have long believed that changes in the way genes are turned on and off play a key role in the evolution of species-specific traits. However, most studies focus on highly conserved sites and rely on comparing sequences between species. A new method uses a "birth-death" model to track changes in transcription factor binding sites without comparing sequences. This method was applied to six transcription factors in humans and mice and found that 58-79% of binding sites in humans are new since they diverged from mice. Over 15% of sites are unique to humans and are near genes related to specific pathways and have more genetic variations than older sites. This method can identify lineage-specific elements and help understand their role in gene regulation variation between species. Unlike other approaches, this method uses specific binding sites or their rate of creation along a lineage. For five of six factors, the produced the most significant prediction using this method. Previous methods rely on cross-species alignments which are often low quality, especially in non-coding regions. This method can determine lineage differences in evolutionary rates of a motif along a branch in the phylogeny. Results support that this method can identify lineage regulatory elements, a step towards understanding their role in gene regulation variation.
Researchers studied how light affects the circadian clock in zebraf fish, a vertebrate model that responds to light in most of its tissues. They found that light induces expression of certain genes, including clock genes, in zraf cells in vivo and vitro. However, the mechanism linking light to gene expression was unclear. To understand this, they focused on how light regulates the zraf period2 (per) gene. Using transgenic fish and stably transfected cell-based assays, they defined a Light Module (LRM) within the per promoter. The LRM is necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and circadian regulation. Curiously, the LRM is conserved in vertebrate per genes, even in species lacking light-sensitive clocks. They also found that human LRM can substitute zraf LRM to confer light-regulated transcription in zraf cells. The LRM contains E and D-box elements, critical for its function. E-box directs circadian regulation by mediating BMAL/C activity, while D-box drives light expression. The zraf homolog of thyroid embryonic factor binds to L-box and transactivates expression. They showed t mRNA levels are light-inducible and knockdown of t attenuates light transcription from per promoter in vivo. Their results support a model where light-dependent crosstalk between E and D-box factors is central to per expression. This extends understanding of how light entrains the clock and regulates gene expression in vertebrates.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called coronin plays a crucial role in the motility of Plasmodium sporites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. These parasites need to migrate to penetrate tissue and enter host cells. Without coronin, the parasites show motility defects that impair colonization of the salivary glands but not migration in the skin, resulting in decreased transmission efficiency. The study found that extracellular ligands trigger intracellular calcium release followed by actin-dependent localization of coron to the rear of the gliding sporite, initiating motility. Mutational and imaging analysis suggest coron organizes actin filaments for motility. Using coronin-Cherry as a marker for actin filaments, protein A contributes to actin disassembly. Calcium and cAMP signaling regulate a switch from parasite motility to host invasion by influencing actin dynamics.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism of resistance to a key drug used to treat leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites. The drug, amphotin B, is a crucial in reducing the global burden of this disease, but resistance to it is a growing concern. Four lines of Leish mexicana, a type of Leish parasite, were found to be resistant to amphotin. They had altered sterol synthesis and were more sensitive to another drug, pentidine. Genome sequencing showed a mutation in a sterol biosynthesis gene, ster C-desaturase, in one line. However, in three lines, RNA sequencing revealed loss of expression of ster C-methyltransferase (SMT), responsible for resistance and altered sterol synthesis. Loss of milteine transporter was also found in one line. MT is encoded by two genes, with different expression levels. Reduced expression was associated with loss of 3 untranslated region of dominant gene, due to structural variations at locus. Regions of homology between genes and presence of SIDER retrotranson elements promoted these variations. In one case, loss of MT was not associated with loss of virulence in macrophages in vivo.
Researchers investigated how attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain. They used electroencephalography (EEG) to record neural activity in humans performing a simple visual task. Participants either attended or ignored a stream of gratings with predictable, surprising, or unpredictable orientations. The study found that surprising stimuli evoked responses were encoded as the difference between predicted and observed features, and attention increased the encoding of this information in the brain. This supports a predictive coding theory that attention optimizes expectations by increasing the gain of prediction errors. The theory suggests attention should increase selectivity for mismatch information in response to surprising stimuli, which is called the "mismatch model". An alternative theory proposes attention modulates predictions, not errors, which are propagated through the hierarchy and modulated by attention. The study found a significant effect of attention on mismatch responses to surprising but not unpredictable stimuli, starting 150ms after onset and reaching significance at 350ms. This shows attention boosts prediction errors evoked by surprising stimuli, consistent with predictive theory. The study aimed to determine what type of information is modulated between attention and prediction. They used forward models to quantify selectivity for orientation and mismatch in responses to surprising and unpredictable stimuli in the oddball paradigm.
Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite found in sub-Saharan Africa, is divided into three sub-species: T. b. brucei, T. rhodesense, and T. gambense. T. b. brucei cannot infect humans due to sensitivity to trypanolytic factors (TLF) in human serum, while T. rhodense and T. gambense are resistant. T. gambense has two sub-groups that differ genetically and in human serum resistance phenotypes. Group 1 T. gambense has an invariant phenotype, while group 2 shows variable resistance. Previous research suggested group 1 T. gambense is resistant to TLF due to reduced uptake of TLF mediated by reduced expression of TLF receptor, the haptoglobin-hoglobin receptor (HbHR) gene. This study investigates if true for group 2 parasites. Isogenic and sensitive group 2 T. gambense were compared to T. bruce parasites. Both express HHR at similar levels and internalize fluorescent labeled TLF like T. bruce. Both resistant and sensitive group 2, as well as group 1 T gambense, internalize recombinant AP1, but only sensitive 2 are lysed. Data indicate group 1 T gambense avoiding TLF is resistant to main component AP1. Group 2 T gambense is innately resistant AP1, possibly same mechanism. However, group 2 Tense variably displays phenotype and does not correlate with HHR expression change. Differences in human resistance mechanisms between T gamb groups 1 and 2.
Researchers have found that DNA methylation of the HIV virus's 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) plays a role in controlling the virus's latency, or dormant state, in the body. This is a mechanism that helps the virus evade the immune system and antiretroviral drugs. However, the role of DNA methylation in HIV-1 latency has not been clear, unlike other factors like transcription and chromatin structure. The study used an in vitro model and patient samples to show that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5LTR is an epigenetic restriction that prevents reactivation of latent HIV-1 and determines its stability. Methylation is a late event in latency establishment and not required for initial silencing. Latent reservoirs with unmethylated 5LTR are more easily reactivable. In patients without detectable viremia, HIV-1 promoters are hypermethyl and resistant to reactivation, while those with vire have hypomethyl 5LTR. Methylation does not confer complete resistance to reactivation with some drugs, but dense methylation is reactivated in absence of T cell activation. This has implications for strategies to eradicate HIV.
Researchers have created a comprehensive catalog of genetic variations in the fruit fly Drosoph melanogaster, including single nucleotide, multi-nucleotide, and structural variants. They used a new approach to identify over 3.6 million distinct variations, with more than 800,000 insertions, deletions, and complex variants up to 6,000 base pairs long. While single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are more common, they found that other types of variations are not more likely to cause mutations. Instead, the high density of SNPs is due to population-level processes. The study also looked at how genetic variations affect gene expression in adult flies by mapping over 2,000 genes. Insertions and deletions make up 10% of these variations and have larger effects than SNPs. They found more associations in males than females and that most variations are specific to each sex, showing a difference in genetic architecture between sexes and importance of factors mediating sex-based expression. Additionally, they analyzed gene expression in offspring of sequenced lines and found that most variations can be seen in heterozygous individuals. This study expands the catalog of variations in Dophila and shows high density of polymorphisms compared to humans and mice.
Researchers investigated how the relationship between the amplitude of the rectified electromyogram (EMG) signal and the neural drive to the muscle. The rectified EMG is commonly used to estimate the neural drive to muscles, but its accuracy can be distorted by the overlap of motor unit potentials, known as amplitude cancellation. The study used analytical and computational models to analyze the impact of cancellation on the correlation between the rectified EM and neural drive. The results showed that the ideal rectified EM without cancellation (EMnc) is a better estimator of the neural drive than the actual rectified EM. Simulations confirmed this, with a strong correlation between the neural and EMnc at low cancellation levels (less than 40%) and low contraction (less than 5% of maximum voluntary force). However, this correlation decreased with increasing cancellation (r=-0.83) at high levels (more than 60%) and contraction (more than 15%). The study also found that stronger neural drive resulted in a stronger correlation between rectified EM and neural, but cancellation mainly distorted low-frequency components (less than 5 Hz) of the neural drive. The findings indicate that amplitude distorts the rectified EM signal, making it less reliable as an estimator of neural drive, especially at high contraction levels or weak synaptic input to motor neurons.
Scientists have discovered a key player in how plants respond to aluminum stress: a protein called YCCA. When plants are exposed to aluminum, YCCA regulates the production of a hormone called auxin in the root tip of the plant. This hormone is responsible for slowing down root growth. Researchers found that YCCA upregulates certain genes that produce auxin, leading to its accumulation in the root tip and growth inhibition during stress. This process is dependent on another hormone called ethylene, which is involved in plant growth and development. Disrupting ethylene signaling either enhanced or reduced YCCA expression in the root tip in response to stress. Inhibiting ethylene also alleviated root growth under stress in plants lacking YCCA or treated with a chemical that blocks Y activity. Another protein, EIN3, is involved in regulating Y9 transcription in this process. PIF4, a protein, acts as a transcription activator for Y5 and 8, promoting root growth inhibition by regulating auxin in the root tip. Al-induced P4 expression in the tip acts downstream of ethylene signaling. The study reveals a cascade of Y-regulated auxin biosynthesis in the root tip mediating growth in response to stress.
Researchers have found that certain peptides from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) can suppress the activity of natural killer (NK) cells in primates by binding to a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule, Mam-A*002, on the surface of infected cells. This interaction stabilizes the binding of Mamu-K3DL05, an inhibitory receptor on NK cells, preventing them from killing the infected cells. Twenty-eight out of seventy-five SIV peptides bound to Mam-A002 suppressed the cytolytic activity of Mam-K3+ NK cells, including three immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes. Substitutions at the C-terminal end of inhibitory peptides changed them into disinhibitory, and vice versa, without altering binding to Mam002. The effects of these variants on NK cell responses corresponded to their effects on Mam002 tetramer binding Mam-K05. In mixtures of inhibitory and disinitory peptides, low concentrations of inhibitory dominated to suppress cell responses. Consistent with inhibition of Mam-K cells by epitopes presented Mam002, SIV replication was higher in Mam002 CD+ lymphocytes co-cultured with Mam-K NK than Mam-K cells.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae, a common cause of ear infections, adapts to changing environments. They found that when nutrients are scarce, the bacteria evolve to survive and thrive. This adaptation helps them colonize and persist in the body. In a study, they looked at how the bacterium's response to nutrient limitation and found a mutation that reduced its ability to break down a molecule called cyclic adenosine monophosphate. In a model of ear infection, this mutation led to less fluid buildup in the ear, a sign of disease resolution. However, the mutated bacteria formed more communities inside ear cells than the original strain, suggesting a reservoir for future infection. This is the first look at how Haemophilus influenza adapts to nutrient limitation and shows the presence of these communities in a model of chronic infection.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Burkholderia pseudalle, which causes melioidosis, interacts with its host's iron levels during infection. Iron is crucial for the bacterium's growth and the host's immune response. The study found that B. pseudalle downregulates the host's iron exporter ferroin, making more iron available to the bacterium. Supplementing iron with ferric ammonium citrate increased bacterial growth, while iron chelating with deferoxamine reduced it. Infected mice had lower ferroin expression, higher liver iron, and lower serum iron levels. Administering ferric ammonium citrate promoted bacterial growth and inflammation, while limiting iron availability improved clearance, reduced cytokines, and survival. The study suggests B. pseudalle modulates iron homeostasis to acquire iron and evade the host's immune response, promoting intracellular growth.
Researchers have developed a new technique called "functional mode analysis" to identify the specific movements in proteins that help them perform their biological functions. These movements are often involve many atoms working together, making it hard to pinpoint which ones are crucial. The new method uses a "functional quantity" that measures the protein's state and finds the movement most related to it. This quantity can be anything relevant to the protein's function, such as shape, charge, or chemical properties. It also estimates which motion is most likely to change the quantity. Two measures are used: the Pearson coefficient for linear correlation and mutual information for any kind of dependence. This helps create a model for the protein's function in terms of a single movement. The technique was tested on several proteins: polyalanine helix, T lysozyme, Trpase, and leucine-binding protein.
Researchers studied the order of intron removal from transcripts of the tubA and gap genes in Euglena gracilis, a type of single-celled organism. These genes contain two types of introns: conventional and nonconventional. Conventional introns are found in most eukaryotes, but nonconventional are unique to eugids and diplonids. Nonventional introns don't have the same borders or sequence as conventional introns and form a different secondary structure. The study found that noncon introns are removed before conventional introns. This suggests a gap between the two types of splicing processes. The study used PacBio Next Generation Sequencing to analyze intermediate products of splicing. Nonconventional introns insert at new positions, while conventional introns are conserved or lost. Only 100 nonconventional introns have been described so far, mostly in eugids. They form a stable structure with exon/intron junction, but not like self-splicing tRNA introns. Intermediate introns have features of both conventional and nonconventional introns. Few genes have been annotated, but confirmed on genomic level. A whole-genome survey of noncon intr is needed.
Researchers studied the effects of Coxsackievirus B (CV) infection on the development of the heart in young mice. CV is a common virus that causes mild fever in infants, but can lead to severe heart problems in some cases. The study looked at what happens when young mice are infected with a low dose of the virus and don't show symptoms, but then face stress as adults. They found that infected mice developed heart problems, such as thickening and dilation, which can lead to heart failure. The virus infected cells that help make new heart cells, called cardiac progenitor cells, were reduced in the hearts of infected mice. This means the heart may not be able to make new cells to adapt to stress. The virus infected these cells, but not the rest of the heart, and was cleared from the heart over time. The study suggests that a mild CV infection in young can lead to heart problems later in life.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Burkholderia pseudalle, which causes meloidosis, interacts with immune cells called macrophages. They found that the bacterium activates a protein called caspase-1 through a receptor called NLRC, but not NLR3, in the early stages of infection. Caspase-1 is involved in a process called pyptosis, where the cell breaks down and dies. Later in infection, casase-1 activation is independent of NLRC. The study identified a pathway involving casases-9 and PAR downstream of NLRC and casase-1. Without casase-1, macrophages undergo apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which is dependent on initiator and effector casases. The bacterium's flagellin and TSS3 protein play a role in casase-1 activation and pyptosis. Infection with a mutant bacterium lacking T3S3 showed reduced casase-1 activation, cell death, and IL-1 secretion. In mice infected with the mutant, mortality was lower, bacterial loads in organs, and IL-β, myeloperoxidase, and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were reduced. The study suggests a major role of T3 in NLRC-mediated casase-1 activation and pypt and contribution of casase-dependent and independent cell death in Burkia pathogenesis.
Researchers studied the role of Arabidopsis Kβ, a subunit of the SNF1 protein complex, in pollen-stigma interactions during pollination. They found that Arabid Kβ is a cytoplasm and nucleus-localized protein in vegetative cells of pollen grains and is essential for pollen germination on the stigma. In Arabid Kβ mutants, pollen could not germinate on the stigma, but germinated normally in vitro. Further analysis revealed that hydration of mutant pollen on stigma was compromised, but adding water promoted germination in vivo, suggesting defective hydration led to germination. Mutant pollen had destroyed mitochondria and peroxomes and reduced numbers compared to wild type. Arabid Kβ mutants had reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pollen. Adding H2O2 in vitro compensated reduced ROS levels, and overexpressing Arabid CATAL 3 reduced hydration on stigma. These results indicate Arabid Kβ regulates ROS by mediating biogenesis of mitochond and peroxomes, required for pollen-stigma interactions during pollination.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the enzyme RNase III plays a crucial role in protecting the cell from the expression of toxin genes carried by two types of viruses called prophages, Skin and SP. This is done through a process called antisense RNA, where RNase cleaves double-stranded RNA. While many organisms use RNase or its homologs as part of a defense mechanism against viruses, Bacillus subtil requires RNase for survival, making its presence essential. Researchers found that two toxin-encoding mRNAs, txA and yT, from Skin and SP prophages are sensitive to RNase. They explored the mechanism of RNase-mediated decay of txA mRNA paired with its antisense RNA, both in the cell and in a lab dish. The study showed that RNase in Bacillus subtil is not related to its function in RNA metabolism or ribosome maturation, but rather to degrading toxin-encoding mRNAs from viruses. In the absence of these viruses, the RNase gene can be deleted without affecting growth. The researchers also found that other enzymes involved in RNA maturation can function without RNase, and that RNase contributes little to stability of many antisense RNAs. RNase has been shown to be involved in bacterial defense against phages in other species and in eukaryotes, where it plays a role in RNA interference and microRNA generation.
Researchers have studied how the parasitic worm Brugia malayi, which causes Lymphatic Filariasis, releases tiny particles called extracellular vesicles (EVs) that contain proteins and RNA to manipulate the host's biology. They found that EVs are released by all stages of the worm's life cycle, from microfilar to adult, and are taken up by host cells in the same way, suggesting a uniform mechanism for delivering effectors. Proteins in EVs from adult male and female worms differ, revealing sex-specific characteristics. The drug ivermectin inhibits EV release from all worm stages, but not in a drug-resistant isolate, suggesting a potential mechanism for its action and new ways to develop anti-filar drugs.
A recent study in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands found that scabies and impigo are common skin conditions affecting many people, especially children. The study included 190 residents from 10 rural villages and found that 19.2% had scabies and 32.7% had impigo. Scabies was most common in infants under 1 year old and children 1-4 years old, while impigo was most common in children 1-4 years old. Scabies was associated with impigo, with 41% of imp cases also having scabies. The study suggests that controlling scabies could reduce the burden of both conditions and their complications.
Researchers have found a link between the number of new brain cells being created in the hippocampus and a type of immune cells called T cells in adult mice. The hippocampus is a part of the brain that helps with memory and learning. The study looked at 719 mice and found that the more T cells there were, the more new brain cells were being created. This was true even when the mice were not sick or injured. The researchers also found that the genetic makeup of the mice affected the number of T cells and new brain cells. They looked at mice without T cells and found that they had fewer new brain cells. This suggests that T cells play a role in creating new brain cells in the hippocampus. The study also found that genetic variation in mice affected the number of T cells and new brain cells. This means that some mice naturally have more T and new brain cells than others. The study looked at many mice and found that the link between T and new brain cells was stronger than other traits. The study suggests that T play a bigger role in creating new brain cells than thought.
Researchers have developed a vaccine, called TVac, to protect against Chagas disease, a major health problem in Latin America and emerging in the US. They identified potential vaccine candidates by analyzing the Trypanosoma cruzi database and tested TVac in a mouse model. The vaccine consisted of DNA and protein components and cytokines IL-12 and GMF. Mice were immunized with TVac and then infected with Trypanosoma cruzi parasites. TVac induced a strong antibody response and moderate lymphocyte proliferation in mice. Upon infection, TVac-vaccinated mice expanded antibodies and elicited a CD8 T cell response with type 1 cytokines, controlling parasite burden. In the chronic phase, antibody persisted and CD8 cells and type 1 cytokines subsided, while type 2 cytokines became dominant. TVac-vaccinated mice had undetectable parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in heart and skeletal muscle. In contrast, mice with vector or cytokines only had a mixed response and persistent parasite burden in myocardium. TVac-induced type 1 and lymphocyte responses provided resistance to acute infection and prevented chronic immunology. This is the first report of a vaccine reducing parasite below detection in chronic animals. TVac elicited a strong antibody response after challenge. The vaccine included antigens were conserved among strains and expressed in infective stages. Immunized mice had significant anti-parasitic responses. This vaccine is a promising approach.
Researchers used a machine-learning approach called Support Vector Machine (SVM) to assess the risk of developing type 1 diabetes (T1) based on genetic data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). They tested this approach on three large datasets and found that it accurately predicted disease risk with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84. In contrast, using only a few known susceptibility loci resulted in poor performance. The study suggests that taking into account many genetic markers can improve disease assessment. The researchers used a dataset from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCC) and the Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes (GoD) consortium. They found that the VM algorithm worked well with hundreds of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) but not with just a few. This approach can be applied to other diseases where a significant risk has been captured by arrays. The study shows that genetic risk assessment may be feasible for complex diseases.
Researchers studied how memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that helps fight infection, behave in the skin during a secondary infection. They found that these cells can enter the skin without needing to go through lymph nodes, which are like traffic hubs for immune cells, and provide protection against a virus called Vaccinia. This is different from naive CD8 cells, which need to go through nodes to fight infection. Memory CD8 cells become cytotoxic, meaning they kill infected cells, and then differentiate into CD69+ residents, which stay in the skin and help fight future infections. They also found that these cells use a protein called granzyme to kill infected cells. This study shows how memory CD8 cells work in the skin and how they can be used to make vaccines more effective.
Myosin VI, a type of motor protein, plays a crucial role in the distribution of proteins on the surface of axons in neurons. Axons and dendrites, the two main parts of a neuron, have distinct compositions and functions due to the way proteins are targeted to them. Myosin VI, a minus-directed motor, helps enrich proteins on the surface of axons by stimulating a process called endocytosis, where proteins are taken in from the dendrite membrane to the axon. In experiments, a protein was engineered to bind to Myos VI and was found on the surface of axons in mouse neurons, suggesting it could be used to study neuron function. Myos VI helps shape the distribution of proteins on axons and dendrites, necessary for proper electrical signaling.
Researchers have identified a gene called DmaD1 in the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna that plays a key role in determining the sex of the organism. This gene is unusual because it is controlled by environmental factors rather than genetics, unlike most other sex-determining mechanisms. DmaD1 is similar to a gene found in insects, which are thought to be closely related to crustaceans. However, the way it is expressed is different. In insects, the gene is spliced differently in males and females, but in Dnia, the amount of transcripts is what differs. The gene is only expressed in males during development and is found in male structures. Disrupting the gene in males results in female traits, while adding it to females results in male-like traits. Another gene, Dma2, was also found but did not have a clear effect on sex. These findings show that Dma1 is crucial for male development and reveal how environmental sex is controlled by a conserved genetic component. This suggests an ancient link between genetic and environmental sex-determin.
A new vaccine against genital herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is urgently needed to prevent pain and suffering, reduce the incidence of neonatal herpes, and decrease the risk of HIV transmission that accompanies genital infection. Researchers evaluated a trivalent HSV-2 subunit vaccine administered with CpG and alum in rhes macaques and guinea pigs. The vaccine contains glycoproteins C, D, and E (C, D, E) to block virus entry by D and immune evasion by C and E. In rhes macques, the trivalent vaccine induced plasma and mucosal neutralizing antibodies that block C and E immune activities and stimulated CD T cell responses. After vaginal challenge, self-limited infection of brief duration was detected by histology and immunohistochemistry in naïve, but not trivalent immunized macques. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in guinea pigs. Animals were mock immunized or immunized with D, the trivalent or trivalent followed by booster D. The trivalent and tr groups were 97% and 99% efficacious in preventing lesions and outperformed D alone. As marker of transmission, vaginal swabs were evaluated for HSV-2 DNA and replication between five and seven weeks after. HSV-2 DNA was reduced in all compared with mock. Shedding of replication virus occurred fewer in tr than D immunized animals while tr D group had no shedding replication virus. Overall, trivalent had lesions <1% and shedding replication virus 0.2%. The vaccine has potential for prevention of herpes in humans.
Researchers have developed a new method called Perm-se to map protein-DNA interactions in highly repetitive regions of the genome. These regions are difficult to study because short DNA sequences from these areas can match multiple locations in the genome, leading to incorrect results. Perm-se uses data from other experiments like DNase-seq and histone ChIP-se to improve mapping accuracy. The method was tested on 64 ENCODE ChIP-se datasets and found many new protein-DNA interactions in segment duplications. These interactions are less conserved across species but share characteristics with non-repet regions. 

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed sequencing (Ch-se) is a way to study protein binding and histone modifications. It generates millions of short DNA sequences. Mapping these to the genome is the first step in analysis. To study repetitive regions, a new method called Perm-se was created. It uses DNase-se and histone Ch-se data to find where reads come from. DNase-se shows open chromatin regions with transcription factors. Perm-se was tested on ENCODE Ch-se datasets and found many new protein-DNA targets in duplications. These interactions share characteristics with nonpet regions. A model was made to use DNase data to map reads in Perm-se. It's versatile and can use other data like histone Ch-se.
Schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection affecting over 218 million people worldwide, particularly in Africa, may increase the risk of HIV-1 acquisition and impair control of HIV-1 replication in those infected. Researchers conducted a nested case-control study in Tanzania to investigate the effects of schistosiasis on HIV-1 susceptibility and viral load at HIV-1 seroconversion. Approximately 40% of the population had Schistoma mans infection and 2% had S. haematium. The study found that women with schist infections had a higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition than those without, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.8 (1.2-6.6, p=0.019). In contrast, sch-infected men did not have an increased odds of HIV-1 acquisition. The study also found that HIV-1 RNA levels in post-serconversion blood of HIV-1 serconverters with schosias were significantly higher than those without schias, with a median of 4.4 (3.9-4.6) log copies/mL versus 3.7 (3.2-4.3, p=0.017). The study confirms that pre-existing schist infection increases HIV-1 susceptibility in women and raises viral load at HIV-1 serconversion.
Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) is a highly variable region in the human genome, with varying copy number and sequence. Despite its importance for cellular function, little is known about its stability and regulation in mammalian genomes due to analysis challenges. Researchers used computational and droplet digital PCR to measure rDNA in normal and cancer states in human and mouse genomes. They found that number and sequence can change in cancer. Counterintuitively, human cancer genomes show loss of copies, accompanied by global number variation. The sequence is also more variable in cancer genomes. Genomes with lower copies have mutational evidence of mTOR activity. The PTEN phosphatase is a tumor suppressor critical for genome stability and negative regulator of mTOR pathway. Surprisingly, consistent with human genomes, hematopoietic cancer cells from PTEN-/- mouse model leukemia have lower rDNA number than normal, despite increased RNA and protein production. Loss occurs early and is associated with hypersensitivity to damage. Loss is a feature in cancers with m activation. rDNA number may be a simple indicator of cancer sensitivity to DNA treatments.

Researchers used a mouse model for PTEN/- leukemia to assess rDNA in hematopoietic stem cells. Surprisingly, rDNA number is reduced in genomes with m activation, providing that number can be altered naturally. They also found co-occurring number of additional genes and single nucleotide variation in repeats. Number can be estimated from whole-genome and dro digital PCR. The plethora of genome projects allows comparison between number in tumor and normal from individual. They used these to analyze rDNA changes in different and cancer. In summary, rDNA number and sequence change in cancer, with m activity associated contractions and damage. This comes possibility to target loci. Cells with low number may be sensitive DNA agents.
Researchers have developed a new approach to study how bacteria spread and grow inside the body during an infection. They used special strains of Salmonella, a type of bacteria, that are genetically identical but can be distinguished with a test. This allowed them to track the bacteria in different parts of the body and understand how they interact with the immune system. The study found that after infection starts, some bacteria die and multiply quickly, creating separate groups in different organs, controlled by the body's defenses. Later, more bacteria survive and spread to other parts of the body through the blood, with some dying off in the process. This new method provides a detailed look at how Salmonella infections work, showing complex and random events drive the disease. It can be applied to other host-bacteria combinations, giving a complete view of inside dynamics.
Researchers have been trying to figure out how our brains process 3D motion from what we see with two eyes, but existing ideas don't fully solve the problem. A new approach combines velocity, binocular disparity, and other cues to better understand 3D motion. In the "aperture problem", two strategies emerge: (1) preferring slow motion in 3D and (2) cyclopean based on slow 2D motion. Predicting ambiguous motion helps distinguish between these strategies. Theoretical results show velocity and disparity from tracking are needed to solve 3D motion. It's possible motion and disparity are processed in parallel and integrated in the visual hierarchy.

 Current models of 3D motion are insufficient to solve the inverse problem of binocular 3 motion. Velocity in binocular geometry shows additional information is necessary to disambiguate velocity and derive an estimate. Integration of motion and disparity with other cues can solve the problem, allowing the system to bind local inputs into a global 3D percept. Geometrically, two planes in binocular geometry define a line in 3 velocity space. Tracking features in depth with bin velocity provides a strategy to disiguate 3D direction and solve the problem.

Three approaches have been proposed: interocular difference, changing over time, and joint motion and disparity. However, results have been inconclusive and the nature of 3D processing remains unresolved.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes an O-acetylated polysaccharide alginate during chronic infection in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients to form a protective biofilm matrix. Four proteins, AlgF, AlgI, AlgJ, and AlgX, have been implicated in O-acetylation of alginate. To probe the function of AlgJ, its structure was determined to 1.83 resolution. Alg is a SGN hydrolase-like protein, structurally similar to the N-terminal of AlgX, but with a distinctly different electrostatic surface. A conserved catalytic triad of D190, H192 and S288 was identified, and Alg exhibits acetylease activity in vitro. Residues in Alg signature motifs form extensive interactions critical for O-acylation of alg in vivo. Alg and AlgX were compared using electrospray ion mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) for binding and acylation of alginate. Alg exhibits weak or no binding, while Alg binds polymannonic acid in a length-dependent manner. Alg can utilize surrogate acetyl donor 4-nitrophenyl acetate to catalyze O-acylation of polymuric acid. Our results suggest Alg and Alg have separate roles in Oetylation. A refined model for alg acylation places Alg as terminal transferase, providing rationale for variability in proteins required for polyschar Oetylation.
Candida albicans is a common cause of fungal infections and a major source of mortality. To avoid detection by the immune system, it masks its cell wall with a layer of heavily glycosylated mannrote (man) that covers β (1,3)-gluc. However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can expose β(1,3)-uc, making it detectable by immune cells like Dect-1, a C-type lectin. Our lab found that the phospholipid phosphatylser (PS) synthase Cho plays a role in β(1,3)-uc masking. A mutant lacking this enzyme, choΔ, has more exposed β(1,3)-uc. Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase (MAP) and Rho small Gases regulate cell wall biogenesis and remodeling. In choΔ, both C1 and M1 MAPs are activated and act downstream of Gases C42 and R1. C42 is upregulated in choΔ. We hypothesized that activating C42 or R1 and their kinases cause unmasking. Disrupting M1 doesn't decrease unmask inΔ, and hyperactivating R1 in wild-type increases unmask and activates C1 and M1. Hyperactivating Ste11 in wild-type leads to C1 activation and β(1)-uc exposure. Upregulating C1 causes unmask and may be responsible for unmask inΔ.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to better understand the genetic factors contributing to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias. They analyzed data from 4,914 brain autopsies to identify genetic links between known risk loci and neuropathologic features of AD, such as neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, Lewy body disease, hippocampal sclerosis, and vascular injury. The study found significant associations with clinico-path AD, neuritic plaques, neurofibr tangles, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and Lew body disease. Variants in the apolipoprotein E (APO) gene were strongly linked to these features. Other genetic loci, including GALNT, ABC1, KCMB2, and a region on chromosome 9, were also associated with specific neuropath features. The study confirmed 12 of 21 known genetic loci for clinically-defined AD in the clin-path sample, including CR1, BIN, CL, MSA, PICAL, ABC7, CD, P2, SOR, MEF, ZWP, and C4. Nine of these loci showed a larger effect in the clin-path sample. The study also found correlations between risk of AD and neuropath features, with positive for neuritic plaques and neurofibr tangles, and negative for vascular injury.
Researchers have long used urea as a denaturant to study protein unfolding, but its role in the process remains unclear. Does urea actively unfold proteins or stabilize the unfolded state? To answer this, scientists analyzed 30 proteins with different folds through molecular simulations using various force fields. They found rules for urea unfolding that apply to all proteins, regardless of fold, disulfide bridges, or secondary structure. Urea concentrates in the protein's solvation shell, but at a lower density than the unfolded state. It doesn't alter protein vibrations, but reduces their magnitude, slowing down atomic motions that oppose unfolding. Urea's stickiness and diffusion are crucial for unfolding. Long urea molecules near hydrophobic cores stabilize partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations. Simulations show ure doesn't favor open states, but actively unfolds, selecting and stabilizing partially unfolded states, driving the protein away from native and thermal conformations.

Urea's role is driven by van der Waals and H-bonding, which stabilize long-living interactions near hinge points, biasing protein dynamics towards unfolding. This study provides a complete picture of ure's role in destabilizing proteins and its unfolding mechanisms. Urea is a denatur used for decades, but its properties remain elusive. The dominant "direct" mechanism claims ure interacts with exposed residues more than water. Simulations at 8M, 368K detected unfolding, but progress was smaller than stable proteins. Unfolding at 368 is independent of fold, structure, and similar with and without disulf bridges.
A systematic review of epidemiological studies on deng disease in Colombia between 2000 and 201 found a stable annual number of deng fever cases, with major outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. The disease spread of deng cases increased, with most of the country affected by 2010. The majority of deng cases were among those under 15 years old. There are gaps in knowledge on asymptomatic deng virus infection, primary infections, and underreporting of the disease. Understanding factors that determine disease expression is important for better control and management.

The review describes national and regional trends, incidence by age and sex, seroprevalence and serotype, and other data. It's part of a series on deng disease in the Americas and Asia. It highlights non-severe deng cases in 2010 in Colombia. There's a lack of information on asymptomatic d virus, secondary infections, and underreporting. Improved surveillance can address these gaps.

There was a 90% increase in municipalities with deng cases from 200 to 2010. Incidence was low in south and south Colombia due to low population density. D is a priority in Colombia and control has been difficult. The period had a stable number of cases with major outbreaks.
Leishmaniasis (TL) is a disease that affects the skin and mucous tissues caused by Leish parasites. People with TL may also have other infections that can affect the outcome of the disease. This review looks at how often TL coinfections happen in people, how Leish and other pathogens interact in animals and humans, and what it means for treatment. TL is defined as all forms of cutaneous, localized, disseminated, or mucocutaneous leishias. HIV coinfection, superinfection with bacteria, and skin manifestations of leishiasis are not included.

Research found 73 records: 21 studies in animals and 52 in humans, mainly cross-sectional and case studies. Reports show that Trypanosoma cruzi coinfection in TL patients in Argentina is about 41% and helminthias in TL in Brazil 15-88%. Different ideas have been explored about how different microorganisms interact, but no clear answers. Interactions may involve innate immunity and regulatory networks that affect quality and quantity of immune responses. Problems occur when infections cause similar lesions (e.g., TL and leprosy), when pathogens are in same lesions (e.g., Leish and Sporothrix schenii), or similarities between pathogens affect diagnostic tests (e.g., serology leishias and Chagas). Coinfections (e.g., helthias) reduce effectiveness of antileishial treatment and combinations cause cumulative effects. In TL, coinfection is frequent, it leads to diagnostic delays and affects treatment effectiveness and safety.
Researchers studied how genetic variations in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) affect the development of immune cells called CD4 and CD8 T cells in rats. The MHC is a group of genes that helps the immune system distinguish between self and non-self. The study found that genetic variations in the MHC region influenced the expression of MHC proteins and the ratio of CD4 to CD cells. However, they didn't know which specific genes in the M region were responsible. They used two rat models to study the impact of genetic variation on M expression and CD4 CD lineage. First, they mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with variation in M class I and II protein and CD4 CD cell ratio in outbred heterogeneous rats. They found 10 QTL across the genome and that QTL for individual traits colocalized in a region spanning M. To identify genes underlying QTL, they generated a panel of M recombinant congenic strains and refined QTL to intervals of 0.25 Mb in M I and II regions. An interaction between intervals affected M class I expression and negative selection of CD single positive thymocytes. They mapped effect to transporter associated antigen 2 (Tap) in M region and classical M class gene (RT-A) in I region. This was revealed by recombination between RT-A and Tap, occurring in 0.2% of rats. Variants of Tap alter antigenicity of M class molecules by changing M class ligandome. Results showed restricted repertoire M class molecules led to negative selection CD cells.
Researchers studied hospital records in Spain from 1997 to 2011 to understand how Chagas disease evolved in the country. Chagas is a disease caused by a parasite and is common in Latin America. Many people from Latin America migrate to Spain, making it the European country with the most infected patients. The study found 1,729 hospitalizations due to Chagas, with 31.6% being re-admissions. Hospital rates increased from 18 to 242.8 per 100,000 people between 199-2004 and 2005-201. Most patients (75.3%) had no complications, while 23.4% had complications, mostly heart-related. 84.6% had invasive medical procedures. The majority (69.8%) were between 16-45 years old and 55.6% were female. Those with complications were more likely to be male, over 45, with Chagas as main diagnosis, history of re-admission, and high hospital cost over 3,065 euros.
Researchers have long known that many genetic markers are linked to various diseases, but a significant portion of the genetic contribution to these diseases remains unknown. This "missing heritability" is thought to be due to interactions between multiple genetic factors, but finding these interactions has been challenging due to complexity and genetic diversity. A new approach, called Blocuster, has been developed to identify and analyze these interactions across the entire genome. Blocuster uses a measure that accounts for single nucleotide polymorphisms and captures genetic diversity. It was applied to study psoriasis, a chronic skin condition, and found a combination of 17 genetic markers associated with the disease. This combination had an odds ratio of 3.64 and p-value of 5.01×10^-16. The result was replicated in independent data, showing the method's robustness. Blocuster improves disease prediction and understanding of psoriasis, and demonstrates its ability to find interactions in complex genetic data.
Researchers studied the genetic causes of three severe brain malformations: agenesis of the corpus callo (ACC), cerebal hypoplasia (CH), and polymicrogyria (PM). They analyzed the chromosomal copy variations (CN) in 255 ACC, 220 CH, and 147 patients and 2,349 controls. The study found that ACC patients had significantly more rare and large CNs than controls, but not CH or PM. Rare CNs are those that affect less than 1% of the population. ACC patients had more CNs impacting 20 genes than controls. Independent PCR confirmed 9.4% of ACC patients had de novo CNs, which are new mutations not inherited. These CNs overlapped with those in patients with autism spectrum disorders. Reports show reduced corpus callo area in autistic patients and social and executive function in ACC. The study found known and new CNs, including a 8p23.1-p11 duplication in 2% of ACC. Novel CNs in single patients were likely deletions and duplications. One patient with microcephaly had paternally inherited deletion 16.13 that included N1. Exome sequencing revealed recessive matern inherited mutation in N1. This is the first study of CN in congenital malations, showing higher large CNs in ACC than CH and PM.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called Yorkie in the regeneration of planarians, a type of flatworm that can regrow lost body parts. They found that Yorkie helps control how planarians respond to injury by regulating cell growth, cell death, and tissue patterning. Without York, planarians grow too many cells, have trouble differentiating, and their tissues don't form correctly. The researchers used a technique to turn off York in planarians and found that they grew too many skin and muscle cells, and had trouble sensing the size of their new body parts. They also found that York helps planarians respond to injury by controlling genes that are turned on after an injury. Without York, these genes are turned on too much and for too long. The study suggests York is a key molecule that helps planarians integrate their response to injury, including growth, cell death, and patterning.
Researchers have discovered that the exosomes released by cells infected with the EV71 virus contain a specific type of RNA called miR-146, which helps the virus to replicate by suppressing the host's immune response. Exosomes are tiny particles that can transfer genetic material between cells and play a role in viral infections. The study found that EV71 infection increases exosome secretion and packaging of viral RNA and mi-146, with mi-146 being enriched in exosomes and not in infected cells. Exosomes with viral RNA and mi-146 can transfer to new cells and replicate, while mi-146 suppresses type I interferon response, a key part of the immune system, allowing the virus to replicate. The study also found that certain genes involved in the immune response, BST-2/tether, regulate exosome secretion in EV71 infection. In a study, exosomal RNA accumulated in tissues more than free virus particles. The findings show that exosomes secreted by EV-infected cells package high levels of mi-146 that can functionally transfer and facilitate EV RNA replication in cells by suppressing type interferon response.
Researchers studied the relationship between two genes, PINK and Parkin, which are linked to early-onset Parkinson's disease. PINK is a kinase that helps maintain healthy mitochondria, while Parkin is a protein that breaks down damaged mitochondria. They found a new protein, PG5, that binds to PINK and helps it work properly. Without PG5, PINK doesn't work well and mitochondria degenerate, leading to muscle degeneration and shorter lifespan in fruit flies. However, PG doesn't affect Parkin's function. Overexpressing PG makes PINK and Park problems worse. This suggests PG regulates PINK to keep mitochondria healthy and acts between PINK and Park or after PINK. PINK recruits Park to damaged mitochond to break them down through a process called mitagy. Without PINK, Park can't do this. Parkin mutations also cause mitochondrial degeneration in some tissues like PINK. PG5 is involved in the PINK pathway, so they tested if it affects Park's effects. Reducing fusion or increasing fission proteins rescues PINK and Park phenotypes. PG5 binds PINK and modulates PINK phenotypes. Losing PG5 has little effect on PINK lifespan. The study shows PG5 regulates PINK in flies, but more research is needed to understand how and if it could help treat PINK-related Parkinson's.
Researchers investigated the role of interferon-γ in the immune response to Mycobacterium ulcerans, the bacteria that causes Buruli ulcer, a chronic skin disease. They found that interferon- is crucial in early defense against the infection. Mice lacking interferon-γ had faster disease progression, more tissue damage, and more bacteria after five weeks. This suggests interfer- helps kill bacteria inside cells early in the infection. The study supports the idea that a vaccine against tuberculosis may also work for Buruli. Previous studies showed that some people can recover from Buruli and that a vaccine can help, but how the immune system clears the bacteria is not fully understood. The researchers found that interfer- is key in this process, as mice without it had more severe disease and more bacteria. This is similar to how the body fights tuberculosis, but Buruli has a toxin that kills cells and causes damage. The study shows interfer- is important in early defense against Buruli.
Mitochondrial respiration plays a crucial role in producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are linked to various diseases. However, the mechanism of hypoxia-induced ROS production is not fully understood. Researchers developed a new methodology to model electron transport in mitochondria, identifying two steady states of operation for respiratory complex III at the same conditions. Various perturbations can switch the chain from one state to another. Normally, complex is a low ROS producer, but anoxia can switch it to a high ROS state, persisting after oxygen return. This prediction was experimentally validated, explaining anox-induced cell damage. Bistability of complex operation may lead to new therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress. The model can be used in biology studies.

A great challenge in studying ROS production is the lack of tools for systematic analysis. Combinations of oxidized and reduced electron transporters create 400 redox states, which must be considered in analysis. Complex can operate in low or high ROS modes at same parameters, explaining ROS difference before and after anox. Experiments confirm two ROS states in mitochondria at same conditions and switching by AD and anox. Significantly higher ROS were released upon oxygen resumption. The damaging effect of rexygen after anox is known, but data show ania increase in ROS levels.

A method constructs equations for each redox based on reactions between transporters and biochemical mechanism. This allows expanding the model, including other transport and metabolism, substrates, transmembrane potential. The method opens direction for detailed analysis bioenergetic systems.
Researchers studied the role of a gene called huckin (Hkb) in the development of fruit fly embryos. Hkb is part of a network of genes that determines the position of body segments along the anterior-posterior axis during early development. The team used a systems-level approach to investigate how Hkb affects the expression of other genes in this network. They found that Hkb is involved in the regulation of the posterior domain of another gene called hunchback (hb) and is required for its anterior shift. This means Hkb helps determine the border of the hb domain. The researchers also created mathematical models of the gene network, called gap circuits, to understand how Hkb and other genes interact. These models were able to reproduce the expression of all posterior genes and some properties of the system correctly. This is an important step towards understanding the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gene network.
Researchers have developed a new treatment for brucellosis, a zoonotic disease that causes significant economic losses worldwide. Current treatments are ineffective and animals remain carriers for life. The new treatment uses phage lysates of Brucella abortus strains 19 and 51, which are live attenuated forms of the bacteria. These phage lysates stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies and cell-mediated immunity. In a study, 21 bruclos affected cows were given a single dose of phage lysate subcutaneously, and within 3 months, the bacteria were undetectable in their blood. This is the first time a non-invasive method to monitor treatment effectiveness using RNA specific to the bacteria as a biomarker. The phage lysates were safe in mice and showed strong immune response in cows. The study suggests phage lysate of Bruc abortus 19 and 51 can be used to treat bruclos in cattle.
Researchers have found that a specific cyclin-dependent kinase, Cdk2, plays a crucial role in helping cells respond to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation. They discovered this by creating a mutant version of Cdk that can be inhibited by a specific chemical, and showing that cells with this mutant C2 are more sensitive to radiation damage. They also found that C2 phosphorylates, or adds a phosphate to, a protein called N1, which is part of a complex that helps fix DNA damage and trigger a response. When C2 is inhibited, N1 is not phosphorylated, and cells are more sensitive to radiation. This suggests that C2 is necessary for cells to respond to DNA damage and that N1 is a target of C2 in this process. This study shows that C2 has a specific role in DNA response, contrary to previous idea that all CDKs are equal in this process.
Researchers used a technique called formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to map regulatory regions of the genome associated with hematological traits, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction in megakarycytic and erythroblast cells. They found that the two cell types of cells have distinct patterns of open chromatin, and that open chrom can guide the finding of functional variants. They identified an open region on chromosome 7q22.3 in megaryocytes but not erythroblasts, which harbors a non-coding variant rs342 known to be associated with platelet volume and function. Resequencing this region in 643 individuals provided strong evidence that rs342 is the causative variant. They showed that C and G differentially bind transcription factor EV1 affecting PI3KCG expression in platelets and macrophages. A protein interaction network in Pikcg knockout mice indicated PI3 is associated with pathways in platelet biogenesis and thrombus formation. This is the first variant to be elucidated among known platelet quantitative loci.
Researchers studied how blocking a type of electrical current called persistent sodium current (INa) affects breathing circuits in the body. They used computer simulations to show that blocking INa with two different medications, tetrodotoxin (TX) and ruzole (R), has different effects. This challenges the common assumption that blocking INa with any medication has the same effect. TX directly blocks the sodium channel, while R shifts the current in the opposite direction. In experiments, blocking IN with TX or R showed IN is crucial for breathing rhythm in isolated neurons and networks. However, simulations show that R may not block IN in intact networks due to its mechanism and interactions. In contrast, low concentrations of TX can block IN and stop breathing rhythm. The study suggests IN plays a role in breathing and highlights the importance of considering medication mechanism when interpreting data.
Researchers have found that a microRNA called mi-218 plays a crucial role in preventing the spread of stomach cancer, or gastric cancer. They discovered that when mi-218 levels are low, a protein called Robo1 is overproduced, which helps cancer cells invade and spread. Rob1 interacts with another protein called Slit to trigger this process. Restoring mi-218 levels suppresses Rob1 and stops cancer cells from invading and spreading in lab and animal tests. This study reveals a new mechanism of how cancer spreads and suggests targeting mi-218 could be a way to stop it. 

In stomach cancer, Rob1 is often overproduced and helps cancer grow and spread by interacting with Slit. To see if Rob1 is controlled by mi-218, the researchers made a Rob1 construct with a part of the mi-218 binding site and a Rob1 mutant without the 3-UTR. They also made Rob1 siRNA. The relationship between mi-218 and Rob1 was confirmed by immunohistochemistry in 40 stomach cancer and normal tissues. Results show Rob1 is up in cancer, especially in spreading cancer with low mi-218. 

Rob1 is an axon guidance receptor for Sl and conserved in animals. Three Sl (Sl1-3) and four Rob (Rob1-4) have been described. Induction of Rob1 by the Rob1 construct without mi-218 site reversed mi-218 suppression of tumor invasion. Knockdown Rob1 by RNA had effect like restoring mi-218, but Rob1 alone weak.
Researchers investigated how lowering cholesterol levels in the blood affects the development of atherosclerosis, a condition that can lead to heart disease and stroke. They studied mice with high cholesterol levels similar to humans with a genetic switch to lower cholesterol production in the liver. Lesions developed slowly at first, then grew rapidly and plateaued. Analysis of the lesions showed that a buildup of lipids in macrophages led to rapid expansion and inflammation. Lowering cholesterol prevented formation of advanced plaques and identified 37 genes that respond to cholesterol. Validation in macrophages showed a network of 8 genes regulating cholesterol accumulation. The study found a network of genes that prevents plaque formation when cholesterol is lowered, which could lead to new therapies for atherosclerosis.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify genes involved in the assembly of the outer layer of Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli. coli. This layer is a barrier that makes it hard for drugs to kill the bacteria, and new treatments are needed to fight infections caused by these microbes. The method, called CPR, is a high-throughput and quantitative, and was used to screen a library of single-gene deletions in E. coli. coli. It correctly identified known genes involved in assembly and 102 unknown genes that likely play a role. One of these, Ely (YC), was studied further and found to be important in the production of a lipid used to build the outer layer and other surface molecules. Further study of Ely and other hits may reveal how the outer layer is made and weaknesses to target with drugs. The CPR method can be used to study other bacteria to understand their outer layer and how it adapts to different environments. Understanding the outer layer is key to fighting resistance, as many drugs are ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria. Recent progress has been made in identifying essential machines for outer assembly, but many aspects remain unknown, including how the layers are coordinated. Study of these may reveal new targets to block growth or make the layer permeable to drugs. The discovery of Ely as a new factor validates the CPR approach. Its role in lipid metabolism is consistent with data, including production or recycling of a key molecule in many surface molecules. This has implications for understanding how the outer is made.
Researchers have developed a new method to combine different types of data from various sources into a single, unified view of complex biological processes. This is a challenge in studying developmental biology, where multiple techniques provide unique insights into the system. They used a semi-supervised learning approach that takes advantage of the structure in high-dimensional data to fuse datasets. This was applied to a study of fruit fly development, resulting in a continuous trajectory of gene expression, protein, cell location, and tissue formation. The method can be adapted to other imaging techniques and is a starting point for further analysis and modeling of biological dynamics.

A dataset of 1,000 images showed the position of nuclei and distribution of several components in the patterning network. The semi-supervised approach combined labeled and unlabeled data, resulting in a trajectory of joint dynamics of tissue and molecular components. This is a representative of multivar dynamics in living systems.

The task of synthesizing data from different observations into coherent trajectories is a problem in various fields, but systematic approaches have not been established. The researchers addressed this for imaging of developing tissues, where cell fates are established by complex networks. By posing data fusion as a semi-supervised problem, they obtained a closed-form expression for estimated values using harmonic extension. The trajectories provide basis for advanced studies of multivar processes responsible for reproducible pattern formation.
Researchers studied three types of snake venom metalloproteinases (PI, PII, and PIII) to understand how they cause hemorrhage by damaging blood vessels. They found that PII and PIII enzymes were more likely to be found in blood vessel walls, particularly in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillary venules, while PI was more widespread in the tissue. The enzymes broke down different components of the extracellular matrix, such as lamin, type collagen, and nidogen, but all three broke down type IV collagen equally. This suggests that breaking down type IV collagen is key to destabilizing blood vessel structure and causing hemorrhage. Analysis of fluid collected from damaged tissue showed that PI broke down more extracellular components and fibrin, while PII and P broke more intracellular proteins. The study provides new insights into how these enzymes damage blood vessels and cause hemorrhage.
In fruit flies, the order of homeotic genes on a chromosome determines the body segments they affect. The more posterior genes repress the anterior ones. However, this rule is broken by abdominal-A (ab-A) and abdominal-B (Abd-B). Without Ab-B, Abd shows ectopic expression of ab-A in the epidermis of the 8th segment, but not in the nervous system. A 92 non-coding RNA, "iab-8", represses ab-A by producing a micro RNA. It also has a second, redundant mechanism that acts only "in cis". This mechanism is transcription interference with the ab-A promoter. The i-8 interferes with an ab enhancer, which must be downstream of the i-6 breakpoint, since ab-A is derepressed in CNS embryos with this break. The ab-A promoter is the likely target, as the poly site of i-8 lies 1.1 kb upstream of ab-A and i-8 transcript continues past its site. Embryos with strong ab-A in CNS show i-8 can only repress ab-A on the chromosome it's transcribed from. A deletion of i-8/D9, removing the bithor complex, shows no ab-A misexpression. There are two mechanisms: i8 represses ab-A, through i-8 miRNA (in) and a cis function. Rearranging i-8 near its start cause derepression ab-A in CNS, similar to Df3 homozygotes. The same is seen with Fab deletion removing i-8 promoter.
Researchers have studied the patterns of focal seizures, which are episodes of abnormal brain activity that start in a specific area of the brain. They found two main types: low-amplitude fast (LAF) and high-amplitude (HAS) oscillations. Using a computer model of brain tissue, they simulated these patterns and found that they arise from different mechanisms. LAF starts with small areas of activity that grow over time, while HAS is a sudden change in the whole brain's state triggered by a local event. This change is due to increased excitability of surrounding tissue, which doesn't cause seizures but can support them. Simulations show this difference in excitability explains why some seizures are harder to treat. The model also shows how to measure this excitability using stimulation. The study suggests that the brain's excitability around the seizure area affects the pattern and treatment outcome.
Scientists have discovered a key player in the process of fertilization in plants, a protein called ZES-4, which helps pollen tubes burst and release sperm cells. In flowering plants, sperm cells are transported to the female gamete via the pollen tube, and upon arrival, two sperm cells are released into the synergid cell to fertilize the egg. Researchers found that ZES-4 is expressed in the female gamete and accumulates in vesicles at the secretory zone of syner cells before fertilization. When Z-4 is released, it interacts with a potassium channel called K1, causing it to open and allow potassium to flow in. This influx of potassium leads to water uptake and an osmotic burst, causing the pollen tube to rupture. The team used RNA knockdown and synthetic Z-4 proteins to show that it induces pollen burst in a species-specific manner. They also found that Z-4 converts K1 from a voltage-dependent to non-rectifying channel. The study suggests that Z-4 is released from syner cells upon male-female gamete signaling, and its interaction with K1 leads to channel opening and potassium influx. This mechanism may be a prezygotic barrier and component of reproductive isolation in plants.
Researchers have developed a new approach to treat ovarian and breast cancers that have spread to the peritoneal cavity, a common in advanced cancer patients. They created a virus that specifically targets the HER2 protein, overexpressed in these cancers. The virus, called RM249, infects and kills cancer cells with high levels of HER2. In a study, mice with human ovarian cancer cells implanted in their peritoneum, i.p. administration of RM249 strongly inhibited cancer growth, with 60% free from peritone diffusion and 95% reduction in tumor weight. The virus also reduced growth of breast cancer metastases in the peritone and brain. Importantly, RM is effective against cancer cells resistant to trastuzumab, a common treatment for HER2+ cancers. Previously, RM showed anti-tumor activity against subcutaneously injected ovarian cancer. This study evaluated RM against intraperitoneal cancer, most common in breast cancer. Results show i.p administered RM effectively inhibits peritone dissemination of HER+ ovarian and breast carcinomas.
Researchers have identified a key player in the process of centrosome duplication, a crucial for bipolar spindle formation and genome maintenance. Centrosomes are the poles of the mitotic spindle in eukaryotic cells, and their duplication once per cell cycle is essential for proper spindle organization and chromosome segregation. The study found that Sfi, a conserved component of centomes, is the first cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) substrate required to restrict centome duplication to once cell. Phosphorylation of S1 by Cdk is necessary for separation of duplicated spindle bodies and preventing premature duplication during mitosis. Cells with reduced Cdk phosphorylation of S1 display defects in spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and growth. The researchers propose a model where phosphorelation of S1 by Cdk promotes spindle formation and prevents premature duplication. They also found that proteinase C14 activates licensing by dephosphorylation of S1.
HIV-1 protein Vpr plays a crucial role in accelerating viral replication during acute infection by exploiting proliferating CD4+ T cells, particularly regulatory Tregs, in vivo. Previous studies have shown that V causes G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HIV-1-infected cells in vitro, but its role in vivo was unclear. Using a humanized mouse model, researchers demonstrated that V causes G2 cell arrest and apoptosis in proliferating CCR+ CD+ T cells, mainly Tregs, leading to Treg depletion and enhanced virus production during acute infection. V-dependent replication and Treg depletion observed in C5ropic but not Xropic HIV-1-infected mice, suggesting effects dependent on coreceptor usage by HIV-1. Immune activation seen in Cropic wild-type but not V-deficient HIV-infected humanized mice. Treating mice with denileukin difox (DD) to deplete Tregs showed massive activation/proliferation of memory cells compared to untreated. Activation/prolifer enhanced C5 in memory CD+ cells and made them susceptible to Cropic wild-type HIV-1 than V-deficient virus. Results suggest V takes advantage of proliferating C5 CD+ cells for viremia Cropic HIV-1. Tregs exist in higher state than other subsets, making them vulnerable to V during acute HIV-1 infection.
Researchers studied the genetic changes in the Plasmodium vivax population in South Korea from 1994 to 2008 using microsatellite DNA markers. P. viv was eliminated in Korea in the 1970s but re-emerged in 1993. To control malaria, understanding the parasite's genetic structure is key. The study analyzed 14 microsatellite loci of 163 isolates from 1994 to 200. Results showed a decrease in linkage disequilibrium (LD) and genetic differentiation between years. A Bayesian analysis suggested a drastic change in the population in 2002-2003. Relapse and asymptomatic parasite carriage may have influenced the structure, but results suggest P. viv was introduced from other sources, possibly North Korea in 2002-2003. Molecular epidemiology using microsat DNA is effective for assessing population dynamics and transmission, aiding malaria elimination in endemic areas.
Researchers have discovered that a specific type of intron, a non-coding region in genes, plays a crucial role in regulating the direction of transcription in eukaryotes. They found that the presence of this type of intron, called splicing-competent intr, favors the transcription of mRNA over upstream antisense RNA from a promoter. This is important for proper gene expression and function. The team used a technique called strand-specific transcription run-on analysis to show that the intron affects the direction of transcription. They also found that mutating the 5 or 3 splice site of the intron reverses the direction, suggesting that the entire intron, not just the 5 site, regulates direction. The intron also recruits termination factors near the promoter region, which are proteins that stop transcription. Removing the intr or mutating the splice sites affects the localization of these factors. The team previously showed that intron-mediated transcription is dependent on gene looping, where the DNA forms a loop. They found that looping is crucial for recruiting termination factors to the promoter-prox region of intr-containing genes. In a looping-defective mutant, transcription direction was lost despite normal splicing. The team proposes that the intron-dependent looping places termination factors near the promoter to stop upstream antisense transcription, giving direction to promoter-initiated transcription.
Researchers have identified a novel transcription factor called ZBED, derived from a domesticated DNA transposon, which regulates IGF2 expression and muscle growth. A single nucleotide substitution in the IGF2 gene's intron 3 abrogates a repressor binding site, leading to a 3-fold upregulation of IGF in skeletal muscle, affecting muscle size, heart, and fat deposition. ZBED is specific to placental mammals and silencing it in mouse C2C myoblasts affects IGF expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing identified 2,500 ZBED binding sites in the genome, with a consensus motif matching the established IGF site. Genes associated with ZBED sites are enriched in development and transcription regulation. ZBED's effects in mutant pigs and silenced C2C mylasts, sequence conservation, nucleolar localization, and broad distribution suggest it's an important transcription factor in placental development, proliferation, and growth. ZBED binds to IGF, repressing its expression in skeletal muscle and C2 cells. Genes associated with neurogenesis are overrepresented, despite using C2 mylasts. Transcript analysis is needed to assess Z6's importance for these targets. Disrupting Z6 and IGF interaction leads to I2 upregulation in muscle and altered body composition. Silencing Z6 increases proliferation, myotube formation, and wound healing in C2 cells. Z's ability to interact with chromatin is likely from ancestral transase.
Researchers have mapped the RNA editome of the rhes macaque, a close relative of humans, using next-generation sequencing technology. They found 31,250 editing sites, with 99.8% being A-to-G transitions, and verified 96.6% in coding and 97.5 in non-coding regions. The study shows that adenosine deamination is associated with A-to-G editing, and the sequence and expression of ADAR (adenosine deaminase) enzymes determine editing levels across sites and tissues. Some editing sites are conserved across primate species, suggesting functional relevance. The study provides a framework for understanding RNA editing in humans and highlights its role in primate evolution.
Researchers have discovered a new perceptual bias that affects how people perceive visual stimuli in a two-alternative discrimination tasks. In these tasks, observers try to determine which of two possible stimuli caused a certain responses. To do this, they integrate noisy neural signals into a reliable representation of the likelihood of each stimulus. Ideally, they should evaluate the likelihood with high precision and consider only the relevant stimuli. However, a new study found that observers read the representation with low precision when discriminating spatial frequencies. By using spectrally filtered noise, an asymmetry was induced in the likelihood of spatial frequencies. This mainly affected frequencies irrelevant to the task, yet a shift in perceived frequency was found, indicating observers evaluate a range of irrelevant frequencies and discard prior knowledge of alternatives.

In an experiment, visual noise altered perception of known gratings in a two-altern spatial discrimination, shifting frequency to lower and higher frequencies in low-pass and high filtered conditions. Observers considered unlikely frequencies, lowering detectability and biasing perceived frequency. Log functions were asymmetrical around vertical frequency in low and high filtered noise. Gratings were presented at high contrasts, corresponding to 84% detection in broadband noise. High performance and steep psychometric functions indicate decisions based on vertical frequency.

The study differs from traditional models of visual encoding gratings in noise, which assume noise affects variability without changing average response. Grating detectability and discriminability were measured in filtered noise, showing dramatic alteration of perceived frequency. Low-pass noise decreased frequency, while high-pass increased.
Researchers have discovered that in Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of worm, small RNAs called piRNAs play a crucial role in defending the genome against foreign genetic elements. These piRNAs are derived from a long, polycistronic RNA, but in Caenorhabdis elegans, each piRNA is a tiny, autonomous transcription unit. A short sequence of 21 nucleotides and an upstream motif of 50 nucleotides with limited genomic context are required for expression. The researchers used computational analysis and a new in vivo system to show that the upstream motif is necessary for gerine-enriched, Pi-dependent piRNA expression. They found that a single nucleotide in the motif determines gerine enrichment. Over 70% of Caenoridis piRNAs are expressed in male or female gerine, and the genes they target suggest that these populations evolved independently. The study reveals that Caenoridis piRNA motifs act as promoters, specifying which sequences are piRNAs, how abundantly they are expressed, and in gerine. The Caenor genome encodes over 15,000 unique pi sequences, rivaling the number of mRNA genes.

The researchers found that piRNAs are autonomously expressed in Caenoridis. They used computational and transgenic approaches to find the conserved motif defines the pi transcription cassette, specifying 21 RNAs from genomic. The motif also encodes information for gerine expression of 21 RN. More than 70% Caenor piRN are preferentially in male or female gerine. Unexpectedly, gerine is enforced by a single nucleotide in the motif. Autonomous expression of synthetic 21 RN from minimal cassettes was shown, consisting of 8 motif, 40 spacer, 21, and 100 flanking context.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the bacterium Brucella uses to replicate inside host cells. Bruc replicates in a membrane-bound compartment derived from the host cell's endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The study found that the IRE pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated during Bruc infection, but not the PER and ATF pathways. This leads to the upregulation of COI vesicle components Sar, Sec23, and Sec24, which are involved in forming vesicles at the ER exit sites. The researchers also observed the formation of ER-derived vacoles around replicating bacteria using microscopy and electron microscopy. They identified a novel host factor, Y1, responsible for activating the IRE pathway in response to tunic treatment and Bruc infection. Y1 is responsible for phosphorylating IRE through high-order assembly of Ire molecules at ER sites under UP conditions. In Y-knockdown cells, Bruc failed to generate ER-derived vacoles and remained in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. The study suggests that activation of the IRE pathway and ER-derived vacole formation are critical for Bruc to establish a safe replication niche, and Y is indispensable for these processes. Autophagy proteins Atg and WI, but not D, are required for the biogenesis of ER-derived compartments. The study proposes a model for Bruc replication that exploits host UP and ER-derived vacole machineries, both dependent on Y-mediated IRE activation.
Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBS) and carnation Italian ring spot virus (CV) hijack a cellular enzyme called V34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK) to help them replicate. This enzyme produces a molecule called PI 3 phosphoinoside, which is crucial for the virus to build its replication compartment. Without V34, the virus can't replicate efficiently. The virus recruits V34 into its replication compartment by interacting with a protein called p33. If V34 is absent, the virus can't get the membranes it needs to replicate. The virus also needs PI 3 phosphoside to keep a protein called p33 stable, which is broken down when PI3 is low. Overexpressing PI phosphatase in yeast or plants stops TV replication on peroxomal membranes and CV on mitochondrial membranes.
Researchers conducted a study in Iqu, Peru to assess the feasibility of feeding Aedes aegypt mosquitoes on deng virus-infected human volunteers for vector studies. The study aimed to examine the transmission of deng virus (DENV) from humans to mosquitoes, a critical component of deng epidemiology. Participants aged 5 years and older with fever were enrolled from clinic and neighborhood studies. Wild, laboratory-reared Aedes aegypt were fed on feile individuals or blood collected from participants with or treated with EDTA. Mosquitoes were tested after 14 days for DENV infection and dissemination. A total 58 participants with vireas from 1.3 × 102 to 2.9 × 106 focus-forming units/mL participated in one or more feeding methods. DENV infection rates were not different between direct and indirect-ED feeding, but lower for no additive. Dissemination rates were similar across methods. No differences were detected in D infection or dissemination in fed on participants with different deng severity. The study demonstrates direct and indirect feeding for field-based vector studies. Direct feeding is preferable in terms of ease, biosecurity, and reliability.
Researchers studied why some people respond differently to chemotherapy drugs that target a protein called topoisomerase II. They used a tiny worm called Caenorhabditis elegans to find that different strains of the worm vary in their sensitivity to these drugs. They found that a single amino acid substitution, methionine to glutamine, in the topoisomerase enzyme explains this variation. This change affects how the enzyme interacts with a poison called etopide, making it more stable. This leads to increased genomic instability in worms with the methine residue. The same residue is conserved from yeast to humans and is a difference between two human topoisomerase isoforms, hTOIα and hIβ. The researchers tested this in human cell lines and found that the amino acid difference affects toxicity of topoiserase poisons. This explains why hIα and hβ are differently affected by poisons. They used the worm to understand genetics of drug responses in humans.
Scientists studied the genetics of long-lived rodents, specifically the African mole rat, to understand how they live longer than similar-sized and related rodents. They analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species and found 250 genes associated with longevity, called positively selected genes (PSGs). These genes showed a pattern in long-lived mole rats and short-lived rats that fits the "antagonistic pleiotropy" theory of aging, meaning they have opposite effects at different stages of life. The PS genes are related to cellular respiration, ion homeostasis, and processes regulated by the mTOR pathway, such as translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Key genes like Rb, regulator of mTOR, and IGF, central to aging pathways, and new candidates like RBL, AM2, PSM1, and GER were found. Protein modeling suggests amino acid changes under positive selection. The study provides a resource to link genes and amino acids to aging and lifespan.
Researchers have developed a new strategy to control the spread of diseases carried by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, a primary vector of dengue, zika, and chikungunya viruses. They introduced Wolbachia, a bacterium, into the mosquito's genome to make it sterile and reduce its ability to transmit viruses. The new mosquito line, called ARP-M, showed 100% inheritance of Wolbach and no difference in survival, fecundity, and fertility compared to wild-type mosquitoes. However, it was unable to produce offspring when mated with wild-type females. When competing with wild males, ARP males induced higher sterility. Wolbach density in AR-M females was 15 times higher than in wild, corresponding to reduced virus transmission rates of 5 and 0% at 14 and 21 days post-infection. AR-M females were unable to transmit Zika virus. The study suggests exploiting Wolbach to suppress wild-type Aedes populations.
Researchers have discovered that peptides, which are short chains of amino acids, can adopt a specific structure when binding to a partner protein domain, even if they are unstructured on their own. This is contrary to previous understanding that peptides in unstructured regions of proteins are disordered. By analyzing high-resolution 3D structures of peptide interactions, they found that the structure of the peptide can be characteristic of the consensus motif and identify target peptides that don't match established patterns. The peptides tend to have a stretched and elongated structure, unlike others of same length. A strategy using Support Vector Machine was implemented to search known 3D protein structures to identify unnoticed peptide interactions. Derived patterns were compared to established linear motifs and domains, and cross-validated on interactome networks of four organisms. Significant over-representations were found for 64 domain-peptide interactions, 46 previously undescribed, involving 6,000 interactions. This suggests molecular details of binding.
Researchers studied 49 adults in Zambia with environmental enteropathy, a condition linked to poor nutrient absorption and weakened immune responses to vaccines. They used confocal endoscopy, histology, and mRNA sequencing to examine the small intestine and correlated with plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and zinc uptake. The study found widespread damage to the small intestine's lining, with defects at the villi tips, where bacteria can enter the body. Higher PS levels were linked to cell shedding and lower levels of a protective peptide, glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2). Zinc uptake was reduced in 64% of participants, linked to HIV and higher GL-2 levels. Transcript analysis found 23 genes differently expressed in severe enteropathy, including protective proteins. Confocal endoscopy and histology showed epithelial defects, likely sites of bacterial translocation. GL-2 and other peptides may protect the mucosa in environmental enteropathy.
Scientists have long known that some viruses can prevent other viruses of the same or similar type from infecting the same host cells, a phenomenon called superinfection exclusion (SIE). However, the mechanism behind this process is not well understood. Researchers have now discovered that a specific protein, p28, produced by the turnip crinkle virus (TCV), is responsible for blocking superinfection. When p28 is expressed, it prevents other TC viruses from replicating in the same cell. This is because p28 forms large, mobile inclusions in the cell that trap and inactivate other TC viruses, preventing them from replicating. The study suggests that p28 acts as both a facilitator and repressor, depending on its concentration. At high levels, it helps TC replicate, but at low levels, it blocks other TC from replicating. This mechanism could be applicable to other viruses and offers a new target for antiviral therapy.
Researchers tested a new way to improve a vaccine against the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease. They used a combination of two plasmid DNA vaccines, one encoding the parasite's enzyme TS and another encoding the protein IL-15. IL-15 is a protein that helps activate immune cells. The goal was to see if adding IL-15 would make the vaccine more effective in the long term. Mice were immunized with the vaccine with or without IL-15 and tested their immune responses and protection against the parasite. Mice that got the vaccine with IL-15 showed better protection against the parasite 6 months after immunization than those that didn't get IL-15. This was because they had more immune cells that could fight the parasite. These cells were also better at multiplying when exposed to the parasite again. The vaccine with IL-15 was more effective because it made more CD4 and CD8 T cells that could fight the parasite.
Researchers have identified a protein called WDR1 that plays a crucial role in controlling the levels of a protein called TbK in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei. TbK is essential for the parasite's ability to divide, attach its flagellum, and separate its basal body. The researchers found that W1 interacts with a protein complex called Cull4 and another protein called TbDB to break down TbK. When W1 is removed, the parasite's ability to divide and attach its flagum is impaired. This is because TbK builds up in the parasite's body and basal, causing problems with its flagum attachment. The researchers also found that W1 localizes to the parasite's basal and body during certain stages of its life cycle. They suggest that W acts as a receptor for TbK in the Cull complex, helping to break it down the protein. This is important for the parasite's ability to divide and attach its flagum.
Researchers have found that a protein called DDX3 plays a crucial role in the body's first line of defense against infections. DDX is a type of enzyme that helps the immune system recognize and fight off microbes. Without DDX, the body's ability to fight off certain infections is weakened. This was seen in mice that lacked D in their bone marrow and spleen, which are key parts of the immune system. These mice were more susceptible to a type of bacteria called Listeria monocytogen. The study suggests that DDX is essential for the immune system's response and may contribute to differences in how men and women fight off infections and diseases. 

The study looked at mice that lacked D in their immune cells and found changes in the types of cells in their bone marrow and spleen. These mice were more likely to get infected with Lister. The researchers think this may be because the mice used in the study were male and D is more important in female cells. Alternatively, a type of immune cell called macrophage may not produce enough of a protein that helps fight infection. D's impact on the immune system is through its role in making immune cells and regulating response to Lister infections.
Researchers have created a computational model to understand how male moth olfactory neurons respond to pherones. The model includes all steps from pherone molecules reaching the neuron to the electrical signal being sent to the brain. It focuses on what happens after the phone binds to the receptor, including the production and breakdown of chemical messengers, opening and closing of channels that let ions in or out of the cell. The model is controlled by proteins that can slow down or speed up the process. The researchers tested the model by comparing it to real data from experiments and found it matches the shape and timing of the response to different pherone doses. The model shows that two types of channels play different roles at low and high pher concentrations. At low doses, a channel lets in positive ions to depolarize the cell, while at middle to high doses, a channel lets in negative ions to depolarize the cell. This could help explain how moths can detect pher from far away and respond to single pher molecules. The model also suggests new ways to test and improve the understanding of insect olfactory neurons.
Researchers studied how the tumor suppressor protein p53 responds to cellular stress by binding to specific DNA sequences and activating genes. They mapped p53 binding and histone H3 modifications in human cells treated with a chemotherapy drug doxorubicin. They found that p-regulated genes were associated with the cell's chromatin status, with most being suppressed and marked by repressive histone modifications. p53 sequences in open chromatin were weaker, while those in enhancers and repressed chrom were stronger. p occupancy was correlated with sequence similarity to the p53 consensus, but inversely with existing nucleosome accessibility and conservation. p binding to transposable element repeats was higher and correlated with stronger sequences. However, this did not translate to gene activation. Occupied p in repeats were unique, displaying negative evolutionary scores and altered histone and DNase hypersensitivity. The study highlights the interaction between chromatin and p53 context in the response. The p response appears tuned by evolutionary processes, potentially repressing or utilizing p from primate transposons.
Scientists have designed a new way to control signals in living cells using a two-component systems found in bacteria. These systems are made of two parts: a histidine kinase (HK) and response regulator (RR) proteins. The HK transfers a phosphate group to the RR, sending a signal. Researchers found that one HK can send a signal to two RRs, making one RR act as a "sink" for the other. This means the signal can be turned off quickly. They also discovered that this system can create a "switch-like" response, where the signal only turns on when a certain level is reached. This is called a sigmoidal-response. The researchers found two conditions that make this happen and how to control the level and sensitivity of the signal. They tested this in yeast and bacteria and found that the level of sigmoid can be controlled by the presence of RR and an auxiliary protein that binds to HK. This system can be used to make synthetic devices that turn on and off at certain levels, useful for biology applications.
Scientists have long known that individual cells within a population can respond differently to stress, but the reasons behind this variation were unclear. To investigate, researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to study yeast cells with and without salt stress. They found significant variation in gene expression in individual cells, both before and after stress. A subset of cells decoupled expression of ribosomal genes from stress response in a way related to cell cycle but not yeast metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging revealed coordinated and decoupled shuttling of transcription factors, including Msn2, Dot6, S1, and Hog1. Results suggest cells maintain a filter against decou bursts of factor activation but mount stress response coordinated in subset unstressed cells. Understanding regulatory networks controlling heterogeneity and stress tolerance could lead to new ways to control population behavior. The study provides new insights into yeast stress response, but many questions remain. To address these, researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing and profiling of transcription factor dynamics before and after stress. Results show variable activation of stress and specific regulators after stress and heterogeneity in activation in unstressed cells due to coordinated and discordant induction of regulators.
Researchers have found that the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African trypanosiasis, accumulates in the reproductive organs of mice, including the testis, epididymis, and epididymal adipose tissue. They used fine needle aspiration cytology to detect parasites in the male reproductive system and histological analysis revealed that T. brucei accumulates in the stroma of the epididym, epidid adipose tissue and fibrous tunics of the test. However, no parasites were found in the lumen of epididym duct or seminifer tubules of the test. This suggests that the majority of parasites are not in immune-privileged sites. Instead, they are associated with inflammatory cell infiltration, degeneration, and tissue rupture of epididym duct, which may be related to reduced fertility. The study shows that, like in the bloodstream and other tissues, male organs, T. bruce are exposed to a strong immune response. The detection of a high number of parasites in this organ opens the possibility of using fine aspiration cytology as a diagnostic tool in African trypaniasis. 

The researchers used immunohistochemistry to analyze the presence and distribution of trypanosomes at different stages post-infection in the test, epidid, and epidid adip tissue. Few parasites infiltrate the fibrous tun that encloses the test, but trypanosomes were not seen to infiltrate the test se inside semifer tubules or supporting stroma. They conclude that the male system is an important site for accumulation of tryosomes, but the test had virtually no parasites. The majority of parasites were in the stroma of epidid and surrounding epidid adip tissue, not protected by tissue barriers.
Researchers studied how fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) respond to their environment through their sense of smell and taste. They found that the genes that help flies detect chemicals in their environment are regulated differently at different stages of life, between males and females, and in response to social interactions. When flies are exposed to the smell of the opposite sex, it changes which genes are turned on or off. This is different from when they are in contact with the same or opposite sex. The researchers looked at how these genes work together and found that they are organized into small groups that respond to similar conditions. This allows the flies to fine-tune their sense of smell in response to their environment. The study shows that the genes that help flies sense their environment are highly flexible and can change in response to different situations.
Researchers have found a link between abnormal meiotic recombination and nondisjunction in human oocytes, which can lead to trisomies. Studies show that failure to recombine or recombination events near or far from the centromere can cause tris. To identify these abnormal configurations, scientists use immunofluorescence to examine the meiotic process in females. They studied crossover proteins (ML1) in human oocytes to analyze number and distribution on nondjunction-prone chromosomes. Results show ML1 number is lower than expected, but pattern is consistent with crossover protein. Observations in individual chromosomes show "vulnerable" crossover in oocytes, which may lead to nondjunction in adult oocytes.

Meiotic errors cause many chromosome abnormalities in humans, mostly in the first division of the oocyte. Studies over 10-20 years linked disturbances in recombination to human tris of maternal origin. Researchers used ML1 as crossover marker in females and asked if achmate and suboptimal crossover are features of human meiosis. They analyzed 103 prophase oocytes from 31 ovarian samples. Direct crossover in fetal oocytes revealed "ulnerable" configurations consistent with tris conceptions, such as chromosome 16 distal exchanges and 21 proximal dist exchanges. If true, recombination patterns in tris should reflect ML1 in pacheneocytes. However, results were not clear, with no evidence of spikes in dist or proximal ML1 on 21, despite prox and dist exchanges with tris 21.
Exposure to the saliva of blood-feeding arthropods like mosquitoes, ticks, and flies can have a significant impact on the progression of diseases they transmit, such as Leishmaniasis, Plasium, and arboiral infections. When an arthropod bites a mammal, it injects saliva containing immunogenic compounds that facilitate feeding. Research suggests that the immune response elicited by pre-exposure to arthrop saliva can alter disease progression if the host becomes infected. Pre-sensisation of host has been reported to both exacerbate and limit symptoms, depending on the system, with implications for recovery. To explore how preensisation affects vector control, a model of vector-borne disease was developed. Results show that abundance of preensised hosts increase when control efforts moderately increase vector mortality. If preensisation leads to rapid infection clearance, increasing mortality may achieve greater control. However, if preens prolongs duration, e.g. through symptomatic cases unlikely to be treated, control can increase total infected. Infections may go unnoticed unless active surveillance detects subclinical individuals, providing long reservoirs for transmission and long-term consequences. Sensitivity analysis suggests negative consequences mitigated through integrated management. The immunological and clinical consequences of pre-exposure are largely uncharted for other vector-parite-host combinations. A range of epidemiological outcomes, positive and negative for health, underscore the need to quantify preensisation modulates recovery and transmission in vectororne diseases.
Leishmanias is a disease that affects 12 million people in 88 countries, with 2 million new cases every year. Leish amazonensis is a leading cause in Brazil, with clinical forms ranging from localized (LCL) to cutaneous leishmanias (D). Researchers studied how the immune system affects Leish proteins by comparing proteomes of amastigotes from BAL/c and BAL nude mice. Thymic nude mice resemble patients with cutaneous leishias, considered T-cell hypersensitive or anergic to Leish antigens. The study found proteins related to oxidative stress and proteases, including known virulence factors oligopeptase and tryparedin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting T cells restrain post-transl modifications in BAL mice. On the other hand, an iso of H70 was increased in amastotes from BAL mice. The study may identify virulence factors and ways of regulating expression.
Researchers have found that the enzyme AID, which is responsible for creating genetic diversity in immune cells, is regulated by the cell cycle. This means that the amount of AID in the cell changes depending on the phase of the cell's life cycle. The team used microscopy to observe that AID degrades more slowly in the G1 phase than in S or G2 phase. They also found that mutations that affect A's regulatory or catalytic activity alter its stability and abundance. To test the role of cell cycle regulation, they tagged A with proteins that destroy it outside of G1 or S2 phases. Results showed that A accelerates somatic hypermutation and class recombination in G1 phase but compromises viability in S2 phase. They identified A derivatives that accelerate somatic mutation with minimal impact on viability, which can be useful for genetic engineering and mutagenesis. The study suggests that cell cycle regulates A's stability may be applicable to DNA repair and genome engineering.
Scientists have developed a new method to study how a type of bacteria called Clostridium phyfermentans breaks down plant materials called polysaccharides. Polysaccharides are important for the environment, food, and industry, and making biofuels from plants. The researchers used three tools: enzyme assays, RNA sequencing, and anaerobic growth to understand how the bacteria works. They tested the bacteria on different types of polysacides like glucans, mannans, xylans, galans, pectins, and arabin. Each polyside was broken down at different rates, and the bacteria preferred some over others. The team used RNA sequencing to see how the bacteria responded to polysides by turning on specific enzymes and transporters to break down the sugars. Fifty-six new enzymes were found and purified, and tested to see how they worked together to break down polysides. The study helps understand how microbes break down plant materials and can be used to make better enzymes and microbes for industry.
Researchers in Sierra Leone conducted three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) to control lymphatic filariasis (LF) in 12 districts previously treated for onchocercias from 2008-2010. The program had good geographic and drug coverage. A mid-term assessment in 2011 showed the impact of MDAs on LF in these districts. Microfilaria (mf) prevalence fell from 2.6% to 0.3%, a decrease of 88.5%. Four districts had a 0% prevalence: Bo, Moyamba, Kenema, and Kono. Seven districts had reductions between 70-95%: Bombali, Bonthe, Kail, Kambia, Kadugu, Portoko, Tonkol. Pehun had 0% baseline prevalence, maintained. Bomb had 1.58% prevalence, the district with highest baseline 6.9%. Mean mf density after MD was 17.59/ml, a 65% decrease from 50.9/ml. The entire population had 0.05/ml, a 96% decrease from 1.32/ml. Results show mf decreased <1% in all but one district after MD.
High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, can reveal the inner workings of microbial communities in oceans and the human gut. However, analyzing this data is challenging due to the type of data generated, called compositional data, which is based on relative fractions of genes or species rather than their absolute abundances. Researchers used simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project to show that compositional effects can be widespread and severe, making many correlations among taxa artificial and true correlations appear opposite. They found that diversity is a key factor that modulates the severity of compositional effects and developed a new approach called SparCC to estimate correlations from compositional data. Spar was applied to infer a network of interacting species across 18 human body sites, showing standard methods yield 3 spurious species interactions and miss 60% of true interactions in human microbiome data, with most errors in low-diversity samples.
Researchers studied how the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, a common cause of pneumonia, resists the antimicrobial effects of lysozym, an enzyme found on mucosal surfaces. They found that lyzym's ability to break down peptoglycan, a key component of the bacterial cell wall, is key to its antimicrobial effect. Two enzymes, Pgd and Ad, modify the peptogcan to make it resistant to lyzym. Experiments with mice showed that wild-type pneumocci outcompeted a mutant strains lacking these enzymes when lyzym was present, but not when it was absent. This suggests that peogly modifications reduce fitness, but resistance to lyzym's peog-degrading activity outweighs this disadvantage. The study highlights the complex effects of peog modifications on bacterial growth and survival in different environments and the importance of lyzym in mucosal colonization.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a major arboviral disease worldwide in terms of morbidity and mortality, caused by four serotypes DENV-1 to 4. In Brazil, it's responsible for 80% of deng cases in the Americas, with 5,944,270 cases reported since its introduction in 1986, including 21,596 deng hemorrhagic and 874 fatal cases. Researchers investigated the usefulness of NS1 capture as an alternative to detect DENV in tissue from confirmed deng fatal cases (n=23) in 2002 Brazil. 74 tissue specimens were available: liver (n=23), lung (n=14), kidney (n=4), brain (n=10), heart (n=2), skin (n=1), spleen (n=15), thym (n=3) and lymph (n=2). Three tests for NS1 capture were evaluated: Deng Early ELISA (Pan Diagnostics), Plat NS1 (Bio Laboratories) and rapid NS1 Strip (Bio). Overall deng diagnosis based on tissues by Deng EL, Plat and NS1 was 34.7% (8/23), 60.8 (14) and 91.3 (21) respectively. Deng EL detected NS in 22.9 (17) of specimens and Plat NS in 45.9 (34). Highest sensitivity 78.3 (58) was achieved by NS Strip, with significant differences (p<0.05). NS Strip was most sensitive in liver (91.3), lung (71.4), kidney (100), brain (80), spleen (66) and thym (100) compared to EL assays. This study shows DENV NS capture as a valuable postmortem confirmation.
Researchers studied the genetic differences in multiple myeloma, a type of blood cancer, between people of African and European descent. They analyzed data from 718 patients and found significant differences in mutations between the two groups. Three genes, B7, BR3, and AUT2, were more common in African cases and are involved in other types of cancer. TP53 and IR4 were more common in European cases. This study is one of the most comprehensive genetic studies of multiple myeloma in people of African descent and shows potential differences in how cancer develops in different populations. Three genes involved in other cancers may be important in multiple myeloma, but were overlooked due to lack of African cases in previous studies. More research is needed to understand why multiple myeloma is more common and deadly in African Americans.
Researchers have found that most mutations in cancer cells are "passenger" mutations, which don't affect the cell's reproductive rate. These mutations can provide information about the cancer's history and serve as a molecular clock. They can also be targets for treatment or treatment resistance. Scientists studied the growth of cancer cells in a population, looking at primary tumors and metastatic lesions. They calculated the probability and frequency of mutations by time of appearance. This helped create a tree of cancer evolution in individual patients. Looking back in time, they estimated the number of cells present when a mutation arose. They derived formulas for subclonal mutations and frequency. Fitting these formulas to data estimated birth and death rates of cancer cells in early stages.

The ratio of birth and death rates determines the cancer's tree shape, which is star-shaped for fast growth and linear for slow. If a mutation has a certain frequency, how many cells were present when it arose? The answer varies with death-birth ratio, which changes from 0 to 0.99. Frequencies of first and most abundant passengers are influenced by mutation and death-birth ratio. If close to 1, several passengers may not be present in first cell but collected during expansion. If 0.99, there are 150 mutations in 1% cells. The formula can be fitted to data to describe the process and extract parameters. It was applied to colorectal cancer data, showing neutral evolution during clonal expansion. Passengers can be used to infer tumorig process. For close to 1, subcl with 50% is equal to cl collected during progression. Subtracting subcl 50 from all cl will estimate cl in first cell.
Researchers studied how a protein called huntingtin, which is linked to Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder. They looked at how a part of the protein called exon 1 (X1) misfolds when it has too many glutamines, a type of amino acid. When there are too many glutamines, X1 can form clumps called amyloids, similar to those found in the disease. The team wanted to know how X1 misolds to form these clumps. They used computer simulations to study X1 with and its surrounding parts, called flanking regions. They found that these flanking regions affect how X1 misolds and form clumps. The more glutamines X has, the more likely it is to form a misold state. The flanking regions, especially a part called polyline, help prevent X from forming clumps. The first 17 amino acids of X are more likely to form a sheet than a helix when there are many glutamines. This study helps understand how X misolds and how to stop it from forming clumps.
Researchers have studied the CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindrom Repeats) system, a defense mechanism used by bacteria and archaea to fight off foreign DNA, such as viruses and plasmids. They analyzed over 700 metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project to explore the diversity of CRPRs in human microbiomes and discover new ones. A new assembly strategy was developed to reconstruct CRPR arrays that whole-genome assemblies couldn't identify. For each known CRPR type, they used its repeat sequence to recruit reads from datasets and assemble into CRPR loci, then extracted unique sequences for analysis. Novel CRs were found in whole-genome assemblies and targeted assembly. CRs were found to be body-site specific, with 64 known and 86 new ones identified. Detailed analysis of several CRPR loci, including novel ones, showed streptocococcal CRPRs in oral microbiomes with 8,000 unique spacers. Samples from the same site shared most spacers, while different sites shared fewer, and individuals almost none, indicating niche impact on CRPR evolution. CRs were also used to trace species and virus exposure. This study highlights the importance of identifying CRPR for microbiome ecology.
Scientists have long known that many living organisms have an internal clock that helps them keep track of time, called a circadian rhythm, which is influenced by environmental signals like light and temperature. However, research on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of worm, has shown that its circadian rhythms are not very strong. In fact, no one had identified circadian rhythms at the genetic level in this organism. Researchers wanted to see if C. elegans has a real circadian clock. They used a technique called genome-wide expression to find genes that change with a 24-hour cycles in response to light and temperature. They found many genes that do, even when kept in constant conditions, suggesting they are controlled by the circadian clock. Light and temperature drive different sets of genes, but mostly not the same ones. A gene that helps sense temperature and light is needed for circadian rhythms to work. This study shows C. elegans has a circadian clock and can be used to learn more about its evolution and function.
Scientists have studied a type of yeast called Saccharomyces cerevisae to understand how DNA repair and recombination work. They looked at a gene called RAD3, which is similar to a human gene called XPD. Some versions of RAD3 have problems with DNA repair and cause a lot of recombination. Previous studies showed that this was because of single-stranded DNA gaps that turn into breaks during replication. The researchers used a new method to see the products of recombination and found that RAD3 versions have 100 times more crossovers. They mapped these events and found that 3/4 are breaks in both sister chromatids and 1/4 in single chromatids. This is similar to normal recombination in healthy cells. They looked at 216 changes in the genome, including crosso, conversions, deletions, and duplications and found that some are near areas with a lot of recombination. They also found a hotspot for deletions and duplications near the end of a chromosome. This suggests that some normal recombination in healthy cells might be from incomplete repair and breaks that can't be fixed by sister recombination.
Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, has a set of simple sequence repeats (SSR) that generate heterogeneous populations through slipped mispairing, allowing adaptation to the changing host environment. Researchers found that an intergenic tract, via slipped mispair, operates like a rheostat to fine-tune expression of the sialic acid adhesin, SabA. They used isogenic strains with varying tract length to show that it affects Sab promoter output, altering H. pylori binding to sial-Lewis receptors on gastric mucosa. Analysis of post-infection clones revealed variable tract length in H. pylori, mirroring host-pathogen interplay where best-fit phenotypes are selected. In silico and in vitro analyzes showed tract length affects DNA structure and RNA polymerase binding, shifting alignment between promoter and UP elements. Additional H. pyl genes with similar tracts show variations modulate cognate output. The study proposes a mechanism mediated by promoter-prox SSR for transcription regulation in bacteria with limited transacting factors.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) must evade the immune system to establish persistent infections and amplify its genome upon cell differentiation. Researchers have found that a protein called STAT-5, part of the JAK/STAT family, plays a key role in this process. STAT-5 is usually involved in regulating the immune response to cytokines and growth factors, but in the case of HPV, it promotes viral replication. The virus activates STAT-5 without changing its overall levels. Inhibiting STAT-5 with a drug called pimide blocks viral genome amplification and late gene expression in differentiating cells, but has no effect on undifferentiated cells that stably maintain the virus. Studies show that a specific version of STAT-5, called STAT-β, is responsible for this activity and it works through the ATM damage response pathway. A protein called peroxisomeator-activated receptor (PARγ) also contributes to this effect. These findings reveal a new mechanism by which the immune regulator STAT-5 promotes viral replication through the DNA damage response.
Researchers in Nepal identified 13 antigens from Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi that are unique to chronic carriers of the bacteria in the biliary tract. These antigens are proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins that are not found in healthy individuals from a typhoid endemic area. One antigen, YE (ST147), an uncharacterized protein with an ATP-binding motif, showed a strong response in patients with S Typhi in their biliary tract compared to those without. The researchers used an immunoscreen technique called in vivo-induced antigen technology (IVAT) to identify these antigens, which are expressed in the body but not in lab-grown bacteria. The study aimed to understand host-pathogen interactions in the biliary of chronic carriers and develop a diagnostic to identify asymptomatic S Typhi carriers. The identified antigens were found in 70% of chronic carriers, 0% of bile-negative controls, 0 of healthy, and 12.5% with acute tyoid. Further evaluation of these and other antigens could lead to improved diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for S Ty carriage.
Scientists have discovered a new way that genes can be turned back on after being silenced. They found that non-working copies of a gene called "white" can reactivate a working copy of the same gene that's been turned off by a process called heterochromatin. This new phenomenon is called transactivation and relies on the presence of similar RNA molecules from the same gene. It's different from other ways genes are turned on or off, like paramutation, transduction, and transvection. In transactivation, non-working genes that don't make a full protein can still influence the working copy of the same gene that's turned off by heterochatin. The researchers found that non-working white genes increase the amount of another gene called wmh and change the structure of the gene's location. This new way of turning on genes is heritable, meaning it's passed on, and relies on the presence of similar RNA. It's also affected by genes that control how genes are turned off after they're made.
Researchers have discovered a protein called Boophil in the midgut of a tick that helps the tick avoid the host's blood clotting system. Boophil is a multifunctional inhibitor that targets several enzymes involved in clotting and complement cascades, including thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein. The study found that Boophil behaves as a classical non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin, blocking platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot formation in vitro. It also inhibits FXa, preventing activation and kikrein activity, indicating it targets the contact pathway. Additionally, Boophil abates cathepsin G and plmin-induced platelet aggregation and affects elastase cleavage of Tissue Pathway Inhibitor (TFI). In vivo, Boophil inhibits carot artery occlusion and promotes bleeding in mice. This suggests Boophil plays a key role in keeping the midut environment low in clotting and inflammatory response, allowing ticks to digest blood for metabolism and egg development. Boophil is the first midut FXa inhibitor found to also inhibit thrombosis.
Researchers have created a computer model called the Spatially Explicit Model of Enteric Tissue (SEMT) to study how inflammation affects the lining of the intestines. This lining, called the mucosa, is crucial for absorbing nutrients and protecting the body from harm. Its structure and function are closely linked, and changes in its architecture can lead to various diseases. Inflammation is a key factor in many gastrointestinal diseases and affects how the mucosa's structure. To understand its role, the researchers developed SEMT to simulate how enteric epithelial cells behave under different conditions, from healthy to diseased. SEMT reproduces healthy mucosal dynamics and various experiments, revealing mechanisms like the role of PTEN/PIK in inflammation and enterocyte slough in ischemia-reper and colonic metaplas. SEMT can be a platform for studying inflammation in gastrointestinal diseases.
Researchers studied the effectiveness of Wolbachia, a bacterium that reduces arbovirus transmission, in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes in Brazil. Traditional control methods like insecticide spraying didn't work well. Wolia was released in a community in Rio de Janeiro for 20 weeks, but only 40% of mosquitoes were infected after 7 weeks and 65% after 19 weeks. However, when releases stopped, 97% of mosquitoes transmitted Wolia to their offspring. Releasing more mosquitoes with longer wings and lower mortality didn't affect invasion. Investigating lab procedures, pyre resistance in Wol decreased from 68 to 3.5% after 17 generations. Initially, released mosquitoes were resistant to pyreoids due to household use of insecticides, jeopardizing Wolia invasion. A new strain, wRio, was created by crossing WolBr with field males to introduce pyre resistance. It increased survival but negatively affected mosquito traits, reducing egg size and hatch. Despite this, wRio established where Br failed, showing matching local genetics, especially pyre resistance, is key to invasion. Local support was high, 90%, and temperature didn't affect Wol expression on Brazilian background. Wolia should match insecticide profile of wild population to invade.
Researchers studied how the vaccinia virus, a type of poxvirus, uses a complex signaling pathway to evade the host's defense mechanisms and replicate properly. They found that the B protein kinase plays a crucial role in in inactivating the antiviral factor B, and likely orchestrates other pathways as well. By deleting the B gene in the virus, they observed a significant increase in viral titer after several passages. Characterization of the adapted viruses revealed mutations correlating with loss of function of the vaccinia B pseudokinase provided a fitness enhancement to the virus. This suggests that losing the gene can be beneficial for the virus. The study also found that expressing full-length B leads to a reduction in fitness in viruses with a defect in B, but no impact on wild-type or mutant viruses. This indicates that B possesses inhibitory activity masked by the presence of B kinase. Further investigation showed that B localizes to the nucleus, a rare characteristic among poxiral proteins. Surprisingly, B phosphorylation is reduced when B is present in cells without B, suggesting B may enhance antiral activity of B. The study presents novel evidence that a paralog kinase-pseudase pair can exhibit epist relationship in virus, serving to enhance conservation during pox evolution and orchestrate events during infection.
Researchers studied the behavior of two synthetic peptides, LKKKLLKKLL (L) and EAAEAAEAAE (E), with built-in alpha-helix secondary structure, in water and at macroscopic interfaces. These peptides are too short to form stable structures on their own, so their conformation is influenced by environment. Simulations showed they don't form random coils or full alpha-helices, but adopt multiple conformations with short lifetimes. Conformation changes with environment, like pH, salt, or presence of interfaces. At macroscopic interfaces, peptides adopt alphael conformation due to hydrophobic/hydrophobic partitioning. Their response to interfaces depends on surface charge and hydrophobicity.
Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a common virus that infects humans in the first years of life and stays in the body for life. It can integrate its genome into the ends of host chromosomes in infected cells, but how it does so is unclear. Interestingly, HH-6 and other similar viruses have sequences at the ends of their genomes that are similar to human chromosome ends. Researchers deleted these sequences in HH-6 and found that they are not necessary for virus replication, but crucial for staying in infected cells. They created a system to test integration and found that without these sequences, the virus is lost quickly. They also found that one sequence is more important than the other for integration. This study shows that HH-6 sequences help the virus stay in infected cells by integrating into chromosome ends. This is a new way the virus maintains itself in the body.
Researchers have discovered the 3D structure of a key protein called D13 from the vaccinia virus, a type of poxvirus. This protein forms a double-barrel shape with two jellyroll domains and a head domain. It assembles into trimers similar to those found in adenoviruses and other icosahedral viruses. When attached to artificial membranes, D13 creates a honeycomb-like structure similar to the virus's immature particles. This suggests that poxviruses use an ancient lipid-remodeling strategy similar to other icosahedral viruses. The protein D13 is essential for the first step of poxvirus formation, as it can create immature particles without other viral factors. Neutralizing D13 with rifampic or mutations stops viral assembly. The study reveals that poxviruses use a common strategy with other icosahedral viruses, and D13 is a target for developing pox inhibitors.
Researchers studied how a plant hormone called auxin affects root growth in a type of grass called Brachyp distyon. Auxin is important for root development in other plants like Arabidopsis, but its role in Brachypton is unclear. They found a mutant with reduced tryptophanminotransferase activity, an enzyme needed for auxin production, but surprisingly had longer roots. This is opposite of what happens in Arabidopsis, where reduced tryophminotransferase leads to shorter roots. The mutant also had elevated auxin levels, not lower as expected. This doesn't seem to be due to alternative auxin production pathways, but increased expression of genes that convert indole-3-pyruvic acid to auxin. Ethylene, another hormone, seems to be involved in this process. Treating the mutant with ethylene precursor 1-aminyclopropane-1-carboxlic acid reduced auxin levels and root growth. Downstream ethylene signaling component, ethylene insensitive 2-like 1, also had increased aux levels. This suggests ethylene inhibits the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis, making aux levels suboptimal for root elongation. The study reveals a delicate balance between auxin and ethylene to control cell elongation in Brach roots, different from Arabidopsis.
Researchers studied how genes in yeast species evolve at different rates and found a link between gene expression and nucleosome organization. Genes without a nucleosome-free region, called OP, vary widely between species, while those with a nucleosome region, DPN, remain similar. They tested if early evolution affects this difference by selecting for high expression of a protein and found both OP and DPN genes increased equally. However, they adapted differently: DPN duplicated regions, while OP favored mutations. When selection stopped, DPN returned to normal, but OP didn't. This suggests organization constrains early evolution and biases long-term path. In yeast, gene divergence is linked to nucleosome organization, connecting evolution with regulation. Genes that diverged quickly lack a nucleosome near start, while DPN remained conserved. When selection stopped, DPN returned to normal, but OP didn't. Results show organization impacts early dynamics and long-term evolution. To test if OP and DPN differ in responding to selection, they selected high expression and examined genomic response. Dozens of proteins increased, regardless of class. They chose 41 proteins with mid-to-high levels, no preference for function or position. Genes were DPN and OP, quantified by nucleosome occupancy. Alternatively, DPN and OP may respond similarly to selection, but easily satisfied by OP due to flexible structure. This supports flexible organization directs evolution's path.
Researchers have found that a protein called Tax, produced by the human T-cell leukemia virus HTLV-1, can cause cells to become senescent. Senescence is a state where cells stop growing and dividing, which can be a protective against cancer. However, Tax also activates a protein called NF-κB, which is involved in cell growth and survival. The study shows that NFκ activation by Tax leads to senesc, and that this is a checkpoint to prevent cancer. The protein p21 and p27, which cause senesc, are upregulated by Tax, and act independently of p53 and pR. Tax also stabilizes p27 by activating the an enzyme called APC, which brings about degradation of Skp and inactivation of SCF. The mRNA of another protein, p21, also increases due to Tax activation and stabilization. The surge in p and p27 leads to p53 and pR-independent senescence, called Tax-induced senescence. The study shows that p and p-mediated senesc induced by Tax is a response to chronic NF-κ hyperactivation. NFκ is constitutively active in many cancers, especially leukemia, and data suggest that changes disabling this pathway accompany NF-κ deregulation in cancers. Impairments of p and p function have been observed in most HT-1-transformed cells. Constitutive IK activation and NFκ hyperactivation cause Tax-induced senescence, and Rel is the major driver of senesc. NFκ acts upstream of APC to stabilize p. Loss of Sk has been shown to facilitate p p p-mediated and Arf-independent senesc in SkpAr-null mice. Induction of p by Tax is due to both promoter activation and stabilization.
Researchers have long understood that the frontal lobe plays a crucial role in decision-making and executive control, guiding goal-directed behaviors. However, current models don't fully explain decision-making in uncertain, changing, and open-ended situations. A new computational model of executive function is proposed to clarify this issue. Experiments show the model predicts human decisions and variations across individuals in natural situations. The model reveals the frontal function monitors up to four behavioral strategies and infers their ability to predict outcomes, choosing the most reliable one to guide action and maximize rewards. If unreliable, a new strategy is formed from stored memory, probed, and confirmed to drive action. The executive has a limited capacity for four strategies, compensated by a binary control structure promoting exploration and new strategies in ambiguous situations. Results support a model integrating reasoning, learning, and creativity in decision-making behavior. 

A key issue is understanding how the executive controls creating new strategies and managing an expanding collection for action. A computational model is proposed controlling creation, learning, storage, and selection of strategies. The PRO model suggests regulating exploration and creativity in adaptive behavior. Results support a model integrating reasoning, learning, and creative in executive control. The model creates an expanding repertoire of flexible strategies in uncertain, changing environments. The frontal function manages task representations in long memory for action. According to reinforcement learning, the actor is adjusted to maximize utility. How do we manage an expanding strategies and create new rather than adjusting or switching, possibly according to cues? Little is known about the executive continuously between adjusting, staying, switching, and creating sets for action.
Researchers have developed a new approach called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT) to study the long-term effects of pharmacological treatments on diseases. This method uses mathematical modeling to predict how molecular adaptations change over time in response to a treatment. A concept of time-dependent parameters is introduced to describe the dynamics of these changes, making use of experimental data from different stages of the treatment. This approach provides insight into the underlying biological systems and identifies areas to study further to understand treatment outcomes. ADAPT was used to investigate the effects of activating the liver receptor LXR, a potential target for treating atherosclerosis. Unexpectedly, it found that activating LXR reduced the liver's ability to clear cholesterol, despite promoting cholesterol efflux and excretion. This was confirmed by measuring SR1 levels in liver membranes. AD can also identify potential side effects and design new interventions to prevent them.
Researchers have proposed a new hypothesis on how the spinal cord and cerebellum work together to coordinate body movements. They suggest that sensory and motor signals are combined in neurons of the spinal cord's spinocerebell pathways. This allows the cerebellum to approximate spatial and temporal relationships between body parts, necessary for coordination. However, the number of granule cells limits the number of combinations that can be represented. Instead, the spinal cord provides useful combinations, described as linear projections in a multi-dimensional space. Granule cells, with the help of Golgi cells, enhance these projections, allowing Purkinje cells to approximate non-linear functions. This new view shows how the cerebellum's functions are supported by spinal recombinations. 

The spinocbell system avoids superfluous combinations by combining signals in individual neurons. This allows "good" combinations to be formed with high probability. The spinal circuit makes sensorimotor functions available to the cerebell through its projections. The cerebell granule receives this information. The spinocbell network's structure before the granule must be considered to understand how dimensionality can be lifted. A simplified example is controlling a double joint arm. The paper seeks to explain these observations in terms of spinal and cerebell circuitry, providing integration across dimensions for coordination. The cerebell is key for coordination, but little is known about its mechanisms.
Researchers used next-generation sequencing to study the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the Aedes aegypti mosquito during Chikungunya virus (CHV) infection. They identified 88 known and 79 miRNAs in uninfected and CHV infected mosquito cells, respectively, and nine novel miRNAs in the mosquito. The study found that CHV infection altered the expression of 77 miRNAs, specifically eight of which were upregulated. The researchers predicted the targets of these miRN and classified them into pathways. This study provides insight into the modification of miRN during CHV infection and identifies potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies.
Cysticercosis (CE) is a parasitic disease affecting humans and livestock worldwide, with significant medical and economic importance in many developing countries, including Iran. The study aimed to determine the economic burden of CE in Iran. Data on prevalence and incidence of CE in humans and animals were obtained from hospitals, literature, and government reports. Economic data on human and animal disease, including treatment costs, productivity, and livestock losses were from national and international datasets. Monte Carlo methods represented uncertainty in parameters. Estimated 1,295 surgical cases per year 2000-2009, and 635,232 asymptomatic individuals. Annual cost of CE in Iran was $232.3 million, including direct and indirect costs. Human cost was $93.3 million and livestock $132 million. Cost per case was $1,539. CE has considerable impact on Iran, 0.03% of country's gross product. Establishment of surveillance and control are necessary to reduce burden. Cost-benefit analysis of control is recommended incorporating losses due to CE in Iran.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of mouse polyomavirus (MPV) infection in mouse cells to understand how the virus interacts with its host and affects gene expression. They used deep sequencing to follow MPV infection in NIH3T cells at various times and analyzed both viral and cellular transcriptomes. The study revealed a dynamic regulation of viral and host gene expression, including widespread RNA editing of viral transcripts late in infection. By 36 hours, 359 genes were upregulated and 857 downregulated. Gene ontology analysis showed changes in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover were upregulated, while extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc binding, SH domain, and GTP activation were downregulated. Noncoding RNAs were also altered, with MALAT1, a marker for late-stage cancer, downregulated and several others upregulated. The study provides new insights into MPV lifecycle and its effects on cell growth and metabolism.
Hundreds of thousands of runners attempt to complete a marathon each year, but many experience severe performance-limiting depletion of physiologic carbohydrate reserves, known as "hitting the wall," and drop out before reaching the finish. Analyses of endurance have suggested that glycogen reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon, making "hitting the wall" inevitable, or that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete a marathon without "hitting the wall. However, a new study shows that energetic constraints on runners are more subtle and depend on physiologic variables, including muscle mass, liver glycogen, and running intensity. The study estimates the distance at which runners will exhaust glycogen as a function of intensity, providing a basis for ensuring safety and optimizing performance by setting paces and prescribing fuel requirements. The analysis sheds light on standards in marathon that have remained empirically defined, such as qualifying times for the Boston Marathon. Carbohydrate loading influences performance by permitting runners to run at greater speeds without "hitting the wall" due to exhaustion of glyc reserves. Typical levels allow runners to complete a marathon safely between four and five hours. The model incorporates running cost and dependence on exertion, revealing dependencies of distance to glyc depletion and pace.
Researchers studied how different strains of Toxoplas, a parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, interact with mouse immune cells called macrophages. They infected mouse macrophages with 29 different Tooplas strains from around the world and used a technique called RNA-sequencing to see what genes were turned on or off in both the parasite and the host. They found big differences in how the parasite and host interacted with each other. Some Tooplas strains turned on genes that helped them hide from the host's immune system, while others turned on genes that made the host's immune system attack them. They also found new ways that some Tooplas strains regulated the host's interferon response, a key part of the immune system that helps fight off infections. Some Toop strains even made the host cells produce interferon without help from other parts of the immune system. The study shows that different Tooplas strains have unique ways of interacting with host cells, which might explain why some strains cause more severe disease than others.
Researchers have investigated the process of recombination in enteroviruses, a mechanism that allows viruses to acquire new genetic material and contribute to diversity and emergence of new strains. They used a novel approach to isolate chimeric poliovirus genomes with duplicated sequences at the recombination site and found that progeny viruses with imprecise junctions had increased fitness. Mutations affecting polymerase or replication complexes altered recombination yield but not non-recombination, suggesting it's a replicative process. The study proposes a biphasic process: initial recombination followed by resolution of extraneous sequences to optimize fitness. This has implications for understanding evolution in positive-strand RNA viruses.
Researchers have discovered a new route for the body to clear a hormone called norepinephrine (NE) in fat cells, which plays a key role in burning fat and energy. This hormone is important for treating diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Previous studies found that NE is cleared by nerve cells or immune cells in fat tissue, but this process is not efficient. The researchers found that a protein called organic anion transporter 3 (Oct) is highly expressed in fat cells and takes up NE at a high rate, unlike other known routes. Fat cells also have enzymes to break down NE and reabsorb it with the help of Oct. When Oct is blocked, mice have higher body temperature and fat burning compared to normal mice. After cold exposure, fat in Oct-deficient mice have more "brown" fat, a type of fat that burns energy, and express more genes for energy production. This involves a signaling pathway in fat cells. Genes for glucose production are increased to compensate for lack of energy in Oct-deficient mice. Blocking this pathway in Oct-deficient mice abolishes fat burning and energy production. Reduced Oct in humans is linked to higher metabolic rate. The study shows Oct governs NE in fat cells, offering potential for treating metabolic disorders.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called HP1 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by interacting with a specific region of histone H3, a protein that makes up chromatin. This region, called the globular domain, is partially hidden inside the nucleosome, a structure that wraps chromatin around. HP1 also interacts with the SWI/SNF complex, a protein that remodels chromatin. The interaction between HP and SW/SNF is antagonistic, meaning they work against each other. In some cases, SWNF acts as a repressor, opening chrom to allow HP to bind, while in others, SWNF acts as activator and HP binds to methylated histone tails. HP uses its chromadow domain to bind to the glob domain of histone H, which is also contacted by SWNF subunits Brg and Brm. This interaction allows HP to detect and block chrom remodeling by SWNF. The study suggests HP benefits from chrom opening to bind and uses this property to prevent unwanted chrom remodeling.
Researchers have discovered a property called "self-containment" in RNA molecules, which refers to their ability to maintain a specific structure regardless of their surrounding sequence context. They developed a method to measure this property, called the self-containment index, and found that microRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit high self-containment, consistent with their need for structural invariance during biogenesis. Most other structured RNAs do not show this property. Analysis revealed a trend towards higher self-containment in conserved miRNAs, suggesting it may be a characteristic of miRN acquiring new genomic contexts. miRNAs display enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs, and a trend towards selection for self-containment in functional classes. The study suggests self-containment arises from selection for robustness against perturbations, invariance during biogenesis, and modular composition of function. Containment analysis is important for RNA annotation and design.
Researchers have identified four transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis that play a crucial role in limiting the spread of necrotrophic fungal pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea and Plectphaella cucina. Mutants defective in any of these TFs showed increased susceptibility to these pathogens, indicating their importance in disease resistance. Transcriptome analysis revealed a common signature of 77 up-regulated genes in the mutants, including several encoding secreted peptides named PROIR (provirulence factors). Overexpression of PROIR in Arabid increased susceptibility to necrot P cucina, while loss-of-function mutants increased resistance, suggesting their role in fungal pathogenesis. The TF and PROIR identified are novel determinants of plant susceptibility to necrophic fungal pathogens.
Researchers have found that a protein called Forkhead Box 1 (FOX1) plays a crucial role in making the uterus ready for a fertilized eggs to implant. The uterus needs to be in a specific state to allow the egg to attach and grow. If it's not, women may have trouble getting pregnant or carrying a pregnancy to term. Scientists studied mice without FOX1 in the uterus and found they couldn't get pregnant. This was because the cells in the uterus were not working right and the egg couldn't get in. They looked at what was happening in the uterus and found changes in how genes that help the egg attach and grow. They also found that a hormone called progesterone, which helps the uterus get ready, was working differently. Progester was stuck in the cells of the uterus when it should have been in the egg. When progesterone was in the cells, FOX1 was not working. This happened in mice and human uterus too. This means FOX1 and progesterone work together to make the uterus ready for egg to implant.
Researchers developed a statistical model to map the spread of deng cases in Bangladesh, a disease that is often underreported. They used data from 2000 to 2009 and found that temperature and its interaction with daily temperature range, two months prior, were linked to deng incidence. Rainfall, two months prior, was also linked to deng. Densely populated districts and those bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence. The model estimated that 92% of deng cases occurred between August and September. Cases were reported across the country, with 94 in Dhaka, the capital, located in the middle. Less than half of districts reported cases were from surveillance data. The proportion varied by month, with higher in high-incidence districts, but dropped towards the end of transmission.
Researchers have discovered a new type of preferred places that mice visit in an open environments, called "knots". These places are characterized by high tortuous paths with twists and turns, and are often visited sporadically during a session. Mice perform a behavior called "knot-scribling" while in these places, which involves tracing a winding path with twists and turns. Knots are distinct from "home" places, where mice spend most of their time, and are typically located near the point of entry into the arena. Mice tend to leave knots shortly after being placed there, but return to them sporadically throughout the session. Injecting mice with saline and placing them in an exposed area enhances the establishment of knots, suggesting that stress and arousal create a long-term association between a locale and knot-scribling. In an environment without cues, mice mark a locale with twisting and turning, creating a self-generated landmark. Knot-scribling may help mice obtain an overview of the environment, recalibrate their map and compass, and improve interpretation of the scene through vestibular input.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for antifungal compounds in a protein called Sec14, which is essential for the growth and virulence of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. They found that the compound NG04, an ergoline, inhibits the growth of C. neoans and related compounds have even higher potency against it. NG04 also showed fungicidal activity against a fluconazole-resistant C. neoans strain. Sec14 is involved in lipid transfer and virulence in pathogenic fungi, making it an attractive target. The researchers used high-resolution chemogenomics to identify Sec14 as the target of NG04 and found mutations in Sec14 define compound interactions in the binding pocket of the protein. They also showed that NG04 inhibits growth of two clinical isolates of C. neoans and NG04-related compounds have equal and even higher potency against C. neoans. The study suggests NG04 as a novel antif starting point.
Researchers have found that the antimal drug mefloquine shows promising antischosomal properties in mice. This means it can help treat schistosomiasis, a disease that affects millions of people worldwide and is often linked to poverty. The current treatment, prazantel, may not be effective long-term due to parasite resistance, so new compounds are needed. Mefloquine reduced worm burdens by 72-100% in mice infected with adult Schistoma mansoni and S japonicum. It also worked on young stages of the worms in the mice. Both forms of meflo reduced worm burdens in mice with subpatent or patent infections. This is promising for developing a new schistosomal drug based on aminoal functionality. Further studies are needed to understand how meflo works and its effects on other parasites. It's interesting that meflo, used to treat malaria, may also help with schosias in areas where both diseases coexist.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to map the distribution of podoiosis, a non-filar elephantiasis that causes massive swelling of the lower legs. Podoiosis was identified as a neglected disease by the World Health Organization in 2011. The study used a multi-stage sampling design and surveyed 76 villages from 40 districts in 10 regions of Cameroon. Individuals 15 years old or older were screened for lymphedema, and a clinical algorithm was used to diagnose podoiosis excluding filarial lymphema. Of 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households participated, 83 with lymphema were identified, but none were positive for Wuchereria bancrofti antigen or DNA. 52 cases of podoiosis were identified after applying the algorithm, with a prevalence of 0.5% (95% CI 0.4-0.7). Podoiosis was found in every region except two villages in Adamawa, with 17 districts having no cases, 15 with 0.2-1% and 8 with 1.2-2.7%. The study demonstrates low but widespread distribution of podoiosis in Cameroon. Designing a control program and health response to the burden of podoiosis is important through surveillance and morbidity services.
Notch signaling plays a crucial role in regulating the adhesion of germline stem cells (GSCs) to their niche in Drosophila. As flies age, Notch signaling increases in GSCs, leading to their removal from the niche. Research shows that Gs with low levels of Notch signaling exhibit increased adhesion to the niche, outcompeting neighbors with higher levels of Notch. Adhesion is altered through regulation of E-cadherin expression. Enhancing Not signaling in Gs hastens age-dependent loss from niche, and is partially mediated by lethal. Disrupting Not signaling in Gs does not delay G loss during aging, nor affects BMP signaling, which promotes self-renew of Gs. In contrast, Not activation in niche maintains niche integrity, mediating G retention, is reduced with age, indicating Not regulates niche occupancy both intrinsically and extrinsically.
Researchers have discovered that a group of kinases, called conserved herpesvirus protein kinases (CHPs), share a common function with cellular cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks). These kinases are found in eight human herpesviruses, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and human herpesvirus 5 (HHV-5). They phosphorylate the retinoblastoma (R) tumor suppressor protein and lamin A, which are substrates of Cdks. A functional assay showed that one of these kinases, UL97 from HH-5, has Cd-like activity. To determine if this activity is shared among all CHPs, researchers expressed tagged each protein in human cells to test for R phosphorylation, lamin disruption, and Cd function. They found that beta and gamma-herpesirus CHPs can phosphorylate R and lamin, disrupt the nuclear lamina, while alpha-herpesirus homologs cannot. All beta and gamma CHPs displayed Cd activity in yeast, but alpha did not. These kinases, some of which are targets of antiviral drugs, likely serve overlapping and non-overlapping functions during infections.
A team of researchers conducted a systematic review to understand the global distribution of Burkholderia pseudalle, a bacterium that causes meloidosis, a deadly disease found in tropical regions. The study aimed to update the risk map of meloid and propose guidelines for environmental sampling. A working group, the Detection Environmental Burkholder pseudalle Working Party, was formed during the 2010 World Meloid Congress. The team searched PubMed for studies on pseudalle and meloid from 1912 to 2011. They found that the distribution of pseudalle in the environment is patchy, with many areas lacking studies where meloid is suspected. The methods used to detect pseud were variable and not robust. The team developed guidelines to reduce false results and provide affordable methods for both developed and developing countries. The guidelines provide a basis for a global map of pseudalle.

The study found that 82% of 61 studies detected pseud using culture or PCR, but some isolates may be non-pathogenic. Only 3 studies from Kenya and Australia reported no pseud. A 1977 study in the US identified a pseud-like organism as Bokomens. Meloid is a disease caused by pseud, first described in 1912, with most cases in Thailand and Australia. 50 of 61 studies detected pseud using culture or PCR. Strains in France, Burkina Faso, Madagascar, and Niger were confirmed pseud by genotyping.
Researchers have discovered a new way to stop the dengue virus from entering cells by targeting a specific part of the virus. They found peptides, short chains of amino acids, that bind to a middle stage of the virus's life cycle, when it's preparing to fuse with the cell membrane. This binding blocks the virus from infecting the cell. The peptides work by attaching to the virus before it reaches the cell, and are carried inside with it into a compartment called an endosome, where the virus fuses with the cell membrane. This happens at a specific temperature, 37°C, and not at 4°C. The researchers propose a two-step model for how this works: the peptides bind to the virus and block it from fusing with the cell. This could be a new way to stop deng and other flaviviruses from infecting cells.
Researchers have developed a new method to sequence the entire genome of Vibrio cholera, the bacteria that causes cholera, directly from dried stool samples on filter paper. This is significant because cholera is a major global health concern, causing an estimated 4 million cases and 95,000 deaths annually, with recent outbreaks in Haiti and Yemen reminding us that it's still a pressing issue. The new method is low-cost, safe, and sustainable, and can be used in resource-limited settings. It provides previously unavailable data on circulating cholera strains, which can inform public health policy on control and elimination. The team successfully sequenced the cholera genome from stool samples preserved in alkaline peptone water and culture, both on filter paper, with a minimum DNA concentration of 0.02 ng/μL. The data confirmed the presence or absence of genes of interest, including cholera toxin and pilus loci, and identified co-infecting pathogens that may impact disease severity. The results fit within the global cholera phylogenetic tree, identifying strains as the 7th pandemic El Tor. This method can be used to explore the gut microbiome, identify co-infections, and provide molecular epidemiological information on cholera outbreaks in remote areas.
Researchers have identified a protein called Dyne that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure of epithelial cells, which are layers of cells that line organs and glands in the body. Epithelial cells need to be organized in a specific way to function properly, but how this organization is achieved is not well understood. A study in fruit flies, called Drosophila, found that Dyne is essential for this organization. Dy works with a protein called Stardust (Sdt) to target a protein called Crumbs to the top surface of epithelial cells. Crumbs is important for cell-to-cell adhesion, sticking cells together. Dy and S work together to move Crumbs to the right place, where it can do its job. The study found that Dy also controls where Stardust mRNA, the instructions for making Stard, is found in the cell. This is important because Stard is only found at the top of epithelial cells early in development, but not in mature cells. This is the first time Dy has been shown to be important for epithelial organization and suggests that where mRNA, instructions, is found in the cell, can affect how cells are organized.
Researchers have found evidence that the parasite Leishmania infantum, which causes leishmaniasis, can exchange genetic material within its own cells, a process called intraclonal genetic exchange. This contradicts the previous belief that Leishmania reproduces asexually. To test this, scientists created transgenic Leish lines that express green and red fluorescent markers, linked to drug resistance. They fed these lines to sand flies, Phlebotus periciosus, and found that the markers were exchanged within the fly's midgut. This shows Leish can recognize and mate with cells of the same genotype. The hybrid offspring were triploid, meaning they had three sets of DNA, and were stable throughout the parasite's life cycle. Infections with the hybrid in mice showed reduced parasite loads in spleen and liver, similar to uninfected mice, and lower arginase activity. This suggests the hybrid is less virulent. The study confirms Leish can mate within its natural vector, the sand fly.
Researchers studied Leishmania donani strains from patients in Ethiopia with visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and HIV co-infections. They analyzed DNA from 63 strains using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS), cystine protease B (cp), and HASPB. The ITS and cp PCR identified the strains as Leishmania donani. However, the HAS PCR amplicon size varied depending on the patient's geographic location. Most strains from northwestern Ethiopia produced a 290bp product, while a minority gave 410 amplicons, all from HIV-VL co-infections. Southwestern strains produced 450 amplicons, with smaller products observed in three. Sudanese strains had amplicons identical to northwestern, while Kenyan gave larger products 500-650bp. High-resolution analysis distinguished different products. Sequence analysis showed the HAS repeat region in Leish donani comprised polymorphic 13-14 amino motifs. The 13 amino peptide, prevalent in Leish donani, is rare in Leishum. The order of repeats in Leishani varies between regions. The HAS region shows considerable polymorphism among Leish strains from East Africa. This should be considered when designing diagnostic and vaccine assays based on this antigen.
Scientists have studied the diversity of HIV-1, a virus that causes AIDS, to understand how it evolves and spreads. They found that some versions of the virus, called recombinants, have unique properties that help them survive and spread. The researchers created a model to predict where these recombinations occur based on the virus's genetic code and compared it to real-world data. The model worked well for most of the virus, but some areas had more or fewer recombinations than expected. This suggests that natural selection, the process by which the virus adapts to its environment, plays a role in these areas. The envelope gene, which helps the virus enter cells, had fewer recombinations, indicating these versions are less successful. However, areas around the envelope had more recombinations, suggesting they have an advantage. This study shows that only a few recombinations are important for the virus's evolution, despite its diversity.
Researchers in neuroscience rely heavily on computational modeling to understand brain function and behavior. Traditionally, two problems have been addressed separately: estimating individual parameters in a population and comparing candidate models. However, these are interdependent, as population parameters depend on which subjects express the model. A new framework, hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI), combines approaches to estimate parameters and compare models concurrently. This framework has advantages for both estimation and comparison. Parameters estimated by H show smaller errors compared to other methods. Model comparison by H is robust against outliers and not biased towards simplistic models. The approach enables researchers to make group-level inferences by performing H-tests. 

A challenge is that the best-fitting model may vary subject to subject, but hierarchical estimation assumes the model is expressed all subjects. A new method, hierarchical Bayesian inference, addresses this by using variational techniques. This has consequences for both estimation and comparison. A fully Bayesian approach quantifies uncertainty at group level, enabling statistical tests and errors. Empirical methods play a role in modern statistics. A novel framework, hierarchical Bayesian inference, is introduced for estimation and comparison. H is hierarchical in that individual parameters are regularized across individuals. H is Bayesian that uncertainties both individual and group are represented by distributions. Evaluating a model precedes estimation its values; research used separate tools. However, are interconnected because parameters and depend on subjects that express the model. This is addressed from a Bayesian viewpoint.
Researchers studied how the development of the brain's auditory circuitry in mice, focusing on the role of rhombomeres and Hox genes. Rhomberes are groups of cells that contribute to brainstem development, and Hox genes determine their fate and connectivity. The study found that rhomere 4 contributes to sensory and motor components, including the ventral nucleus of lemniscus, ventral cochlear nuclei, and olivochlear neurons. Assembly of these components is crucial for sound perception and depends on interactions between Hox1 and H2 genes. In mice without H1 and H2, low-level sound transmission is lost, causing hearing impairments. On the other hand, H2 regulates axon guidance and contralateral projections to the trapezoid nucleus, involved in sound localization. Each rhomere and its Hox controls distinct subcircuits in the brainstem. The study also found that a single rhomere contributes to various auditory pathway derivatives across multiple rhomeres. H1 and H2 are crucial in rhom patterning, and ventral4 changes in their absence. The study suggests H genes are key in assembling functional circuits in the developing brain.
Scientists have sequenced the complete genome of a marine bacterium called Saccharagus deans strain 2-40, which can break down complex carbohydrates found in plants and algae. This bacterium is part of a newly discovered group of marine bacteria that recycle complex carbohydrates in the ocean. The genome analysis shows it has many enzymes that can break down different types of complex carbohydrates, some with unique combinations of parts that help break them down complex carbohydrates in the ocean. This is the first time a marine bacterium's genome has been sequenced that can break down plant cell walls, a key part of the carbon cycle not well understood in the ocean.

The study found that the bacterium's enzymes are regulated in different ways, and more complex carbohydrates need more enzymes to break them down. Glucose is a key to regulating the enzymes. The bacterium can grow on plants as its only food and break them down completely, the first time a marine bacterium has done so. It's related to other bacteria that break down cellulose and fix nitrogen, found in shipworms.

The bacterium is likely important in the ocean's carbon cycle, recycling biomass and breaking down complex carbohydrates. It's a "super-degrader" breaking down complex carbohydrates from plants and animals. The bacterium's genome has been fully sequenced and is available online.
Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic flavivirus that causes significant childhood neurological infections in Asia. Over the past 20 years, the dominant genotype has shifted from III (GIII) to I (GI). The reason for this shift is unknown. Culex (Cx) mosquitoes are common in China and play a key role in JE transmission. This study used Cx pipiens mosquitoes from China to explore if they played a role in the shift. Female Cx pip mosquitoes were exposed to GI or GIII JEV strains. Midgut, organs, and saliv glands of infected mosquitoes were collected at 7 and 14 days post infection and measured for infection, replication, dissemination, and transmission. Cx pip mosquitoes were competent for both GI and GIII infection, with similar rates and kinetics. Both genotypes disseminated to secondary organs at similar rates. GI-infected saliv glands were positive at 16.2% at 7 days, while GIII was undetectable. However, 29.4% and 36.3% were positive at 14 days, showing an increase. No difference in transmission rate between GI and G-infected was detected. Data suggests GI and GIII have similar infectivity in Cx pip, suggesting C pip may not play a role in JE shift.
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that affects people living in tropical and subtropical regions, including Malaysia, where large outbreaks have occurred in recent years. Researchers studied the demographics and clinical characteristics of deng deaths in Malaysia between 2013 and 2014. They reviewed 322 deng deaths, with a mean age of 40.7 years and 72.5% were adults. Diabetes and hypertension were common co-morbidities among adults and elderly. The most common symptoms were lethargy and vomiting, with lethargy more common in children and abdominal pain in adults. 22.4% had no symptoms and 34% were suspected deng at initial presentation. Adults developed severe plasma leakage more often and half suffered multi-organ involvement. Deng deaths occurred at 3 days post-admission. Deng shock syndrome (DSS) caused 70% of deaths, followed by organ involvement 69% and bleeding 29.7%. In Malaysia, deng deaths primarily occurred in adults and SS was leading cause regardless of age. The study suggests early recognition and aggressive intervention to prevent deaths.
Researchers studied how female fruit flies choose their mates and what makes them attractive to males. They found that insulin signaling, a nutrient-sensing pathway, affects female attractiveness in fruit flies. Insulin signaling in the body and ovaries makes females more attractive, while insulin in the fat tissue makes them less attractive. The ovaries are necessary for insulin's effect on attractiveness, and manipulating insulin in ovaries alone has the same effect as global manipulation. Insulin in fat has opposite effect, suggesting a relationship with ovaries. Both tissue-specific insulin manipulations changed fecundity in the same direction, pointing to insulin as link between fecundity and attractiveness cues. Cues, cuticular hydrocarbons, responded differently to body and ovary manipulations, indicating independent activity from two tissues. The study describes a system where attractiveness comes from connection between cues and organism's state of fecundity, both created by insulin in fat and ovaries.
During the 2013-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa, the virus spread unevenly across the hardest-hit countries Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. To understand how the disease spread, researchers estimated the basic reproduction number (R) for each district and country using weekly case numbers. They found that R ranged from 0.36 to 1.72 in Guinea, 0.53 to 3.37 in Liberia, and 1.14 to 2.73 in Sierra Leone. At the national level, R was estimated at 0.97 for Guinea, 1.26 for Liberia, and 1.66 for Sierra Leone. The study suggests that urbanization, such as high population density and wealth, contributed to the spread of EVD. The researchers used district-level data and a statistical approach to model the growth of the epidemic at country and district level. They estimated transmissibility of EVD as R for Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra, and their 53 districts. The study found a relationship between R and socio-demographic variables, such as urbanization, as drivers of E transmission at population level.
Scientists have long debated what determines a protein's rate of evolution. Two main factors are at play: intrinsic properties of the protein itself and its age. Researchers studied the interplay between these two factors using a large dataset of human and mouse proteins with known structures. They found that previously reported relationships between protein structure and evolution still hold within each age group, but age also plays a role. Younger proteins, despite being less designable, evolve faster than older ones. Age affects the relationship between structure and evolution, making older proteins more stable and robust to mutations. The study suggests both intrinsic and historical factors interact to determine protein evolution rates.
Polycomb-like 3 (P3) is a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that promotes embryonic stem cell (ES) self-renewal. Researchers identified P3 as a binding partner of Suz12, a core component of PR2, using mass spectrometry and co-immunoprecipitation. Knocking down P3 in ES cells increases spontaneous differentiation, but not early differentiation, indicating P3 has a specific role in self-renew. P3 promotes PR2 function by increasing histone 3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-q) shows P3 co-localizes with Suz12 and depletion of P3 decreases Suz binding at 60% of PR2 targets. Mutation of conserved residues in the P Tudor domain of P3, which recognizes methylated histones, compromises H3me formation. P3 and its paralog P2 exist in different PR complexes but bind many of the same targets, particularly Cp islands regulated by P3. P3 is critical for ESC selfnew, histone methylation, and PR2 recruitment to a subset of genomic sites.
Researchers studied how the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans changes its chemosensory behavior in response to food availability. They found that a specific gene, sr-234, in the AD sensory neuron, is regulated by the transcription factor MEF-2 and basic helix-loop-helix (bHL) factors. MEF-2 and bHL work together to control the expression of sr-234 as a function of feeding state. A cis-regulatory M2 site is necessary for starvation-induced downregulation of sr-234, while an E-box binds bHL factors to drive expression in AD neurons. HL-2, HL-3, and HL-4 act in AD neurons to regulate sr-234. MX-3 and HL-30 in the intestine regulate sr- levels in AD neurons, dependent on insulin signaling in AD neurons. Intestine-to-neuron regulation of sr- involves insulin-like peptides. These results show that chemore gene expression is regulated by cell-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms mediated by MEF and bHL, allowing animals to fine-tune chemens responses to feeding changes.
Researchers studied the connection between mosquitoes and Buruli ulcer (BU), a skin infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium ulcerans, in southeastern Australia. They trapped mosquitoes in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula, Victoria, from 2004 to 2009, and tested them for M. ulcer using real-time PCR. The number of confirmed BU cases in residents during the same period was counted to find the average incidence in each town. A strong link was found between M. ulcer in mosquitoes and human disease risk (r, 0.99; 95% CI 0.92-0.99; p<0.001). This supports the idea that mosquitoes spread M. ulcer to humans in Australia. This has implications for controlling and preventing BU. Mosquitoes may play a role in spreading M ulcer in other areas like Queensland and Africa, where most cases occur, but more research is needed.
Researchers have identified a genetic mutation in the MRS2 gene, which codes for a magnesium ion channel in the mitochondria, as the cause of demyelination in rats. Demyelination is a condition where myelin breaks down in the central nervous system after normal myelination is complete. The mutation creates a new splice site that inactivates the gene, leading to a loss of function. Transgenic rats with the wild-type MRS2 gene validated the findings. M2 is essential for magnesium influx in mitochondria in yeast and human cells. Rats with the mutation have mitochondrial deficits, high lactic acid, low ATP, and swollen mitochondria in oligodendrocytes. M2 is mainly in neurons, not oligodrocytes, and in the inner mitochondria membrane. Observations suggest demel is due to mitochondrial disease and myelin maintenance is different from production. Mg2 homeostasis in mitochondria is crucial for myelin maintenance.
Researchers analyzed eight clinical microarray studies to evaluate the consistency of gene expression signatures in diagnosing and predicting diseases. They found that current documentation methods often lead to different diagnoses when applied to external patients, hindering their use in clinical practice. The team proposed a new documentation strategy that includes quantitative information, reducing discrepancies to 1%. This approach improves the process of bringing gene expression signatures to clinical practice, making it more reliable.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called curli, produced by certain bacteria, helps them stick to surfaces and form communities called biofilms, making them resistant to stress. They found that curli's structure is similar to human amyloid, a protein linked to Alzheimer's disease. Two peptides designed to stop human amyloid formation also stopped curli from forming and reduced bacterial biofilm in Salmonella. This suggests a new way to fight bacterial infections by targeting amyloid biofilms. The study also showed that cur can seed human amyloid formation, supporting the idea that amyloids can interact across species. Curli is made in a specific process and helps bacteria stick to cells, activate the immune system, and form biofilms. Amyloids are found in all life forms of life and play a role in many processes. A similar to cur, another protein in bacteria changed shape from a ball to a sheet-like structure when forming a biofilm. Cur's two main parts, Csg and Csg, work together to form fibrils, with Csg starting the process by interacting with unstructured C monomers. Two compounds also stopped a yeast protein from becoming a prion, a misfolded protein. This study offers a new way to stop curli formation and suggests that anti-amyloid drugs could target amyloid biofilms.
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a significant cause of encephal in Asia, with high fatality rates and neurologic sequelae among survivors. In the Philippines, the epidemiology of JE is not well defined. A systematic review of literature and surveillance data from 2011-2014 was conducted to support consideration of JE vaccine introduction into the national schedule. The review found 29 reports on JE in the Philippines, including 5 serologic surveys, 18 clinical cases, and 8 animal studies. Clinical studies reported 257 laboratory-confirmed JE cases from 1972-2013, with JE virus as causative in 7-18% of meningitis and encephalitis and 16-40% encephal cases. Predominantly affected children under 15, with 6-7% resulting in death. Surveillance from 2011-2014 identified 73 laboratory-confirmed JE out of 497 tested. The review demonstrates endemicity and geographic range of JE in the Philippines, supporting vaccine use in the country. Continued surveillance and laboratory confirmation is needed to quantify the burden, guide prioritization of high-risk areas, and age and schedule of vaccine introduction, and measure preventive measures against this public health threat.
Scientists have long debated the origins of genetic robustness in bacteria, which is the ability to withstand genetic mutations and environmental changes. Two main theories exist: it arises from environmental pressures or intrinsic factors, such as metabolic needs, or adaptive selection of genes that allow species to endure disruptions. To study this, researchers analyzed the robustness of metabolic networks in hundreds of bacterial species across various environments. They found that variations in robustness reflect ecological adaptations. Robustness was divided into two components: environmental, responsible for 20% of non-essential reactions, linked to species' lifestyle (specialized or generalist), and environmental-independent, linked to intrinsic capacities (0.6 correlation) of species, with higher robustness in fast growers or producers of secondary metabolites. Reactions uniquely susceptible to disruptions were identified in pathogens, potential drug targets.
Researchers conducted a study in Uganda to investigate the effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection on the immune response to measles vaccination in pre-school children. They found that children infected with S. mansoni had lower levels of antibodies against measles after vaccination compared to those who were not infected. The study also showed that treatment with prazantel, a medication used to treat S. mansoni, improved the immune response to measles vaccination in infected children who received it before or at the time of vaccination, but not after. At 24 weeks after vaccination, antibody levels did not differ between groups, but were lower in those who remained infected. The study suggests that S. mansoni infection may reduce the effectiveness of measles vaccination and that treating the infection with prazantel may help. This could be important in areas where schistosomiasis is common, as it may also affect responses to other vaccines.
Scientists have made significant progress in understanding how bacterial populations evolve by analyzing large-scale DNA samples. To get a clear picture of a population's genetic structure and ancestry, researchers need DNA sequences from many genes and a broad sampling of the population. However, traditional methods like phylogenetic analysis struggle with large samples, especially when recombination is common. To address this, researchers introduced statistical tools to detect and represent recombination between populations and a model population's shape in sequence space. They used extensive data from the Neisseria genus to demonstrate combining these tools with phylogen analysis. The tools are available in BAPS 5.2 software, downloadable from http://web.ab.fiak.fi/matec/software/baps.

A population of 508 Neisser strains was analyzed, assuming a simplified evolutionary model with a common local ancestor and global ancestor. Traditional genetic tools are not suitable for bacterial data, and phylogen analysis can be distorted by recombination. The new tools in BAPS enable large-scale population analysis, previously not possible with standard Bayesian methods. Neisser was chosen due to frequent recombination and horizontal gene flow between species.
Researchers have long believed that brain rhythms play a crucial role in our ability to focus and pay attention. A specific rhythm in the beta band, around 20 Hz, has been linked to attention in previous studies. This rhythm is thought to be generated in higher areas of the brain and sent to lower areas to help us focus. To understand how this works, scientists built a computer model of brain areas. Their results show that this rhythm can activate connections from lower to upper layers, helping us focus on one thing over another. They also found that certain cells in the brain, called inhibitory neurons, resonate at 20 Hz and control activity in upper layers in a way that helps us focus. This could explain how a chemical called acetylcholine helps us choose what to pay attention to.

The researchers tested how this rhythm affects cells in lower layers. They found that these cells can modulate activity in upper layers by sending signals to them. Specifically, they found that two types of connections from lower to upper layers are associated with this rhythm. This matches what happens in the brain when we pay attention to something inside our field of vision, but not outside. The rhythm enhances activity in upper layers, reduces in lower, and makes cells in upper fire more. This is consistent with how attention works in the brain.

The model shows that top-down signals, or from higher to lower, can bias competition in the brain. This is consistent with other models, but adds a new idea that interaction between layers, regulated by rhythm, helps us focus. Attention control is not fully understood, but competition has been thought to be a key. Recent studies link beta rhythm to top attention. This study used a model to see if rhythm can bias competition and how it does. They tested if rhythm reproduces what happens in the brain when we pay attention.
Researchers have developed a new method called Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems (MSS) to calibrate and predict the spread of epidemics using real-time data. Stochastic models are useful for studying the emergence of new diseases when the number of infected individuals is small, but current methods for estimating and predicting these models are limited. M uses a linear approximation to describe the size of fluctuations and updates the belief about the epidemic state with each new observation. The method was tested on simulated outbreaks of a viral pathogen and showed accurate estimates of key parameters such as duration of infectiousness, R0, and Reff, and the number of unobserved individuals during the epidemic. It also accurately predicted future hospitalizations and attack rate. M outperformed three state-of-the-art methods: likelihood with Poisson assumption, particle filtering, and Kalman filter in most scenarios. This method may improve current approaches for calibrating and predicting stochastic models of epidemics.
Researchers have discovered that our perception of the world around us is influenced by two opposing forces: one that pushes us away from what we've seen before and another that pulls us towards what we've decided in the past. In a series of experiments, they used multiple modeling and validation approaches to investigate how previous stimuli and decisions affect our perception. The results showed that our perception is shaped by a hierarchy of processes: low-level adaptation repels us from previous stimuli, while decisional attracts us to the past. This hierarchy is consistent with a two-process model where decision persistence compensates for adaptation, leading to biases in perception. The study proposes a unified account of dependence where distinct mechanisms at different stages promote differentiation and integration of visual information over time.

The research used multile modeling and cross-validation to investigate the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports in adjustment and forced-choice tasks. They found that perceptual reports are permeated by biases from a hierarchy of serial dependent processes. Low-level adaptation repels perception away from previous stimuli, whereas decisional attracts percept reports towards the past. This is consistent with a two-process model of dependence where persistence in decision compensates for adaptation, leading to attractive biases in perception.

The study aimed to determine whether dependence in perception depends on past stimuli or decisions. Recent work has shown that past stimuli bias decisions about present sensory input. However, the history of decisions itself is a source of perceptual bias that combines or outweighs the impact of previous stimuli. The results provided strong evidence for a hierarchical view of dependence and showed decisional affect percept even when interleaved with new stimuli. The study presents a unified account of concatenated perceptual and decisional processes, proposing a hierarchical model of dependence where adaptation and decisional forces interact shaping experience and reactions to stimuli.
Researchers studied the role of a protein complex called CLK-CYC in the fruit fly Drosila's internal clock, which regulates daily rhythms. CLK-CYC is a key component of the fly's circadian system, but its function was not fully understood. They created a modified version of the protein, CY-VP16, by adding a potent transcription activator from a virus to see if it would enhance CLKYC's activity. The results showed that CY-VP increased CLKYC's ability to turn on genes involved in the circadian rhythm. This was seen in both in cells and flies expressing CY-VP. These flies had higher levels of CLKYC target genes and a shorter circadian period, indicating that transcription plays a role in period determination. Further analysis showed that the shorter period was due to faster activation of transcription, not just higher levels of a protein. The study suggests that the timing of transcription, not the activation itself, is key to the observed effects in CYVP-expressing flies. The findings indicate that circadian transcription contributes to the fly's circadian function.
Scientists have long believed that horizontally acquired genes, or genes passed from one species to another, can function independently and confer new traits. However, a new research suggests that pre-existing proteins in an organism can limit the functionality of a horizontally acquired gene if it operates on an ancestral pathway. Researchers studied the horizontally acquired pmr gene in Salmonella, a type of bacteria, and Escherichia coli, a closely related bacteria. They found that the pmr gene activates the PA/PB system in Salmonella but not in E coli. coli. The pmr protein in Salmonella binds to phosphorylated PA, protecting it from dephosphorylation by PB, resulting in transcription of PA-dependent genes, including polymyxin resistance. In contrast, E coli pmr protein cannot activate PA/PB in E coli. coli. The researchers discovered that E coli pmB has higher phosphatase activity towards PA than Salmon pmB and identified a specific domain responsible for this property. Replacing E coli pmB with Salmon homolog restored E coli resistance to polymin in low Mg+ conditions. This study shows that differences in biochemical activities of ancestral proteins can dictate the ability of horizontally acquired gene to confer species-specific traits.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify genes involved in the early stages of cell differentiation, a process by which cells become more specialized. This method, called Differentiation-Test, analyzes gene expression data from a mixture of cells without separating them into different types. Previous methods often included genes that respond to differentiation, not regulate it. The team applied Different-Test to mouse embryonic stem cells and found Smad1, a new regulator of pluripotency and self-renew. They used short RNA to study two regulators detected by Different-Test, Smad1 and P2, and found lower expression in differentiated cells. The researchers separated regulators into two modules: upregulated during differentiation and downregulated, associated with pluripotency.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze genetic data from next-generation sequencing studies, called unbiased clustering of gene variants with phenotypic-link network. This method aims to identify functional associations between genes and their roles in diseases. Traditional methods use large-scale data, such as protein-protein interactions and gene-expression networks, but can be affected by bias, leading to false findings. The new method controls for a known bias in gene length, where longer genes tend to cluster together, leading to exaggerated results. It uses over 100,000 human genotype-phenotype relations and semantic similarity to enhance the network. The researchers tested the method on different data and networks and found that disease-associated genes cluster more in the phenotyp-link network than other networks. This method can identify functional genes in the same disease, even after accounting for sequencing bias, and is suitable for polygenic disorders.
Mexico implemented an 8% tax on non-essential foods with energy density ≥275 kcal/100g and a peso-per tax on sugar-sweet beverages (SBs) in January 2014 to prevent obesity and diabetes. This study examined changes in volume of taxed and untaxed food purchases in response to these taxes, stratified by socioeconomic status (SES). Data from 6,248 households in Nielsen's Mexico Consumer Panel (2012-2014) showed taxed food purchases declined by 5.1% in 2014 compared to expected trends, with no change in untaxed foods. Low SES households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods, medium SES 5.8% less, while high SES didn't change. The study's limitations include inability to infer causality due to national implementation and lack of control group, and only representing urban areas. Purchases of non-essential foods declined in the first year after taxes. Future studies should evaluate taxes' impact on energy intake, quality, and food patterns.
Researchers have developed a new model to explain the behavior of a specific type of neuron in the locust's brain called the Lobula Giant Detector (LG). This neuron is sensitive to objects approaching objects and responds best when they are on a collision course with the locust's compound eyes. A previous model, called η, used a power law to scale inhibitory input, but was not biologically plausible. The new model, n-ψ, is more realistic and assumes each channel is noisy and has a threshold. By pooling these channels, an approximate power law is obtained. This model can predict many characteristics of the LG neuron, including its response to approaching objects. The results depend on noise in the inhibitory pathway but are robust against noise in the excitatory pathway. The model shows that a power law alone is not enough, as it would distort the LG's response to approaching objects. The new model, nψ, is based on biophysical principles and describes the membrane potential of the LG neuron. It receives input signals and integrates them through the dendritic tree. The conditions for each channel are noise and a threshold.
Cameroon has been endemic for Buruli ulcer (BU) since 1969, but a national control program was only established in 2002. From 2001 to 2014, the number of cases dropped from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants, and the number of endemic districts rose from 2 to 64. Five diagnostic and treatment centers are now functional, with two more planned for 2015. The health system has been strengthened and research has gained interest in Cameroon. However, a reduction in resources and activities led to a drop in performance since 2010. The program aims to detect cases early, confirm 70% by PCR, treat all according to guidelines, and heal 95% without joint limitation. BU is expensive and occurs in poor, remote areas.
Researchers investigated how people's confidence in their choices affects their learning and decision-making in situations where they gain or lose something. They found that people are more confident in their choices when learning to gain something compared to avoiding a loss, even if they perform equally well in both situations. A computational model showed that this bias is due to "context-value", an estimate of the average value of options, which is different in gain and loss domains. This bias is the first found in a learning context and is general, meaning it has important consequences. It shows that people's flexibility in learning changes when outcomes are framed as gains or losses. A previous study showed that stakes can also bias people's confidence in choices, with gains increasing and losses decreasing it. Confidence is crucial in learning and decision-making, as it affects subsequent processes and strategies. The researchers hypothesized that people would be less confident in choices to avoid losses compared to gains, despite equal performance and difficulty. They found that this bias is generated by learned-value, a variable in some learning models. The study investigated behavior and confidence in a task where outcomes were manipulated (gains or losses). People performed equally well in gain and loss contexts.
Researchers have studied the role of a protein called ns3 in the replication of alphaviruses, a type of virus that causes diseases such as chikungunya fever and sindbis fever. Ns3 is part of the virus's replication complex and has a conserved amino-terminal domain that helps with RNA synthesis and a poorly conserved carbox-terminal region. They found that a carbox-terminal proline-rich sequence in ns3 is a target for a protein called amphiphin, which is found in host cells. Amphins bind to ns3 of three alphaviruses, including semli forest, sind, and chikunya, and this interaction is important for viral replication. When cells are infected with alphavirus, amphins move to where ns3 is located. Disrupting ns3's ability to bind amphin or silencing amphin expression impairs viral replication in cells. In mice infected with alphavirus that can't bind amphin, the virus is less deadly. This study shows that ns3's interaction with amphin is crucial for alphavirus replication.
Researchers studied 123 strains of a disease-causing fungi in Brazil, known as chromoblastyc, to understand its diversity. They used DNA sequencing to identify the species. The fungi were divided into three groups, with Fonca being the most common, followed by Rhinadiella and Cyellophora. Fonca pedso was the most prevalent, found in 80% of cases, followed by 13% for monora, 3 for nica, and 1 pnius. Two new species, Rhinadi and Cyello, were also found, making up 3 and 1% of cases, respectively. The study found that Fonca pedso and nica are associated with the disease, while monora is not. Cladiophora was not found, likely due to climate, as it thrives in arid conditions.
Listeria monocytogenes, a type of bacteria, infects host cells and causes DNA damage, but surprisingly, the host's DNA damage response is only moderately activated. Researchers found that the bacteria's toxin, listeriolysin O (LO), blocks the host's DNA damage response by degrading a key sensor protein, Mre11. Without this protein, the bacteria can replicate more easily, showing the importance of this mechanism in controlling infection. The study reveals that dampening the host's DNA response is crucial for the bacteria's success. This is the first time it's been shown that the DNA response can be a negative regulator of bacterial infection. Other bacteria, like Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoe, also cause DNA damage, but it's not been studied during Lister infection. Lister's LO degrades M11 through proteasome degradation, and dampening the response is important for infection, as blocking proteins in this pathway increase bacteria. The study uncovers Lister's subversion of the DNA response and its role in blocking bacterial proliferation.
Researchers have identified a protein called BRD4 as a key player in the infection of two common viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2, which cause diseases in humans. They tested a library of chemicals that regulate gene expression and found that blocking a part of BR4, called the BD domain, increased infection. Using a specific chemical called JQ, they found that JQ acts by blocking BR4, as knocking down BR4's expression stopped JQ's effect on infection. BR4 regulates virus replication by forming a complex with proteins CD9 and RNA polymerase II, while JQ promotes infection by directing the complex to viral gene promoters. Suppressing BR4 or blocking CD9 activity hindered infection. The study suggests JQ enhances infection by switching BR4 to regulate viral gene expression by targeting chromatin.
Researchers studied the microbial communities in the mouths of children with a devastating illness called noma cancrum, which causes severe facial disfigurement and affects over 140,000 malnourished children every year. The cause of noma is still unknown, but a mix of infection, poor oral hygiene, and weakened immune system likely contribute to the development of oral lesions. These lesions are entry points for microorganisms that trigger gangren facial infections. The team sequenced 16 rRNA gene fragments from 60 samples of gingival fluid from 12 healthy children, 12 with noma lesions, and 12 with Acute Necrotizing Gingitis (AN) lesions and healthy sites. Compared to healthy individuals, samples from diseased mouths were enriched with Spirocha and depleted Proteobacteria. Samples from healthy sites of diseased had similar proportions of Spiro and Proteobacteria to healthy controls. Samples from n mouths did not have higher Fusobacter abundance, casting doubt on its causative role. Microbial communities from n and AN lesions were dominated by Prevotella intermedia OT, less abundant in healthy sites. Multivariate analysis confirmed different bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites. Several OTUs in Erysotrichales, Cloidales, Boid, and Spirotales were identified as indicators of n, suggesting one or more microbes within these orders associated with noma development.
Bacillus thuringis, a bacterium that infects insects, uses a communication system called quorum sensing to adapt to its environment and decide whether to form spores or survive in the insect cadaver. Researchers studied the role of quorum sensing in this bacterium and found that a protein called Npr plays a key role in this process. Npr is activated by a signaling peptide called Npr and acts as a transcription factor, turning on genes that help the bacteria survive in the insect cadaver. However, in the absence of Npr, Npr has a different function: it inhibits sporulation, the process of forming spores. Npr does this by preventing a protein called SpoA from being activated, which is necessary for spore formation. This is similar to how other proteins called Raps work, which don't bind DNA but control gene expression through protein interactions. The structure of Npr shows it has a flexible shape similar to Raps. The researchers propose that Npr has two functions: binding Npr makes it an inhibitor of sporulation, while binding N makes it a transcription activator of necrotrophic lifestyle. This coordination of sporulation and necrotism ensures the bacteria's survival and spread during infection.
Researchers have developed a new way to predict which HIV treatment will work best for an individual patients by combining genetic and chemical information. Current treatments for HIV can't cure the virus, but can control it with multiple drugs. Each patient has a unique viral type, making it hard to choose the right treatment. With genetic and chemical data, models can predict the best treatment. Previous models only used genetic data, not chemical similarity of drugs. The new method, called proteochem, combines genetic and chemical properties in one model. A large database of 300,000 data points was used, including 4 types of drugs and 10,700 mutants. The new models were accurate, with an error rate below 0.5.5. They also did better than previous models in predicting resistance, 0.76 compared to 0.91. Known and new resistance-causing mutations were found, such as K102 and Q18. The models were applied to a public database and correctly predicted 84% of resistance, compared to 80%. This method can predict resistance for new mutants and mixtures and inform users about reliability.
Researchers have proposed an alternative mechanism for chemotaxis, the process by which cells move towards chemical attractants. They suggest that pseudopods, formed by a self-generated cycle, are modulated by chemotactants rather than directly causing actin polymerization. A computational model based on pseudod autocatalysis reproduces a wide range of existing data on cell movement and chemaxis. It simulates cell polarization, persistence, and pseudod selection in chemactant gradients, and predicts pseudod position and initiation in gradients. The model predicts that the angle between pseudods at the front of the cell increases with the difference between the cell's direction and the gradient. Experiments on Dictyostelium cells confirm this prediction. The model and data suggest that rapidly moving cells like Dictyostelium and neutrophils have an intrinsic pseudod cycle at the heart of their motility. This implies that chemaxis relies on modification of pseudod behaviour, not generation of new pseudods or actin polymer by chemactants. The model is robust to changes in parameters and emerges two mechanisms of chemaxis, pseudod selection and orientation, from simple pathways. Actin polymerization and depolymerization following stimuli are also observed without multiple pathways.
Researchers studied how fleas transmit the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which causes plague, to rodents. They found that fleas can transmit the bacterium in two ways: early-phase transmission (EPT) and bio-dependent transmission (BDT). However, the efficiency of transmission varies among flea species and rodent blood sources. To understand EPT, they fed fleas bacteremic blood from mice, rats, guinea pigs, and gerbils. They observed that 10-28% of fleas fed rat or guinea blood regurgitated a portion of the infected meal into the esophagus within 24 hours. This phenomenon is called post-infection esophageal reflux (PIER). In contrast, PIER was rare in fleas fed bacteremic mouse or gerbil blood. PIER correlated with accumulation of dense aggregates of Y. pest, red blood cells, and hemoglobin in the proventulus. At next feeding, fleas with PIER were 3-25 times more likely to be blocked, with blood retained in the esagus, than fleas without P. Three days after feeding on bacteremic rat blood, Oropsa montana transmitted significantly more CFU than groups using mouse blood, and this transmission was bio-dependent. Data support a model where EPT results from regurgitation of Y. pest from obstructed foregut and E and BDT can overlap.
Researchers have found that positive correlations between the activity of neurons in the brain can actually improve the accuracy of coding, rather than hinder it. Contrary to previous studies, which showed that correlations were either detrimental or marginally beneficial, this study shows that they can enhance performance by astronomical factors. The probability of error can be suppressed by many orders of magnitude and the number of stimuli encoded, or capacity, can be increased more than tenfold. These effects don't require unrealistic correlation values and can occur in populations with just a few neurons. The study also found that heterogeneity in activity is beneficial and that both error suppression and enhancement depend on a specific pattern of correlation. Tuning one or several parameters can lead to perfect coding. The pattern of positive correlation leads to a "locking" of response that eliminates variability in the space relevant for stimulus discrimination. The researchers suggest that this pattern is a key to high-fidelity coding and propose tests to identify it.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine against cholera, a severe diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholera bacteria. The vaccine combines a specific part of the bacteria's outer shell, called OSP, with a fragment of tetanus toxin. They tested the vaccine in mice and found it induced strong immune responses, including antibodies and memory cells that can fight the bacteria. The vaccine also protected mice from cholera in a challenge test. The researchers varied the amount of OSP in the vaccine and the ratio of OSP to tetanus fragment, as well as the adjuvant used and route of immunization. They found similar immune responses in mice with different variations, but lower responses in those with the highest dose. The vaccine worked with or without adjuvant. Administering the tetanus fragment resulted in 55% protection against cholera in mice. This new vaccine could be beneficial, especially for young children who don't respond well to the bacteria's outer shell.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to investigate the effectiveness of immunochromatographic test (ICT) in mapping lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas with contrasting levels of Loa loa and Mansonella perans endemicity. The study assessed the prevalence and intensity of Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Mansonella perans in 42 villages across three regions of Cameroon's rainforest domain. Blood samples were collected for circulating filarial antigen detection by ICT and microfilaria assessment. Clinical manifestations of LF were also evaluated. Overall, 219 individuals participated, with 24 testing positive by ICT, ranging from 0% in South-west to 2.1% in North. Lymphedema was diagnosed in 20 individuals, mostly in North, with none testing positive by ICT. No microf W. bancfti were found in blood of individuals with positive ICT or lymphedema. Positive ICT was associated with high Loa intensity, with 21 having over 8,000 Loa/ml (odds ratio 15.4; CI 6.1-39; p<0.001). A strong association was observed between Loa prevalence and ICT area, with 1% or more positive results in areas with Loa above 15%. No association was found between ICT and M perans prevalence or density. The study confirmed association between ICT and Lo intensity, and demonstrated strong association with Lo prevalence. Results suggest main confounding factor for positive test results are high Lo levels. Findings indicate W. bancft less prevalent in Central region than assumed, accurate re-mapping useful for shrinking LF distribution map.
Scientists have studied how the SARS-CoV virus replicates, or makes copies itself, inside host cells. They found that it uses a network of modified endoplasmic reticulum, a type of cell membrane, to do so. This network is made up of convoluted membranes and double-membr vesicles (DMVs) that are about 200-300 nanometers in diameter. These DMVs are not just floating vesicles, but are part of the network. The virus uses this network to make its RNA, the genetic material it needs to replicate. The virus also uses this network to hide from the cell's defense mechanisms that try to fight it off the virus. The researchers used electron tomography to see the network in 3D at high resolution. They found that the convol membranes, not the DMVs, have viral replicase subunits, the proteins that help make the virus copy itself. The DMVs have double-stranded RNA, the virus's genetic material, inside. But the researchers couldn't see how the DMs connect to the cell's cytoplasm. This raises questions about how the DMs form and where the virus makes its RNA. The study shows how the virus reorganizes the cell's membranes to replicate and hide from the immune system. This will help scientists understand the early stages of the virus's life cycle and how it interacts with the host.
Scientists have long believed that a substance called suberin plays a crucial role in helping plants absorb water and nutrients from the soil. However, there was no direct evidence to support this idea until now. Researchers studied a plant called Arabidopsis thaliana and found that when suberin is present in the roots, it helps control how water and nutrients move into the plant. They created a mutant plant with more suberin in its roots and found that it had less water loss and more efficient water use during growth. The plant also had less calcium, manganese, and zinc, and more sodium, sulfur, selenium, and molybdenum in its leaves. This shows that suberin in the roots helps control water and nutrient transport to the leaves. The team also found that suberin acts as a barrier to water and mineral transport in the plant. When suberin is high, it reduces water movement to the shoot and loss from the root to soil. They tested this by measuring water loss in plants with more suberin and found it was 15% of normal plants. This supports the idea that suberin is a barrier to water and nutrient transport. The study suggests that increasing suberin could help develop drought-resistant crops with better water use.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of rhodopsin deactivation and its role in regulating the reproducibility of the single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction. They used a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CT) model based on the biochemistry of rhodin activation and deactivation, interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. The model reproduced both wild-type (WT) and mutant responses with variable numbers of phosphorylation sites. The sources of variability were dissected into components: random number of turn-off steps, random sojourn time between steps, or both. Results showed that only randomness of soj times in phosphorylated states contributed to coefficient of variation (CV) of response, while randomness of number of turn steps had negligible effect. This contradicts the view that larger number of decay steps makes response more stable. Rhodin shutoff is responsible for variability, while diffusion of second messengers acts as suppressor.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical framework to analyze complex networks within cells that are affected by external factors outside the network, such as fluctuations in the number of ribosomes in a gene network. These external factors can make it hard to model the network's behavior. The new framework separates the network from its environment by incorporating the environment's effect into a new model. This allows for a "self-contained" model that summarizes all possible behaviors under external fluctuations. The model can be used to analyze a network subject to external noise without considering the noise.

The study shows that models of biochemical networks need to account for both internal and external noise caused by variations in the cellular environment. This is done by extending the model's state with environmental species whose dynamics are described along with the system of interest. The decoupled dynamics provide a tool to study how stochasticity is propagated through reaction networks. The environmental noise is split into two terms: one that is suppressed and one that is sensed by the network.

The decoupled process can reduce computational effort in Monte Carlo simulations, especially if the environment is costly to simulate. This highlights the framework as a tool to split biochemical networks into parts that are easier to simulate. The time evolution of a reaction network is described by a continuous Markov chain with species and channels. The state at time is denoted and its path on intervals.
Researchers have developed a new brain-machine interface (BMI) system that allows people to control devices with their thoughts at a faster and more precise scale than current systems. The system uses two main components: an infinite-hor feedback model of the brain's behavior and a point model of neural spikes. The feedback model infers the user's intention during control and is used for training and adaptation. The point model enables processing and adaptation with every spike at a time, unlike current decoders that use batch adaptation on slower time scales. Experiments in a non-human primates showed that the system improved performance compared to current techniques and allowed consistent control. Spike-based adaptation was faster and more consistent than batch methods and robust to initialization. The system also controlled tasks beyond those used for training. This has implications for developing clinically viable neuroprosthetics.
Researchers studied how the retina responds to different types of visual stimuli, such as movies and white noise patterns, to understand how it processes information. They found that the retina doesn't completely eliminate redundancies in responses, but reduces them to a lower level, similar to responses to white noise. The amount of correlation varies between stimuli, but is less than predicted by a non-adaptive model. Experiments showed the retina doesn't fully decorrelate its input, even with least correlated stimuli, some correlations are present between ganglion cell spike trains. Results are consistent with previous studies on LGN and visual cortex, which differ in structure when probed with natural versus random stimuli. Gain of ganglion cells responding to correlated stimuli changes with effective contrast, i.e. standard deviation of input to nonlinearity in linear model. The retina may adjust its coding strategy to represent new stimulus efficiently.
Researchers have developed a new approach to predict genetic interactions between genes, called synthetic lethality, which occurs when a combination of mutations results in a surprising effect. This is important for understanding how proteins work together in pathways and the causes of diseases. They used data from various sources to create a large number of features characterizing relationships between genes. These features were independent of known interactions, unlike previous methods. A non-parametric multi-classifier system was developed to predict interactions using these features. Experiments showed improved performance compared to current method. The approach was used to create a yeast transcription factor genetic network, supported by literature, and predicted interactions between non-essential genes. This method is expected to uncover new interactions in yeast and higher organisms like mouse and human, where few have been identified.
The BRCA Challenge is a global data-sharing project that aggregates BRCA1 and BR2 data to support collaborative research. It aims to understand how genetic variations affect cancer risk in these genes. Initially, variants from public databases were integrated into a single site, www.brca.org. The BR Exchange provides a reliable and accessible record of interpreted variants for high-risk phenotypes. Over 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number in the next-largest database, with 7,250 classifications. Data comes from clinical databases like BIC, ClinVar, and LOVD, and population databases linked to one access. The BR Challenge brought together experts, clinicians, researchers, and providers to advance understanding BR1 and BR2 variation. Ongoing work includes sharing data with centers, developing methods for genetic variation extraction, and engaging communities for clinical significance.

The scope of BR1 and BR2 testing is larger than other cancer genes, but data has not been coordinated. Multiple databases and proprietary testing have hindered linking well-annotated variants for interpretation. The BR Challenge shares and annotates variants to advance health globally. BR1 and BR2 are a compelling case for sharing to improve variant interpretation, enabling clinicians and patients to decide. The BR Exchange is an open portal to improve sharing and classification, improving care for clinicians, patients, and families. The Challenge brings clinicians, researchers, scientists, patients, and advocates to a new data-sharing model.
Malaria, a disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite, remains a significant threat to human health, resulting in over one million deaths annually. To survive and thrive, Plmod undergoes a complex life cycle in humans and mosquitoes, requiring adaptation to various environments. To manage oxidative stress and maintain redox processes, Plmod relies on a delicate balance. Researchers have mapped the subcellular localization of antioxidant and redox proteins in Plmod falcum for the first time. They found that two Plmod peroxiredoxins and a putative glyoxal system are targeted to the apoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid, similar to plant chloroplasts. A complete picture of thioredoxin and glutaredin-like proteins was also obtained. Notably, Plmod uses alternative translation initiation (ATI) to target two major antioxidant enzymes, glutathione reductase and thioreductase, to different locations. This dual localization by ATI may occur in other Apicomplex parasites, opening new avenues for intervention.

The study provides the first comprehensive picture of cellular redox metabolism in malaria. The apoplast, a non-photosynthetic plast of Plmod, contains plant-like metabolic pathways, including fatty acid and hem biosynthesis. Until now, no data existed on antioxidative capacity of the apoplast. Two major antioxidants, catalase and glutathione peroxide, are absent in the parasite. This offers potential for therapeutic agents disrupting redox balance in Plmod. Many redox enzymes contain targeting sequences, but localization has not been demonstrated. Plasium has two NAD-dependent red systems with broad antioxidant mechanisms. The study maps the red system of malaria, understanding cellular functions and interactions. ATI exists in Apicom parasites, translating isoforms with subcell localization from one gene.
Researchers studied how a protein called PUM binds to its partner Mcl-1. PUM is a type of protein that doesn't have a fixed shape on its own, but folds into a specific shape when it binds to M-1. They used a computer model to see how electrostatic interactions, or charges, affect this process. The model was tested with data on how much of the protein was folded and how well it bound to M-1, and matched what was already known about how binding changed with salt levels. They found that the protein's own electrostatic interactions didn't much affect its shape before binding. However, electrostatic interactions between PUM and M-1, especially non-native ones, helped form the initial complex. The model showed the binding process in more detail than experiments alone, revealing the role of non-electrostatic interactions. The study highlights the importance of electrostatic interactions in binding of proteins that don't have a fixed shape. This approach can be used to predict how mutations affect binding.
Researchers studied how Polycomb proteins, which help silence genes during development, move in fruit fly embryos. They found that these proteins form structures called Polycomb bodies, which contain silenced genes, and move in the nucleus. Using a combination of techniques, they tracked the formation and movement of these bodies during embryogenesis. They found that Polycomb bodies correspond to 3D structures of genomic domains identified in previous studies. During early development, Polycomb and Polyhomeotic proteins accumulate in these bodies, which form on euchromatin domains with histone H3-methylated on K27. Time-lapse analysis showed two types of motion: long-range movement of bodies and chromatin domains, and fast movement of individual bodies and chromatin. Both types move within smaller volumes than chromosome territories, limiting interaction with other nuclear structures. Fast motion decreases in late stages, suggesting chromatin dynamics in gene silencing maintenance.
Researchers used ultra-deep sequencing to study mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in mice that age normally and prematurely. They found that mice with a proofreading-deficient mtDNA polymerase, called mt mutator, have 10 times more mutations than their normal siblings. These mice also have more linear mtDNA fragments and less complete DNA in some areas. In contrast, large DNA deletions are rare in these mice and don't seem to cause premature aging. Analysis shows that most mutations in these mice come from their mothers, suggesting they are inherited. The study found no increase in mutations or deletions in normal mice as they age, questioning their role in aging. Oxidative damage is also not a main cause of mt mutations. The study suggests most mt mutations occur during development, not from damage later in life.
Researchers have discovered a new type of sodium-driven ATP synthase membrane motor in the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum that uses glutamate decarboxylation to generate a transmembrane gradient of sodium ions. This ionotive force is directly coupled to ATP synthesis via an F1-ATP synthase with a novel sodium recognition motif shared by other human pathogens. Molecular modeling and free energy simulations of the rotary element of the enzyme, the c-ring, indicate sodium specificity in physiological settings. Consistently, activity measurements showed sodium stimulation of the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, and ATP synthesis was sensitive to sodium ionophore monens. Furthermore, sodium has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting ion-binding sites, both the complete ATPase and isolated. Evidence of sodium coupling is provided by two crystal structures of the c-ring solved by X-ray crystallography at 2.2 and 2.6 resolution at pH 5.3 and 8.7, respectively. Sodium ions occupy binding sites, each coordinated by four amino acids and a water. Intriguingly, carboxylates mediate ion binding. Simulations and experiments demonstrate this implies a proton is bound to all sites, although sodium alone drives the rotary mechanism. The structure reveals a new mode of ion coupling in ATPases and provides a basis for drug efforts against opportunistic pathogen.
Researchers studied how the immune system's T cells, called T cells, recognize and respond to foreign substances on the surface of other cells. This recognition is a key step in fighting off infections and diseases. In the lab, it's known that strong and long-lasting interactions between T cells and these substances, called major histocompatibility complex (MHC), lead to strong T cell activation. However, the study found that in the body, T cells respond best to substances with medium-strength interactions with M, not the strongest. In fact, the strongest interactions led to weaker cell responses and less ability to fight off infections. This challenges the idea that stronger is always better when it comes to T and M interactions. The study suggests that vaccine design should consider how substances interact with T in the body, not just in the lab, to be effective.
The fungus Nect haematocca, also known as Fusarium solani, is a member of a group of over 50 species called the Fusarium solani complex. This group has diverse properties, including causing disease in over 100 plant genera and opportunistic infections in humans. Researchers studied the most known member of this group, N haematocca mating population VI (MP). They found that genes controlling its ability to colonize specific habitats are on extra chromosomes, called supernary. These extra chromosomes have unique genes not found in other fungi, including its closest relative Fusarium gramineum, and multiple copies of genes found in other fungi. Some genes may have come from duplication, while others from horizontal transfer. Three extra chromosomes, 14, 15, and 17, were confirmed absent in some isolates lacking specific sequences on their ends. These extra chromosomes have more repeats, unique genes, and lower G content compared to others. The origin of extra genes and chromosomes is unknown, but expansion and large size match species' diverse habitats. Unique genes on extra chromosomes might explain isolates having different niches.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how herpesviruses, a type of virus that causes cold sores and other diseases, leave infected cells. They used a special microscope to watch live cells and see how the virus particles move and leave the cell. The method, called total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, lets them see the virus near the cell membrane. They also used a special tool to see when the virus leaves the cell. The study found that virus particles travel in small, acid-filled vesicles to the cell membrane, where they leave the cell. Three proteins, Rab6, Rab8, and Rab11, help the vesicles move to the right place. The vesicles then dock and fuse with the cell membrane, releasing the virus. After leaving the cell, the virus stays on the surface. This study helps understand how herpesviruses leave cells, which is important for understanding how they spread and cause disease.
Researchers studied the impact of Enterobius vermicularis infection and mebendazole treatment on the intestinal microbiota and immune response in 109 primary school children in Taiwan. They found that Enterobias increased gut diversity and peaked after meendazole treatment. At the phylum level, pinworm and meendazole were associated with decreased Fusobacteria and increased Actinobacteria. The probiotic Bifobacterium abundance increased after Enterias and meend treatment. Intestinal SIg levels were lower in the pin-infected group and higher in the meend-treated group. A higher pre-treatment Salmonella proportion was linked to increased SIg after meend dewing. The study suggests that exposure to pin and meend is associated with increased diversity, Actinob, and probiotic Bifobacterium, and decreased Fusob. SIg levels were lower in pin-inf and higher in meend-treated. 

The study found that Enterobias and meend dewing altered the intestinal microbiome, consistent with previous helminth-infected microbiota studies. Further metabolomics studies are needed to evaluate if pin and meend alter commensal metabolism and host immune. The change in microbial composition after meend in pin-inf children may be confounded by late effects of Enterias. More experiments, including animal studies, are needed to understand relationships between pin, microbiota, and immune. The immunomodulatory effect of pin may depend on individual microbiota interaction.
Researchers studied the genetics of root length in Arabidopsis thalian, a plant species, and found that most of the genetic variation in root length was not due to individual genes acting alone, but to interactions between genes. This is known as epistasis, where two or more genes work together to affect a trait. They used a method called genome-wide association analysis to identify genes involved in root length and found four pairs of interacting genes that explained a large part of the variation in the population. These genes were not detected in a standard analysis that only looked at individual genes. The researchers estimated that half of these interactions were real, not false positives due to the small population size of the study. They found functional genes in three of the pairs that affect root development. The study shows that epasis can explain why some traits have low heritability, or genetic variation, and why some genes are not found in standard analysis. It also highlights the importance of accounting for epasis in genetic studies.
Researchers analyzed 30,506 mitochondrial DNA (mt) sequences from around the world to understand how genetic background influences the occurrence and severity of disease-causing mt mutations. They found that the likelihood of having two or more disease-causing mutations was 6 times lower in certain mt haplogroups, suggesting that the background plays a role in acquiring or retaining disease-causing mutations. The study also showed that disease-causing mutations were more frequent in younger sequences and genomes, and that some mutations recurred within the same phylogenetic cluster. This implies that natural selection may have purified disease-causing mutations in older populations, explaining why they are less common in specific ethnic groups. The researchers also found that 43% of recurrent disease-causing mt mutations were associated with specific haplogroups, but not necessarily disease-causing, and that the dataset was representative of global populations, not enriched with rare variants or mutations from patients with mitochondrial diseases. Overall, the study suggests that mt background influences the occurrence and severity of disease-causing mt mutations, not just a few examples.
Researchers have developed a computer model to study how cells move and interact with each other on a surface with tiny patterns. This is important for understanding how cancer spreads, how embryos develop, and how wounds heal. The model includes how cells change shape and how they stick to each other. It shows that a balance between how cells stick to each other and how they move is key to what happens when they collide. The model can reproduce different outcomes of cell collisions, such as changing direction, sticking together, or passing by each other. It suggests why different types of cells behave differently and how interventions can change outcomes.

The model is more detailed than simple models that just look at how cells move together. It shows that cell shape and adhesion can have a big effect on how cells move. This is different from what would be expected from simpler models. The model also shows that combining cell shape and adhesion can lead to new effects not seen before.

The model was applied to neural crest cells and cancer cells. It can reproduce four types of collisions seen in these cells. This would not happen with a simpler model. The model shows that detailed interactions and cell dynamics are needed to understand how cells interact. It shows that combining cell shape and biochemistry can lead to unexpected effects, such as adhesion not always making cells walk past each other.

Collective cell movement is important for many biological processes, like the immune system, development, and cancer. Cell interactions drive new dynamics not seen in single cells.
Researchers have been trying to figure out how thioredoxin (Tr) breaks down its mixed disulfide complex for over 20 years. A mixed disulfide is a type of chemical bond between two sulfur atoms. Thiorexin is a protein that helps convert oxidized proteins back to their normal state. To study this process, scientists looked at a complex between thiorexin and a protein called arsenate reductase (Ars). They found that a sulfur atom in thiore (CysTr) attacks another sulfur in Ars (CysArs) to form a disulfide. Then, another sulfur in thiore (CysTr) attacks the disulf to break it apart. This sulfur in thiore (CysTr) is more reactive than the other sulfur in Ars (ysArs). The study used computer simulations and experiments to see how thiore breaks down the disulf. They found that the sulfur in thiore (CTr) changes shape to make it easier for it to attack the disulf and break it apart. This helps us understand how thiorexin works to convert oxidized proteins back to normal.
People's preferences are not fixed and can change based on what others' choices. Researchers tested this idea in a study of 700 14-24 year olds. They found that people are uncertain about their own preferences and can learn from others' choices. This uncertainty is reflected in their choices before and after seeing others' preferences. A model, called the taste-uncertainty (K) model, showed that people update their preferences based on new information. The study found that people's variability in choices is due to uncertainty, not just random noise. When people see others' choices, they update their beliefs about their own preferences. This is a new way of learning, called Bayesian updating. The study suggests that people are uncertain about their own preferences and can change based on others' choices. This has implications for understanding brain development and decision-making.
Scientists have been trying to understand how different signals in a cell come together to create a single response. In yeast, multiple pathways control a complex process called filamentous growth, which happens under specific conditions. To study this, researchers used a new method called secretion profiling to measure the release of a protein called Ms2, which is involved in filament growth. They found that many pathways that regulate growth were also required for the Ms2 pathway to work. This made the pathway more sensitive to signals and connected it to the cell's global network. Several regulators were needed for Ms2 expression, showing it's a key point where signals meet. The promoter of Ms2 was also controlled by a protein called HDAC, which helped the pathway and growth. This study shows how pathways that control growth are connected and work together to create a complex response.
Researchers studied how changes in gene expression contribute to the evolution of different body shapes in filamentous fungi. They grew five species of fungi, Sordomycetes, in a common environment and measured gene expression at five stages of development. They found genes that increased in expression led to changes in fruit body shape. Knocking out these genes in two species showed altered fruiting body development. This approach was more efficient than studying whole genomes or gene families. Combining gene expression with knockout helped refine networks of genes controlling fruit body development, a complex process in multicellular organisms.

Fungal fruiting bodies have similar stages but different shapes. This makes them ideal for studying how common and different developmental sources of similar traits and how new traits arise despite existing networks. The researchers found key genes in Neurospora and Fusarium for sexual development and reproduction. They used a systematic approach by comparing gene expression across species. Mapping variations in developmental processes is key to understanding evolution.

Bayesian networks based on gene expression are hypothetical until verified by specific studies. Combining with knockout helps understand relationships among genes in a process and how they evolved. Estimating expression in ancestral lineages identifies changes that may lead to new traits. If complex traits depend on gene changes, morphology should map to expression changes.
Scientists have found a new way to introduce genetic material into the eggs of a parasite called Schistosoma, which causes a disease in humans. This parasite has a high ratio of germ cells to non-germ cells, making it a good target for genetic modification. The researchers used a technique called electroporation to deliver genes and molecules into the eggs. They tested it with fluorescent RNA, messenger RNA, and a virus. The results showed that electrop was more effective than just soaking the eggs in the material. The virus was detected in the eggs and the larvae that hatched from them. The virus was also found in the germ cells of the larvae, which is important for genetic modification. The study suggests that electrop is a good way to introduce genes into Schosoma eggs.
Researchers have developed a new approach called Perturbation Markov Transmission (PM) to study the dynamic behavior of large molecular assemblies in cells. These assemblies are crucial for various biological processes and signaling between different parts of the cell. Previous studies have looked at the topology and fluctuations of these networks, but not the time-dependent behavior. The PM model monitors responses of over 8,000 residues across 6 decades of time after a perturbation, using a method called Klov subspace projection. It can identify key residues for movement, signaling, and binding. The team applied this to the Gro-Gro chaper system and found 71-84% accuracy with experimental studies. This method is general and can be used for other assemblies like viruses and ribosomes.
Researchers have discovered that a type of carbohydrate-binding protein called galectin from a mushroom, Coprinopsis cinerea, is toxic to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. When fed to the nematode, the galectin, called CGL2, inhibited its development and ultimately led to its death. The researchers found that the toxicity depends on the interaction between the galectin and a specific sugar-containing molecule on the nemode's surface. They identified the sugar molecule as a Gal1,4Fuc1,6 modification of the nemode's N-glycan core. The study suggests that fungal galectins play a role in defense against predators by binding to specific sugar molecules on their prey. To test the galectin's toxicity, researchers fed nemodes with E. coli bacteria expressing the galectin or a defective version that can't bind carbohydrates. They found that nemodes lacking a specific sugar on their surface were resistant to the galect's toxicity. Another galect from a different mushroom, Agaricus bisporus, was also toxic to nemodes. This led researchers to the hypothesis that galectins help fungi defend against predators like nematodes. They found that C. cin galect C2 was toxic to C. elegans and identified the sugar it binds to as Gal1,4uc,6 modification of the nem's N-gcan core. This modification is also found in other animals like octopus and squid. The researchers found a gene that may be involved in making this sugar modification, which could shed light on its function.
A long-lived reservoir of latently infected CD4 T cells is a major barrier to curing HIV and has been extensively studied, but its effect on the virus's evolutionary dynamics has received little attention. Researchers developed a within-host quasis model that incorporates a long-lived reservoir and nested it into an epidemiological model of HIV dynamics. They found that the presence of a reservoir severely delays evolutionary dynamics within a host, with longer delays associated with larger reservoir sizes and homeostatic proliferation of cells within the reservoir. These delays change the dynamics of the virus at the epidemiological scale. The delay in within evolutionary can be sufficient for the virus to evolve intermediate loads consistent with maximising transmission, as observed, not the high loads previous models predicted. This effect can be enhanced if viruses similar to those initiating infection are preferentially transmitted. The results depend on within characteristics such as reservoir size, with evolution observed only when dynamics are sufficiently delayed. The reservoir has an underappreciated role in both within and between-host evolution.
Researchers studied how the Coxsackievirus B3 (CV3) virus evades the immune system by looking at how it affects the presentation of antigens to T cells. Antigens are proteins on the surface of infected cells that T cells recognize to fight the virus. They used special T cells that can detect specific antigens to see how CV3 affects antigen presentation in the body. They found that CV3 almost completely stops the presentation of antigens to CD8 T cells, which are a type of T cell that kills infected cells. However, it doesn't stop presentation to CD4 cells, another type of T cell that helps other cells. CD4 cells can still recognize CV3 and fight it, and even remember it for later to fight again. This is important because it shows how CV3 avoids being detected by the immune system.
Researchers conducted a study to compare the effectiveness of high-dose intravenous methylprednisone and oral prednisone versus intravenous saline and oral prednisone in treating leprosy Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment. Forty-two individuals were randomly assigned to receive methylprednisone followed by predone or predone alone. There were no significant differences in the rate of adverse events or improvement at the end of the study. However, those treated with methylprednis were less likely to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and 113. The study also found that 50% of individuals with Type 1 reactions and nerve impairment required additional predone despite 16 weeks of corticosteroids. This supports the use of prolonged corticosteroid treatment for Type 1 reactions and investigation of factors for recurrence after corticoid treatment.
Researchers studied how regulatory T cells (Treg) affect CD8 T cells in people with chronic HIV infection. They found that Treg cells from HIV-infected individuals (Treg/HIV) did not suppress autologous CD8 T cell function as well as T cells from HIV-negative individuals (T/H-). However, T/H inhibited IFNγ expression of autolog CD8 cells stimulated with CMV/EBV/Flu (CEF) antigens, but not HIV-specific CD8 cells. In cross cultures, T/H suppressed differentiation of CEF or HIV-specific CD8 cells from infected patients. PD-1 and PD-L expression was higher on HIV-specific CD8 cells compared to CEF CD8 cells, and did not change after T depletion or co-culture with T/H. The study shows T/H defect in modulating differentiation and PD-1/P-L expression on HIV CD8 cells. This defect might contribute to exhaustion of HIV-specific T responses. Treg mostly suppressed differentiation of effector-memory CD8 cells in HIV-infected patients. HIV-specific CD8 cells were less sensitive to Treg suppression than recall-specific CD8 cells. HIV-specific effector CD8 cells were resistant to Treg modulation of exhaustion molecules PD-1/PDL. Results suggest CD8 cells are defective in IFγ production and sensitivity to Treg, or T could be less suppressive. In HIV infection, T exert subset-specific inhibitory effects on CD8 cells. Failure to contain HIV-associated activation is due to impaired T function and decreased responsiveness of effector clones, associated with high PD-1/P-L levels.
Researchers have evaluated Wuchereria bancrofti's glutathione-transferase (GST) as a potential vaccine candidate for lymphatic filariasis. The parasite's GST helps it survive in the lymphatic system by countering oxidative radicals produced by the host. Previous studies have shown GSTs from other parasites can be used as vaccines, but not from lymphatic parasites. This study cloned the GST gene from Wuchereria bancroft's third larval DNA, expressed and purified the recombinant GST (rWGST). Serum from individuals living in an endemic area showed significant levels of anti-WGST IgG antibodies compared to those with microfilaria or clinical symptoms. Isotype analysis showed IgG and Ig3 antibodies in endemic individuals. Functional analysis showed rGST retained enzymatic activity and antibodies inhibited it. Similar results were seen with anti-rGST antibodies in mice. Brugia mal GST and Wucher bancroft show sequence similarity. To evaluate rGST's potential, Brug mal was used as a challenge. Results showed 61% protection in jirds immunized with rGST. The study suggests rGST is a potential vaccine against lymphatic filariasis.
CRISPR-C9 technologies have revolutionized genome editing of experimental organisms and hold great promise for therapy. Despite advances in understanding the CRPR-C9 system, concerns remain about potential off-target effects. Recent studies used whole-genome sequencing of edited embryos to find new mutations that might be caused by poor editing. However, these studies used strain-matched but not pedigree-matched controls, making it hard to tell if changes were due to editing or other factors. This study used a trio design, sequencing parents and 19 embryos, 10 of which were edited with well-characterized gRNAs targeting the coat color gene. Detailed analysis found that if CR9 editing caused mutations or off-target changes, the number was not different from background mutations caused by other factors. This supports using CR9 as a therapeutic tool.
Scientists have discovered two new players, Hypersensitive to Red 1 (HR1) and Phosphatase 7 (PP), that help control the opening and closing of stomata, tiny pores on plant leaves, which regulate carbon dioxide uptake and water loss. Stomatal aperture affects photosynthesis, water efficiency, and crop yields. Blue light is one of the signals that regulates stomatal opening and is perceived by blue/UV light-absorbing cryptochromes phototropins. The researchers found that mutations in HR1 or PP lead to misregulation of stomatal aperture and reduced water loss under light. Both HR1 and PP are expressed in guard cells in response to light-dark or dark-light transition. HR1 interacts with PP through its N-terminal zinc finger motif and requires PP for stomatal response. HR1 is phosphorylated in vivo and PP dephosphylates HR1. In the dark, HR1 is dephosphylated in a 193kDa complex, while light increases to 285Da. In PP mutant, this shift is impaired and HR1 is predominantly phosphorylated. The study proposes that HR modification by PP under light is essential for proper HR1 conformation and assembly.
Researchers have identified a key component of the Mediator complex, a protein called MDT-15, in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in adapting to the materials ingested by the worm. MDT-15 is a subunit of the Mediator, a complex that helps regulate gene expression by interacting with various transcription factors. The study found that MDT-15 is involved in detoxifying certain toxins and heavy metals, making the worm more sensitive to exposure. However, it does not affect other stress responses such as heat tolerance. MDT-15 also regulates genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and nutrient availability. The researchers propose that MDT-15 integrates multiple pathways to monitor the quality and availability of ingested materials, including nutrients and toxins. The study used microarrays to identify MDT-15 targets and found it interacts with at least two metabolic factors, NHR-49 and SBP-1. MDT-15 was previously found to regulate genes in fatty acid metabolism and fasting response. The study suggests MDT-15 is part of a system that ensures health and longevity by adapting to ingestion-related stress.
Researchers have long believed that the hippocampus, a brain region responsible for spatial navigation, encodes geometric information such as distances and angles. However, since it consists of patterns of spiking neurons, downstream regions must translate these patterns into accurate information about an animal's environment. The researchers hypothesized that the pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information and since coiring implies spatial overlap of place fields, a map by coiring will be based on connectivity and adjacency, a topological. They tested this hypothesis with a model of hippocampal activity, varying parameters firing rate, place size, and number of neurons in simulations of rat trajectories in topologically and geometrically distinct environments. Using computational tools from algebraic topology, they found that patterns of coiring convey topological information in biologically realistic time. Simulations revealed a "learning" region where interplay between parameters produce hippocal states more or less adept at map formation. For example, lower number of neurons can be compensated by adjustments firing or place size, but beyond point formation fails. They propose this region provides a lens to view conditions impairing spatial by altering cell rates or specificity.
Researchers have been trying to understand how the hepatitis C virus (HCV) is released from infected cells, but the process is not fully understood. They used a technique called RNA interference (RNAi) to identify host genes involved in HCV release and combined it with live cell imaging to track the virus's movement. The study found that HCV uses the cell's secretory pathway to exit, which is also used by other viruses in the same family. This pathway involves the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and vesicles, and recycling endosomes. The researchers identified several proteins that help HCV move through this pathway, including those involved in vesicle formation, sorting, and transport to the plasma membrane. They also found that HCV interacts with apolipoprotein E and VAMP vesicles. To understand how HCV moves, they created a tagged version of the virus and tracked its movement. The core protein moved to the cell's periphery and interacted with microtubules, but was blocked by a drug. Some core also went to the Golgi and interacted with recycling endosomes. Silencing a recycling component caused core to accumulate in the Gol. The majority of core interacted with apolipop E and VAMP vesicles. This study reveals new proteins involved in HCV release and shows how it moves in infected cells.
Researchers have found that the loss of a specific gene called Grb10 can contribute to the formation of tumors in mice with a weakened immune system. Gr10 is an imprinted gene, meaning it is expressed from only one parent and loss of the expressed allele leads to complete loss of protein. The study used mice with a weakened immune system, called NF1, to model tumors that arise in people with this condition. Analysis of tumor cells from these mice showed Gr10 was not expressed. Further analysis found that the expressed allele of Gr10 is commonly lost in NF tumors in these mice. The researchers tested if restoring or losing Gr10 would change tumor growth features. Restoring Gr10 in weakened tumors decreased growth, reduced colony formation, and downregulated Ras signaling. Conversely, silencing Gr10 in normal cells increased growth and Ras levels. Expression of a constantly active MEK rescued cells from Gr10 reduction in colony formation. This study shows Gr10 loss can occur in tumor formation and affects normal cells. In weakened mice, Gr10 loss promotes Ras hyperactivation, a feature of tumor development. This work identifies a new role for an imprinted gene in tumor formation and suggests considering imprinted genes' origin in disease.
Researchers investigated how humans learn to predict threats from environmental cues, a fundamental skill found in many species, through Pavlovian fear conditioning. This process involves associating neutral cues with aversive events. Despite many studies on neural mechanisms, computational understanding is fragmented, with different models giving opposing predictions for trial-by-trial dynamics of learning, such as autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. The team used a statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling to obtain precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of ANS responses. They considered non-probabilistic, probabilistic, and non-learning models, as well as different functions to link models with AN activity. Across three experiments, skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size (PS) responses were measured. A probabilistic model best explained ANS responses, with SCR tracking expected uncertainty and outcome, and PS tracking outcome alone. Combining psychophysiological with learning theory, the team found Pavlov threat in humans relies on probabilistic inference and uncertainty estimation. This could inform neural implementation of aversive learning theories.
Researchers have identified a new regulator of fungal reproduction in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans, called Pom, which suppresses the septation and conidiation process. Septation is the process of cell division in fungi, while conidiation is the production of spores for reproduction. Without Pom, the fungus has defects in septation and conidiation, and overexpressing Pom stops septation. Normally, the protein Sep promotes the phosphorylation of Hog, a protein involved in stress response, while Pom reverses this process. Under stress conditions, Hog is phosphorylated and can bypasses the need for Sep, but not the entire septation process. The study shows interaction between the septation and stress pathways, with Pom and Sep regulating Hog phosphorylation through upstream kinases. 

In normal conditions, Sep promotes Hog phosphorylation, while Pom reverses it. Under stress, Hog is phosphorylated and can bypasses Sep, but not the entire septation process. The study shows interaction between septation and stress pathways, with Pom and Sep regulating Hog phosphorylation through kinases. The researchers found that Sep, a kinase, promotes septation, while Pom suppresses it. Sep promotes Hog phosphorylation, while Pom reverses it. Under stress, Hog is phosphorylated and bypasses Sep, but not septation. The study shows interaction between septation and stress, with Pom and Sep regulating Hog phosphorylation through kinases.
Researchers investigated the association between Leish RNA virus 1 (LRV1) and mucosal manifestations of tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) in 156 patients in Brazil. TL is endemic in Latin America and causes 20,000 cases per year, but its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Clinical manifestations vary from cutaneous leishias (CL) to severe disseminated leishias (DL), mucosal leishias (ML), and diffuse cutaneous leish (DCL). LRV1 was previously linked to severity in animal models. The study found 5 Leishmania species: 121 (77.6%) Leishmania (Viann) brazili, 18 (11.5%) Leish (V) guyensis, 3 (1.8) Leish (V) laini, 2 (1.3) Leish (Le) amazonensis, and 2 (1.3) Leish (V) shawi. LRV was detected in 6 (3.9%) samples. Patients with CL+ML and DCL were excluded. Among 147 remaining patients, 71.1% (n=27) mucosal lesions were LRV+ and 28.9% (n=11) LRV-, while 36.7% (n=40) cutaneous lesions were LRV+ and 63.3 (n=69) LRV-. The ratio LRV+/LRV- was 2.93 (CI 1.57-5.46, p<0.001), indicating LRV association with mucosal leishias. LRV was not the only factor contributing to disease.
Type I interferon (IFN) plays a crucial role in protecting against pneumocococcal disease by preventing bacteria from migrating from the lungs into the bloodstream. Researchers found that mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (Ifnar−/−) or treated with a neutralizing antibodies against type interferon had more bacteria in their blood after being infected with pneumocococcus, while having similar amounts in their lungs. In contrast, treating mice with interferon or a synthetic RNA that induces interferon reduced bacteria in the blood after pneumococcus infection. Interferon increased tight junction proteins and decreased the pneumococcus receptor platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor. This led to reduced pneumoc invasion and migration across epithelial and endothelial layers, and increased lung permeability in Ifnar− mice. The study identifies interferon as a key component of the immune system that regulates two mechanisms involved in pneumoc invasion: PAF-mediated transcytosis and tight junction-dependent pericellular migration, limiting lung infection progression to invasive disease.
Researchers have developed a neural network with multiple layers that can learn and solve complex tasks, such as foraging, by combining two types of plasticity: rewarded and non-rewarded spike-dependent plasticity (STDP). The network consists of three layers: an input, hidden, and output. The hidden layer uses non-rewarded STDP to respond to specific combinations of inputs and classify patterns, while the output layer uses rewarded ST to learn and make decisions. This combination allows the network to learn without labeled data and distinguish between rewarding and punishing patterns. Synaptic noise enables trial-and-error learning to identify effective strategies for solving the task. The study shows that a set of properties of spiking networks with ST can solve complex tasks involving pattern recognition and decision-making.
A protein called ELF5 plays a key role in the development of a type of breast cancer called luminal breast cancer. In this cancer, ELF helps the cancer cells grow and spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs. ELF does this by recruiting a type of immune cell called myeloid-derived suppressor cells. These cells are immature neutrophils that help the cancer grow and spread. When these cells are removed, the number of lung metastases decreases. In a mouse model of luminal breast cancer, ELF was found to increase the number of immune cells in the tumor and blood vessels, making it easier for cancer to spread. This was also seen in human breast cancer, where high ELF levels of the protein were linked to shorter survival and faster disease progression. The study suggests that ELF is a factor in the spread of luminal breast cancer.
Recent research has shown that the interaction between chromatin loops plays a crucial role in determining the level of cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. Chromatin loops are characterized by three factors: connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication. To understand how these factors affect gene expression, a model was developed that maps three patterns of interacting DNA loops into a 4-state model of transcription. The study found that nested loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce noise, while alternating loops have opposite effects. Comparing facilitated and direct looping on gene expression, facilitated performs better in controlling mean and tuning noise, but control is distance-dependent, with a limit to loop length where the difference between forms disappears. The results support the chromatin-looping hypothesis.
Researchers have developed a new way to design a type of RNA called riboregulators that can control gene expression without the need for extra proteins. These riboregulators, called translation inhibiting RNAs (tiRNAs), work by blocking translation initiation, the first step in gene expression. To design them, they analyzed 12 features related to thermodynamics and structure that affect translation. From a library of 12,000 tiRNAs, 18 were selected and tested with two target genes. Results showed repression of up to 60% of original protein levels, which was partially explained by a statistical model. A model was built to link tiRNA properties to repression, showing both structure and thermodynamics are important for efficient repression. This approach allows for more reliable design of effective ribg, expanding the toolbox for gene modulation.
Researchers studied how groups of neurons in the brain's cortex communicate with each other to create memories and behaviors. They recorded electrical activity from multiple points in the brain of awake monkeys and lab-grown-up brain tissue. They found that when a group of neurons gets too active, its activity spreads quickly to other parts of the brain through electrical signals. These large electrical signals, called coherence potentials, last for hundreds of milliseconds and carry information like single-cell signals. However, they have a unique shape, allowing them to encode and identify specific connections. This behavior is similar to how ideas spread in social networks.

Previous studies used similar changes in electrical signals to identify connected groups of neurons. They also found waves traveling between brain areas. This raises questions about how signals spread across brain regions and interact. The study's data showed that coherence preserves the pattern of activity, suggesting it carries meaningful information. The shape of the signal is a better predictor of behavior than single-cell signals, supporting this idea. Researchers looked for the underlying pattern of activity associated with coherence. Their recordings represent many neurons, but only a few near the electrode can be seen, a small sample of the activity.
Scientists have long known that the size of a cell's nucleus is related to its overall size, but the exact mechanism behind this relationship is unclear. To investigate this, researchers conducted a genetic screen in yeast to identify essential factors involved in controlling nuclear size. They found 25 factors that affect nuclear size and discovered that RNA processing and LINC complexes play a crucial role in this process. The study revealed a wide range of nuclear sizes, from small to large, and pinpointed specific cellular processes and structural components important for size control. 

The researchers used yeast to generate cells with varying sizes, observing a consistent ratio of nuclear to cell volume. They found that nuclear size increases with cell volume during the cell cycle, maintaining a constant ratio. However, there's a sudden increase in size during DNA replication. Yeast Schizoscharomyces pombe is a useful for studying nuclear control due to its simplicity and closed mitosis. A screen of non-essential mutants implicated nucleocytoplasmic transport and lipid biosynthesis in size control. This suggests regulation of global processes, nucleoplasmic transcription and cytoplasm translation, and specific nuclear components are important for size. In multicellular organisms, the ratio varies between cell types but is generally within a narrow range. There's evidence that volume is determined by volume or related to it, not directly by DNA. Volume correlates with across a range in both budding and fission yeasts.
Deep brain stimulation (DB) is a treatment for neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease and essential tremor (ET). Current DB involves delivering constant pulses through electrodes implanted in the brain, but "closed-loop" approaches adjust stimulation based on brain activity, potentially improving efficiency and reducing side effects. Success depends on devising a strategy that minimizes neural oscillations associated with symptoms. A step towards this is creating a mathematical model describing how oscillations change with stimulation. Our work uses coupled oscillators to represent neurons generating pathological oscillations, analyzing how patients respond to stimulation with given phase and amplitude under certain conditions. We predict the best strategy is phase-specific and stimulation has more effect when oscillation amplitude is lower. This is compared with ET patient data. We propose a new strategy combining phase-locked and adaptive DB.
Researchers have developed a new test, called Biom-LAMP, to detect a parasite called Schistosoma mansoni in a type of snail called Biomalaria glabrata. This parasite causes a disease called schistosias, which affects over 230 million people worldwide. The new test is a rapid and simple way to detect the parasite in snails, which can help control the spread of the disease. It uses a technique called looped isothermal amplification, which makes many copies of the parasite's DNA, making it easier to detect. The test was tested on snails infected with different amounts of the parasite and was able to detect it in all of them. It can be used on individual snails or groups of snails, making it suitable for large-scale surveys in areas where schosias is common. The test is specific, sensitive, and cost-effective, and can be used in areas with basic laboratory facilities. This is important for controlling the spread of schias in areas where it is common.
Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, has been a major public health concern in Sri Lanka since the 1960s. The Ministry of Health is responsible for controlling deng and other outbreaks, and providing care to those affected. Controlling deng and treating patients in hospitals is a significant burden on the public health sector. This study estimated the costs of deng control and hospitalizations in Colombo, the most urban district in Sri Lanka, in 2012 from the Ministry's perspective. The total cost of deng control and hospitalizations was $3.45 million, or $1.50 per capita. Personnel costs made up 79% of deng control and 46% of hospital costs. The average cost per deng control was $0.42. Hospital costs ranged from $216 to $609 for pediatric and $196 to $866 for adult cases, depending on severity and treatment. This study is the first to assess the economic burden of deng on the public sector in Sri Lanka. The results suggest deng is a significant burden on the health sector.
A new study has re-examined the origins of the most common European Y-chromosome lineage, Haplog Rb1b2 (R-M269), which is carried by 110 million men. Previous research suggested it originated in the Paleolithic era, but this study shows its distribution is best explained by a single source in the Near East during the Neolithic period. This means most European Y-chromosomes come from the Neolithic expansion. This pattern contrasts with maternally inherited DNA, which suggests males played a unique role in the transition. The Neolithic expansion brought significant cultural and technological changes, and this study shows Y-chromosome lineages often accompany these changes. Other European lineages, such as Hg1b1 (E35) and J, also show Neolithic origins, indicating most European Y-chromes come from this period. The study used microsatellites to analyze diversity within the lineage, showing it spread from a single source in Anatolia during the Neolithic. This challenges previous findings that suggested a Paleolithic origin based on high frequency in the west. Mitochondrial DNA shows a different picture, with no east-west line and most lineages having Paleolithic signatures.
Researchers have explored the relationship between movement variability and motor learning, suggesting that increased variability can speed up the learning process. However, a computational model of motor adaptation shows that variability can have both positive and negative effects on learning. Experiments also found decelerating effects, and a meta-analysis of published papers found no statistical relation between variability and learning rate across a wide range of experiments. Motor learning is a complex process that can be modeled, but further research is needed to understand the importance of involved factors.

 Simulations showed that increased variability does not typically enable faster learning and sometimes slows it down, but doesn't preclude a possible positive correlation between variability and learning rate. Factors can affect learning and variability in distinct ways, leading to positive, negative, or zero relations between them. It's hypothesized that variability is correlated with learning in a task-specific way, depending on which factor affects performance. Computer simulations of error-based learning with an optimal model showed variability as a problem for motor control and received attention. Studies on variability and learning are sparse, except that reduction is a characteristic of learning.

Simulations suggest the relation between variability and rate varies in adaptation, depending on which factor dominates performance in a task. Divergent results can be explained by uncertainty or noise. People converge to solutions where variability minimally impacts accuracy. A study showed initial variability predicts learning in reinforcement and motor tasks, the first to show facilitatory effect for error-based adaptation.
Scientists have studied how a protein called RelA interacts with another protein called CB/p300 to help turn on genes involved in the immune response and inflammation. Rel is part of a family of proteins called NFκ that helps cells survive and grow. To turn on genes, Rel interacts with CB/p300 and other proteins on DNA. The Rel:CB/p300 complex is made of two parts: Rel's DNA part binds to CB300's K domain, and Rel's activation part to CB's T1 domain. A specific event, Rel's Ser276 being phosphorylated, is needed for this to happen. The role of this interaction in turning on Rel's genes was unclear. Researchers used NMR to see the structure of the Rel:CB complex and found that Rel's activation part folds when binding to CB's T1 through hydrophobic sites. They also made Rel mutants to block the interaction and found that many more genes turned on by Rel are affected than thought. This interaction controls NF's response through a feedback loop and CB/p300 is already on Rel's target gene promoters.
Researchers have developed a new method called Time-course Gene Set Analysis (TSA) to analyze gene expression data from repeated measurements over time. This method is an extension of gene set analysis, which considers groups of genes together in analysis. Unlike previous methods, TSA can use all available measurements, even if some are missing, and accounts for differences within gene sets. It identifies significant changes in gene expression over time and compares patterns between conditions. The method was tested on two real datasets: an HIV vaccine trial and a study on influenza and pneumocococcal vaccines. In the HIV trial, TSA found significant changes in 69 gene sets over time, while other methods failed to detect any pattern. In the influenza study, TSA identified 4 gene sets linked to the vaccine, but not previously associated with pneumococcal vaccine. Simulations showed TSA has good statistical properties and increased power compared to other methods. The method is available as an R package.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the global distribution of Plasmodium vivax, a parasite that causes malaria, to help control and eliminate the disease. Current understanding of P. vivax was limited compared to P. falciparum, making it hard to develop strategies for control. The team used data from 9,970 surveys from 1985 to 2010 and a statistical model to estimate the parasite rate in every 5x5 km square. They also included data on Duffy negativity, a trait that affects P. viv transmission. The map shows P. viv is present in a narrow range worldwide, with high areas mostly in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. The Americas have 22% of the risk area but only 6% of the 2.5 billion people at risk. Africa has 3.5% of risk due to Duffy negativity. Asia has 82% of risk with high areas in India and Myanmar. East Asia has the highest risk in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. This map will help plan P. viv control and elimination.
Staphylococcus aureus, a common bacteria that causes skin and soft tissue infections, has a protein called clumping factor B (ClB) that helps it stick to host cells and evade the immune system, making it more virulent. Previous research showed ClB helps S. aureus colonize the nose by binding to a protein called loric in the nasal tissue. However, its role in skin infections was unknown. This study found ClB plays a crucial role in skin infections, affecting abscess formation and bacterial load early on. It interacts with loric, a protein in abs tissue. A vaccine targeting ClB induced both antibody and cell responses, protecting against S. aureus skin infection. This study identifies Cl as a key antigen for future skin infection vaccines.
To achieve the UNAIDS goal of reducing new HIV infections to 500,000 by 2020, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a key strategy. Truv, a medication currently approved for EP, is costly and requires daily dosing. To improve EP, next-generation regimens, including long-acting formulations, are being investigated. However, preclinical testing often fails to translate to clinical efficacy, and quantifying prophylactic efficacy in the clinic is ethically problematic. To prioritize and design EP regimens, tools are needed that integrate pharmacological, viral, and host factors. A stochastic approach was developed to predict prophyl efficacy, using dolutegravir (DT) as an example. Combining DT's population pharmacokinetics with the framework, predicted plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM prevent 50 and 90% transmissions respectively. Daily EP with 50mg DT prevented 99-100 infections, and 85 when 50% of dosing events were missed. EP 'on' prevented 79-84 infections and P >80 when initiated within 6 hours and continued. The framework can be adapted to other EP candidates, indicating oral 50 DT is inferior to Truv. Predicted 90 concentrations guide release kinetics of DT nano-formulations.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) uses autophagy to enhance its replication, but how it regulates the autophagy pathway is unclear. Researchers found that HCV induces the expression of Rubicon and UVR, which inhibit and stimulate the maturation of autophagosomes, respectively. Rubicon is induced early, while UVR is delayed, leading to accumulation of autagosomes in early in infection. Rubicon inhibits maturation of autag in H-infected cells, confirmed by siRNA knockdown and overexpression. Rubicon enhances maturation of autag. Rub plays a role in H replication, suppressing its expression reduces H replication and overexpression enhances. In contrast, overexpression UVR facilitates maturation autag and suppresses H replication. The H subgenomic RNA replicon, expressing nonstructural proteins, induces Rubicon and autag accumulation. Analysis shows NS4 protein induces Rubicon and autag. Results indicate H, by inducing Rub and UVR, temporally regulates autagy to enhance replication.
Cyclin-like 1 (Cny1) is a newly identified member of the cyclin family that is highly similar in protein sequence to Cyclin (Cny). However, its function is poorly characterized in any organism. Researchers found that Cny1 was most abundantly expressed in the testis of mice, seven times higher than the level of Cny. Male C1- mice were infertile, whereas male and female C- mice displayed normal fertility. This suggests that C1, not C, is indispensable for fertility. Spermatoa from C- mice displayed impaired motility and thinned annulus region/bent head. The protein, not mRNA level of cyclin-dependent kinase (CD16) was decreased in testis C- mice. Further study showed that C1 interacted with CD and this increased stability of two. Moreover, interaction increased kinase of CD. In addition, observed alteration phosphorylation of CD in presence C1. Identified phosphorylation of CD by mass spectrometry revealed several modifications on-terminal of CD indispensable for C binding and modulation CD activity. Results reveal previously role of C in regulating spermatogenesis through interaction of CD.
Enterohemorrhagic Escheria coli (EHE) strains cause diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome due to toxin-mediated vascular endothelial injury. EHE hemolysin (E-Hly), a member of the RTX repeats-toxin family, is an E virulence factor increasingly recognized. The toxin exists as free E-Hly and E-H associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by E during growth. While the free toxin is lytic to human endothelium, the effects of OM-associated E-H on vascular endothelial and epithelial cells, major targets during E infection, are unknown. Using microscopic, biochemical, flow cytometry, and functional analyses of human microvascular endothelial (HMEC) and C-2 cells, we demonstrate OM-associated E-H does not lyse cells but triggers apoptosis. The OM-associated is internalized via dyn-dependent endocytosis and trafficked into endosomal compartments. Upon acidification and pH drop, E-H is separated from OM, escapes lysosomes via pore-forming, and targets mitochondria. This decreases mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cytochrome translocation to cytos, indicating E-H permeabilization of membranes. Subsequent caspase and casp-3 activation leads apoptotic death evidenced DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation in intoxicated cells. The ability OM-associated to trigger apoptotic in microvascular and epithelial cells indicates mechanism E involvement in pathogenesis E diseases.
Researchers have discovered a feedback loop between two proteins, P-TEbdk and histone H2 ubiquitylation, that regulates gene expression in yeast. PTEb is a protein that helps RNA polymerase II, an enzyme that reads DNA to make RNA, move along the DNA. Histone modifications, chemical changes to histone proteins, play a role in starting gene expression, but their role during gene expression is not well understood. Histone H2 ubiquitylation, a type of histone modification, helps coordinate other histone modifications and regulates gene expression. The study found that PTEb and histone H ubiqulation talk to each other in yeast, Schizoscharomyces pombe. Lowering Pb activity or preventing its substrate phosphorylation reduces histone ubiqulation. Conversely, mutations in hist ubiqulation impair Pb recruitment to chromatin and decrease phosphorylation. A mutation in phosphorylation site combined with deletion histone Lys methyltransferase phenocopies growth defects due to ubiqulation. Surprisingly, mutation histone ubiquitin-acceptor residue relaxes Pb activity and Pb mutations suppress cell defects in ubiqu-deficient strains. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation show opposing effects of Pb and ubiqulation on transcribing RNA polymerase II.
Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South America. To understand its evolutionary history, researchers analyzed the largest YF dataset to date, comprising 133 isolates from 22 countries over 76 years. They found that current YV strains emerged in Africa 1,500 years ago and arrived in the Americas through the slave trade 300-400 years ago. These viruses spread across the continent and persist in South America's jungles. The study shows how genetic data can test viral dispersal and demographic hypotheses and human migration's role in disease spread.

The analysis included 71 additional sequences, making 133 isolates from 22 countries (14 African, 8 American). Phylogenetic analysis divided YV into two groups, with distinct lineages in Africa and Americas. West Africa has annual outbreaks, with five cities facing epidemics since 2001. However, analysis found no difference in dynamics between African and American viruses, nor increased diversity expected of expansion. The virus established a sylvatic cycle in Amazon, Aragua, and Orin river basins, vectored by Haemus and Sabeth mosquitoes. The slave trade introduction hypothesis has been repeated, but not rigorously examined with gene data and phylogen techniques.

Few diseases have captured historians' attention like yellow fever. It was feared 15-19 centuries, large outbreaks in cities North, South, Africa, and Europe, causing mortality and shaping settlements and colonial expansion. YV is a Flivirus family member, containing vector-borne pathogens like deng, encephalitis, and West viruses. Previous studies suggest YV originated in Africa, with deepest phylogen split between East and West isolates.
Researchers studied a virulent Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading bacterial pathogen, in an infant mouse model of colonization and disease transmission, with and without influenza A (IAV) co-infection. They found that in the presence of IAV, the bacteria must pass through single bottlenecks during invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and transmission between hosts. These bottlenecks were not associated with genetic adaptation of the pathogen. The bottleneck occurred between exit from one host and establishment in another, explaining the number of shed organisms in secretions is critical to overcome. IAV and TLR innate immune responses stimulate and drive bacterial contagion.

The study used an animal model to examine the consequences of bacterial colonization and disease and host-to-host transmission. They found IAV increased pneumocci burden consistent with prior observations in mice. Targeting stages when bacterial size is restricted, there's less opportunity for selection among phenotypically and genetically diverse pneumocci. The study employed an infant model that recapitulates pneumoc pathogenesis features. Regardless of IAV co-infection, sampled at 12 days prior to onset, detection of pneumonia by lung homogen culture was unusual. The bottleneck in IAV could be due to selection of pneumoc subpopulation requiring de novo adaptation or passage.

A type 6 clinical S pneumonia isolate was tested in an infant model with intranasal challenge at 4 days. The model is susceptible to low colonizing dose. To examine IAV cofection, mouse-adapt strain 31 was inoculated at 8. To understand protection mechanisms, the study identified steps where pneumoc must pass bottleneck - a population reduction due to environmental constraints. A bottleneck occurs if only infecting organisms pass a barrier or evade local defense.
Researchers have identified two proteins in the saliva of the sand fly Phlebotus orientalis that trigger an immune response in humans who have been bitten by the insect. This fly is a vector of the parasite Leishmania donani, which causes a life-threatening disease called visceral leishiasis in Eastern Africa. To see if people in areas where the disease is common have been bitten by the fly, the researchers tested their blood for antibodies against these proteins. The proteins were made in the lab using bacteria or animal cells and used to detect antibodies in human blood samples from Sudan and Ethiopia. Two proteins, mY1 and m5, were best at detecting antibodies in people who had been bitten by the fly. Together, they were even better than using the whole fly saliva. This is the first time using lab-made proteins to detect antibodies in people who have been bitten by the fly. The proteins mY1 and m5 can be used to see if people have been bitten by the fly in areas where leishias is common.
Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI) is a mobile genetic element associated with multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of pathogenic Enterobacteraceae. It is mobilized by IncA and Inc plasmids, also known as A/C plids, after excision from the chromosome, triggered by the transcriptional activator ACD encoded by these plids. Although SGI is not self-transmissible, it carries genes tra, NS, traH, and traG, coding for homologs of the mating pore subunits Tra, Tra, Tra, and Tra, encoded by A plids. Researchers investigated the regulation of tra and tra and the role of these genes in transibility of SGI. They found that expression of these genes is inducible by ACD and that tra and tra are essential for Inc plid transfer. However, SGI can rescue mutants of each gene, revealing that Tra, Tra, and Tra are functional. Complementation of tra and tra mutants showed that Tra and Tra replace Tra and Tra in the pore encoded by plids, and that Tra and Tra are required for SGI optimal transfer. Remodeling the Inc-encoded pore by SGI was found to enhance transfer of SGI over the plid. Tra was also found to allow transfer between cells bearing Inc plids, suggesting that SGI disables an Inc-encoded exclusion mechanism.
Researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have made a significant discovery about how cells respond to DNA damage. They found that a protein called CDC5 helps cells adapt to DNA damage by reducing the activity of another protein called Rad53. Rad53 is a key player in the DNA checkpoint, a mechanism that stops cell division when damage is detected. When Rad53 is hyperphosphorylated, it keeps the cell from dividing. But when CDC5 is present, it reduces Rad53's activity, allowing the cell to adapt to the damage and continue dividing. This process is important because cells can't repair all damage, and need to move on. The study used yeast cells to understand how CDC works and found that it doesn't affect early steps leading to Rad53 activation, but blocks its hyperphosphorylation. This means Rad53 can't keep the cell from dividing, allowing adaptation to occur. The research suggests this mechanism is conserved in other living things, like humans. Other studies have shown polo kinases, like CDC5, can inhibit the checkpoint response to DNA damage. The findings provide new insights into how cells adapt to damage and could lead to better understanding of diseases like cancer.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework called the Kirchhoffern-Planck (KNP) to study the movement of ions and electric potential in the brain's extracellular space (ECS). This space is important for understanding conditions like seizures, stroke, and depression, where ion concentrations change. Previous models were limited to small scales or simplified processes, but the KNP can handle large scales on a standard computer. It assumes electroneutrality, making it faster and more efficient. The framework was tested on a detailed neuron model of a pyramidal cell, showing how ions and potential change around it. This demonstrates the KNP's efficiency and its potential for more complex systems, like pathologies with large concentration changes in ECS. To estimate electrodiff effects, all ion concentrations must be known, but this is unfeasible experimentally, but achievable with computational models. Current models often ignore or partially model ion dynamics. The 3D KNP predicts ion changes in all directions, unlike 1D models, and can be applied to various biological problems. It addresses diffusion due to concentration gradients on large scales. Models without ion dynamics can't explore pathologies, and neglect diffusive effects on potentials. The KNP is the first to handle 3D electrodiff in tissue at large scales without needing much power. A simulation of 100 seconds in 1mm^3 took a day on a standard computer. The KNP was used with a hybrid setup, where ion and potential in ECS were computed with K, and neurodynamics with NEON. It shares NEON's limitations in handling intracellular dynamics, which is not diffusive in NEON.
A proposed budget cut to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding for mosquito-borne disease surveillance, such as deng and West Nile virus, could leave the country unprepared to handle emerging and existing diseases. Researchers evaluated the impact of delayed responses to deng epidemics in a developed urban environment, using a mathematical model of Cairns, Queensland, Australia. They found that halting surveillance increased epidemic costs by an order of magnitude compared to sustained surveillance and early detection. The total costs of preparedness through surveillance were lower than needed to respond to vector-borne pathogens, even considering human lives and well-being. The 2011 US fiscal year budget cut $26.7 million from the vector-b diseases program could paralyze surveillance and research, jeopardizing early detection of exotic pathogens like Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis, and chikunya virus. A delayed reaction to Cairns deng outbreaks resulted in escalated costs up to $382 million, surpassing sustained surveillance costs. The analysis shows costs of preparedness are lower than response, providing ammunition for lawmakers to retain investments in preventive health strategy.
Dengue is a significant infectious disease worldwide, and in Nicaragua's capital, Managua, suspected cases among children have been documented, but not among adults with undifferent fever. A study in semi-urban and rural Nicaragua found that 63.5% of 740 patients with acute febrile illness were seropositive for deng at enrollment. The seropreval increased with age, reaching 90% in people over 20 years. Acute deng serotypes 1 and 2 were identified in 5.1% of patients. Only 8.1% of confirmed cases were clinically suspected. Dengue is an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in western Nicaragua. Since Zika virus is transmitted by the same vector and associated with severe congenital infections, the population is at risk of being devastated by the Zika epidemic that has reached Central America.
Plant-parasitic nematodes are destructive pests that cause billions of dollars in losses annually. Effective defense against them relies on recognizing pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized receptors, leading to activation of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Research has been conducted on PT in various plant-pathogen interactions, but less is known about PT in roots and plant-nemat interactions. This study shows nemat-derived protein elicitors can induce PT in Arabidopsis, dependent on the immune receptor BAK. Consistent with BAK's role, a leucine-rich receptor-like kinase, NIL1, is regulated upon nemat infection. NIL1 is essential for PT responses to nematodes and loss-of-function mutants are hypersusceptible to various nematodes. NIL1 is the first immune receptor involved in basal immunity PT in plants or animals to nematodes. Manipulating NIL will provide options for nemode control in crops.
Researchers have found that the anti-cancer drug milteine is effective against Schistosoma mansoni, a parasite that causes schistosomiasis in humans. They treated adult worms with miline in a lab dish and found that it exposed new antigens on the worm's surface. These antigens are normally hidden from the host's immune system during infection. The researchers used rabbit antibodies to identify the exposed antigens and found four proteins: fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogenase. These proteins were also found on the surface of young schosula and caused them to clump together, suggesting they may help the host fight the parasite. This study shows a new way miline works against schos. It's similar to how another drug, prazantel, which unmasks antigens on the parasite. These antigens could be targets for new treatments and antibodies against them may make the drug more effective and help prevent re-infection.
Researchers have studied how the bacterium Bacillus cereus, an opportunistic pathogen, acquires iron from its host. Iron is essential for bacterial growth and survival, but its low solubility and bioavailability make it hard to obtain. Bacillus cereus has developed systems to get iron from various sources, including heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin. Ferritin is a 24-mer protein that stores thousands of iron atoms in its cavity, but little is known about iron acquisition from ferritin. IlsA, a surface protein of Bacillus cereus, binds heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin in vitro and is involved in virulence. This study shows Ils acts as a ferritin receptor, causing ferritin aggregation on the bacterial surface. Ils binds several types of ferritins through interaction with subunits, enhancing iron release from ferritin. Disrupting siderophore bacibactin production reduces Bacillus ability to use ferritin for growth and attenuates virulence in insects. A new model of iron acquisition in Bacillus is proposed, involving Ils binding to ferritin followed by siderore iron uptake. This highlights interplay between surface protein and siderore, providing insights into Bacillus adaptation and pathogenesis.
Researchers have long studied the circadian clock of the cyanobacter Synechoccus elongatus, a protein cycle that helps the organism anticipate day and night changes. The clock is driven by a phosphorylation cycle of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. These proteins form a hexamer, with each monomer having two domains, CI and CII. The domains can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only CII can be phosphorylated at two specific sites. A new model explains how the clock works thermodynamically. It says ATP hydrolysis in CI drives a switch in KaiC's conformation, making its phosphorylation rise or fall. Phosphorylation of CII drives hydrolysis in CI. The model also shows how KaiA, a nucleotide factor, stimulates phosphorylation of KaiC and creates a temporal order of phosphorylation. As CII's phosphorylation rises, AD release from CI slows, making KaiC's inactive state stable. Inactive Kai binds KaiB, stabilizing it and sequestering KaiA, leading to dephosphorylation. A kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm simulates the system, showing the model fits experimental data.
Hepatitis B virus (HB) is a stealthy virus that evades the immune system and causes chronic infection. Despite being a DNA virus, its pre-genomic RNA can be sensed by the immune system, triggering interferon production. However, the mechanism behind HB's failure to induce interferon-β (IFN) synthesis remained unclear. Researchers found that HB induces parkin, a protein, to recruit the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LAC) to mitochondria, suppressing IFN synthesis. Parkin interacts with MAVS, a protein, and accumulates unanchored polyubiquitin chains on MAV via LAC, disrupting MAV signalosome and IRF activation. This study highlights park's role in antiviral signaling, involving LAC recruitment to mitochondria. The results provide avenues for investigating mitochondrial dynamics in innate immunity. Park's localization to mitochondria may influence orchestrate antiral signaling during HB infection. HB cripples RIG-MAV signaling and suppresses mitochondrial MAVS that stimulates IF production. Park interacts with MAV and potentiates this interaction. HB activates R-MA axis to target downstream steps to abrogate IRF activation and IF synthesis. Park induces mitochondrial translocation and mitagy to promote persistence. Mitochondrial dynamics and mitagy modulate antiral signaling. HB-localized Park interacts with MAV and causes ubiquination. Park recruits LAC to mitochond, enriching M-linked polyubitin on MAV, disrupting TRs and IRF activation. Park modulates LAC activity and LAC abrogates MAV signaling. Park silencing restores IF synthesis in HB cells upon R-agonist stimulation.
Researchers have identified a protein called pT, encoded by the gene of Pseudomonas fluoresens, as a superantigen associated with Crohn's disease. A superigens are proteins that stimulate the immune system and can cause inflammation. The structure of pT was determined at a resolution of 1.7 angstroms, and its interaction with human class II MHC was analyzed. pT and its homolog, PA5, bound to human cells and stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. This was inhibited by anti-class II MHC-DR antibodies, and to a lesser extent by anti-HLA and DP antibodies, indicating class IIHC-specific binding. pT efficiently precipitated endogenous and purified HLA-DR molecules, indicating direct interaction with HLA-DR. Competition studies showed pT and superigen Mycoplas arthritidis mit (M) competed for HLA binding, indicating overlapping sites. Structural analysis placed pT in the Tet-family of DNA-binding regulators. The structure of p indicates a new family of T superigens.

p is a biomarker for disease and clinical phenotype of Crohn disease. The interplay of environment and microbiota in Crohn disease is a focus, as source of antigens in immune activation and microbial products targeting epithelial function. Strong T responses are elicited by superigens via interaction TCRβ elements and in some Tα chains. A novel enteric superigen, I, and full-length product pT, are encoded by microbial associated Crohn disease. Selective activation was observed for murine T-V5 subpopulation and pT exhibited SAg activity. PA5, Pseudomonas aerugin hom of pT (78 sequence) stimulated murine CD T proliferation. Colonization by I and pT-expressing microbe in IBD hosts was speculated to provide superigen stimulus to pathogenesis Crohn disease.
Researchers have found that the gene Nanog, a key regulator of embryonic stem cell pluripotency, has distinct patterns of expression within stem cell populations. This heterogeneity is influenced by allelic control of the Nanog gene, where two copies of the gene have different versions. A mathematical model was created to understand how this regulation affects the distribution of Nanog in stem cells. The model showed that allelic expression leads to three states of Nanog, but when combined with random gene noise, the distribution becomes bimodal. Initially, uniform populations of stem cells give rise to the same Nan heterogeneity within 10 cell cycles. Depletion of Nanog in cells is slower than accumulation of intracellular Nanog, indicating Nan-dependent dynamics. Allelic transcription of Nan raises questions about using stem cell lines with reporter genes knocked in single locus. Divergence was observed in reporter and native protein profiles depending on half-life and insertion of reporter in one or both alleles. In stem populations with restricted Nan expression, allelic facilitates maintenance of self-renew cells with sufficient Nan to prevent loss of pluripotency. The study highlights allelic control of Nanog as a determinant of stem population heterogeneity and warrants further investigation in cell specification and reprogramming.
Researchers have found that nearly half of the proteins in E. coli, a type of bacteria, are not used in certain environments. These unused proteins cost the bacteria energy and slow down their growth. To understand this, scientists used a new model that calculates the cost and benefit of each protein in different environments. They found that the cost of unused proteins explains 95% of the difference in growth rates of E. coli in 16 different environments. They also showed that reducing unused proteins can help bacteria grow faster in changing environments. The unused proteins are involved in preparing for nutrients and stress, which can be beneficial in different environments. This means that unused proteins are a big cost, but also provide a benefit against environmental changes.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes in three ethnic groups in Southeast Asia: Chinese, Malays, and Indians. They analyzed data from 3,955 cases and 1,945 controls in Chinese, 2,034 cases and 1,240 controls in Malays, and 2,146 cases 1,169 in Indians. The study aimed to assess the transferability of previous findings from European populations to these ethnic groups, which make up half of the world's population. Of the previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with type 2 diabetes, only CDK1 and HXIDE/K11 showed strong association in the meta-analysis of all three groups. However, the direction of effect was consistent for many other SNPs in this study and those in European populations. Examination of CD1 and HIDE11 loci showed some evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity in relation to type 2 diabetes. The study also found variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations for these loci previously identified. These factors, combined with limited power, may contribute to failure to detect associations in diverse populations. The study highlights the importance of surveying diverse groups to fine-map causal variants and search for population-specific variants.
Researchers studied the process of cell division in the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans, a type of yeast. They found that a protein called Aurora kinase I1 (I1) plays a crucial role in this process. I1 helps break down the nuclear envelope, a membrane surrounding the cell's genetic material, during cell division. This allows the genetic material to move to the new cell. Without I1, the process is delayed. The researchers also found that I1 helps maintain the structure of microtubules, tiny threads that move the genetic material. Without I, these threads become unstable and the process is delayed. A computer model predicted that I and another protein, dynein, work together to move the genetic material to the new cell. Experiments confirmed this, showing that altering levels of I or dyin delay the process. The study suggests that I's timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope helps control the division process in Cryptoccus neoans.
Researchers studied a rare and aggressive form of thyroid cancer called medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) to understand how genetic mutations contribute to its development. They focused on a specific mutation in the RET gene, which is known to be a driver of cancer. The mutation was a synonymous, meaning it didn't change the amino acid sequence of the protein. However, next-generation sequencing revealed it was paired with another mutation in the same gene, which is known to drive cancer. The team found that the synonymous mutation increased the production of the RET protein, making it more active. They discovered that the synonymous mutation created a new "splicing enhancer" that attracted an enzyme to the gene, leading to more efficient production of the active protein. This is a new mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer.
Researchers have developed a new method to remove contaminants from databases of genomes used for diagnosing human infections. Metagen sequencing is a powerful tool for identifying pathogens, but its accuracy depends on the quality of available genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes exist, but many are incomplete or contaminated, leading to false identifications of wrong pathogens. The team created a bioinformatics system to eliminate contaminants and low-complex sequences in draft genomes of eukotic pathogens. They applied it to remove human, bacterial, viral, and archaeal sequences from a comprehensive database of sequenced eukotic pathogen genomes, also removing low-complex sequences causing false positives. This pipeline produced a "clean" eotic pathogen database for use with bioinformatics tools, showing better sensitivity and reduced false positives when finding eotic pathogens in metagen samples.
Researchers studied the genetic diversity and population structure of Trypanosoma brucei in Uganda to understand the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region. They collected 269 isolates from different regions in Uganda and southwestern Kenya and genotyped at 17 microsatellite loci, and checked for the presence of the SRA gene that confers human infectivity to T. b. rhodesense. The results showed three distinct genetic clusters: cluster 1 and 3 include isolates from central and southern Uganda, while cluster 2 contains mostly isolates from southwestern Kenya. These clusters are not sorted by subspecies (T. b. bruce vs T. b. rhense) or date of collection. There is evidence of genetic admixture among the clusters and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent and ongoing gene flow between them. The expansion of the disease to new foci in central Uganda occurred from the northward spread of T. b. rhense (br) and emergence of human infect strains from non-infect T. b. br (bb) of different genetic backgrounds. Cattle are a reservoir that shape the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region.
Researchers studied the role of thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXIP) in the inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock. They found that mice lacking TXIP (Tx−/−) were more susceptible to endotoxic shock due to increased production of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The absence of TXIP also led to reduced IL-1 secretion due to increased S-nrosylation of NLR3, a protein involved in the inflammatory response. The study suggests a link between TXIP and the NFκB/iOS pathways, which regulate NO production and disease states associated with sepsis. Excessive NO in the absence of TXIP activated the NLR inflamome, leading to reduced IL-1 secretion and increased sensitivity to endotoxin-induced shock. The researchers propose that S-nrosylation of NLR3 by NO affects IL-1 secretion and sensitivity to lethal shock. They found that TXIP regulates NFκ, affecting the iOS pathway in response to L treatment, and excessive NO inhibits NLR-dependent IL-1 secretion via S-nrosylation of the inflamome. The study indicates L-induced iOS activation is mediated by the NFκ pathway in the absence of TXIP, with increased NO and iOS in Tx−/− macrophages suggesting TXIP involvement in NO-mediated NLR inhibition. Overall, TXIP plays a role in modulating NO and iOS expression during endotoxic shock, with increased iOS and NO in response to L stimulation in Tx/− mice.
Scientists have discovered a new protein called ZTF-8 that plays a crucial role in repairing damaged DNA in the reproductive cells of a type of worm called Caenorhabditis elegans. This protein helps fix breaks in the DNA that can occur during cell division and also triggers a response to DNA damage in the reproductive cells. Without ZTF-8, the worms are more sensitive to radiation and chemicals that damage DNA, and their cells don't divide properly. The researchers found that ZTF-8 interacts with a complex called the 9-1, which is involved in DNA repair and damage response. They also found that ZTF-8 localizes to the nucleus and changes its location in response to DNA damage, supporting its role in repair. In worms without ZTF-8, there are more breaks in DNA that can't be fixed, leading to cell death. The study suggests that ZTF-8 helps fix stalled replication forks and DNA breaks in reproductive cells and triggers a response to damage via the 9-1 pathway. This protein is conserved across species, meaning it has the same function in humans. The researchers propose that Z-8 promotes genomic stability in reproductive cells.
During the development of the neural tube, a type of tissue that gives rise to the brain and spinal cord, certain cells called multipotent progenitors differentiate into motor neurons at a faster rate than others. Researchers used single-cell transcriptomics to study the changes in gene expression that occur as these progenitors become motor neurons. They found that a gene called Olig plays a crucial role in this process. Olig represses, or turns off, two genes called Hes1 and H5, which are part of the Notch signaling pathway. This pathway is important for cell development and patterning. Olig's repression of H5 is direct, meaning it acts on a specific element within the H5 gene to prevent it from being expressed in motor progenitors. The study shows a tight connection between the networks that control patterning and neuron development, and how Olig acts as a coordinator for the spatial and temporal pattern of motor neuron generation. By modulating the Notch pathway, Olig not only specifies motor identity but also determines the rate at which progenitors differentiate, imposing the kinetics of motor neuron production.
Researchers studied how the immune system fights off the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in non-human primates, specifically rhesus macaques. They found that T cells, a type of immune cells, play a crucial role in clearing the virus from the body. To test this, they first infected the macques with a seasonal H1 influenza virus, which triggered a cellular and antibody response but no neutralizing antibodies against the pandemic H1 virus. Four months later, they challenged the "primed" macques and naive ones with the pandemic virus. The results showed that "prim" mac had a faster and stronger T response, with cells appearing in the blood and lung within 2-7 days, compared to 5-7 days in naive ones. This response involved both CD4 and CD8 T cells. The "prim" mac also cleared the virus from the upper and lower respiratory tract earlier than naive ones, before neutralizing antibodies appeared. The study suggests that cross-reactive T cells can clear an antigenically novel virus in primates, and vaccines inducing such cells may protect against severe disease from emerging viruses.
Researchers have developed a new method to quickly and accurately detect the bacteria that causes Q fever, a widespread disease spread by animals. This method, called Loop-Med Isothermal Amplification (LAMP), is simple and doesn't need special equipment. It targets a specific gene in the bacteria, called htp, and can detect it in just one copy per reaction. The test was tested on 26 types of bacteria and 18 common pathogens, and showed no cross-reaction. It was compared to real-time PCR on 24 blood samples and 126 animal samples, and found 33.3% of febrile patients and 7.9% animals were positive by LAMP, while 8.3% patients and 0.8% were positive by real PCR. The LAMP is a potential tool for diagnosing fever in humans and animals, especially in rural areas of China, due to its rapid and sensitive detection without aid of equipment or complicated protocol.
Researchers have found that certain genes in cancer cells are similar to those in embryonic stem cells, which are undifferentiated cells that can become any cell type. They wanted to know how this happens. They looked at enhancers, parts of DNA that control gene expression, in blood cell development and cancer. They found a new type of enhancer, ES, specific to blood cell lineage, that changes in cancer. These enhancers are more likely to be methylated, a sign of activity, in cancer. Methylated enhancers are near silenced genes, unmated enhancers near active genes. This doesn't happen with other enhancers. They found that unmated enhancers near a gene, VEGF, affect its levels in cancer. They think these enhancers help reactivate genes in cancer. 

They used DNA methylation data to see how enhancers change in blood cell development and cancer. Found enhancers present in stem cells, but not blood cells, change in cancer. Methylation of these enhancers linked to VEG expression in cancer. Unlike other enhancers, methylation not linked to gene expression in blood and cancer. Results show enhancers prone to methylation in cancer. Genes near methylated enhancers in stem cells, but down in blood, up in cancer. These genes in signaling pathways. They showed methylation of enhancer affects its activity in leukemia. This supports enhancers help reactivate genes in cancer.
Researchers investigated how dividing a population into smaller groups, or demes, can affect the time it takes to cross a "fitness valley" or plateau in a complex landscape. They used a simple model where demes are connected by migration, but don't change size or have different environments. They found that subdivision can speed up crossing, but only if the fastest dem is in the "sequential regime". This means it needs to be in a state where new mutations are fixed quickly. They used Markov theory to find conditions for optimal speedup and verified with simulations. Subdivision can accelerate crossing in a wide range of parameters, not just the optimal. The study also looked at varying the degree of subdivision and trade-off between speed and range. Results hold for weak beneficial mutations too. They extended to a population connected by one or several islands and found subdivision alone can speed up crossing, shedding light on conditions for this to occur.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypt, the primary mosquito vector for viruses such as deng, Zika, chikunya, and yellow fever. They found that the metabolic environment within the midut plays a crucial role in virus replication and dissemination. Since these viruses are enveloped, replication and assembly occur on cellular membranes through manipulation of host metabolism, interfering with this environment is detrimental to viral replication. The study used high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze metabolic perturbations following deng virus infection in the midut, the primary site of infection and replication. They identified metabolites that exhibited a dynamic profile across early, mid, and late infection points, with a marked increase in lipid content, glycerophospholids, sphingolids, and acyls coinciding with viral replication. Elevated glycerolip levels suggested diversion of resources from energy to synthetic pathways, while acylcarnines indicated disruptions in mitochondrial function and energy production. A central hub in the sphingip pathway, dihydroceramide to ceramide ratio, was critical for the virus cycle. The study reconstructed the sphip pathway in Aegypt, highlighting biochemical points to target for disrupting transmission of multiple pathogens by mosquitoes.
Researchers have created a simplified model of the action potential in rabbit heart cells, called the "parsimon" model, to better understand the underlying mechanisms of fatal heart arrhythmias. Current models of the action potential are complex and varied, leading to different predictions, so a simpler model is needed to reproduce significant phenomena with few parameters. The new model combines a Hodgkin-Hux formulation of sodium current with a phenomenological repolarization model, similar to the rectifying potassium current. It was calibrated using data from rabbit cells under physiological conditions, including current-voltage relationships, recovery of excitability, and steady-state inactivation. The model reproduced phenomena such as alternans at 250 beats per minute, reentrant waves on the heart surface, and spiral breakup. Variants of the model showed the minimal requirements for alternans and spiral breakup, the kinetics of sodium inactivation and non-rectification of potassium. The model's simplicity and physiological parameters make it ideal for general insight and a building block for more detailed models.
Scientists have studied the process of how the ciliate Parameium assembles its genome during its sexual cycle. This process involves the precise removal of thousands of short, non-coding sequences called Internal Eliminated Sequences (IES) flanked by TA nucleotides. Previous research showed that these rearrangements start with developmentally programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced by the domesticated transase PiggyMac. However, the steps involved in the final assembly of somatic genes were unknown. Researchers found that Ligase IV and Xrccp, components of the non-homous endjoining (NHE) pathway, are required for repairing IES excision and circularizing excised IES. Lig IV and Xccp are induced early in the cycle and accumulate in the somatic nucleus during I excision. Silencing either gene results in free DNA ends, protected from resection. At the nucleotide level, removal of the 5-terminal nucleotide occurs in IV-silenced cells, while addition to the 3 ends is blocked, indicating a coupling between NHE polymerase and ligase activities. The study shows I excision is a "cut-and-close" mechanism, introducing double-strand breaks at I ends, followed by DSB repair via precise joining. This broadens the view on how NHE cooperates with domestic transases for genome dynamics.
Researchers studied the main cause of death in patients with Chagas disease, a heart condition caused by a parasite infection. They compared patients with and without the disease and found that heart failure was the main cause of death in those with Chagas. However, there was no difference in sudden death between the two groups. The study analyzed 342 patients and found that 185 died, with 56.4% of those with Chagas and 53.7% without the disease. Heart failure was more common in Chagas patients, but sudden death was not. Factors associated with heart failure were Ch disease, left ventricle size, kidney function, and medication amiodarone. Factors with sudden death were left venticle size and beta-blocker use. The study challenges understanding of Chagas disease and may change treatment choices.
Scientists have discovered a new way that plants defend against a type of virus called geminivirus. This virus uses a protein called NS to suppress the activity of a plant protein called NIK, which is part of the plant's defense system. NIK helps move a protein called rp10 to the nucleus, where it can fight the virus. When NIK is active, rp10 goes to the nucleus, but when it's not, it stays in the cytoplasm. The virus tries to stop this by binding to NIK and preventing it from working. Without rp10, the plant is more susceptible to the virus. The virus also traps rp10 in the cytoplasm to prevent it from doing its job. NIK is part of a family of proteins that help plants defend against viruses, but this one is the first time it's been shown to work in this way. It's not the same as other ways plants fight viruses, like making them more sensitive or using RNA. Instead, it stops plant growth.
Researchers studied the role of an enzyme called alternative oxidase (AOX) in the fungus Paracoccoides brasiliensis, a pathogen that causes disease in humans. The fungus adapts to survive inside the host by resisting oxidative stress from immune cells. They created a strain with reduced AO expression and tested its interaction with immune cells and in a mouse model. Results showed that AO is important for the fungus to resist oxidative stress and be virulent. In the absence of AO, the fungus had lower burden in lungs and higher survival rate in mice. When exposed to hydrogen peroxide, the fungus with AO increased expression had higher viability than without AO. This suggests AO helps the fungus defend against oxidative stress from immune cells and is important for its virulence.
Researchers studied how the brain's hippocampus stores memories of different places and contexts. They thought that memories are stored as "attractors" in the hippocampus, which are like stable states that the brain settles into when it remembers something. To test this idea, they changed a familiar environment into a new one and looked at how CA3 cells in the hippocampus responded. They found that the population of CA cells changed gradually, not suddenly, suggesting no attractors were involved. However, individual cells showed both gradual and sudden changes, and some had "hysteretic" behavior, a sign of attractors. To understand this, they created a model of CA cells with attractors for position and context. They found that memories stored in overlapping cells in a map caused gradual changes at different points, while population showed smooth changes. In contrast, memories in separate maps caused sudden changes on both population and cell levels. Feedback made a hysteretic effect that decreased with overlap. This suggests memories can be stored in local attractors in CA cells. Similar mechanisms may be in other parts of the brain.
Entamoeba histoly, a microerobic enteric protozoan parasite, causes amebic colitis and intestinal abscesses in millions of inhabitants of endemic areas. Troozoites of E histoly are exposed to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during infection. Since E hist lacks key components of eukaryotic anti-oxidative systems, alternative strategies have been postulated. This study investigated metabolic responses in E hist to H2 and paraquat oxidative stress. Metabolites were measured by capillary electrophores and time-of-flight spectrometry. Oxidative stress drastically modulated metabolites in glycol, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide amino metabolism. Stress inhibited glycol as inactivated key enzymes, redirecting flux to glycer production, chitin bios, and nonoxidative pentose pathway. Glycol intermediates accumulated upstream pyru, reducing nucleos triosphates. A functional gly biosynthetic pathway was found in E hist demonstrated by glyol 3-phosphate and glyol production upon stress. This pathway is proposed as an anti-oxidative system in hist.
Researchers have found that a protein called IKAR plays a crucial role in the development of blood cells called hematopoietic cells. IKAR works with a complex called NuRD to turn genes on and off, but it's not clear how it does this while being part of the Nu complex. IKAR also binds to a protein called PTEb that helps with gene expression. The study shows that Nu and PTE are together in a complex that can be recruited by IKAR to specific genes. The level of IKAR affects the recruitment of NuPTE to genes and helps with transcription by adding a protein called PP1. A IKAR mutant that can't bind PP can't sustain gene expression and normal hematiet cell development. Knocking down a Nu subunit shows that Nu at genes helps relieve a pause and promotes transcription.

 IKAR can be a factor for NuTE recruitment to chromatin and its levels influence NuTE association and transcription. Low IKAR levels are enough for Mi/Nu recruitment but higher IKAR for NuTE and PP to chrom and transcription. IKAR-PP interaction is needed for normal hematiet differentiation. IKAR is part of a complex with Nu and PTE that remodels chromatin and elongates genes. IK interacts with PP and is dephosphorylated by this phosphatase. The study shows IKAR is important for CD9 and Mi interaction and recruitment to transcribed genes in hematiet cells.
Researchers studied the evolution and spread of rabies virus (RV) in Trinidad, a Caribbean island with periodic outbreaks in livestock. They analyzed RV sequences from 1997-2010 and used a method called phylogeography to see if outbreaks were due to virus evolution on the island or imported from the South American mainland. Results showed RV in Trinidad were similar to those from vampire bats, specifically Desmodus rotus, and fell into two groups: Trinidad I and II. Trinidad I had sequences from 1997-200 and were related to RV from Ecuador, French Guiana, and Venezuela, while II had sequences from 2010 and were related to Brazil and Uruguay. Phyloge analysis suggested three RV introductions from the mainland, with subsequent evolution on the island. Data also showed co-circulation of lineages I and II in 200. The study suggests further research on RV dynamics and vampire bat ecology, particularly movement between mainland and Trinidad.
Researchers have created a computational model to understand how genes control the development of distinct areas in the mammalian brain's cerebral cortex. The cortex is divided into many areas, each with specific functions, and their emergence during development depends on gene expression patterns. Five genes, Fgf, Em2, Pax, Coupfi, and Sp, play a crucial role in specifying area identity along the anterior-posterior axis. However, the interactions between these genes that lead to their spatial patterns are not well understood. The model simulated all possible networks of the five genes to find which interactions and combinations reproduce observed patterns experimentally. The model treated expression as Boolean, reflecting the qualitative data available. Only networks that could reproduce patterns had certain interactions and combinations, including auto-regulation and inductive loops. Analysis showed which interactions are likely in the network regulating area. Repressive interactions are more likely than inductive, but mutually repressive are not critical for functioning. The model reveals principles of the network and makes predictions to be tested.
Researchers used a new technology called ChIP-Seq to study how a protein called B1 helps control gene expression in cells. B1 is part of a group of proteins called Polycomb, which helps decide which genes are turned on or off during development. They found that B1 helps put a mark called H2 on histone, a type of protein that wraps DNA, at the start of genes that are not being used. This mark, called H2, is linked to genes being turned off. They also found that genes with H2 have lower levels of activity than those without it. When they removed B1, genes with H2 got more active. They also found that H2 is not just at genes with a different mark called H3, but also at many other places in the genome, including 700 gene promoters. This suggests that DNA may be linked to H2 at some of these places. This study shows how B1 helps control gene expression by putting H on histone.
Pregnancy-induced non-coding RNA (PINC) plays a crucial role in regulating the development of mammary epithelial cells during pregnancy. Researchers found that INC is highly expressed in alve cells of the mammary gland during pregnancy and decreases in early lactation, when alve cells undergo terminal differentiation. INC levels also decrease when mammary epithelial cells are induced to produce milk proteins. Overexpression of INC blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown enhances it. INC interacts with retinoblast-associated protein 46 (b46) and other members of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PC2), which confer epigen modifications that maintain a population of mammary epithelial cells committed to the alve fate in the involuted gland. The study suggests INC inhibits terminal differentiation of alve cells during pregnancy to prevent milk production until parturition.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called PML, also known as TRIM19, in fighting off HIV and other retroviruses. P is mainly found in the nucleus, where it forms structures called PML bodies that recruit other proteins. When HIV and other retroviruses infect cells, they trigger P to move to the cytoplasm, where it forms new structures called P bodies. This happens within 30 minutes of infection and peaks at 2 hours. P's movement is blocked by reverse transcription inhibitors and not seen with other viruses, suggesting it's triggered by retroviral reverse transcription. P interferes with an early step of retroviral infection, as knocking it down P increases reverse transcription efficiency. P doesn't directly inhibit retrovir but acts through a partner protein called Dax. In P's presence, cytoplasmic Dax is near HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse transcription. Dax not only blocks exogenous retrovir but also endogenous retrovir, making it a broad inhibitor of reverse transcription. These findings reveal a new antiviral function for P and its partner Dax.
Researchers have developed a new method for aligning protein structures, called Matt, which allows for flexibility in the alignment process. This means that small movements and rotations can be made between fragments of the proteins to bring them closer together, even if they wouldn't fit under rigid transformations. The program is tested on two benchmark datasets, Homstr and Smark, and performs well on both. On Homstr, it is competitive with other programs, but outperforms on Smark, which has more distant homologous proteins. Matt is good at aligning alpha-helices and beta-strands, important for structural library construction. It can also distinguish between homologous and non-homologous proteins. A score based on RMSD is used to separate decoys from homologs in Smark. Matt's performance is due to its ability to model different conformations and backbone distortions in distantly related proteins.
Researchers studied how cells exit mitosis, a process where a cell divides into two daughter cells. They focused on a protein called Greatwall, which is activated during mitosis and inactivated by a counteracting phosphatase called PP2/B. Greatwall inactivates PP2/B by phosphorylating its substrates En and AR19. However, the regulation of Great and the phosphatases that control Great and its substrates is not well understood. The researchers used a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments to monitor Great, En/AR19 and Cdk phosphorylation during mitotic entry and exit. They found that PP2/B is required for Great dephosphorylation at a specific site and En/AR19 deosphorylation is mediated by a phosphatase called F1. Surprisingly, inhibiting or depleting F1 or PP2 did not block deosphory of most mit Cdk substrates during exit. The study suggests a hierarchy of phosphases controlling Great, En/AR and Cdk deosphory during exit.
Scientists have been trying to develop a vaccine that can elicit neutralizing antibodies (Nab) that can limit the spread of HIV and prevent new infections. To achieve this goal, understanding how the body's immune system responds to the virus in the early stages of infection is crucial. Researchers studied two people with acute/early subtype C HIV-1 infection and found that the virus escaped the body's immune response despite high levels of neutralizing antibodies. They created a series of envelope protein chimeras and mutants to understand the escape pathways. In one person, escape was driven by changes in a specific region of the envelope protein, while in the other was driven by changes in a different region. The findings suggest that a single pathway is not enough for the virus to escape and that multiple strategies, including glycosylation, epitope alteration, and conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.
Researchers studied the genomes of 13 individuals from the plant species Capsella grandiflora to understand how positive and negative selection vary across the genome. They found that positive selection is strong in coding regions, but weak in most non-coding regions, except for 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs. However, they also found strong signals of selection in noncoding conserved regions across the Brassicaceae family. Additionally, they saw reductions in neutral diversity around substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions, indicating recent selective sweeps at these sites. Using expression data from leaf tissue, they showed that highly expressed genes experience stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive to lowly expressed genes. Overall, they observed positive and negative selection in coding and regulatory regions, but results suggest both are rarer in plants than in animals.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforms resting B lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts, which can lead to malignancies. Researchers found that EB-encoded protein EB2 drives the formation of new binding sites for two master regulators of B-cell fate, RBPκ and E1. Unlike previous studies, which suggested these factors are bound to specific gene promoters, EB2 induces new binding for RBPκ and E1, many of which are close to each other in the cellular and viral genome. These new sites are co-occupied by EB2-E1-RBPκ and correlate with transcription activation of genes important for B-lymphoblast function. Depleting EB2 leads to rapid change in RBPκ and E1 binding. Biochemical and RNA studies show cooperative assembly at co-occupied sites. EB2 facilitates combinator interactions to induce new patterns of transcription and gene necessary for Blymphob growth and survival.

EBV promotes B-cell developmental program, increasing RBPκ sites. EB-encoded coactivator EB2 reprograms chromosome patterns of master transcription factors RBPκ and E1. EB2 localizes with E1 and Rκ at enhancer regions in EB positive lymphoid cell lines. E1 and Rκ are regulatory factors in lymph development, but their cooperativity not established. EB2 not alters chromosome site selection of specific DNA factors. EB different gene programs depend on cell or tumor, epigenetic factors. EB encodes cofactors, including EB2, remodel and host gene to confer proliferation to resting Bells.2 binds specific factors like Rκ and PU.2 is coactivator expressed in early EB proliferation of naïve Bells, but extinguished later B development.2 characterized interaction with Rκ at promoters and enhancers of2-regulated genes.
In Mexico, the mosquito species Aedes aegypt is the primary vector for four types of deng virus (DENV). Research has shown that different populations of Aedes aegy in Mexico have varying abilities to transmit deng viruses. A study found that the intersection of the Neovolcan axis (N) with the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz acts as a barrier to gene flow among Aedes aeg populations north and south of N. Populations north and south of N differ in their vector competence (VC) for deng serotype 2 virus (DENV2). Mosquitoes from north of N have an average VC of 0.55, while those from south of N have an average of 0.20. This difference is mainly due to midgut infection barriers, with 21.5% of mosquitoes from north failing to develop midut infections and 30.3% of those infected failing to develop disseminated infection. In contrast, 45.2% from south failed to develop midut and 62.8% of those infected failed to develop disseminated. The study suggests that barriers to gene flow may impact epidemiologically relevant traits such as vector competence. Further research is needed to determine why N is a barrier to flow and if differences in competence north and south of N are epidemiologically significant.
Researchers studied the role of the Dna protein in the replication cycle of E. coli bacteria. They found that Dna cycles between an active (ATP-Dna) and inactive (ADP-D) form, and is thought to control the frequency of initiation. However, they discovered that having more than a 50% increase in P-Dna did not change the timing of replication. This suggests that while Dna is the main actor in initiation, its accumulation does not control the timing. Other factors are required for the exact timing in response to the cell's environment. They also investigated the role of D-dependent Dna inactivation (DA) and Dna-binding protein Dia. Loss of DA affected the cycle during slow growth and made it sensitive to Dia protein. This indicates the cell machinery performs less robustly. The study proposes that E. coli has a robust cycle driven by Dna levels, initiation occurs with sufficient P-D, and timing is governed by the cell's environment.
Researchers have developed a new approach called partial Granger causality to study interactions in the frequency domain, where oscillatory activity plays a crucial role in biological processes from cellular to organismal levels. This method can reveal patterns in multivariate data with exogenous and latent variables in the frequency domain. It was tested with toy models and applied to datasets: gene array data of HeLa cell cycle, in vivo-electrode array (MEA) field potentials from sheep's inferotemporal cortex, and in vivo potentials from macaque monkey's hemisphere. The study aimed to show that ad hoc causality definitions like PDC in frequency can be misleading, contradicting time and frequency domain causality. Due to HeLa microarray data's one-hour sampling rate, dynamical activity at minute scale couldn't be assessed. LFP data from monkey performing GO-NOO task showed beta (14-30 Hz) oscillatory activity in sensorotor cortex during prestimulus. Pairwise Granger showed connectivity in Figure 5, but partial in time domain (Figure 4C) and complete (Figure 4D) and frequency (Figure 4E) showed different results. A toy model with exogenous and latent variables was used to illustrate frequency decomposition of partial Granger. Five time series were defined by equations εi(t), ε6 exogenous, and ε7(t-1 + ε(t-2) latent. Partial Gr causality depends on conditional variance, a well-understood concept. Dealing with exogenous and latent is central in statistics, extensive literature exists.
Researchers have developed a new method for determining ancestry in individuals with mixed ancestry, such as people of Latin American descent. This is important for medical and genetic research, as it can help find disease-causing genes, understand how genes mix, and map the human genome. Previous methods were made for older technology and didn't use all the data from new sequencing. The new method uses specific variants found in certain groups, like Europeans or Africans, to improve accuracy. It combines data from public sources, like the 1000 Genomes, to make better calls. Simulations show it's as good as more complex methods, but faster. It also works with low-quality data and can find ancestry in short parts of the genome. The method was tested on real people from the 100 Genomes Project and matched results were similar. It can even work with low-quality data and find ancestry in small parts of the genome.
Researchers have found that almost all genes in mammals exhibit daily oscillations in their expression levels, contrary to previous estimates that only 10-15% of genes follow a circadian rhythm. By applying digital signal processing techniques to gene expression data, they identified circadian oscillations in nearly 100% of expressed genes. This suggests that circadian oscillations are a natural feature of nearly all biological pathways, and changes in gene expression due to mutations or environmental factors should be considered in the context of changes in amplitude and phase of oscillations. The study used a new approach to analyze gene expression data, combining statistical tests for periodicity with digital signal processing to reduce noise and enhance the signal. This allowed them to identify circadian oscillations in a larger number of genes than previous methods, which only considered one gene at a time and lacked statistical power to identify the circadian component. The study found that genes with daily variation in expression may not be linked to the circadian clock, but their oscillations affect the system as a whole. The amplitude of circadian genes does not differ significantly among tissues, and perturbations in oscillating systems depend on circadian time and wave properties of pathways.
Researchers used whole-genome resequencing to study recombination in a three-generation pedigree of collared flycatchers. They found 325 crossovers at a resolution of 1.4 kb, with 86% of events in regions <10 kb. Crossover rates were higher in males (3.56/Mb) than females (2.28/M) and increased towards chromosome ends in males but not females. Crossovers were not randomly distributed, with hotspots in genic regions, highest in promoters and CpG islands. They also found 267 non-crosso events, associated with crossover locations, and a bias towards 'G' over 'A' alleles, suggesting GC-bi gene conversion. This approach can be applied to other species, providing a more detailed recombination landscape.
Researchers have studied the unique properties of repeat-proteins, which are made up of repeated amino acid sequences that fold into elongated structures. They found that the folding of these proteins can be analyzed as a one-dimensional problem due to their symmetries in sequence and three-dimensional structure. A new model was developed to describe the energy landscape of repeat-prote based on the interactions between folding elements, treated as variables. The overall stability and cooperativity of the protein can be derived from this description. The one-dimensional nature of the model leads to simple relations for experimental observables, such as folding energy and denaturation, which don't apply to globular proteins. Parameters for the coarse-grained description of foldon variables were extracted from detailed simulations on funneled landscapes. A case study of tetratricptide (PR) repeat proteins was presented, relating results to experimentally observed transitions. Single mutations were found to affect folding behavior, suggesting natural proteins are poised at particular ratios of inter and intra-element energetics for structural transitions in physi conditions, related to biological functions.
Researchers have found that a protein called CHOP plays a key role in the development of liver cancer, specifically hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This type of cancer is often linked to viral hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism. These conditions cause stress in the liver cells, leading to the activation of the integrated stress response (ISR) and unfolded protein response (UPR). However, the extent to which these stress pathways contribute to the development of HCC has not been fully understood. The study shows that CHOP is overexpressed in liver tumors in human and mouse models of HCC. Mice without CHOP are resistant to liver cancer development and exhibit reduced cell death and proliferation. They are also resistant to fibrosis, a major risk factor for H. Gene expression analysis reveals that deleting CH reduces inflammation in the liver. The study suggests that CH contributes to liver cancer by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation. This implicates CH as a factor in the development of H in various liver diseases.
Researchers conducted a systematic review of studies on the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania aethopica in Ethiopia. They found 24 records of 506 treatment episodes, with antimonials, pentam, and cryotherapy being the most commonly used treatments. However, the quality of the studies was poor, with only two small, old randomized trials and two non-randomized studies on cryotherapy, antimonials, and pentam. The cure rates were 60-80% for cryotherapy and 69-85 for antimonials. Pentam was effective against complicated cases and non-responsive to antimonials, but all studies had methodological limitations. Data on milfos, paromycin, and liposomal amphotin were scarce, with only a few studies on diffuse cutaneous leishiasis (DCL). The effective options for D seem to be antimonials with paromycin or pentam, but not evaluated. The evidence for treating CL due to Lethopica is limited, with antimonials being the most available treatment in Ethiopia, but their efficacy and safety should be defined. Alternative treatments like milfos or parycin should be explored. High-quality trials are needed to evaluate options in parallel.
Scientists have successfully recreated a biological clock that ticks like the human body's internal clock in a lab dish using three purified proteins. This clock, called Kai, KaiB, and KaiC, displays a daily rhythm that lasts 24 hours and is resistant to temperature changes. To understand how this clock works, researchers studied how these proteins interact with each other over time using electron microscopy and gel electrophoresis. They found that the proteins form different complexes at different stages of the clock's cycle and used this data to create a model that accurately predicts the clock's behavior. The model shows that the proteins exchange among themselves to keep the clock in sync, allowing it to keep ticking. To test this, researchers used a technique called FRET to confirm that the proteins swap partners. They also applied temperature pulses to the clock to see if it could be reset, like the body's internal clock. The study provides a detailed look at the clock's inner workings.
Researchers have long known that brain activity and behavior can vary greatly from one trial to another, even under the same conditions. Most studies on the relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavior have found a direct link, or "monotonic" relationship. However, recent findings suggest that variability can be independent of average activity, leading to an "U" or inverted" relationship. A study using electroencephalography (EEG) found an inverted relationship between trial-trial brain activity and behavior in a visual detection task. Fluctuations in broadband EEG activity close to the mean were associated with higher hit rates and faster reaction times. This relationship was present in both post-stimulus and pre-stim activity, indicating anticipatory brain dynamics. The findings support the presence of noise in the brain and attractor theories, which suggest the brain settles into a confined state for performance, proximity to the target is better. Variability can be decoupled from average activity in stimulus modulation and correlation with behavior, predicting an inverted relationship between trial-trial activity and performance. The study used EEG recordings from patients undergoing neurosurgical treatment to find evidence of this phenomenon in the human brain.
Scientists have studied the mating systems of a group of fungi called basidiomycetes, which have two types of mating systems: tetrapolar and bipolar. Tetrap involves two separate genes, HD and P, while bipolar involves a single fused gene. Researchers looked at 24 species of Trichporales, a group related to Tremales, and found that all have a single fused gene, similar to bipolar Cryptococcus. However, the HD and P combinations are different from Cryptoccus. This suggests that the fusion of HD and P occurred independently in Trichporales and Cryptoccus, supporting convergent evolution. Unlike other fungi, the gene content and order in the fused loci are conserved in Trichporales, with no suppression of recombination to adjacent regions. This is different from other basidiyc lineages. Fungi are good models to study evolution of mating regions. Mating is governed by mating-type genes in MAT loci. Ascomyc and Mucorycina are bipolar, while basidiyc are tetrap with two unlinked loci. However, some basidi have bipolar systems through linkage of HD and P or loss of P function.
Chagas disease, a major vector-borne disease in Latin America, still poses a significant risk due to nonomiciliated vectors, which have not been controlled by residual insecticide spraying in many regions. A mathematical model was developed to predict the abundance of nonomic vectors in houses, using data from the Yuc peninsula, Mexico. The model accurately predicted field data with and without insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying was effective at 50mg/m2 applied yearly during the immigration season, reducing bug abundance by >80%. However, larger doses or more frequent spraying decreased effectiveness. Insect screens reduced abundance proportionally to immigration rate, offering a sustainable alternative for integrated control of neglected vectororne diseases. Insect spraying has a short-lived effect on infestation due to recurring immigration, as seen in a previous study. Nonomic vectors can't be controlled by spraying, but screens may be effective. A low dose of 10mg/m2 reduced bug population by 50% for a year. Repeated spraying didn't achieve sustainable control, so optimal frequency was evaluated. Insecticide strategies should be improved to cope with re-infestation and alternative methods like screens or bednets investigated. A model was created to reproduce abundance without control and account for various strategies, including spraying, screens, and bednets for evaluation.
Scientists have discovered how feathers are arranged in a precise patterns on birds' skin. During development, feathers first appear in a row along the middle of the back, with new ones added in a wave-like pattern. They found that this patterning relies on two types of signals: fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and boneogenetic protein (BMP), and movement of cells in the skin, working together in a coordinated system. This system is a mix of chemical and mechanical processes, with a feedback loop where F20 induces cell aggregation, making the skin compress and increasing F20 expression. A wave of feather formation is triggered by expression of ectodysin (E), which starts F20 expression. The wave spreads across a cell density gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold for cells to start a feather bud. In some birds, like the flightless emu and ostrich, this pattern is lost, but they still have feathers in a similar arrangement. The ostr forms feathers without a wave, like hair in mammals, while the emu's skin lacks cells to form feathers, gaining them later. This study shows a reaction-diffusion system with mechanical processes creates the feather pattern in flying birds. The key role of ectodysin receptor in skin patterning has been found to activate this process in a one-dimensional, highly ordered formation.
Researchers conducted a systematic review of studies on the presence and persistence of Ebola and Marburg viruses in patients and survivors. The review aimed to determine which body fluids are infectious and pose a risk to humans, as the World Health Organization stated there was insufficient evidence in 2014. They searched for scientific articles on filoviruses in human fluids, focusing on Marburg (MARV) and Zaire, Sudan, Ta Forest, and Bundibuyo species of Ebola. Eligible studies had confirmed infection through lab tests or clinical history with filirus antibodies or inflammatory factors. 683 articles were found, 33 were eligible. Most body types had insufficient data to draw conclusions, with variable prevalence of positivity. Fluids taken 16 days after onset were usually negative. RT-PCR tests for filirus RNA gave positive results 4 times more often than tissue culture. Filirus was found in most fluid types, but not every sample from confirmed patient. Apart from semen, non-blood RT-PCR samples likely negative, possibly low risk. Contact with blood and blood-stained fluids major transmission risk due to high viral loads in blood.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical model to describe how neurons work, called the fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model. This model takes into account how the past activity of a neuron affects its current activity, unlike traditional models that only look at the present moment. The model uses a concept called a fractional derivative, which is a way to describe how a value changes over time based on its past values. By changing the strength of this derivative, the model can mimic how neurons adapt and change their firing patterns in response to stimuli. The researchers tested the model on real neurons in a lab and found it matched their behavior. The model also showed how neurons respond to noise and oscillations in their environment. The model's behavior is different from traditional models, reflecting how neurons' internal dynamics affect their response to external stimuli.
Researchers have identified six superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms in the fungus Paroccoides, which helps it defend against reactive oxygen species produced by host cells. To counteract these radicals, the fungus expresses different antioxidant enzymes, including SODs. The study found that two SODs, PbOD1 and PbOD3, are highly expressed during the transition from yeast to mycelium and when exposed to oxidative agents and phagocytic cells, suggesting they help combat superoxide radicals during host-pathogen interaction. Knocking down these genes showed they are involved in the fungus's response to host cells, particularly oxidative stress, in a mouse infection model. Protein analysis and knockdown strains suggest PbOD is linked to extracellular activity while Pb1 is intracellular. The study suggests Parocoid actively responds to radicals generated during metabolism and counteracts immune cells' oxidative burst by inducing SOD isoforms.
Researchers studied how intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) interact with chaperone proteins in the cell. IDPs are sensitive to proteolysis in the lab but not in the body. They thought that IDPs might be protected by chones, which shield them from proteases. To test this, they analyzed data from high-throughput interaction studies and found that predicted disorder doesn't correlate with chone binding in E. coli, yeast, and human cells. In fact, IDPs tend to avoid chones. This applies to prokaryotes, unicellular eukaryotes, and metazoa. The presence of ordered domains, like Pfam, might explain this. Chone binding to IDPs is often accompanied by binding to other proteins, suggesting they use chones for assembly, not folding. IDPs that bind chones are more likely to bind other proteins than those that don't. In three groups, non-chone proteins are twice as likely to bind as chone proteins. Disorder doesn't distinguish between proteins with or without glob domains, so they looked at chone binding in those with at least one glob domain. ID that bind chones are more likely to bind other proteins than ordered ones. There's overlap between chone and nonone proteins, so they compared disorder in those that only bind chones and those that bind both.
Researchers have identified two transcription factors, Salm and Salr, that play a crucial role in the development of the fruit fly's wing. These proteins are regulated by the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway and are necessary for cell survival and growth in the central region of the wing, as well as vein patterning in the lateral regions. To understand how these proteins work, the researchers looked at the expression of genes in fly wings with and without these proteins. They found a complex landscape of genes regulated by Salm and Sal, including some that are turned off and some that are turned on. Further analysis showed that some of these genes are required for wing growth and patterning. This discovery opens a new way to understand how the genetic structure of the wing is formed, linking the activity of the Dpp pathway to the development of the epithelial tissue.
Researchers have found that a protein called Phosphase 1 (PP) plays a crucial role in regulating the number of centrioles, which are essential for cell division, in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Centrioles are involved in the formation of the spindle, the structure that separates chromosomes during cell division. In humans, problems with centri number are linked to cancer and microcephaly. The researchers identified two PP orthologs, G-1 and G-2, and regulators SZ-2 and SDS-22, as key to controlling levels of ZYG-1, the C. elegans homolog of Pl4, required for centri duplication. They found that downregulation of PP activity either directly or mutation of SZ-2 or SDS-22 can rescue loss of centri associated with Z- hypomorphic allele. This is achieved by increase in Z- levels, and data indicate PP regulates Z- through post-translational mechanism. Moderate inhibition of PP restores centri to Z mutant, but strong inhibition in wild-type leads to centri amplification via production of more than one centri. The study defines new pathway that limits number of centri produced each cycle.
A study was conducted in a protected area in southeastern Brazil to investigate the transmission of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease caused by Leishmania parasites. The area, known as Campinas, initially reported a case in 2009 and since then cases were restricted to dogs living in two contiguous condominiums. The study found 1.5% and 1.2% seroprevalence in dogs in 2013 and 201, respectively. Six species of sand flies were identified as vectors or potential transmitters of Leishmania, including the main vector in Brazil, Lutzia longalipis. Two specimens were captured in the area. Infection was recorded in two wild animals, Pomy monticola and Expillatai firm. Infection was also detected in two white-eared opossums, a known reservoir of VL. Coordinates of infected animals were plotted on a map, showing proximity to human residences and infected dogs. The area has an active focus of VL. The risk of transmission in similar areas with environmental modifications is evident. Different epidemiological profiles must be considered for prevention and control measures.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a cancer-causing virus linked to nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly aggressive type of cancer common in Asia. While some viral proteins have been shown to promote cancer cell migration and invasion, not all tumors express these proteins, suggesting other mechanisms are at play. Researchers found that EB virus-encoded microRNA miR-B9 is highly expressed in EB-positive NPC tissues. They investigated miR9's effect in EB-negative and EB-positive NPC cells and found it promotes cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Computational analysis showed miR9 targets E-cadher, a protein crucial for cell-cell junctions and epithelial phenotype. Biochemical assays confirmed mi9 inhibits Eadher to induce mesenchymal phenotype and promote NPC migration. This suggests mi9 is a promastatic viralRNA and high levels in EB-positive NPC may contribute to aggressive tumor behavior.
Researchers have developed a new software tool called gashimi for visualizing splicing events in RNA-seq data. Unlike existing tools, gimi is annotation-independent and can handle large genomic regions by scaling down segments between splice sites. It's available on GitHub and implemented in Python, generating R code for plotting. The tool was initially part of the MISO suite, which quantifies and compares splicing from RNA-seq data. Current implementations include a standalone utility for MISO-indexed splicing and IGV's built-in visualization. Visualizing splicing is challenging as events occur between non-contiguous regions, distant in space. Gimi aggregates samples and shrinks intron lengths for better visualization. The sash representation is a standard for splicing, but current implementations have limitations. Gimi addresses these by eliminating annotation needs and supporting hundreds of samples. It draws a connective element illustrating splice junctions between sites.
Researchers have developed a new model to predict and align cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) across species, which are crucial for gene regulation. Current methods struggle with aligning non-coding sequences and don't account for CRMs' special properties. The new model captures evolution modes of transcription factor binding sites and background sequences. A key feature is a probabilistic model of site gains and losses, a significant in regulatory evolution. A computational framework uses this model to solve alignment and prediction problems. The method is similar to statistical alignment but uses conserved sites to improve alignment. It deals with uncertainties of site annotations and sequence in a probabilistic framework. Simulated and real data show it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Alignments were used to study genome-wide binding of key factors in Drosophila blasterm, revealing: factor-bound sequences are constrained even if neighboring genes aren't expressed, and distal sites are more conserved than proximal. The approach is implemented as software, EM (Evolutionary Model cis-regulatory Module) for broad application.
Researchers studied the role of the piRNA pathway in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly, in maintaining genome integrity and telomere protection. They found that mutations in genes arm, aub, ago3, and rhi led to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during embryonic cleavage divisions. Additionally, aub and arm showed defects in telomere resolution during meiosis and cleavage divisions, while mutations in lig-IV, which disrupt non-homous end joining, suppressed fusions. By contrast, lig-IV mutations enhanced chromosome fragmentation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that aub and arm mutations disrupted telom binding of HO, a component of the telere protection complex, and reduced expression of a subpopulation 19-22-ntelom-specific piRN. Mutations in r and ago, however, did not block HO binding or production of theseRNAs. These findings uncovered separable functions for the Dophila pi pathway. The a, arm, r, and ago genes silenced transons and maintained chromosome integrity during cleavage embryonic divisions, while a and arm had an additional function in assembly of the telere complex.
Researchers have identified a new Ebola virus responsible for a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Uganda. The virus, called Bundibugyo ebolavirus, is closely related to another Ebola virus found in Côte d'Ivoire, despite being from a different part of Africa. This discovery is important for creating tests to detect Ebola in humans and animals, and developing treatments and vaccines. The new virus was found in 29 suspect blood samples using standard and a new DNA sequencing method. The outbreak in Uganda's Bundibyo District started in November 2007 with 7 cases, and spread to 149 cases and 37 deaths by December 2007. The new virus is less deadly than two other known Ebola viruses, with a 36% fatality rate compared to 80-90% for one and 50-55% for the other. More studies are needed to see if current vaccines protect against this new virus and to test its effects in animals. To control the outbreak, rapid tests were sent to Uganda to quickly identify cases. The outbreak ended in December 2007.
Researchers have found that Alzheimer's disease (AD) progresses at varying rates among patients, with some declining quickly and others slowly. To understand this variation, scientists analyzed data from 648 patients with an average 4.78-year follow-up period. They used the Global Deteration Scale (GDS) and Functional Staging (FAST) procedures, which break down AD into seven stages from normal to severe dementia. Each stage has a published average duration, but the variation was unknown. The study found that the standard deviations for stages 4-6 are similar to their means, indicating significant variation in decline among patients. This suggests that AD is a heterogeneous disease with different subgroups of patients experiencing different patterns of decline. A large dataset revealed significant variation in lengths of DS/FAST stages 4-6, with standard deviations similar to their means, indicating varying cognitive and functional decline. This supports the idea that AD is a complex disease with multiple factors contributing to its progression. The study used a 23-year dataset with patients at stages 4-7 of AD, showing large heterogeneity in DS/FAST durations consistent with previous reports. The DS and FAST procedures describe a continuum of 16 stages from normal to severe AD, with some differences between them. A 5-year follow-up study found association between frontal lobe involvement and rapid AD progression, and a 15-year study examined patterns of AD progression.
Researchers studied how the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory, adapts to changing environments. They created a simplified model of the hippocampus to see how it encodes and decodes memory patterns. They found that adding new neurons, a process called neurogenesis, was more effective than changing existing neurons or their connections, called synaptic plasticity. This allowed the model to adapt to new environments while keeping old memories. They extended the model to include grid cells in the entorinal cortex, which provide spatial information. Compared three strategies: synaptic plasticity, where connections change but not number of neurons; turnover, where neurons die and are replaced; and neurogenesis, where new neurons are added. Neurogenesis outperformed the others. A more realistic rule that includes cell death and plasticity of new neurons performed better than each alone. This rule can be tailored for short or long-term memory. They also studied neurogenesis over an animal's lifetime under different conditions, showing distinct features that can be tested. Place cells emerged in a realistic way in the model due to dentate gyrus sparsification.
African trypanosomes, a type of parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans and animals, have a special enzymes called peroxides that protect their cells from damage. These enzymes, called Px I and II, are found in the cell's liquid (cytosol) and mitochondria, a part of the cell that produces energy. Without these enzymes, the parasite's cells die quickly. Researchers found that the mitochondria is not the main source of damage, but the lysosome, a part of the cell that breaks down waste, is. The lysosome is damaged when the parasite takes in too much iron from its host, a process called endocytosis. The lysosome's damage leads to cell death. The enzymes Px I and II protect the lysosome from iron-induced damage. This process is linked to the parasite's high rate of taking in iron from its host. The study shows that the lysosome, not mitochondria, is the main site of damage in African trypanosomes.
Researchers have studied the role of a protein called PMEL in melanocytes, cells that produce melanin, the pigment responsible for skin and hair color. They created mice without the PM gene, called P−/−, and found they were viable and fertile with no developmental defects. However, their melanosomes, the structures where melanin accumulates, were spherical instead of the usual elongated shape. This was seen in skin and eye melanocytes. Inactivating PM had a mild effect on coat color in different genetic backgrounds, but reduced melanin content in hair, showing PM's role in maintaining epidermal pigmentation. The study suggests PM is essential for normal melanos shape but not survival of melanocytes.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of environmental methods for deng vector control was conducted to evaluate their effectiveness in preventing deng infections. Nineteen studies were eligible, with sixteen contributing to the meta-analysis. The methods evaluated were: container covers with and without insecticides, waste management and clean-up, and elimination of breeding sites. Quality was highest for container covers with insecticides, followed by waste without direct collection and elimination. Both review and meta showed a weak effect on larval populations, with no differences between results. For the meta, container without insect (BI: -7.9, DOE-5) and waste with collection (BI: -8.83, DOE-6.2) achieved strongest reductions for BI, while pupal results were opposite, with covers (P: -0.83, 0.09) and elimination (P: -0.95, -0.83) showing strongest. Each method showed effectiveness in reducing Aedes larval and pupal densities. However, more high-quality studies are needed to strengthen evidence. A previous studies concluded environmental management was effective, and community-based interventions reduced deng risk. This study aimed to review and meta environmental methods' effectiveness. Searches were finished in 2017, but no further studies altered results. All methods showed effectiveness in reducing Aedes densities, partly due to study design issues and linking control and transmission.
Researchers have identified small molecules that can selectively stall protein synthesis by the ribosome, a key to developing new treatments for diseases. These compounds, like PF-06303, inhibit PCSK9, a major regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, reducing LDL in preclinical models and affecting few off-target proteins. However, their impact on cell physiology and ribosome control pathways is unknown. A genome-wide CRISPR screen was used to identify proteins and pathways that modulate growth in presence of high doses of PF-03. The most potent genetic modifiers of fitness were ubiquitin binding protein ASC2 and helicase ASC3, which bind to the ribosome and protect cells from PF03's toxic effects. Surprisingly, quality control proteins Pelota and H1 sensitize cells to PF03 treatment. Genetic experiments showed ASC3 acts with ASC2 and downstream of H1. These results connect ribosome control pathways and provide insights into selectivity of compounds that stall translation, aiding next-generation compounds to treat diseases.
Researchers have discovered that a protein from the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSH) called SO induces widespread destruction of cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) in host cells. This is a way for the virus to evade the immune system and block host gene expression. The mechanism behind this process was unknown, as SO doesn't have an enzyme that breaks down RNA. The study found that SO stimulates RNA turnover through a unique process called polyadenylation, where RNA gets an extra tail. Cells with SO express this protein have longer tails on their RNA and it gets broken down faster. Inhibiting this tail formation blocks SO's activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins are important for SO's function and it moves to the nucleus. This is a new way for the virus to shut down host and a new way to study how RNA is broken down in cells.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to bacterial infections in the lungs. They found that a type of interferon, called IFλ, plays a key role in this response. IFλ is a protein that helps fight off viral infections, but its role in bacterial infections was unknown. The study showed that two types of bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, trigger IFλ production in the lungs. Mice without the receptor for IFλ, called IL-28, cleared the bacteria better and had less lung damage. This was linked to lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the airways. In human cells, IFλ blocked a microRNA called mi-21, leading to more of a protein called PDC4, which promotes inflammation. In mice without IFλ or PDC, bacterial clearance improved and lung damage reduced. The study suggests IFλ promotes inflammation by blocking mi-21 regulation of PDC.
Researchers at the National Center for African Trypanosomiasis in the Democratic Republic of Congo studied mortality trends and risk factors in 781 patients with advanced stage-2 sleeping sickness between 1989 and 2012. They found that 17.2% of patients died in the standard melarsol treatment group, 12.1% in the short melarsol group, 5.4 in the eflornine group, 9.1 in the NECT regimen, and 36% in the group given efline due to severe clinical status. After adjusting for treatment, the odds of death were higher for patients with severely impaired clinical status, high protach, parasites in CSF, and cyach. Multivariate analysis showed clinical status and protach as predictors of death in some groups. The study's clinical assessment tool may help develop standardized tools for H management and epidemiological reports.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the effects of isolation on social behavior in fruit flies, specifically Drosophila melanogaster. They created a system to track and analyze the behavior of many flies at once, and used it to see how isolation affects their social interactions. The team found that isolation changes social behavior and the way flies interact with each other, and that these changes happen quickly. They also looked at the genetic changes in the flies and found that some genes related to metabolism are affected. Isolated flies have more lipids, a type of fat, in their bodies. The researchers used this method to study the effects of isolation on social behavior and found that it changes the way flies move and interact with each other, and that these changes last. They also found that some genes related to metabolism are affected. The study shows that isolation has a big impact on social behavior and physiology in flies.
Researchers conducted a pilot study in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of a smartphone adaptation of the World Health Organization's (WHO) diarrhea management guidelines, including a tool for age-based weight estimation. The study took place in two hospitals that lacked scales, necessitating weight estimation. The study consisted of a 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention period with a 10-day post-discharge follow-up. The primary outcome was adherence to guidelines for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and zinc. A total of 841 patients were enrolled (325 pre-intervention, 516 intervention). During the intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for IV fluids decreased at both hospitals (p < 0.001) with risk ratios (RRs) of 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. However, when IV fluids were prescribed, the volume adhered to recommendations. The proportion of prescriptions for the antibiotic azithromycin increased (p < 0.001; p= 0.035) with RR of 6.9 and 1.6, while prescriptions for other antibiotics decreased; zinc adherence increased. The study found that a smartphone tool can improve guideline adherence.
Scientists have long struggled to predict how host-parasite systems will respond to climate change due to the complexity of their interactions. A key factors like host survival and parasite virulence have different temperature dependencies that need to be included in disease models. Researchers used data from Daphnia and a microidian parasite to create a mechanistic model of within-parasite dynamics. The model accounted for host mortality, parasite growth, and infection cost across temperatures with fewer parameters than traditional models. The study shows that linking metabolic theory with a host-parite framework can predict parasite population responses at the within-host level.

The researchers analyzed data on host and parasite across a temperature range using a model to capture thermal dependencies of aging and virulence, growth, and abundance. They fitted a model to data on Daph and its parasite to examine temperature effects on traits, interactions, and dynamics. Over nine temperatures, they measured lifespan of exposed and unexposed D and parasite abundance. Accurate predictions of climate change on host-parite and disease require models that integrate thermal dependencies of host and parasite traits. Development, survival, and movement can be described by formula from metabolic theory. These inform classical host-parite models to estimate temperature effects on prevalence and severity.

The study demonstrates the power of linking metabolic relationships for host and parasite in mechanistic models to understand temperature impacts on disease. The framework is simple and general, making it a valuable approach for predicting outcomes and consequences of infections under climate change.
Scientists have long known that a type of brain cell called GABAergic interneurons play a crucial role in controlling the activity of another type called excitatory pyramidal cells. However, how different types of inhibitory neurons contribute to information processing is not fully understood. Researchers propose a new role for a network of three types of inhibitory neurons: parvalbum, somostatin, and vaso intestinal peptide. They suggest that these neurons control the distribution of inhibition onto pyramidal cells, and that mutual inhibition between two of them translates weak inputs into large changes in inhibition. Using a computer model, they show that properties of the circuit support this idea. They also show that this network allows inputs to switch between two modes of processing, either integrating or canceling top inputs onto dendrites of pyramidal cells.
Researchers have found that interactions between different microorganisms in the microbiome can create false associations between specific microbes and host phenotypes, making it difficult to determine which microbes are directly linked to a disease. They developed a method, called Direct Association Analysis, to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. The method corrected inflated p-values in association tests and showed only a small subset of associations are directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate and brain-gut axis as factors in inflammatory disease. Microbial interactions produce a large number of spurious associations between members of the microbiome and phenotypes, many of which can be removed by a procedure based on maximum models from statistical physics. Traditional association studies lost power to identify the link between phenotype and microbiota in the dataset. The number of detections increased for real data, suggesting many reported associations between microbi and IBD could be indirect. The researchers estimated the contribution of indirect associations and isolated direct from associations, showing interactions are strong enough to generate detect changes in abundance of microbes not linked to host.
Researchers compared two ways of infecting mosquitoes with Wolbach, a type of bacteria, to see how it affects the spread of two viruses: dengue (DENV) and West Nile (WNV). They used two methods: stably infecting mosquitoes with Wolbach, which means the bacteria is passed on to their offspring, and transiently infecting, where the bacteria is only in the mosquito for a short time. The study found that Wolbach blocked both viruses in both types of infections, but the effect was stronger in stably infected mosquitoes. They also found no evidence that Wolbach helped the viruses spread, which suggests it could be a safe way to stop them from being transmitted. This is important because some mosquitoes are hard to infect with Wolbach, making it hard to study how it affects viruses. The study looked at how Wolbach density, or amount, in mosquitoes and found it was lower in transiently infected ones, which could explain why the weaker effect. They repeated the study with another virus, WNV, and got similar results.
Researchers studied how cilia are organized in the roundworm C. elegans. Cilia are microtub-based organelles that help cells sense the environment. They are divided into three parts: the basal body, transition zone (TZ), and shaft. In mammals, a protein called Inversin localizes to a part of the shaft near the TZ, called the Invers compartment (Inv). The mechanisms that create and maintain Inv are unknown. In C elegans, the shafts of sensory cilia are divided into two regions by microtub structure: proximal doublet near TZ and distal singlet. It was thought Cans cilia have an Inv like mammals. The study explored ciliogenesis, structure, and Inv in Cans. They found Inv is distinct from the double region. Two genes, n-2 (Invers homolog) and ar-13,lp-11, and unc-119, are needed for cili. Inv and double region can be grouped into two modules: n-2lp-11 and ar-13-119, which are opposed by hd-6 deacetylase. Glutamylation, a tub modification, is not needed for Inv and double region targeting; rather, it's modulated by n-2, ar-13, and-119. C targeting and localization of N-2, A-13, and UNC does not require TZ, double region and Inv genes. N-2 needs its calcium binding domain for Inv. C elegans Inv is distinct from double region, and components interact to regulate cili via placement, microt structure, and localization.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Scribble plays a crucial role in the formation and repair of myelin, the fatty insulation that surrounds nerve fibers in the central nervous system. Myelin is formed by oligodendrocytes, specialized cells that change shape to create the myelin sheath. Scribble is present throughout oligodrocy development and becomes more active in mature oligodcytes, where it is found in both developing and mature myelin sheaths. Without Scri, oligodrotes fail to initiate myelinate, and myelin formation is disrupted in the central nervous system during development and after damage. Scri also regulates myelin thickness by suppressing a signaling pathway called ERK/MAP and is located at the node of Ranvier, where it helps axon-glial adhesion. This study shows that Scri is essential for myelination and remyelination, a process conserved across evolution.
Researchers have discovered a new insights into the pathogenesis of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogen, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium botulin. Until now, modified virulence peptides have been rarely reported and S-like cytolyins have been associated with Streptoccus sp, including group A and G streptocci and S.iae, a fish pathogen. However, this study found that a number of related clusters can be identified in other Gram pathogens, including L. monocogen, S. aure and C. A focus on the L. monocogen cluster revealed it encodes an inducible cytotoxic and hemolytic peptide, Listerin S, which plays a role in survival of the path in PMNs and contributes to virulence in mouse model. Notably, Listerin-associated cluster is variable, present in subset isolates from lineage I, evolutionary associated with majority of epidemics with this fatal path. In silico analysis demonstrates gene clusters encoding S-like factors present in notorious Gram pathogens, including L. monocogen, S. aure and C. botulin. A focus on L. has established S biosynthetic enzymes, SagD, function analogous to microcin B modification machinery, Sag can substitute for Mc with respect modification micro B structural in vitro. Each cluster contains gene encoding S-like peptide, designate Listerin (LS), Stolys (ST), and Botin (BTS).
Researchers studied the role of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in mycetoma, a type of granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria. They found that IL-17 and MMP-9 were present in myet lesions, with IL-17 mainly in Zones I and II, and MMP-9 in Zones II and III. MMP-9 levels were higher in lesions caused by Actinomura pelletii and Streptomyces somensis compared to Madure mycatis. There was a direct correlation between MMP-9 and IL-17 levels, and MMP-9 levels were higher in lesions with longer disease duration. The study suggests IL-17 and MMP-9 play a role in myet granuloma formation, but more research is needed to determine their exact function.
Researchers have been trying to understand how certain proteins, called intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), recognize and bind to other molecules. IDPs are unique because they don't have a fixed shape and can change depending on what they interact with. Some IDPs stay disordered even when bound to a target, a phenomenon called "fuzziness". Scientists studied the transcription activation domain of the Ewing Sarcoma oncoprotein (E) family, an ID that exhibits fuzziness. They hypothesized that E-target binding involves interactions between E's aromatic side chains and the target's basic residues. To test this, they looked at E variants with different sequences, aromatic density, and charge. Results supported the cation-π model. A coarse-grained model and analytical model also captured the trends. E-target binding is driven by balance between E conformation entropy and cationπ contacts. This versatile recognition mode offers a framework for promiscuous target by polyent IDPs.
Researchers studied the functions of two ATP-dependent proteases, Lon-1 and Lon-2, in the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. This bacterium is transmitted to humans through tick bites. Previous work showed that Lon-1 is upregulated when exposed to blood, while Lon-2 is not. The study aimed to clarify the roles of these proteases in B. burgorferi. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Lon-1 and Lon-2 are different due to differences in their substrate binding domains. Recombinant Lon-1 showed properties of an ATP-dependent chaper-protease but did not complement E. coli mutant, while Lon-2 corrected Lon-mut phenotypes. The study concludes that B. burgorfer Lon-1 and-2 have distinct roles. Lon-2 functions like a canonical Lon, in cellular homeostasis, while Lon-1, induced by blood, may be important for host adaptation from arthropod to warm-blood host.
Researchers studied how the role of antibody-dependent phagocytosis (AD) in preventing HIV-1 infection. AD is a process where antibodies help white blood cells engulf and destroy viruses. They found that HIV-1 virions (virus particles) are not easily engulfed by antibodies, but when coated with a specific protein called gp41, antibodies can mediate phagocytosis. A few hundred gp41 molecules are needed for successful phagytosis, similar to the number of spikes on other viruses like influenza. Using a technique called fluorescence spectroscopy, they found a link between virus aggregation and AD. In contrast, HIV-infected cells are targets for phagocytosis in the presence of antibodies. The study suggests AD may not play a role in preventing HIV infection due to lack of trimers and inability of antibodies to cross-link receptors on white cells. However, phagocyt of infected cells could play a role in clearing cells on verge of infection.
Hookworm infection is a widespread in many countries around the world, but its economic and health impact is not well understood. To determine how much time, energy, and resources to invest in controlling the disease, researchers created a model to estimate the economic and health burden of hookworm in every country, region, and globally in 2016. From a societal perspective, globally, hookworm resulted in 2,126,280 Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) using 200 disability estimates and 4,087,803 DALs using 201 estimates (excluding cognitive impairment). Including impairment did not increase DALs worldwide. Productivity losses varied with anemia and calculation method, from $7.5 billion to $138.9 annually using Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, and from $2.5 to $43.9 billion using minimum wage. Hook is classified as a neglected disease, but its burden exceeded estimates of diseases with more attention, such as rotavirus. Countries transitioning to higher income, like Brazil and China, still face significant hook burden. A study reported 3,230,800 DALs annually due to hook among all ages in 21 regions, but did not include cognitive impairment. Assuming median anemia and NI, hook infections resulted in losses $11.1 billion (95%: $5.5-18.5) using Method 1, $87.9 (95:1.7-302.3) Method 2, and $23.1 (11-38.4) Method 3. Using minimum wage, global burden was $3 billion.
Researchers studied how oxygen deprivation, or hypoxia, affects the developing brain in vertebrates, such as zebraf fish. They found that hypox disrupts the pathfinding of forebrain neurons, leading to errors in commissural axons failing to cross the midline. This happens due to the activation of the hypia-inducible transcription factor (h1) pathway, which can be mimicked by chemical inducers of h1 or expression of constitutively active hα. Blocking transcription activation of hα prevented the defects. EphrinB2 was identified as a target of the h pathway, and its knockdown rescued the errors. The receptor EphA4 is expressed in a pattern to the misrouting axons. Targeting a constitutive form of EphB to neurons showed EphB mediates the errors via reverse-signaling. Magnesium, used to improve neurodevelopment in prebirths, protects against errors by preventing upregulation of EphB.
Researchers studied how a fungal infection called paracidiomycosis affects the lungs in mice using a new imaging technique called high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and compared it to traditional tissue analysis. Paracidiomycosis is a disease caused by a fungus that affects the lungs, skin, and other parts of the body, and can be hard to treat. The researchers infected mice with the fungus and took pictures of their lungs with HRCT every four weeks to see how the infection spread. They also looked at the lungs under a microscope to compare the results. Three types of lung damage were found: nodular, diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-oral. The damage was mostly around the lung's center and affected the left lung more often. After four weeks, 80% of infected mice had a type of damage called consolidation, which made the lung denser. After eight and 12 weeks, the damage spread to other parts of the lung. Microscopic analysis showed that the damage seen on HRCT was the same as a type of reaction, while nodules were small groups of immune cells. After 16 weeks, the damage formed large masses that blocked airways. Researchers found that HRCT is a good tool to see and measure lung damage in this infection. This method can help reduce the number of animals needed for study and monitor treatment.
Researchers have developed a new test to detect infection with Leishmania donovirus, a parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis. The test, called Interferon-gamma Release Assay (QuFERON), measures the body's immune response to the parasite. They tested the test on blood samples from people with active, cured, and healthy individuals living in areas where the parasite is common. The test used five different parts of the parasite: H2, H2-PS2, H-Le12, crude antigen, and soluble Leish antigen (SL). The test based on SL had 80% sensitivity and 100 specificity. This means it correctly identified 80% of people with the infection and 100% of those without. The study found that people with active infection had a different immune response than expected, producing interferon-gamma when exposed to the parasite. This is opposite of previous findings that showed no response. The test could be used to measure immune response to the parasite.
Researchers have found that a toxin called CNFY plays a key role in making the bacteria Yersinia pseudotuberculosis persistent in the body. This bacteria can cause gastrointestinal infections that can lead to relapsing enteritis and autoimmune disorders. To establish a persistent infection, the bacteria must navigate through the intestinal lining and colonize the underlying lymphatic tissues, but how they evade the immune response is not well understood. The study shows that CNFY toxin enhances the transfer of antiphocytic effectors, leading to inflammation and tissue destruction of the intestinal microbiota and bacterial clearance. However, suppressing CNFY function increases interferon-mediated responses, non-inflammatory activities and tolerogenesis. This leads to a preprogramming of the pathogen's transcription towards persistence, giving the bacteria an advantage against host responses and establishing a commensal lifestyle.

The study demonstrates that removing a single virulence factor, CNFY, is sufficient to dampen inflammation and evade host defense, favoring Yers persistence. The mechanisms are unclear, but the impact suggests a set of immune responses, such as IL-6 levels, modulators, bacteridal activities, and anti-inflammatory factors, contributing to the process. The CNFY process is a double-edged sword. The toxin constitutively activates Rho GTPases deid and improves Y translocation into host, enhancing inflammation and tissue damage. Suppressing CN function shifts the balance towards immune suppression, promoting asymptomatic infection. Several enteric pathogens, including Yersiae, persist in the tract and lymphatic tissues, promoting chronic arthritis and ileitis.
Researchers have identified a new gene called DES1 in the fungus Magnaporthe oryza that helps the pathogen to overcome the plant's defense system. This gene is necessary for the fungus to successfully colonize and reproduce in the plant. To find DES1, scientists looked at pathogenic-defective mutants in a library of T-DNA insertions. They found that DES1 encodes a protein rich in serine with unknown properties, and its homologs are conserved in filamentous Ascomyc. Deleting DES1 had no effect on growth, conial germination, appressium formation, and penetration, but conial size was smaller. The mutant was sensitive to oxidative stress and had less extracellular enzymes. In interaction with rice, cells inoculated with DES mutant showed strong defense responses, brown granules, ROS, autofluorescent materials, and PR gene induction. The mutant had reduced infectious hyal extension and pathogenicity. Suppressing ROS with DPI, an inhibitor of NAD oxidases, reduced defense in plant tissues with mutant. DPI-treated tissues allowed mutant to grow normally. This suggests DES1 regulates fungal proteins, compromising plant defense by ROS.
Researchers in Ghana used a statistical model to predict where Schistosoma haematium, a parasitic worm infection, was most prevalent in the country. They compared these predictions to actual data from school surveys to see how accurate the model was. The study found that using the model alone, 21 out of 25 schools with high infection rates would not receive treatment and 20% of schools with no infection would be treated. This would mean 28% of children would not receive treatment and 12% would receive unnecessary treatment. The model was not accurate enough to guide the national program, but can be a tool when combined with actual assessments. Predictive mapping should not be a one-time exercise, but an ongoing process that incorporates testing and refining to meet needs of disease control managers.
Researchers have discovered that a mixture of prostaglandins, a type of hormone, guides sperm in the reproductive tract of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of worm. They found that the worm's oocytes, or egg cells, synthesize prostagland from fatty acid precursors in yolk protein complexes. The team used genetics and mass spectrometry to study prostland metabolism and found that omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids are converted into over 10 structurally related prostland, which work together to promote sperm guidance. Disrupting omega-3 fatty acid synthesis triggers prostland production from omega-6 acids. The worm's prostland synthesis is different from mammal pathways, yet still produces PG2 stereomers. A conserved enzyme, cytochrome P450, regulates prostland synthesis. The team found a cons enzyme that inhibits prostland metabolism, possibly diverting precursors to alternative pathways. Results support that multiple prostland function together promote sperm motility for fertilization.
Researchers have developed a new method to design proteins that are less likely to trigger an immune response while keeping their function intact. This is a challenge in creating medicines that use proteins to treat diseases, as the body's immune system often rejects them. The team used a computer program to find the best balance between making the protein less recognizable to the immune system and keeping it working well. They found that there is no single "best" design, but a range of options that trade off between these two goals. Eight of these designs were made and tested, and the results matched the computer predictions. This is the first time a systematic look at the trade-offs between making a protein less immunogenic and keeping it functional. The new method could speed up and improve the development of medicines that use proteins to treat diseases.
Researchers studied how temperature affects the process of meiosis in plants, specifically Arabidopsis thaliana. Meiosis is a crucial for sexual reproduction and involves the exchange of DNA between chromosomes to ensure proper chromosome segregation. The frequency and distribution of these exchanges, called crossovers (CO), are regulated by internal and external factors, but more is known about the internal mechanisms than external. The study found that higher temperatures increase meiotic recombination in Arabidopsis and used genetic analysis to show that the extra crossovers come from the Type I pathway, which is sensitive to interference. They also found that heat-induced crossovers are not due to increased DNA breaks and the hyper-recombinant phenotype is specific to thermal stress, not a general response. This provides insight into how environmental cues affect meiotic recombination and may have practical applications.
Researchers have developed a new computational tool, called Hanalyzer, to help scientists navigate the vast and rapidly evolving field of molecular biology. This tool combines reading, reasoning, and reporting methods to analyze experimental data from various sources. It extracts information from structured and unstructured data, tracks provenance, and enriches knowledge by noting relationships between genes and databases. Hanalyzer was tested on a large gene expression dataset related to craniofacial development, revealing new roles for four previously uncharacterized genes, validated by further experiments. The tool allows users to trace provenance links and access underlying data sources. To present relevant knowledge, sub-networks are selected and presented in a comprehensible way, either by visualizing or creating a quantitative network based on experimental data. Combining the two networks highlights supported and unsupported linkages, facilitating explanation and hypothesis generation. This approach can be applied to any dataset.
Helminth parasites, such as Fasciola hepatica, secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be internalized by host cells, modulating the host's immune response. While the cargo of EVs has been characterized in many parasites, little is known about the surface-exposed molecules that participate in ligand-receptor interactions with the cell to initiate vesicle docking and internalization. Researchers used a membrane-impermeable biotin reagent to capture proteins on the outer surface of two subpopulations (15 and 120 EV) released by adult F. hepatica, describing 380 proteins including virulence factors, membrane proteins, and molecules involved in EV biogenesis/trafficking. Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis showed 120 EV have endosomal origin and may be released via the protonephial excretory system, while larger 15 EV are from gastrodermal epithelial cells lining the gut. Lectin microarray strategy profiled surface oligosaccharides of intact fluorically labelled EVs displayed to host. Lect profiles of 15 and 120 EV subpopulations are identical but distinct from parasite tegument, predominated by mannose sugars. EV were resistant to exo and endoglycosases, but glycosidase remodelled surface and blocked uptake by macrophages. Pre-treatment with antibodies from infected hosts or purified against EV surface proteins significantly enhanced internalization.
Researchers have discovered a key player in the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) in plants, called Arabidopsis CDF2. miRNAs are crucial for plant development and are first transcribed as stem-loop primary miRNAs (pri-mi) by RNA polymerase II, then cut into mature miRN by Dicer 1 (D1). CDF2 interacts with D1 and regulates a group of miRN. It acts as a transcription activator or repressor for some mi genes and binds directly to their promoters. C2 also binds to pri-mi regulated by itself and affects D1 processing of these prii. Genetically, C2 works in the same pathway as mi156 or mi172 to control flowering. C2 regulates a group of prii at both transcription and post-transcription levels to maintain proper levels of mature mi to control plant development.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GG) plays a crucial role in the communication between oocytes and granulosa cells in the ovaries. This communication is essential for the development of follicles, which provide eggs for reproduction. GG is involved in a process called protein geranylation, which helps cells talk to each other. The study found that GG levels increase in oocytes during early follicle development. When GG was removed from oocytes, granosa cells didn't proliferate, and follicles didn't transition to the next stage, affecting female fertility. Mechanistically, GG blocked a protein called Rho, which helps cells stick together, and another called Rab, which helps send materials from o to granosa cells. Restoring GG in oocytes fixed these issues. The study shows GG's role in o-granosa communication and follicle transition, a key step in female reproduction.
Researchers have created a detailed model of an enzyme called RNA polymerase II, which is responsible for creating messenger RNA from DNA. Despite previous studies, it was unclear how a molecule called NTP (a building block of RNA) reaches the enzyme's active site. The model reveals that the secondary channel is the main route for NTP to enter the enzyme, but the main channel is still a possibility. This is because the non-DNA part of the transcription bubble, which overlaps with the main channel, is crucial for studying NTP routes but its shape is unknown in available structures. The researchers built a model of RNA polymerase II with a complete bubble by combining existing data and simulations. They found that the secondary channel has more space for NTP than the main, and simulations showed that N through the main is hindered by electrostatic repulsion between N and negatively charged DNA. This suggests the secondary channel is the main route for N during transcription.
Dengue is a significant public health problem in Thailand and Cambodia, particularly among children under 15 years old. Despite being a reportable disease, the true burden of deng is unknown due to underreporting. Researchers used data from laboratory-confirmed outpatient and inpatient cases in prospective studies to estimate the magnitude of underreporting and establish accurate burden estimates for these countries. Two cohort studies were conducted among children under 15 in a deng field site over two deng seasons. Age-specific multiplication factors (MF) were calculated by comparing cohort data to national surveillance in the same province and year. In Thailand, 14,627 person-years of cohort data were obtained in two provinces and 14,493 from one in Cambodia. Average incidence of laboratory-confirmed deng was 23/1,000 and 25/1,000 in Thailand, and 41/1,000 in Cambodia. Calculated MF varied by age and year (0.4-29). Average age-specific MF were applied to country data indicating in Thailand 229,886 (210,612-331,236) deng cases annually 2003-2007 and 111,178 (80,452,357,135) in Cambodia. Underreporting total inpatient deng cases was 8.7 and 2.6 in Thailand, and 9.1 and 1.4 in Cambodia. In 2007, over 95,000 children in Thailand and 58,000 in Cambodia were estimated hospitalized due to deng. Calculating MF by cohort data to surveillance is one approach to assess burden. Data indicate deng reported in many countries underreport true burden.
Researchers have discovered that natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in promoting the immune response to cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. They found that NK cells help accelerate the development of CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that fights off the virus, by controlling the production of immunosup cytokines. These cytokines can suppress the immune response and make it harder for the body to fight off the infection. By limiting their production, NK cells create an environment that allows CD8 cells to develop and attack the virus effectively. The study used mice with and genetically modified viruses to understand how NK cells interact with CMV. They found that without NK cells, CD8 cells were delayed in responding to the infection. Administering interferon-alpha, a cytokine that suppresses immune response, also delayed CD8 cell activation. This shows that NK cells not only directly fight the virus but also regulate the immune response to prevent overreaction and promote CD8 cell development.
Scientists have discovered that a protein called nucleolin plays a crucial role in controlling the expression of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in Arabidopsis thalian, a type of plant. rRNA genes are arranged in arrays of hundreds to thousands of copies in plants, but not all are transcribed under normal conditions. Researchers found four rRNA variants in Arabid thalian, with one induced and others repressed or unchanged in plants with disrupted nucleolin protein (At-L). The most represented rRNA variant, inactive in normal plants, is reactivated in At-L mutants. The study shows pre-rRNAs originate from RNA I transcription and are processed. Disruption of At-L gene causes loss of symmetrical DNA methylation without affecting histone marks on r genes. This reveals a new mechanism for r gene regulation, where nucleolin controls active and repressed r variants.
Researchers have found that a protein called UL29 from the human cytomegalovirus virus interacts with a complex called NuRD, which is involved in regulating gene expression. This interaction is important for the virus to replicate efficiently. The Nu complex is made up of several proteins, including HDAC1, RBP, and CHD4. When these proteins are knocked down, the virus's immediate-early RNA and DNA accumulation is reduced. This suggests that multiple components of the Nu complex are necessary for the virus to replicate. The researchers also found that the UL29 protein enhances the activity of the virus's major promoter, regardless of the presence of another protein UL38. However, this effect requires the Nu components of the complex. When the Nu components are knocked down, the virus's immediateearly RNA accumulation is inhibited. The researchers propose that UL29 modifies the Nu complex to stimulate the accumulation of immediateearly RNAs.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in young children and adults. They used a technique called whole-genome-fragment display libraries (GFPDL) to identify the specific parts of the virus that the immune system targets. Before and after infection, they found that the immune response to the fusion protein (F) didn't change much, but the response to the attachment protein (G) increased 100-fold. The immune system targeted the N and C-terminus of G and a central part called the conserved domain (CCD). They made synthetic peptides and proteins to test the immune response in children, adolescents, and adults. The response to F increased with age, and new targets were found in the pre-fusion form of F. Antibodies to pre-fusion were 2-3 times stronger than post-fusion. For G, the response was high in children but decreased in adults. This study shows the immune response to F and G evolve differently and supports the idea that the virus adapts to the immune system. These findings can help develop effective countermeasures like vaccines.
Emodeide, a veterinary drug used to treat nematode infections in cats and dogs, has been shown to have macrofidal effects on adult Brug mal, a parasite that causes lymphatic filariasis. Researchers studied how emide works on Brug mal and found it potently inhibits motility by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, with males being more sensitive than females. They discovered that emide targets S-1 channels, a type of potassium channel, and that has different forms due to alternative splicing in the R1 region. The slo-1 isoform found in males is more sensitive to emide than the slo-1 isoform found in females. Knocking down the slo-1 isoform in females increased emide potency. Onchercavolus, another parasite that causes blindness, has two forms of slo-1 in females with different R1 domains. Modeling showed emide binds to the same R1 region in different species of filaria, affected by splicing variations. This study shows emide has potent macroidal effects and splicing in R1 affects potency. Evaluating sex-dependent effects of anthelmint compounds is important to prevent underdosing one gender of nematodes given to patients.
Scientists have been trying to eliminate lymphatic filariasis, a disease caused by the parasite Wuchereria bancrofti, using rapid tests that detect the parasite's protein in the blood. However, these tests also react with another parasite, Loa loa, causing false positives. To understand why, researchers used a special antibody to purify Loa antigens from people with Loa infections. They found many Loa antigens that react with the same antibody, and identified several Lo proteins in the blood of people with Loa infections. These proteins are made by the parasite and released into the blood when it dies. Unlike Wuchereria's protein, which stays in the blood for a long time, Loa antigens are only present in some people's blood for a short time. This difference can help tell the two parasites apart and make better tests for Loa.
Researchers have identified a new protein called RAB-28 that plays a crucial role in the development and function of cilia, tiny hair-like structures on the surface of cells that help with sensing and signaling. Defects in cilia cause inherited disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Bied syndrome, which affect multiple organs and developmental processes. To find new cilia-associated genes, scientists used the nematode C. elegans, where cili form quickly during a short period in late embryogenesis. They analyzed RNA libraries and found a signature profile of known ciliary proteins, including FAM161, CC104, and RP1. From a list of 185 candidates, they found orthologues of MAP, YAP, CC149, and R28 as conserved ciliary components. Further analysis of C. elegans R-28, linked to autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, showed this GTPase is expressed in ciliated neurons and associates with intraflagellar transport (IFT) in a Bardet-Bied syndrome (BBS)-dependent manner. Inactive R-28 has no IFT and diffuse localization, while active GTP-bound R-28 concentrates at the periciliary membrane and undergoes bidirectional IFT. Overexpression of predicted or locked GTP variants of R-28 disrupts cilium and sensory morphogenesis. This study presents a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins and unveils R28, a GTP closely related to B protein R4/IFT, as IFT-associated with BBS-dependent cell and non-autonomous functions at the ciliary base.
Scientists have long wondered how the brain represents the world around us, despite relying only on neural responses and no direct access to external stimuli to understand what those responses mean. Researchers investigated how much can be learned about the space of stimuli using the action potentials (spikes) of cells with stereotypical receptive fields. They used hippocampal place cells as a model and found that knowing which groups of cells fire together reveals a surprising amount of structure in the underlying space, enabling the brain to construct its own representations.

The study showed that knowing which hippocamp cells fire together is enough to extract global features of the environment and reconstruct an accurate representation of physical space, including the animal's position. This is different from previous approaches that reconstructed position from place activity, which required knowing place fields or other neural responses related to position. The researchers found that simple knowledge of cell groups is enough to infer topological features of two-dimensional environment and geometric reconstruction of space, without assuming place fields or prior measurements of position.

In the case of hippocamp cells, global features of environment and accurate reconstruction of space, including animal's position, can be inferred from spikes alone. No prior knowledge of place fields or independent position is needed. Previous approaches to reconstructing position from place activity required knowing place fields, which is not the case here.
Researchers studied a severe liver disease called viral fulminant hepatitis (FH) in mice infected with a virus called murine hepatitis virus-3 (MH-3). They found that mice with high levels of a protein called IL-1β in their liver and blood had severe disease and high mortality. Mice without IL-1 receptor (IL-1-) or treated with IL-1 antagonist (IL-Ra) had less virus replication, disease, and lower mortality. IL-1 receptor deficiency blocked a protein called fibrinogen-like-2 (F2) in macrophages and neutrophils in the liver, and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) by macrophages activated NLR3 inflamome. Mice without NADPH oxidase subunit p47 showed reduced NLR3 inflamome and IL-β during infection, making them resistant to FH. Mice without NLR3 and caspase-1, inflamome components, had less IL-β and reduced hepatitis. The study shows that ROS/NLR3/IL-β is a key pathway causing severe liver disease during viral infection, and may lead to new treatments for FH and other inflammatory diseases.
Hookworm infections are a major cause of severe anemia and iron deficiency in children in tropical regions. Researchers used a new diagnostic tool called multiplex real-time PCR to study the prevalence and impact of two types of hookworm species, Ancyoma duale and Necator american, on anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children in Malawi. The study found that 34.1% of severely anemic children and 27.0% non-severely anemic children had hookworm infections, while microscopy detected only 5.6%. The prevalence of A duale and american was 26.1% and 4.9% respectively. Moderate to high A duale infections were associated with severe anemia and iron deficiency, with odds ratios of 2.49 and 9.04 respectively. Iron deficiency was also associated with intensity of Aale infection, with odds of 3.63, 16.98 and 44.91 for low, moderate and high loads. This is the first study to assess hook load and species with anemia and iron deficiency. The results show a higher than expected prevalence of Aale and its association with severe anemia and iron in pre-school children in Malawi, highlighting the need for species-specific screening. Multiplex real PCR is a powerful tool to combat anemia and iron deficiency in resource-poor settings.
Researchers have identified a protein called COM-1 that plays a crucial role in the process of meiosis, a type of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells. During meiosis, DNA is broken into pieces called double-strand breaks (DSBs), which can be repaired in two ways: homologous recombination (HR) or non-homous joining (NHE). HR is the only way to create inter-chromosome crossovers (COs) needed for proper cell division. Without COM-1, cells repair DS via error-prone NHE, resulting in lack of CO, chromosomal abnormalities, and near-complete embryonic lethality. COM1 is not required for DS initiation but promotes meiotic recombination by counteracting NHE complex. In fact, animals lacking both COM1 and Ku are viable and proficient in CO formation. COM acts parallel to nuclease EX-1 to promote interolog HR at early meiotic stage and safeguard CO formation. Both nucleases are dispensable for RAD-51 at late stage when hom-independent pathways predominate.
Researchers studied the immune response of goats to Burkholderia pseudallei, a bacteria that causes meloidosis, a severe pneumonia and sepsis in Southeast Asia and Australia. They used an aerosol infection model to mimic the disease in goats, which is more similar to human infection than previous mouse models. The goal was to identify proteins that trigger an immune response, which could lead to new diagnostics and vaccines. The study found that goats developed a strong immune response to several proteins, including GroEL, EF-T, and Dna, which were present in all samples after infection. Heat shock protein GroEL elicited the strongest response. Most antigens showed peak IgM reactivity at day 14, while IgG increased as disease progressed. A comparison with human sera showed many common reactive proteins between goats and humans with meloidosis. The study found a diverse and increasing antibody response over disease in goats, with IgG and IgM responses in individual serum samples using 2D electrophoresis and western blots. ELISA and 2D gel electrophis were used to analyze antibody concentration to whole lysate and individual antigens. Total reactive IgM was stable with most antigens throughout 7-14. The response was similar to human meloid patients, with many antigens eliciting comparable antibodies. The study suggests goats have a complex immune response to multiple antigens during meloidosis, similar to humans.
Cyclin B-Cdk Activation Continues after Centros Separation to Control Mitotic Progression

A key event that initiates mitosis is the activation of cyclin B-cyclindependent kinase (Cdk), triggered by a positive feedback loop at the end of G2. This activation is followed by the metaphase/anaphase-promoting complex-dependent destruction of cyclin B, which inactivates Cdk, allowing mitotic exit and cell division. However, experimental data on Cdk activation in mitosis have been lacking. Researchers used a novel approach to determine the temporal development of cyclin B-Cdk activity in single cells. By quantifying dephosphorylation of C and phosphorylation of the Cdk target anaphase-promoting complex, they disclosed cyclin B-Cdk continues to be activated after centros separation. Importantly, cytoplasmic cyclin-Cdk activity can be maintained when cyclin B translocates to the nucleus in prophase. These data are fitted into a model describing cyclin-Cdk activation in human, revealing a resemblance to a bistable circuit. Cyclin-Cdk levels required to enter mitosis are lower than the amount needed for mitotic progression. Gradually increasing cyclin-Cdk activity after centros separation is critical to coordinate mitotic progression.
HIV-1 vaccines have failed to elicit neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) that can protect against diverse HIV-1 subtypes. One way to develop a strong, cross-reactive response is HIV-1 superinfection (SI), defined as sequential infections from different partners. SI has led to a broader and more potent response than single infection, but it's unclear if SI impacts epitope specificity. This study examined post-SI responses from 21 Kenyan women exposed to subtypes A, C, and D, and superinfected after 1.07 years. Plasma samples were analyzed at 2.72 years postSI. Previous studies showed broad and potent responses targeted 4 main HIV-1 envelope epitopes: CD4 site, V1/V glycan, N332 in V3, and gp41 proximal region. Epitope mapping and computational analysis found no dominant response to these epitopes in 21 women. Data suggest SI promotes a polyclonal response, supporting vaccine designs using multivalent immunogens to elicit diverse Nabs.
Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a leading cause of neurological disabilities in children worldwide, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. CMV has been shown to dysregulate the Notch signaling pathway in neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Hairy Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes) is essential for NPC fate and brain development as an important downstream effector of Notch signaling. Researchers found that CMV downregulates Hes protein levels in infected NPCs. The CM 72Da immediate-early 1 protein (IE1) is involved in Hes degradation by assembling a ubiquitination complex and promoting Hes ubiquination as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasomal degradation of Hes. SpA, a component of PML bodies, is another target of IE-mediated ubiquination. The C-terminal region of IE, amino acids 451-475, is required for IE/Hes interaction and IE-mediated Hes ubiquination but not for IE/SpA interaction and ubiquination. This study reveals a novel mechanism linking Hes downregulation to neurodevelopment disorders caused by CMV infection and identifies IE as the first CM-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase.
Researchers studied how gene expression changes in fruit fly embryos from four different species of the Drosophila genus, which diverged 40 million years ago. They looked at how transcription factors, proteins that control gene expression, bind to DNA and compared it to gene expression levels. They found that gene expression is more conserved than transcription factor binding, and changes in gene expression are not explained by changes in binding. However, sites bound by multiple factors and near genes are conserved more than others, suggesting weak or non-functional binding not subject to selection.

They compared binding across species and found it decreased with phylogenetic distance. Few regions were bound by all four species. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons showed transcription binding diverged in Dophila. They compared divergence to divergence and found only 3-7% of variance explained by binding, 21% if phylogenetic not considered. mRNA-seq from embryos at end of cellularization showed highly correlated between species, decaying with distance. Divergence was lower than TF binding.

They found two sources of binding divergence: BCD, HB, GT, and KR motifs drive a portion, and ChIP log-transformed values normalized for comparisons. mRNA levels were highly correlated between species, decaying with distance. Divergence was lower than TF binding along Doph tree. On a gene-by-gene basis, they matched genes to regions bound by most TFs and focused on 4,846 annotated in all species.
Researchers conducted a large-scale study in two primary health centers in Thanjav district, India, where eight rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) for lymphatic filariasis had been completed. The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of MDA and identify potential "hotspots" of transmission. They tested 50,363 people, mostly children, for microfilaria (M) and antigenemia (Ag) levels. Results showed 0.2% prevalence of M and 0.004 intensity in 60µl blood, and 2.3% and 17.3 Ag-units, respectively. Ag prevalence ranged 0.7-0.9% in children 2-10 years and 2.7-3% in adults. Despite M levels <1% and Ag <2 in sentinel sites, "residual" M-preval ≥1 was found in 7 children and "transmission" at least one Ag-positive child during MDA. Antigenemic persons clustered at household and site levels. An Ag-preval ~1% in children equivalent 0.4 M-preval as possible threshold for stopping MDA. The study indicates need for good surveillance strategies to detect "hot" and evidence-based sampling and evaluation size for transmission assessment surveys.
Researchers conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of temeph, an organophosphate laricide, in controlling deng vectors and deng transmission when used as a single intervention or combined with other methods. They searched six databases and screened grey literature for relevant studies, extracting data and assessing methodological quality. 27 studies were included, 11 single intervention and 16 combined. Single intervention studies showed temeph reduced entomological indices, while 11 of 16 combined studies showed tem with other chemical methods reduced entom indices, but not sustained over time or failed to reduce immature stages. Effectiveness depended on factors like delivery quality, water rate, type, debris, temperature, and sunlight. Timing, reapplication, reluctance, cost, supplies, time, and labor were limitations. As a single intervention, tem was effective in suppressing entom indices, but not when combined with other methods. No evidence suggests tem reduces deng transmission.
Researchers have discovered that two proteins, Ctf19 and C3, play a crucial role in holding sister chromatids together during cell division. C19 is found along the length of chromosomes, but is most abundant at the centromere region, the pericentere. The study found that C19 directs the association of C with the perentere, while C3 ensures its functionality in holding sister chromatids together. Without C3, cells show defects in combination with mutants of C19. Delaying DNA replication rescues the defect in C19 components, but not C3. The researchers propose that C19 loads C at the centere before replication, ensuring its incorporation through C3. Two C19 proteins, I3 and Ch4, direct C association with the perentere during mitosis and meiosis. Without I3 and Ch4, C binding at perere is reduced, affecting chromatid cohesion and segregation. A pathway of C loading is essential for C to be in place before replication. C3 is crucial in ensuring the replisome's integrity and association with cohesion as it traverses the protein-DNA barrier surrounding the centere. The study also found I3 and Ch4 localized at the centere, despite influencing C in perentere. C19 plays a similar role in perent cohesion during mitosis and meiosis. C19 and C3 are conserved. The study suggests a mechanism of kinetore-driven cohesion may operate in organisms with perent heterochatin.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a widespread arbovirus that infects an estimated 100 million people every year, mainly in tropical and subtropical areas. Dengue fever (DF) and deng hemorrhagic fever (DHF) are major health concerns. To understand the underlying mechanisms of deng pathogenesis, researchers studied the serum metabolome and lipidome of adult patients at three stages of infection: early fever, defervescence, and convalescence. Using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry, they identified 60 differential metabolites, mainly fatty acids, acylcarnines, phospholids, and amino acids, in a large sample of 44 patients. The main pathways affected were fatty biosynthesis, β-oxidation, phosphid catabolism, and steroid. These changes suggest a multifactorial host response. Analysis of phospholids and sphingolids showed association with lymphocytes and platelets, which normalized at convalescent stage. These metabolites may be prognostic markers. DENV causes distinct serumome and lipidome changes, with many involved in inflammatory responses. The study reveals early anti-inflammatory responses modulating pro-inflammatory processes, preventing excessive inflammation. This is the first omic approach to show concurrent and dynamic host responses to DENV, offering physiological insights on why DF is self-limiting.
Research on neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) has increased in recent years, but significant gaps in diagnostic and treatment remain. Analyzing bibliometric data from research is a powerful method to reveal research efforts and partnerships. This study aimed to map NTD research in Germany and its partners to enable informed evaluation of German contributions. A Scopus database search for articles with German affiliations published between 2002-2012 was conducted for kinoplast and helminth diseases. From 26,833 publications, 1,187 (4.4%) had at least one German affiliation, and 972 were processed for five most published diseases. Co-author networks were constructed with 4,007 authors and 863 institutions. Most co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries, Brazil. Collaborations with African countries were scattered. NTD research in Germany was distributed among 220 institutions. Strong performers were identified on individual level using parameters (publications, h-index) and social analysis (between centrality). The network varied between diseases. The share of NTD publications with affiliations is half of other medical fields. This underlines the need to identify and expand Germany's strong research towards NTD. Spatial analysis of collaborations abroad can support decisions to strengthen low and middle-income countries involved less than high-income. Identifying knowledge within networks complements traditional indicators for opportunities.
Haiti has made significant progress in controlling neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) since 2000 through a mass drug administration (MDA) program led by the Ministry of Health and its partners. By 2012, the program had reached national scale with good epidemiological coverage, allowing treatment for almost all of the country. Key to this success were the details of how MDAs were implemented, including community awareness through evidence-based education, community trust in drug distributors, directly observed treatment, easy access, and quality data collection. These strategies were effective, with 100% coverage in 201, above targets for LF and STH, and a 45% reduction in infection burden. Haiti's campaign, with international support, resulted in steady progress toward LF elimination and a strong foundation for STH control. 

The likelihood of taking treatment was associated with community knowledge, disease, transmission, strategy, and side effects, perceived risk, and history. In Haiti, knowledge was low and not associated with MDA. In Grand Anse, with 72% prevalence in 2001, decline was less than others, remaining at 55. Results show progress addressing STH, but question how to continue after MDA ceases. A successful campaign was launched in 200 with high rates, steady toward LF elimination, with more rounds in high prevalence and fewer low. A foundation for STH control was established. Factors determining treatment were knowing M was to take and ease of access. Direct observation increased participation. Now, Haiti turns to morbidity control for LF, building on surgery and patient groups implemented.
Researchers studied the role of the master regulator Ctr in controlling the cell cycle of Sinorhizob meli, a type of bacteria that forms a symbiotic relationship with legume plants. In this relationship, S. meli undergoes significant changes, including genome amplification, cell elongation, and loss of reproductive capacity. The researchers found that depleting Ctr causes similar changes, suggesting it's essential for differentiation. They also discovered that Ctr is regulated by proteolytic degradation, a possible mechanism for its depletion during symbiosis. By analyzing gene expression and protein interactions, they found Ctr regulates different processes than in S. meli than in another similar bacteria, Caulob cresus. For example, it doesn't control the F complex for cell division timing, but instead regulates the septum-inhibiting system. This study provides insight into how conserved genetic networks can adapt to diverse lifestyles. The model of Ctr regulation in S. mel will help understand how the bacterial cycle is modulated by plant factors during symbiosis.
Francisella tularens is a highly infectious bacterium that causes tularemia, a zoonotic disease. To survive and multiply inside host cells, it needs to evade the immune system. Researchers found a gene, FTL_6, that helps Francisella use glutathione (GSH) as a source of cystine, an essential amino acid. This is the first time a nutrient system is shown to be crucial for Francisella's growth inside host cells. SH is the most abundant cystine source in host cells. Francisella adapted to use SH as cystine source in host cells, a key example of bacteria-host interaction.

 Francisella's FTL_6 gene encodes a glutamyl transpeptase (GT) that breaks down glutam peptides. GT allows Francisella to use glutam peptides as cystine source during growth and is critical for virulence. Without GT, Francisella is resistant to serum. Researchers tested if GT helps Francis use glutam peptides as amino acids and cystine, essential for Francis. They grew Francisella with and without cystine in minimal medium. Francis growth was severely impaired without cystine. Adding cystine relieved growth defect, suggesting GT provides cystine to bacteria by breaking down glut peptides.

Francisella uses SH and glutam-cystine as cystine sources. GT breaks glut-cystine bond. Francisella GT complements E. coli GT deficient strain. Francis GT breaks glu bond in glut-cystine dipeptide, like E. coli. Francis uses SH and glut-cystine as primary cystine sources. Without GT, Francis can't obtain cystine from surroundings, adding cystine compensates deficiency.
Researchers studied how two types of Leishmania parasites, Leishmania amazonensis and Leish major, interact inside host cells. These parasites have different forms: flagellated promastigotes in insects and round amastigotes in host cells. Leish amazon amastotes occupy large vacuoles with many parasites, while Leish major amigotes are in small, tight vacoles that divide. To see if these vacoles can fuse, scientists infected mouse cells with non-fluorescent Leish amazon amastotes, then superinfected with fluorescent Leish major amastotes or promigotes. They used time-lapse imaging and found that Le major promigotes fused with established Leish amazon vacoles, but Leish amastotes did not. In chimeric vacoles, Le promigotes remained motile and multiplied, but did not turn into amastotes. In contrast, in separate vacoles, Le promigotes were destroyed or differentiated into amastotes. This shows that Leish vacoles differ in their ability to fuse and that species-specific mechanisms are required for differentiation.
Scientists have been trying to develop a vaccine against HIV-1, a virus that causes AIDS, for a long time. One goal is to create antibodies that can neutralize the virus, or stop it from infecting cells. To do this, they need to understand how the virus's outer layer, called Env, works. Env is made of two parts, gp120 and gp41, and is heavily covered in sugar molecules called glycans. These glycans make it hard for antibodies to bind and neutralize the virus. Researchers created a vaccine using a piece of the virus, called a trimer, and tested it in rabbits. They found that some rabbits developed strong antibodies that could neutralize the virus. These antibodies targeted gaps in the glycans near the CD4 binding site, a spot where the virus attaches to cells. The researchers also found that removing some of these glycans made the virus more susceptible to the antibodies. This is a new way to create antibodies that can neutralize HIV-1. The study shows that holes in the glycans can be used to develop antibodies that can neutralize the virus. It also shows that antibodies can neutralize the virus even if the glycans are present. This is a step towards creating a vaccine that can protect against HIV-1.
Researchers investigated how to monitor wound healing in patients with Buruli ulcer (BU), a bacterial infection common in rural Africa. Traditionally, surgery was the main treatment, but a combination of antibiotics rifampicin and streptomycin improved outcomes and reduced recurrence. However, managing extensive lesions after treatment remained a challenge, especially in areas with high disease burden. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify markers for wound progression. Specimens from 8 patients were analyzed before and after treatment for connective tissue, remodeling, and epidermal activation markers. Suitable markers were found to monitor healing. α-smooth muscle actin myofiblasts emerged during healing, producing extracellular matrix proteins like pro-collagen and tenascin. After treatment, cells showed ribosomal S6 phosphorylation, a translation marker. Wounds showed dermal remodeling by apoptosis and increased cytokeratin 16 in epider. A set of markers was identified to monitor healing by immunohisto. This may help understand delays in some patients.
Researchers studied how mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, move along axons, the long extensions of nerve cells, in living mice. They used a special imaging technique to watch mitochondria movement in saphous nerves, a type of nerve, in anesthetized mice. They stimulated the nerves with electricity to see how it affects mitochondria movement. They found that low-level electrical activity increased movement of mitochondria in both forward and backward directions. Higher activity, like what happens during normal nerve function, increased forward movement but not backward. This increased the number of mitochondria and their speed. Applying capsaic, a substance, to the skin increased movement in both types of nerves. They also found that mitochondria in active nerves became smaller, suggesting they split into more. These new mitochondria moved forward, not to the nerve endings, but along the nerve. This shows that nerve endings have high energy needs during high activity. Most mitochondria are made in the cell body, so this forward movement helps increase density along the nerve during high activity.
Scientists have studied a genetic disorder called spondylocarparsal synostosis (SCT), which causes progressive vertebral fusions due to a loss of function in a protein called Filamin (FLNB). FLNB acts as a scaffold, linking the actin cytoskeleton to signaling systems, but the disease mechanisms are unclear. Researchers used a mouse model without FLNB and found that the intervertebral discs (IVD) undergo rapid degeneration during development due to abnormal cell changes in the annulus fibros (AF). AF cells lose their fibroblast characteristics and become hypertrophic chondrocy, with hallmarks of endochond-like ossification, including collagen changes, apoptosis, and ossification. TGF and BMP signaling are upregulated, and canonical and non-canonical genes are activated. This indicates FLNB is involved in attenuating TGF/BMP signaling and influences AF fate. The study shows IVD disruptions resemble degenerative discs, providing insights into vertebral fusions and degeneration. In vitro and in vivo, TGF and BMP are increased in the absence of FL, demonstrating FL is required for attenuation of T/B signaling. The AF undergoes ectopic differentiation to chrogenic lineage, leading to abnormalochond ossification. Phenotyp findings resemble aging degeneration, providing a developmental model for degenerative disease.
Viruses have developed various ways to evade the immune system's defenses, and a new research study reveals a previously unknown mechanism used by the orthomyxirus Thog virus (THOV) to suppress the immune response. The virus targets a general transcription factor called TFI, which is essential for the recruitment of the polymerase II enzyme to gene promoters. This enzyme is crucial for the expression of many immune-related genes, such as cytokines and antiviral effector molecules. By depleting TFI, the virus creates an environment where these genes can't be expressed, impairing the immune response. However, other genes not dependent on TFI can still be transcribed. The study found that targeting TFI is beneficial for the virus, as it allows it to express pro-inflammatory cytokines while suppressing negative regulators and tissue repair factors. The virus achieves this by mimicking its inhibitory domain to bind to TFI, affecting a wide range of pro-inflammatory cytokines and effector molecules without impacting general gene expression. The research suggests that targeting TFI could be a favorable site for therapeutic intervention to control undesirable inflammation.
Human parvirus B19 (B19) infection of human erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) causes cell cycle arrest at both late S-phase and G2, containing 4 DNA. The virus induces a DNA damage response (DDR) that facilitates viral replication but is not necessary for cell arrest at G2. A putative terminal activation domain (TAD) within NS1 is responsible for G2 arrest. To understand the mechanism of B19 NS-induced G2 arrest, researchers created doxycine-inducible B19-permissive UT/E-S cell lines that express NS or NSmT2 and examined the function of T2 during G arrest. Results confirm the NS T2 domain plays a role in NS-induced G arrest. Mechanistically, NS activated gene expression through T, which is responsible for ATR (ataxia-telated and Rad-related) activation. Activated ATR phosphorylated CDC25 at serine, inactivating cyclin B/CD1 complex without affecting nuclear import. Importantly, ATR-CHK-CDC25-CD1 pathway is activated during B19 infection EPC, and A plays a role in BV-induced G arrest. B19 infection induces DDR is essential for viral replication, but has no effect on cell arrest at G-phase. The TAD domain of NS1 is key to disrupting cell cycle. B19-infected cells arrest at late S and G contain 4 DNA. ATR activation plays a role in G arrest of EPC expressing NS1, mediated by T2 of NS protein, and ATR-CHK-C25-CD1 pathway is activated in cells at G.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a range of diseases from mild to life-threatening, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. The virus's non-structural protein 1 (NS1) plays a key role in this process by making endothelial cells more permeable. Research has shown that NS1 disrupts the endothelial glycocalyx layer, a network of molecules on the surface of endothelial cells, and triggers the release of inflammatory cytokines from immune cells. This study investigated the role of inflammatory mediators and endothelial-intrinsic pathways in NS-induced vascular leakage. In a mouse model, DENV NS caused vascular leak in the skin, but not a similar virus, West Nile virus NS. Human endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS did not produce inflammatory cytokines, and blocking these cytokines did not affect NS-induced endothelial permeability. The study also found that DENV induced leak in mice lacking inflammatory receptors, similar to normal mice. Blocking molecules involved in glycocal disruption stopped DENV-induced leak. These results suggest that DENV-induced endothelial leak is independent of inflammatory cytokines but dependent on glycocal components. This could lead to new treatments targeting enzymes that break down glycocal components for severe deng disease.
In yeast cells, the formation of a septin ring at the site of bud emergence is crucial for proper cytokinesis, spindle positioning, and the spindle position (SPO) checkpoint. The PO checkpoint delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis until the anaphase spindle aligns with the division axis. Researchers found that two ubiquitin ligases, Dma1 and D2, control septin dynamics and PO by promoting the recruitment of Elm1 kinase to the bud. Cells lacking Dma and D2 showed reduced Elm levels at the bud and Elm-dependent Kin4 activation. Artificially recruiting Elm to the bud restored normal septin ring, spindle positioning, and PO in Dma D2 cells. The study reveals a link between septin dynamics and PO function, suggesting the integrity of the bud is crucial for PO signalling.
Humans have adapted to live in a wide range of environments, and natural selection has likely played a key role in their ability to survive and thrive in extreme climates. Researchers scanned the human genome for signs of selection by looking at single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are strongly linked to climate across 61 populations worldwide. They found a higher number of SNPs that affect gene function compared to those that don't in areas strongly linked to climate. Some of the strongest signals match those found in genetic studies of diseases, including pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. There's also a higher number of signals in genes related to UV radiation, infection, and cancer. This suggests that climate has shaped the distribution of human variation.

The study looked for signs of selection in response to climate variation. Climate affects the spread of diseases, so many of the signals match SNPs associated with immune response in genetic studies. It's likely that the analysis detects pressures due to climate or mediated by climate.

The study found evidence of selection at individual SNPs identified in genetic studies, and sets of genes in cardiovascular and immune diseases. Common themes are genes and variants in pigmentation, response to UV, immune, autoimmune, and cancer. A subset of SN with strong signals for climate were also linked to traits in genetic studies. Some SN strongly linked to climate are implicated in pigmentation and autoimmune.

The same data was used to test adaptations to climate at the genome level and identify genes behind them. Several genome scans have been done in humans, but only two used environment to detect selection on a scale. The strongest signals for each climate show patterns in specific regions. Despite fewer populations, there's a higher number of functional SNPs linked to climate compared to non-functional in all subsets.
Scientists have studied a genetic condition called short QT syndrome (SQTS), which can cause irregular heart rhythms and sudden death. They looked at how a specific mutation in the ERG gene, called N588, affects the heart's electrical activity. Using computer models, they found that this mutation shortens the time it takes for the heart to recover between beats, making it more prone to irregular rhythms. However, in a 3D model of the heart tissue, they found that in some areas, the mutation made it harder for signals to travel, increasing the risk of re-entrant waves. This means the heart can get stuck in a loop, causing irregular rhythms. The study shows that the N588 mutation in ERG gene makes the heart more likely to get stuck in this loop, increasing the risk of irregular rhythms.
Researchers have developed a new model using deep networks to study the collective behavior of zebraf, a type of small fish. The model is both predictive and insightful, meaning it can accurately describe the motion of individual fish in a group and the interactions between them. The model uses two parts: a pair-interaction network, which describes how a fish interacts with its neighbors, and an aggregation network which combines these interactions. The pair network takes 6 inputs and produces 128 outputs, while the aggregation network combines these to a single number. The researchers tested the model on simulated and real data of 60-100 zebraf and found that interactions can be repulsive, attractive, or aligning, but only when moving slowly. At high speeds, interactions are only alignment or repulsion at close distances. The model also shows that each fish decides where to move by averaging information from neighbors, with more weight given to those close, in collision, or moving in front and laterally. The number of interacting individuals is dynamic, typically 8-22, with 1-10 most important. This suggests each fish selects information from the collective.
Researchers have developed a new method to measure the impact of HIV mutations that make the virus resistant to antiretroviral drugs. This is important because about 10% of people newly infected with HIV in Europe have strains that are resistant to treatment. The team used data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and drug resistance tests to create a family tree of viral lineages and model how they spread. They found that one mutation in the protease gene makes the virus more transmissible, while others in the reverse transcriptase gene make it less transmissible. The mutations in reverse transcriptase that make the virus less transmissible are 41, 67, 70, 184, 210, 215, and 219. The mutation in protease that makes the virus more transmissible is 90. The other mutations had no significant effect on how transmissible the virus is. This study shows a new way to measure the cost of resistance mutations and can help understand how resistance spreads in areas with limited resources.
Researchers have found that a protein complex called Elong, which includes histone acetylase Sin3/El3, plays a crucial role in modifying transfer RNAs (tRNAs) to regulate translation efficiency. They discovered that Sin/3El3 is essential for yeast cells to survive oxidative stress, specifically affecting the transcription program governed by the Sty1-Atf1-Pcr pathway. However, cells lacking Sin/3El3 cannot modify the uridine wobble nucleotide of certain tRNAs, and other tRNA activities like Ctu-C2 are also necessary for normal tolerance to H2O2. A plasm overexpressing tRNALUU complements the stress-related phenotypes of Sin/3El3 mutant cells. The study found that H2O-dependent genes, including transcription factors At1 and P1, are highly expressed mRNAs with a biased lysine codons. These mRNAs are poorly translated in stress cells lacking Sin3El3 or C2, but mutated At1 with AAG codons is efficiently translated in all backgrounds. The study shows that lack of functional Elong complex results in stress phenotypes due to tRNA modification and translation inefficiency of stress-induced mRN.
Researchers have discovered a new function of a protein called Nef in the HIV virus that makes it resistant to certain antibodies that can neutralize the virus. These antibodies, called 2F and 4, target a specific part of the virus called the membrane-proximal external region of gp41. Nef makes the virus 50 times more resistant to these antibodies, but has no effect on other antibodies that target different parts of the virus. This resistance was seen in many different types of HIV and SIV viruses, including ones that infect different types of cells. The researchers found that Nef needs to be attached to the membrane to work, but this is separate from its other functions like making the virus more infectious and downregulating a protein. A similar protein from a different virus worked the same as Nef, showing this is not unique to HIV. The study suggests N changes how the virus is recognized by the antibodies, making it harder for them to bind.
Researchers studied the snail host of the liver fluke parasite Opisthoris vivini, which causes cholangiocarcinoma in the Mekong region of Thailand. They used high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics to compare gene expression in infected and uninfected snails. The study found 7,655 differentially expressed genes associated with 43 biological pathways, including immune defense against parasites. Genes encoding proteases were downregulated in infected snails, while heat shock proteins and actins were upregulated. This study lays groundwork for understanding genes and products involved in parasite colonization of snail host. The dataset is a resource for studying susceptibility and resistance mechanisms of snail to parasite and comparing with other hosts.
Researchers investigated the role of complement receptor 1 (CR1, also known as CD35) in leprosy, a public health issue in Brazil. They studied CR polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR levels in 213 lepro patients and 297 controls. The most common haplotype, harboring rs926*T in intron 21 and rs700*T in exon 26, increased susceptibility to lepro by 2.43 times. Paucibillary patients with these variants had lower CR levels, reducing anti-inflammatory response. The most haplotype increased susceptibility to multibillary form by 3.04 times and was associated with higher gene expression, probably increasing parasite internalization. There was an inverse correlation between CR and mannose-binding lectin, initiator of lectin pathway, recognized by CR. The study suggests CR polymorphisms and CR levels, with haplotype effects, increasing lepro by enhancing phagocytosis and inflammation.
Researchers have used a powerful tool called metabolomics to study how genes and their variations affect the body's biological processes. Metabolites, or small molecules in the blood, show what's happening in the body and are linked to diseases like Alzheimer's and metabolic disorders. However, most studies didn't consider sex differences between men and women. This study looked at sex-specific differences in metabolites and their genetic causes. They used data from over 3,300 people and measured 131 metabolites, including amino acids, phospholipids, and sugars. Results showed significant differences between men and women for 102 out of 131 metabolites. Genome-wide studies found significant differences in genes related to metabolism. The study found that metabolites in men and women are different and specific genetic variants in metabolism genes cause these differences. This study provides new insights into sex differences in biological processes and suggests studies should consider sex in design and interpretation.
Researchers have been using genome-scale metabolic networks to model the relationship between a cell's genetic makeup (genotype) and its function (phenotype) through simulations. However, the large number of possible metabolic states makes it hard to predict the cell's active state under specific conditions. To solve this, optimization algorithms are used, but the objective function they aim for is linked to the model's underlying biology, making it a crucial parameter for successful modeling. Current methods use a combination of fluxes to formulate the objective, but this makes the problem sensitive to the stoichiometry of the network, leading to different results when using different but equivalent stoichiometric representations. This makes biological interpretation ambiguous. A new method, Minimization of Metabolites (MiBl), decouples stoichiometry from the objective by using metabolites instead of fluxes. Simulations show MiBl gives unambiguous results and links to biology. For example, it helped explain genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Current methods lead to incoherent predictions due to stoichi representation. A new methodology, MiBl, accounts for stoichi in the objective by mapping flux to metabolite space. Optimization approaches search for an optimal flux that maximizes or minimizes a biological function while satisfying balance and exchange constraints. MiBl uses a linear combination of metabolite turnovers, which is the sum of producing or consuming fluxes multiplied by stoichi coefficients. Minimizing intracellular flux is a common objective, but using it leads to inconsistent results with different stoichi.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the distribution of plague and the genetic structure of the black rat, Rattus rattus, the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. They conducted a study of seroprevalence and genetic (microsatellite markers) in rat populations from four areas with different topography, covering 150-200 km within the Madagas plague focus. The results showed that serreval levels in rats mimicked those reported for humans, and populations displayed more genetic structure with relief. However, the relationship between serval data and structure differed, suggesting plague distribution not related to rat dispersal. Genetic estimates suggested epizootics had weak impact on population sizes. In highlands, plague cannot be accounted for solely by dispersal reservoir. Human activities may be involved in spreading disease in rat and human populations.
Researchers studied the proteins on the surface of Schistosoma mansoni parasites, a type of parasitic worm that infects humans, to understand how the immune system responds to it. They found 11 proteins in the Ly6 family, including 3 new ones, and confirmed that one of them, Sm6D, has a unique structure. These proteins are likely attached to the parasite's surface and can trigger an immune response. The study looked at IgG, IgA, and IgE antibodies in a group of infected Ugandan men before and after treatment with praziquel, a medication. Before treatment, 7.4% and 25.3% of the group had IgG against Sm6A and SmB, respectively, higher than 2.7% against another surface antigen SmAL. After treatment, IgG against SmA and SmB dropped, while Ig against SmAL rose. This shows that SmA and SmB elicit an immune response in infected communities.
Researchers have created a computer simulation to study how cells in the fruit fly retina develop their shape during tissue formation. They found that a protein called cadherin plays a crucial role in determining the shape of cells, not just in sorting them into different groups. The simulation matched data from normal and mutant cells that lack or overexpress cadher with a simple model that includes the timing of cadher expression and cell contact changes. The model reproduced the shapes of normal and mutant cells and highlighted the importance of cadher in cell adhesion and its timing. The simulation also showed that cadher is recycled from inactive to active, changing adhesion between cells.

The study built on previous knowledge that cell adhesion is key in tissue formation and morphogenesis. The researchers used a model to simulate various tissues and found that cadher's role goes beyond sorting, shaping cells' details. They demonstrated that the model describes shape changes in mutants, distinguishes how cadher levels are controlled, and incorporates dynamic features like cad expression and contact timing. The model features include cad recycling, redistribution, expression, and contact dynamics without extra parameters.

In the retina, cells have two adhesion molecules: E-cadher and N-cadher. All cells have Ead, but only cone cells have N. Cadher is localized in a thin membrane band, the adherens junction, where cells stick together.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand how a protein called MT-MT-M helps cancer cells invade by breaking down the surrounding tissue. MT-M is delivered to the front of the cell through tiny vesicles and plays a key role in breaking down the extracellular matrix. The team used a technique called FRAP to see how quickly MT-M is delivered to the front of the cell and found it recovers quickly. They built a computer model based on this data and found that vesicles are key to delivering MT-M to the front of the cell. When they blocked vesicles, the cell's ability to break down tissue decreased. The team also found that the more MT-M is delivered, the more tissue is broken down. The model suggests that breaking down tissue and delivering MT-M work together to help cancer cells invade. This model can be used to design new treatments to stop cancer from spreading.
Researchers studied how the spread of drug-resistant HIV-1 within an infected individual by analyzing viral sequences from four macaques with a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) containing HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. The macques were treated with inhibitors, and viral DNA and RNA were isolated from blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at four time points. Single-genome sequencing revealed a dynamic process where RNA rapidly acquires resistance through multiple mutations across compartments. The blood and lymph nodes were compartmentalized, while the blood and lymph were different from mucosal tissues. The study suggests that blood sampling may not capture viral dynamics in other parts of the body, especially the gut, where RNA turnover was faster and retained fewer wild-type viruses than other compartments. The findings may explain previous conflicting results on compartmentalization in HIV-1.
Researchers have explored the role of feedback in regulating cell growth and development in tissues. They used mathematical modeling to show that a specific type of feedback, where both positive and negative signals act on stem and progenitor cells, leads to unique behaviors such as bistable growth, ultrasensitivity to external cues, growth, and self-organization in the form of lamellar fingers. These behaviors arise not through cell cycle regulation, but through control of stem and progenitor self-renewal. The patterns that emerge are a result of interactions between diffusible factors with opposing effects, but morphogenesis is not due to Turing instabilities.

The study found that regulation of stem and progenitor selfnew can lead to bistability and ultras, with switching between high and low or zero growth states. A necessary condition for this is the presence of both positive and negative feedback. Several in vivo phenomena, such as growth bistability, ultras, and feedback-regulated morph, support this view.

The researchers showed that simultaneous positive and negative regulation of renewal by diffus signals leads to emergence of dynamic behaviors, manifesting as localized growth differences. They mathematically defined conditions for phenomena like bistability, ultras, and selforganization to arise in such systems, and how they drive formation of induced or spontaneous bulges and fingers. These are basic blocks of many morphogenesis. Although patterns arise from opposing interactions, they are not Turing patterns.
Researchers conducted the largest genome-wide study to date on myopia, a common eye disorder characterized by nearsightedness, in 45,771 Europeans. They analyzed data on age of onset and identified 22 significant associations, 10 of which were novel. These associations explain 2.9% of variance in myopia onset and point to multiple mechanisms behind its development. One gene, PRSS, linked to abnormally small eyes, and another, LAMA, part of extracellular matrix, were found. Two genes, RGR and RDH, involved in regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, and two, ZIC and SP, in growth of retinal ganglion cells, were also identified. Five genes involved neuronal development were found. The study suggests complex interactions between extracellular remodeling, neuronal, and visual signals from retina underlie myopia in humans.
Researchers studied the role of feedback in the swimming dynamics of lampreys, a type of eel-like fish, to understand how it affects their movement and energy use of energy. Lampreys have a central pattern generator (CPG) circuit that controls movement and adjusts to sensory inputs from the environment. Feedback is crucial for responding to unexpected changes, but also active during steady swimming and influences the pattern. The study investigated two types of curvature-based feedback and their effects on swimming energy and movement. The CP was modeled as a chain of oscillators, with pairs representing left and right body segments, activating muscles to move the lamprey through a simulated fluid. Curvature of the body served as input to the oscillators, closing the loop. Two types of feedback were considered, consistent with experimental results on lamprey sensory receptors. Directional feedback excited or inhibited oscillators on the same side, opposite on the other, and affected duration of muscle activity. Magnitude feedback provided symmetric effect on both sides, increasing frequency and reducing energy cost when gain was high. Both types resulted in similar curvature magnitude, indicating different forms of feedback can cause distinct performance differences.
Researchers studied how different strains of HIV compete in a population and found that the first strain to colonize a population has an advantage. This strain can slow down the spread of new strains and limit the diversity of the epidemic. They created a model to simulate HIV epidemics on contact networks and tested if a second strain could spread in a population where the first strain was established. The second strain spread slower than the first and needed a 25% advantage in transmission efficiency to become dominant over decades. The effect was weaker if the second was introduced when the first was still growing. They also tested how interference mechanisms like superinfection, depletion of hubs, and one-time peak infectiousness contribute to the effect. Simulations showed a strong first advantage in HIV competition at the population level, which may explain the virus's global geography and influence the pandemic's evolution. In HIV epidemics, more transmissible strains replace less efficient ones, and the pace of this process needs to be understood. A model was developed to track competition of strains with varying transmission rates. Without specific conditions, the most transmissible strain drives others extinct, a principle from simple to complex models. The model was based on heterosexual epidemics in Africa but can be adapted to other routes and concentrated epidemics.
Researchers studied how muscle cells organize their internal structure and function at different scales, from the smallest units called sarcomeres to the entire muscle bundle. They found that the environment outside space around the cells, called the extracellular space, plays a crucial role in organizing the cell's internal framework, called the cytoskeleton. The team created a model to show how the cytoskeleton of heart muscle cells, called myocytes, organize in response to cues from the extracellular space. Experiments showed that the cytoskeleton's architecture forms through two processes: actin fibers, myofibrils, and focal adhesions, and the alignment and bundling of myofils. The study suggests a hierarchy of mechanisms regulates the cykeleton's self-organization and a positive feedback loop from the extracellular space is needed to create symmetry and polarize the contractile cytoskeleton.

The researchers also developed a computational model to mimic the assembly of sareres, where proteins assemble along actin fibers. They compared their model to other cytoskeleton assembly models and mechanics. Myofils mature in a force-dependent manner, suggesting cell contractility plays a role in polarizing the myofilar network. In non-muscle cells, cytos architecture becomes polarized with increasing traction forces. The team created a model to show myilar patterning sensitivity to extracellular space to understand the assembly and organization of the contractile apparatus in myocytes.

The study found that muscle cells depend on extracellular cues to organize myils and contraction. They hypothesized a hierarchy of mechanisms for myilar organization and tested which feature, fiber-force dependence or parallel fibers, was dominant.
Researchers are testing a bacterium called Wolbachia as a way to control the spread of dengue in mosquitoes. Wolia can infect and spread to all mosquitoes in a population, but it needs a high rate of transmission, strong incompatibility, and low cost to the host to do so. To understand how Wolia works, scientists studied its effects on mosquitoes in a lab and in the field. They found that Wolia causes incompatibility, high transmission rate, and no harm to the host. To see how urban landscapes affect mosquito survival, they released Wolia-infected mosquitoes in two areas in Rio de Janeiro and tracked them. They found that Wolia can spread in all five areas, but conditions vary greatly between sites and depend on mosquito population size. The study provides a framework for future releases of Wolia-infected mosquitoes in Rio and similar cities.
Researchers have identified a protein called JMJ703 in rice that removes a type of epigenetic modification called histone lysine methylation from histone H3. This modification, known as H3me, plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression and is involved in plant development and stress response. The study found that JMJ703 specifically removes three forms of H3me: mono, di, and tri-methyl. Without J703, rice plants have stunted growth and elongation, possibly due to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes. The researchers analyzed the structure of J703's catalytic core and found similarities with mammalian and yeast proteins that remove H3 and H36 methylation, but also unique features that interact with cofactors and methylated H3 peptide. Key residues are conserved in other H4 demethylases, suggesting specificity for H4 methylation. J703 is essential for plant cell division and elongation, demethylating Hme in vivo and vitro. Demethylation of three Hme implies J703 regulates gene expression. Phenotype caused by T-DNA and RNAi increased CK genes suggest J703 regulates hormone metabolism, different from J14 that functions in floral transition, DNA methylation, and silencing.
HIV-1 capsid is a crucial for the virus's life cycle, from reverse transcription to integration, and is targeted by multiple host and pharmacologic ligands. However, previous studies have focused on individual capsid monomers, leaving the mechanism of ligand influence unclear. Researchers found that a multi-unit interface within hexamers, not present in monomers, mediates binding to cellular cofactors NUP and CPS6 and antiviral compounds PF74 and BI-2. Each ligand anchors to a phenylalanine-glyine motif in the N-terminal domain of one monomer, with BI-2 also interacting across the N-terminal C-terminal interface of another monomer. Disassembling hexamers into monomers prevents high affinity with CPS6 and PF74 and abolishes NUP binding. The interface is dynamic, but NUP or CPS6 binding is accommodated by one conformation. NUP and CPS6 have overlapping sites, but unique interactions when mutated, perturb cofactor dependency. The study reveals multiple ligands share an interface in HIV-1 caps lost upon disassembly.
Scientists have improved the genome assembly of the mosquito Aedes aegypt, which transmits diseases like dengue fever and chikunya viruses. The mosquito's genome is large and complex, with many repetitive sequences, making it difficult to assemble. The previous assembly had 4,758 scaffolds, few of which were assigned to chromosomes. To map genes affecting disease transmission, researchers scored many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in offspring from a cross between two strains of Ae. aegypt and generated a genetic map. This revealed high rates of misassemblies, where sequences from different chromosomes were on the same scaffold. Correcting these, they assigned 60% of the genome to chromosomes and ordered scaffolds along chromosomes. Large regions of suppressed recombination around centromeres were found, up to 47% of a chromosome. A gene making Ae.egi resistant to the parasite Brugia mal was mapped, and a list of candidate genes affecting the trait was generated.
Aedes aegypt, a mosquito that transmits deng and yellow fever, is a key target for control programs in tropical countries. Most surveillance relies on traditional larval surveys, but new traps are available. A study compared four traps (BG-Sent, Adul, MosquiAP, and ovit) with larval surveys in five cities with different climates. Traps were used in 1km areas, simultaneously with larval surveys. Positivity and density were calculated and regressed against meteorological variables to show seasonal patterns. House was low in most cities, with median 0, and traps rarely null, indicating higher sensitivity than larval. Despite this, both agreed on seasonality in all cities. Mosquito seasonality was associated with temperature, not precipitation, even in areas with small temperature variation. All traps performed better than House in measuring seasonal abundance and should be considered alternatives to larval. Household surveys and trap systems are not interchangeable. Traps' properties (sensitivity, specificity) should be consistent under low and high abundances.
Researchers have studied the protein APOBECG3, a potent inhibitor of retroviruses and transposable elements, to understand how it restricts HIV-1. APOECG3 contains two cytidine deaminase domains, one of which is known to mediate cytidine deamination. By analyzing the structure of a related protein, APOEC2, they identified residues in APOG that could mediate oligomerization. They found that tyrosine and tryptan in the inactive N-terminal domain mediate APOG oligomer and its packaging into HIV-1 virions. Oligomerization is also dependent on RNA. Modeling APO onto the A2 structure showed a positive charge accumulation in a putative dimer interface. Substituting arginine at positions 24, 30, and 136 reduced virus inhibition, virion, and oligomer. APO associated less efficiently with cellular RNA, suggesting RNA occupies the charged pocket, promoting oligomer, packaging, and antiviral function.
Scientists have long sought to understand how genes and their variations contribute to complex traits, but it's been challenging due to various biological and technical reasons. Fruit flies, Drosoph melanaster, have high genetic variation and low linkage disequilibrium, allowing researchers to study the effects of multiple variants within a single locus. This study identifies the sequence polymorphisms that make up major-effect QTL alleles at the bric-br locus, which affects cuticular pigmentation. The results show that br-br alleles with large effects on pigmentation reflect the cumulative impact of polymorphisms in three regions: a promoter, tissue-specific enhancer, and Polycomb element. Analysis of allele-specific expression at the br-br locus confirms these polymorphs modulate transcription at the regulatory level. The study establishes that a QTL can act through multiple mechanisms and variation in flanking functional elements can have significant effects on transcription and phenotype. This has implications for basic and medical genomics.

 Researchers sequenced the 148 kb brac region from 94 inbred lines of D. melanaster. Multiple polymorphs in a single regulatory element of the ebony gene contribute to pigmentation differences between populations. Studies show multiple polyms contribute to protein function. This suggests accumulation of mutations at a locus may be a common mechanism of micro and macroevolutionary change. The br locus is composed of duplicated paralogs, bab1 and bab, involved in patterning adult, legs, and ovaries. Bab expression in pupal epidermis is responsible for sex pigmentation and changes have played a role in macroevolution diversification of D melan patterns. This is in contrast to Qs due to single or regulatory mutations. Analysis of a gene responsible for 100% difference between D species revealed contributions from independent regions.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, a common cause of invasive and mucosal disease in humans, has remained resilient to antibiotics and vaccines due to its ability to adapt through genetic exchange with surrounding microbes. This adaptation is controlled by a quorum sensing system triggered by extracellular accumulation of competence stimulating peptide (CSP). Researchers found that CSP stimulates production of diverse bacteriocins, which occurs through increased secretion of bacterioc pherone BlC and requires a functional competence system. A conserved motif in BlC promoter mediates upregulation by CSP, leading to activation of Bl locus. Using biofilm organisms as model, DNA exchange is enhanced by bacterin secretion, suggesting co-stimulation of bacterins with competence provides an advantage. The Bl and regulatory pathways diverged in pneumoccus ancestor but maintained connection promoting competition and adaptation by targeting various competitors while allowing DNA incorporation.

The competence system is controlled by quorum sensing regulated by extracellular CSP. The ABC complex processes and secretes CSP. Amino acid sequence preceding CSP is recognized by Com and cleaved at glycine while transported out. Strains with disrupted BlA demonstrate bacterin locus activation during competence but Bl pherone is secreted by and only during competence. Bacterin increases efficiency in dual biofilms suggesting liberation through pneumin contributes adaptability.

Pneumoc bacterin production is controlled by Bl locus like competence, stimulated by Bl pherone. Agutated pneum showed induction bacterin and competence without exogenous pherones, suggesting local density. Duration competence determined under broth conditions, mechanism may differ biofilm organisms.
Researchers have been studying how the poliovirus, a virus that causes polio, uses the cell's own machinery to make copies of itself. They found that two proteins, PC2 and SR20, work together to help the virus translate its genetic code into proteins. To understand how this process, they focused on the interaction between these two proteins. They discovered that SR20 moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected cells, where it partially localizes with PC2. This interaction is important for the virus to make copies of itself. The researchers also found that SR20 binds to PC2 on the viral RNA, helping to recruit ribosomes to translate the virus's genetic code. A mutated version of SR20 that can't bind RNA still localizes with PC2, but results in a 100-fold decrease in virus production. This suggests SR20 is crucial for the virus to make copies. The study shows how SR20 and PC2 work together to help the virus use the cell's translation machinery to make more copies of itself.
Scientists have identified a crucial amino acid in the ErbB3 protein that is essential for its function. Erb3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a key role in the development of the neural crest, a population of embryonic cells that gives rise to various cell types including glia, neurons of the peripheral and enteric nervous systems, and melanocytes of the skin and hair. Mutations in genes and pathways regulating neural crest development lead to a range of human disorders called neurocristies. To understand these processes, researchers used an N-ethyl-nitrosurea (ENU) mutagenesis screen on a mouse model with a defect in the Sox10 gene. Out of 71 lines analyzed, they found four heritable loci that altered Sox expression, called modifier of Sox10 pattern 1-4 (m1-4). In homozygous m1 embryos, Sox10ac expression was absent in cranial ganglia, cran nerves, and sympathetic chain, but other Sox-expressing cells were unaffected. The mutation was linked to a new allele of Erb3, Erb3m1, with a single amino acid substitution in the extracellular region. The ENU mutation did not alter protein expression, but impaired Er3 signaling, causing embryonic defects similar to Er3 null. Biochemical analysis showed Er3 was on the surface, but ligand-induced phosphorylation reduced by the mutation. This highlights the importance of the residue for Er3 function.
Researchers studied the factors that influence Schistosoma mansoni infection in a rural Ugandan community. They looked at how age, sex, ethnicity, and IgE (a type of immune response) affect reinfection after anti-parasite treatment. The study used a multi-disciplinary approach to account for environmental and behavioral differences in the community. They found that ethnic and sex variations in reinfection were due to cercarial exposure, not biological differences in susceptibility. Age-related reinfection was not explained by exposure, but linked to IgE and IgG to a specific antigen, which was related to resistance. The study highlights the importance of a multi-disciplinary approach in complex settings to understand population ecology and make robust conclusions.
Researchers studied the relationship between the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) and the actual number of worms in people infected with Clonorchis sinensis, a type of parasitic worm. They collected fecal samples from 60 residents in Sanche-gun, Korea, 50 positive and 10 negative for eggs, between 2006-2009. After administering prazantel, a medication to kill the worms, participants were purged and worms were collected from their feces. The number of eggs per gram of feces ranged from 0 to 65,544 and the number of worms from 1 to 114. A strong correlation was found between EP and number of worms (r= 0.681, P<0.001). Worms were recovered in 9.7% of cases with EP 1-1,000 and 73.7% with EP over 1,000. No worms were found in egg-negative subjects. The maximum egg count per worm per day was estimated 3,770 in a subject with EP 2,664 and collected 106 worms. The number of worms correlated with egg counts in Cloniasis. It's estimated that at least 110 worms are in a body with EP around 3,000 and egg per worm per day around 4,000.
Researchers have found a new way to combat fungal infections that are resistant to antifungal drugs. These infections are a growing concern, and current treatments often don't work. To find new solutions, scientists used a technique called combinatorial therapy, which targets multiple proteins at once. However, this method is limited by how much is known about the proteins involved. To overcome this, they used an unbiased approach called synthetic lethal screens to identify new targets. They tested this on a fungus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and a human pathogen Candida glata with a mutation that makes it resistant to fluconazole, an antifungal drug. Eighteen genetic mutations were found that made the fungus die when combined with the resistant mutation. One of these, histone acetylase G5, was further studied. Deleting or inhibiting G5 made the fungus die, and prevented the emergence of resistant strains. This shows that targeting synthetic lethal interactions can be a new way to treat resistant infections.
Researchers studied how the poliovirus (PV) multiplies and forms structures within cells. They found that a type of fat called phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4) appears as clusters in membranes early in the infection process. This fat is before the virus starts to replicate its genome. The team used two mutants, EG and GG, that have problems processing the protein P3, which delays the start of replication and assembly. They found that PI4 changes occur as early as 30 minutes post-infection, even with a replication inhibitor, and form tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicles appear in the perinuclear region at 3 hours post-infection, too slow to be responsible for replication delays. Delays in EG and GG were similar to PI4 remodeling, suggesting PI4 is a marker for replication organel. GG can't convert tubules to vesicles, explaining nearly 5-log reduction in virus production. The study suggests PV forms distinct structures for replication (tubules) and assembly (vesicles). The pace, spatiemporal dynamics, and efficiency of conversion may be set by P3 processing rate and capacity to yield 3 and 3 proteins.
Researchers used a multi-step strategy to find new compounds that can kill the parasite causing Chagas disease, a major health problem in Latin America. They searched a large database of available compounds and tested the most promising ones in the lab. This led to 12 non-peptide compounds that bind to the parasite's enzyme cruzain, a key target for new treatments. The binding was confirmed with X-ray crystal studies. Cruzain is similar to a human enzyme, cathepsin, linked to cancer, so the compounds were also tested against it and showed similar activity. This raises the possibility of using these compounds to fight cancer. The most potent compounds were tested on infected cells and two showed parasite-killing activity. One compound, Neimed42, was used to study the relationship between structure and activity. A key group, 2-acetamthiophene-3boxamide, was found to be essential for both enzyme and parasite killing. The compound Ne42 was 10 times more effective than a current treatment, benznidazole. A smaller version of Ne42, Ne176, was identified as a new, non-peptide, non-covalent cruzain inhibitor with potential for further development.
Researchers have developed a new DNA-based vaccine against yellow fever (YF) virus, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical areas worldwide. The current attenuated YF vaccine generates long-lasting antibodies and T-cell responses, but can have rare, sometimes fatal side effects. This study presents two non-viral DNA formulations encoding the full-length envelope protein (pFE) or full envelope fused to lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 (LFE), aiming to divert antigen presentation through major histocompatibility complex compartments. Immune responses were evaluated in C57/6 and BAL/c mice, corresponding to C57/6 and BAL/c strains. Both constructs induced strong T-cell responses against all epitopes generated by Y17 vaccine, with LFE performing best. Additionally, it stimulated high anti-Y neutralizing antibody titers comparable to 17 vaccine. Importantly, LFE conferred 100% protection against intracereally challenged mice. Results indicate LFE is an excellent candidate for further studies.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the nucleoid protein SlmA in the cholera pathogen Vibrio cholera. SlmA is a transcription activator of the chitio utilization genes, which are essential for the bacteria's survival and spread in the marine environment. These genes are encoded by the ch operon and regulated by the sensor kinase ChiS. However, the mechanism of ChiS activation was unclear. An unbiased transposon screen revealed SlmA as a regulator of the ch operon. SlmA is a member of the Tet family of proteins, which are generally repressors, not activators. In vitro, SlmA binds directly to the ch oper promoter and in vivo, this interaction is required for transcription activation and chitio utilization. Mutations disrupting SlmA's functions show DNA-binding, not nucleoidclusion, is critical for transcription activation. This study identifies a novel role for SlmA as a transcription regulator in V. cholera, in addition to its established role as a division factor.

The researchers found that SlmA is required for activation of chio genes in V. cholera and this is direct because it binds to the promoter that regulates these genes. They also showed this regulation is necessary for V. cholera growth on chio. While SlmA is an activator of the promoter, the mechanism is unclear. A SlmA mutant does not phenoc a Chi mutant, which is unable to grow on Glc as a sole carbon source. SlmA has been characterized in E. coli, but is conserved between E. coli and V. cholera. The effect of SlmA on regulation of the promoter was only uncovered by deletion or growth on chitin, which induce this locus. It may be additional cues required to uncover a role Sl-dependent regulation at genetic loci.

Vibrio-chitin interactions are important for persistence, transmission, and evolution of this human pathogen in its reservoir. The genes for ch degradation, uptake, and utilization are regulated by ChiS. Chi is repressed by chitin protein, periplasm substrate for chio ABC. The transcript may play a role in basal expression of the oper, required rapid response ch oligosacides. Tet proteins are generally repressors, but can mediate activation.
Researchers have developed a new framework for solving complex problems that arise in modeling biological systems. These problems are challenging because they involve highly nonlinear equations and many data points. The framework uses cutting-edge tools that are efficient, robust, and easy to use. It avoids repetitive simulations, enables algebraic computation of derivatives, and uses efficient solvers that exploit linear techniques. The team tested the framework on a human gut microbiome model with 156 parameters, 144 equations, and 1,704 data points, solving it in under 3 minutes. An off-the-shelf solution took over 7 hours. They also showed the framework can handle large problems with 2,352 parameters, 2,304 equations, and 20,352 points in 15 minutes. The framework is flexible and can be applied to various biological models, enabling tasks like uncertainty quantification, observability analysis, model selection, and outlier handling.
Researchers used a new technology called nCounter to study how the body's inflammatory response to West Nile virus (WNV) infection in mice. They wanted to understand how the virus spreads and how the body reacts to it. Mice were infected with WNV and their gene expression in different tissues like the spleen, lung, liver, and brain were analyzed over nine days. A kit containing 179 genes related to inflammation was used to track changes in gene expression. Protein levels of some cytokines and chemokines were also measured. Results showed that some genes like Ccl10 and Il2 were different in all tissues except the kidney. Comparing infected and non-infected mice helped separate the body's general response from specific responses to W infection. In infected spleen, C3 decreased, Il23 increased, and Il10 decreased. In lung, Il3 and M2 decreased. In liver, Stat, T2, chemines Ccl, C3, C9, C10, Il6,18, and Il1 increased. In brain, C2 and C10 increased. Gene and protein levels for C2,3,4,5 correlated with virus presence. The study showed nCounter's ability to quickly identify gene changes in mice with W infection.
An outbreak of rabies occurred in Maputo and Matola cities, Mozambique in 2014, prompting an investigation into the epidemiology, clinical features, and risk factors of human and animal bites. Fourteen human cases of rabies were detected, all with a history of dog bites, and only one of the rabid dogs was immunized. A total of 819 animal bites were registered, with 64.6% from Maputo City, and 97.8% caused by dogs, but only 27% were immunized. Factors associated with rabies were age <15, bite by stray dog, deep wound, head bite, unimmun dog, no soap use, and no post-exposure prophylaxis. Implementation of control measures for rab is poor in Maputo and Matola, where cases were strongly associated with stray and unvaccinated dogs and irregular post-exposure measures. The study aimed to determine clinical and epidemiological features of rab cases, risk for developing rab, and animal bites in Map and Matola, contributing to formulating recommendations for rab control in Mozambique. This is the first investigation of rab outbreak and epidemi profile bites in Mozambique, where procedures are irregular, resulting in frequent outbreaks. Rab is a major cause for underinvestment in control in countries, including Mozambique, with high burden in sub-Saharan Africa.
Researchers have identified a new gene, SCN9, as a potential cause of febrile seizures (FS) in a large family with significant linkage to chromosome 2q. They found a mutation in a highly conserved amino acid, p.NY, in the SCN9 gene in 21 affected family members, which was absent in ethnically matched control chromosomes. To confirm the role of SCN9 in FS, they introduced the mutation into mice using homologous recombination and found reduced seizure thresholds and increased kindling rates compared to wild-type mice. In a collection of 92 unrelated FS patients, they found highly conserved Nav.7 missense variants in 5% of patients. One child with FS later developed Drav syndrome, a severe myoclonic epilepsy, and sequenced SCN1, associated with Drav, and found a heterozygous frameshift. Analysis of 109 Drav patients yielded 9 Nav.7 missense variants, 8% of patients, in conserved amino acids. Six Drav patients with SCN miss variants had either miss or site SCN1 mutations or no SCN1 mutations. This study suggests SCN plays a role in human epileps, both as cause FS and partner SCN1 mutations.
Researchers have been trying to understand how complex shapes in living tissues form through growth. One idea is that growth happens in certain directions due to stresses in the tissue, but another is that directions are specified by molecular signals. A new approach, called the Polarised Tissue (PT) framework, treats tissue as a material where genetic factors interact and signals propagate. Polarity is established by signals that spread through the tissue and are anchored in regions controlled by genes. Growth rates parallel or perpendicular to polarity are specified by a network. The resulting growth depends on how patterns interact within the tissue's constraints, leading to features like curvature not specified by the network. This feedback influences local arrangements and orientations, allowing complex shapes from simple rules. Asymmetries emerge through polarity interactions. The PT framework was applied to a growing flower and can be tested by simulation. Combinatorial interactions between orientations and growth, a feature of polarity systems, have been used to generate observed shapes.
Researchers studied how the immune system's CD8+ T cells respond to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in the early stages of infection. They found that these cells put pressure on different parts of the virus's genome, leading to mutations that help the virus evade the immune system. Some studies showed that these mutations take longer to emerge and spread as time goes on, a pattern known as the escape rate decrease (ER). The team wanted to know if interference between these mutations affects their rates and if it's a reason for ER. They created a model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination, and found that interference between beneficial mutations can cause ER. They also found that the number of locations and recombination rates affect ER, which can be explained by the decline of escape rates over time. The team found that the observed ER pattern in infected individuals is consistent with both interference and no interference. Their results suggest that interference should be considered when analyzing HIV mutations, but current methods can't overcome the challenge of estimating effects due to the nature of competition between mutations.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the effectiveness of chemotherapy in treating non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL) patients. The model takes into account various factors such as cancer cell growth, heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance. It uses data from two points in time, before and during treatment, to estimate the effect of the tumor environment and cell repopulation on treatment outcome. The model was tested on 13 patients with NSCL who received cisplatin with gemcitab, vinlb, or docetax in neoadjuvant context. The results showed that growth rate and fraction diagnosis are key features for accurate estimates. The model provides a framework for estimating in-vivo cell killing of chemotherapies. Correlation with molecular profiles could lead to personalized predictions.
Researchers studied how bacteria in biofilms develop resistance to antibiotics. Biofilms are communities of bacteria that stick to surfaces and are hard to kill with antibiotics. They found that some bacteria in biofilms are more resistant to the antibiotic fluoroquinolofloxacin than others. To understand this, they used a technique to randomly change the DNA of bacteria and found that those that couldn't make certain amino acids were more resistant to the antibiotic. When these bacteria were starved of amino acids, they became even more resistant. The researchers also found that the SOS response, a stress response to DNA damage, was key to this resistance. When bacteria were starved of amino or carbon, the SOS response made them more resistant to the antibiotic. However, this wasn't due to a known toxin-antitoxin system. The resistance increased with age of the biofilm and was also dependent on the SOS response. The study shows that stress and lack of nutrients in biofilms can make them more resistant to antibiotics.
Researchers have discovered a key player in the process by which the malaria parasite Plasium falcumeroites invades human red blood cells. The parasite uses tiny organelles called micronemes to attach to and enter the cells, and a molecule called cAMP helps trigger the release of these organelles. When the parasite is exposed to the low potassium levels found in blood, it activates an enzyme that raises cAMP levels, which in turn activates a protein that regulates the micron release. The researchers also found that cAMP helps control the parasite's calcium levels, which is also necessary for the release. This discovery provides new targets to stop the parasite's growth and prevent malaria.
Strongyloides stercis, a soil-transmitted threadworm, is one of the most neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) worldwide. A review of 20 years of studies on its global prevalence in populations and risk groups was conducted. A literature search was performed on PubMed articles from 1989 to 2011, including those with information on infection prevalence. A meta-analysis was done to get country-specific estimates and compare odds in risk groups, accounting for diagnostic sensitivities. 354 studies from 78 countries were included, 62.4% community-based, 34.2% hospital, and 11% refugee/immigrant. World maps show data. Many African, Asian, and South American poor countries lack S.ercis information. Meta-analysis showed association with HIV/alcoholism and Sercis (OR 2.17, CI 1.18-4.01; OR 6.69, CI 1.47-3.8). High prevalence in selected countries and regions. Sercis prominent in risk groups. Adequate info lacking from many countries, but shows Serc not to be neglected. Further socio-economic and ecological assessments and global health integration are needed.
Researchers have long known that noise at the cellular level plays a crucial role in circadian rhythms, influencing how groups of cells synchronize with external cues and generating internal rhythms. However, few studies have investigated how perturbations affect stochastic noise, mainly due to the difficulty in measuring it directly. This study shows that the rate of population-level bioluminescence can serve as an accurate measure of overall noise, applicable to high-throughput circadian screens. Using fibroblast data, they found that higher single-cell noise results in faster population damping. Small molecule modulators can change damping in a dose-dependent fashion, explained by single-cell noise using a model. The method was applied to a genome-wide siRNA screen, revealing noise altered independently from period and phase. The unperturbed clock is likely optimized for robust rhythms, few perturbations increasing amplitude and lowering noise. This study highlights the importance of considering circadian perturbations on stochastic, especially for small-molecule therapeutics.
Researchers have been searching for new ways to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria by targeting proteins involved in cell division. One such protein, Fts, is a promising target. An inhibitor, PC723, has shown activity against Staphylococcus aureus in lab and animal tests, but its effects on other bacteria are unclear. To understand how PC723 binds to FZ, the researchers used a method called Pocket to analyze the 3D structure of the binding site. They found that the environment around the binding site differs between species, especially in bacteria not from the Staphlocus genus. Simulations showed PC723 prefers to bind Stylocus FZ when it's bound to a molecule called GTP, and that FZ polymerization can enhance binding. These results suggest that the binding pocket can vary across species, genetic changes, and states, which is important for developing FZ inhibitors. This study shows how analyzing the 3D environment of a drug-binding site can reveal properties and mechanisms of drug-protein interactions. The findings that PC723 has high affinity for Styloc species but not others has implications for its use as a future therapeutic.
Scientists have discovered a new details about how a protein called LEDGF helps the lentiviruses, like HIV, to integrate their genetic material into human cells. LEDGF binds to a protein called lentiviral integrase, which is essential for the virus to replicate. The researchers created a 3D structure of the part of lentiviral integrase and LEDGF, showing how they interact. They found that certain parts of the integrase and LEDGF have opposite charges, which helps them stick together. This interaction is important for the virus to integrate its genetic material into the cell's DNA. The team also made a mutant lentiv integrase that only works with a modified LEDGF, not the normal one. This discovery could lead to new ways to stop the virus by targeting LEDGF.
Researchers studied how cancer cells in different organs change over time and how these changes affect tumor growth. They found that cancer cells inherit traits from their original cells that determine how they behave and grow. These traits can change due to genetic and epigenetic mutations, making some cells more fit and aggressive. The study used a computer model to track cancer stem cells, which can start and sustain tumors, and looked at traits like migration, death, division, and telomere length. They found that cell proliferation, or growth, is the strongest factor in tumor growth. More growth leads to more non-stem cancer cells that compete with stem cells, while less growth allows stem cells to divide more. The stem cell population becomes diverse, with some areas dormant and others aggressive. A single tumor sample only shows a small part of the possible phenotypes.
Researchers studied how novel infectious diseases emerge in humans, focusing on the role of adaptation and spatial heterogeneity within the population. They used mathematical models to describe different scenarios of adaptation and emergence, calculating the probability of introduction and waiting time for a successful event. The study found that for typical connections between communities, spatial heterogeneity has a weak effect on outbreak size and emergence. For example, a village connected to a city by 10 commuters a day is effectively part of the city in terms of emergence and outbreak distribution. Empirical data showed most communities are at least this interconnected. For plausible ranges, effects of heterogeneity are likely dominated by host biology adaptation. The study suggests only remote communities are subject to epidemiological isolation. Factors like human patterns and host heterogeneity also shape risk and speed of emergence, but the study focused on spatial structure of the host population. The biology of the pathogen determines emergence and outbreak sizes according to reproductive number. A threshold exists where heterogeneity doesn't matter. Previous research showed effect of heterogeneity depends on interconnectivity allowing spread between communities. This study provides new insights without specifying infectious migrating hosts. Analytical results were validated with stochastic simulations of village-city models, an example of interconnected communities.
Researchers studied the migration patterns of the influenza A virus in wild birds in North America over a 34-year period. They collected and sequenced 287 avian influenza virus samples from migratory birds in Alberta, Canada and Delaware, USA. The goal was to understand how the virus spreads between different bird populations and how it affects humans and livestock. The study used a statistical framework to test hypotheses of viral migration and genetic patterns. Results showed that birds in Delaware do not contribute significantly to the virus diversity in North America, but those in Alberta do. The virus can be restricted to specific flyways short-term, but long-term persistence is independent of migration between populations. Analysis of long-term data helps develop predictive models for pandemic preparedness and protection.
Researchers have developed a new type of antibody, called MAb S/1391, that can protect against many different types of influenza viruses. This antibody targets a specific site on the surface of the virus called hemagglutinin (HA) that is shared among various subtypes of the virus. MAb S/1 was tested against 16 different subtypes of the virus and found to be effective against many of them, including H1, H2, H3, H, H, and H subtypes. The antibody blocked the virus from attaching to cells and infecting them, which is a key step in preventing the spread of the virus. Mutations in the virus that made it resistant to the antibody were found to have changes in three specific amino acids on the surface of the HA. A computer model showed these amino acids formed a new shape on the surface of the HA near where the virus attaches to cells. When mice were given the antibody, it provided protection against different types of the virus. This study suggests that antibodies that target a common site on the virus can provide protection against different types of the virus and could be useful for treatment.
Researchers conducted a three-year study to see if treating Strongyloides stercoral infection with ivermectin could control the infection in an Australian Aboriginal community. They tested 259 adults in a remote community in northern Australia and found that 35.3% had the infection. After treatment, the infection fell to 5.8%. The study showed that using a lower ELISA threshold for diagnosis was valid in this setting, but some people still tested positive despite treatment. After three years, only 1.4% had the infection, showing the treatment was effective. The study suggests that controlling Strongloides sterc infection in Aboriginal adults can be done by finding and treating those infected with iverectin, following current guidelines. The communities in northern Australia have high infection rates, up to 40%, andivermect is the accepted treatment. However, there's debate on whether to test and eliminate the infection widely. The study was in three communities in Western Australia's Kimberley region, isolated with the nearest hospital 800km away. Before, there was no systematic testing or treatment. The study used ELISA to diagnose, as parasitological tests were difficult and less sensitive. The goal was to see if finding and treating infected people could control the infection. No data on symptoms or health improvements were collected.
Researchers studied how different strains of prion, a misfolded protein that causes prion diseases, interact with each other. They hypothesized that long-incubation strains, which take a long time to develop, can block short-incation strains, which develop quickly. However, they found that co-infecting animals with different long-incation strains didn't show evidence of interference. To rule out the possibility that this was due to failing to infect the same cells, they used protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain (PMCA) assay, which showed both strains amplified independently. This suggests the lack of interference is not due to failing to target the same cells, but an inherent property of the strains. Longation strains had relatively high levels of Pr, a protein needed for prion formation, compared to shortation strains. This changes the understanding of prion interactions and implications for interspecies transmission and emergence of new pr strains from a mixture. Prion interference occurs when Pr is limiting, and strains compete for it. Overexpression of Pr can lead to emergence of new strains not seen at normal levels.
A new model has been proposed to compare the roles of ordered and disordered proteins in alloster regulation. It was thought that disorder is favorable for alloster coupling, but the new model shows that order transition has a higher probability than disorder transition in alloster. This suggests a complicated role of disordered regions in regulatory proteins. An equation for maximal alloster coupling is also obtained, showing that stable or unstable states are unfavorable for alloster, which can help design alloster drugs. The Ensemble Allost Model (EAM) previously explained why disordered proteins are prevalent in alloster, but lacks order transition. The Monodors Model (MWC) considers order transition but not disorder. A comprehensive model combining both shows order-disorder and order transitions reveals order transition is less competitive in alloster, especially strong alloster. The prevalence of disordered proteins in alloster is more complicated than thought. A new view of alloster based on protein structure landscape shows ligand stabilizes specific states and shifts conformation. The EAM model uses this view to explain disordered alloster. Disordered proteins are prevalent in alloster due to advantage, not only alloster capacity. Combining data and bioinformatics can compare ordered and disordered importance alloster. It's unclear if disordered are more or less prevalent alloster than ordered proteins.
Researchers have investigated the role of β-caten in prostate development and cancer. βaten is a protein essential for many developmental processes and has been linked to cancer in various tissues, including prostate. However, its role in human prostate cancer is unclear. The study used genetic studies in mice to understand βaten's role in normal and cancerous prostate. They found that epithelial βaten is required for embryonic prostate growth but dispensable in adult. During development, βaten controls the number of progenitors in epithelial buds and regulates genes, including c-Myc and Nk3.1. Deletion of βaten in a model of castration-resistant prostate showed it is dispensable for progression. Complementary experiments showed βaten promotes squamous epith formation during development, even without androgens. βaten overexpression with Pten loss drove invasive carcinoma with squamous metaplas. These studies show βaten is essential for prostate and high levels drive squamous differentiation. They also show βaten can promote cancer in a relevant model.
Researchers conducted a study in Ethiopia to understand how to obtain informed consent for a biomedical study in a low-income setting with a high disease burden. They explored factors affecting information and communication during the consent process. The study involved focus groups and in-depth interviews with patients, non-patients, community workers, NGO staff, and leaders. They found that using everyday language, addressing participants' expectations, and presenting information techniques impacted comprehension. Approaching patients via trusted individuals and community sensitization were optimal. Poverty, lack of treatment, and trust in the NGO were barriers to genuine consent. Researchers should evaluate consent processes to provide information and support decision-making on a study-by-study basis.

The community believed podoiosis is genetic, using terms like "passed from parents and grandparents" and "blood" to express disease. Participants didn't favor written consent forms. Fieldworkers thought monetary compensation might induce participation due to poverty, stressing "true voluntiness" should be part of the process. Researchers should approach patients through intermediaries like MPA fieldworkers, as they're respected. Local gatherings, group discussions are common for information. International guidelines like purpose, researchers, affiliations, sample use, confidentiality, and findings were important in the consent process.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study how immune cells called T-lymphocytes proliferate in the thymus and spleen, which are crucial for the body's immune system. They used a technique called single-cell flow cytometry to track the cells' division and DNA content. The model, based on ordinary differential equations, simulated the cells' behavior over time, allowing them to estimate proliferation rates and cell cycle durations. The study found that T-lymph proliferation is highly heterogeneous and depends on the cells' genetic background, age, and differentiation stage in the thym and sple. In young mice, T-lymph from FVB strain had lower proliferation rates than those from C57/BL6 mice. The model also showed that genetic and age influence T-ly dynamics from early in thym to final maturation in sple. The study provides a detailed assessment of T-ly proliferation in subpopulations along differentiation from thym to sple and aging. It's the first to show that genetic and age drive a "signature" of proliferation and cycle durations according to T cell stage and lineage.
Scientists have discovered a new way to study a type of genetic mutation that causes diseases in humans by creating a similar mutation in mice. These mutations occur in the DNA of mitochondria, the energy-producing parts of cells, and affect the tRNA, which helps make proteins. The researchers found a mutation in a mouse that mimics a human disease-causing mutation and studied its effects. They discovered that the mutation causes the tRNA to fold abnormally, preventing it from being charged with an amino acid, leading to increased production of reactive oxygen and a compensatory increase in energy production. This can explain why some people with the mutation don't show symptoms while others do. This mechanism is different from mutations in protein-coding genes, which can't be compensated by increased energy production. The study suggests that mutations in tRNA can be fixed in two steps, one at a time, not all at once.
Researchers studied how genes on the X chromosome are expressed in human cells with three sets of chromosomes (triploid) compared to cells with two sets (diploid). They found that genes on the X chromosome are not doubled in cells with two active X's, but increased in cells with one active X. This suggests a mechanism adjusts gene expression based on the number of active X's and autosomes. However, not all genes follow this rule, and some are expressed similarly in both triploid and diploid cells. A subset of genes' expression is proportional to the number of autosomes. The study found no change in autosomal gene expression in triploid versus diploid cells, indicating autosomes are not affected. In trip cells with one active X, X expression is increased, possibly due to an epigenetic mechanism sensing the X/autosome ratio.
A widely used measure of evolutionary pressure on proteins is the ratio of substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites, known as dN/d. This measure was originally developed for distantly diverged sequences, where differences represent substitutions fixed along independent lineages. However, it's often applied to sequences from a single population, where differences represent segregating polymorphisms. Researchers studied the expected d/d ratio for samples from a single population and found it's relatively insensitive to selection. The hallmark of positive selection, d/d>1, is violated within a population. The relationship between selection and d/d doesn't follow a monotonic function, making it impossible to infer pressures from d/d. This has implications for interpreting d/d measurements among population-genetic samples. The relationship between selection and d/d is different for samples from a single population compared to divergent lineages. Standard tests for selection based on d are sensitive to divergent lineage assumption violations. In a single population, differences represent polymorphisms, not fixation events. Understanding the relationship between selection and d/d for single samples is crucial. Simulations confirmed theoretical analysis of d/d. The relationship between selection and d/d is described by Equation 2 for divergent lineages. However, within a population, the relationship is different. Negative selection has a relatively insensitive d/d ratio, while divergent lineages produce extreme d values. This has implications for inferring positive selection based on d among conspecific samples. Even independently evolving populations, d's power to detect selection is low when most sites evolve purifying.
Scientists have long sought to understand how natural selection shapes genetic variation within and between species. Studies have shown that genetic differences within species are reduced at sites under selection, but its effect on differences between species is unclear. Researchers investigated whether selection affects divergence between closely and distantly related species. They found that divergence between closely related species, like humans and primates, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively with recombination. Divergence between distantly related species, like humans and rodents, is also negatively correlated with functional and positively with background selection. These patterns persist after accounting for confounding factors. Coalescent models show that selection in the ancestral population can explain a large proportion of variance in divergence, generating the correlations. The study reveals that selection can indirectly affect divergence between both closely and distantly related species, contrary to previous intuition. While direct purifying selection may drive some patterns, it would require more of the genome to be under selection than believed. The findings have implications for understanding genomes and interpreting genetic variation.
Researchers have found that the CK2 kinase plays a crucial role in regulating the stability and activity of the CLOCK (CLK) protein in the fruit fly circadian oscillator. CLK is a key component of the circadian clock that controls the expression of genes involved in daily rhythms. The study shows that CK2 phosphorylates and stabilizes CLK, reducing its activity. This is surprising because CK1, another kinase, promotes CLK degradation. The findings suggest that CK2 and CK1 have opposing effects on CLK, stabilizing and destabilizing it, respectively. This balance is important for proper circadian function. The study also found that downregulating CK activity decreases phosphorylation of CLK and increases expression of PER and TIM, two proteins that inhibit CLK activity. This indicates that CK2 inhibits CLK degradation while reducing its activity. The research identifies CK2 as the first kinase to regulate CLK in Drosila, and suggests it may play a key role in setting the circadian rhythm. The circadian oscillations are found in many organisms and governed by feedback loops of transcription factors that activate their inhibitors. In Drosila, CLK and CY activate PER and TIM at the end of the day, with CLK showing robust oscillations in phosphorylation levels. The study aimed to determine if CK was involved in CLK phosphorylation and its effect on circadian function.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, interacts with its invertebrate host Rhodnius prolix midgut. Researchers investigated whether cruzain, a cystine peptase, plays a role in this interaction. They treated T cruz epastigotes with anti-cruain antibodies and a panel of cystine peid inhibitors and measured adhesion to R. prolix midut ex vivo. All treatments, except CA-OM, decreased adhesion. Cystatin reduced adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. Comparison among T cruz isolates showed G, with low cruzain, adhered less than D28 and Bre. Transgenic epastotes overexpressing endogenous cruzain inhibitor chag, with low cruzain, adhered 73% less than wild-type. Adhesion was partially restored by exogenous cruzain. In vivo experiments, low ch parasites adhered less than wild-type after insect passage. Expression of cruzain increased drastically. This study shows cruzain contributes to T interaction with insect for the first time.
Researchers have identified 20 genes in the nematode worm Caenorhabitis elegans that can suppress a mutant form of a protein called cytoplasm dyin, which is essential for cell division. Cytoplasm dyin is a motor protein that moves along microtubules, helping to separate chromosomes and move to the right place during cell division. It also helps move vesicles and organelles around the cell. The researchers used a technique called RNA interference to reduce the function of many genes in the worm and found 20 that can suppress the mutant cytoplasm dyin. Some of these genes are not essential for the worm's survival, but when reduced, they can prevent the mutant cytoplasm dy from causing problems. The researchers also found that some of these genes, including two light chains of cytopl dy, go to the same places in the cell as the heavy chain of cytopl dy. This suggests they might be part of the same complex. Reducing one of these light chains can also stop the heavy chain from working. The researchers also found 29 genes that, when reduced, can prevent problems not only in cytopl dy but also in other essential processes. They conclude that some non-essential genes can help cytopl function during cell division.
In the ciliate Paramecium tetra, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) drive programmed genome rearrangements (PGR) during somatic differentiation. The germline nucleus is transmitted to the progeny, but the somatic nucleus, essential for gene expression, is destroyed and a new somatic nucleus differentiates from a copy of the germline. In Paramec tetra, the somatic nucleus development involves massive GR, including the elimination of at least 45,000 germl sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences, IES). I excision proceeds through a cut-and-close mechanism: domestic transposase PigMac is essential for DNAavage and DSB at excision involves Ligase IV, a component of non-homous endjoining (NHE) pathway. To understand how DNAavage and DSB are coordinated during GR, researchers focused on Ku, the actor of HE-mediated repair. Two Ku70 and Ku80 paralogs are encoded in the genome of P. tetra: Ku70 and Ku80 are produced during sexual processes and localize in developing somatic nucleus. RNA interference shows the development-specific Ku/Ku80 heterodimer is essential for recovery of functional somatic nucleus. Strikingly, PigMac-dependent DNAavage is abolished at IES in cells depleted Ku80, resulting IES retention in somatic genome.
Researchers studied the early stages of prion disease in mice to understand how it affects the brain before symptoms appear. They focused on hippocampal CA1 neurons, which are crucial for memory and learning. They used a technique to isolate these neurons from infected mice and analyzed their gene expression over time. They found that genes in these neurons are dynamic, with distinct phases of activity. A cluster of genes changed early in disease, returning to normal or reversing later. This cluster includes genes related to N-methyl-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor and neuroprotective pathways. Genes for neuronal and dendrite development also changed, leading to a decline in synaptic proteins. MicroRNAs like mi-132, mi-124, mi-16, mi-26, mi-29, and mi-140 followed similar patterns. This study is the first to describe preclinical response of hippocal neurons to prion. Findings suggest prion stimulates a response, mediated by NMD receptor, promoting survival and remodelling, but terminated before symptoms appear. This points to a critical juncture in disease.
Researchers have created a computer model, called a Petri net, to study how the body's immune response to a parasite called Leishmania donani, which causes a disease called visceral leishiasis. The model simulated how immune cells, called granulomas, form in the liver to fight the parasite and eliminate it. The model was tested with data from experiments on mice and showed it accurately predicted the progression of the disease and changes in the granomas over time. It also revealed a new level of diversity in the granomas' ability to fight the parasite. By simulating the effect of a protein called IL-10, which helps regulate the immune response, the model showed that IL-10 produced by a type of immune cell called Kupffer at the center of the granoma plays a key role in controlling the parasite load. The model doesn't account for IL-10's effects outside the granoma, like on T cell differentiation in other tissues, which could affect the quality and quantity of T cells entering the granoma. Data from mouse studies and human cases of leishias point to a role of T cell cytokines in maintaining balance during disease and granomatous inflammation as a sign of protective immunity. T cells are key to fighting Leish and their depletion in the model led to high parasite burden and non-healing infection, as seen in T-deficient mice.
Researchers have viewed the transcriptional machinery of genes as a computational device with transcription factors as inputs and expression levels as output. They asked what kinds of computations are possible and found that simple kinetic models of transcription regulation can approximate arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as equality and inequality. This contrasts with other studies that emphasize digital notions of computation in biological networks. The accuracy and precision of these approximations depend on different parameters and are tunable. Networks of "arithmetic" genes can be combined to accomplish more complicated computations by designing a network that detects significant elevations in a time-vary signal. Approximating analytic functions can be achieved by allowing multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter. This is important for interpreting naturally occurring networks and designing synthetic ones. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that "arithmetic" genes can be combined to compute sophisticated functions. An example is a network that tracks the mean and standard deviation of a time-vary signal and detects when the signal is significantly elevated. A model of a gene regulated by a single transcription factor with multiple binding sites on the promoter is also considered. Simple models demonstrate arithmetic computations at the level of transcription regulation. Other functions like exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions can be computed by combinations of arithmetic. However, this would be energetically wasteful and require many genes. A more efficient approach is to approximate directly using complicated machinery.
Researchers in Brazil sequenced the genomes of the Chikungunya virus (CHV) from a recent outbreak in the Northeast region and found that two genotypes, Asian/Caribbean and ECSA, are cocirculating in the area. This is the first time these genotypes have been found together in the same region. The study also found evidence of simultaneous infection by both genotypes in six clinical samples, suggesting coinfection might be more common than thought in highly endemic areas. Chikunya virus is an RNA virus from the Togaviridae family transmitted by mosquitoes and causes febrile illness, Chikunya fever, associated with severe outcomes. It arrived in Brazil in 2014 through two introductions: Asian/Caribbean genotype in North and ECS in Northeast. Both genotypes established urban cycle among naive populations, causing outbreaks in Americas. The study used an in-house Next-Generation Sequencing (GS) protocol to detect multiple CHV genotypes from clinical samples. The results show both genotypes expanded their range, reaching cocirculation in Northeast Brazil. Future efforts to understand CHV epidemiology should consider coinfection by different genotypes in population.
Bacteria acquire new DNA from their environment through a process called horizontal gene transfer, which increases their genetic diversity and helps them colonize new niches, including the human host. However, it's unclear how this new DNA interacts with the bacterial cell's regulatory networks. The protein H-NS is a global regulator that targets both horizontally acquired and core genes, silencing their expression in response to external stimuli like osmolarity and temperature. Researchers found that HNS differentially modulates core and horizontally acquired DNA. For example, the plasmid R27-encoded HNS protein evolved to silence horizontally acquired genes without interfering with core regulation. In contrast, chromosomal H requires a helper protein, Hha, to silence horizontally acquired DNA, while core genes are modulated by HNS homomers. The presence of H-like proteins is unique to Enterobacteraceae and conjugative plids encoding HNS variants have only been found in this family. The HNS system in Enterobacteria has unique features, allowing it to selectively modulate core and horizontally DNA. This may help maintain horizontally acquired DNA silent and give bacteria an advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization.
Scientists have studied the genetic makeup of three types of Leishmania parasites, which cause different diseases in humans, to understand how they interact with their hosts. They found that most genes are similar across the three species, but a few are different. They looked at which of these different genes are active in the parasite's "intracellular" stage, which causes disease, and if similar genes are active differently in different hosts. Using special microarrays, they confirmed that all different genes are active in the intracellular stage, but only a few are regulated at the RNA level. In a large study of one species, Leish, they found that about 9% of genes are regulated during its life cycle, similar to other Leish species. Comparing gene profiles between species confirmed that Leish undergo little regulation but identified conserved genes are regulated differently in hosts. They also looked if host immunity affects parasite expression by comparing RNA profiles in Leish from normal or immunocompromised mice. While parasite spread is enhanced in immunocompromised mice, RNA profiles are unchanged. This suggests Leish are adapted for intracellular survival and don't change gene expression much. Factors contributing to virulence and pathogenicity may be few different genes or regulation of conserved genes, subject to translation or post-translational controls.
Researchers have developed a new test, called LPhimer, to detect a parasite called Amphimer that causes a disease in humans and animals in tropical areas of Ecuador. The current method to diagnose this disease is by looking for eggs in stool, but it's not very sensitive and can be confused with other parasites. The new test, Limer, targets a specific part of the parasite's DNA and can detect as little as 1 picogram of DNA. It was tested on 44 stool samples from areas where the parasite is common, and was able to detect 25 samples that had the parasite. The test's sensitivity and specificity were 76.67% and 80.77%, respectively. This is the first specific and sensitive test for this parasite in stool samples. It has potential to be used in areas where resources are limited and can help diagnose and monitor the disease.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called Ykt in the process of autophagy in fruit flies. Autophagy is a way cells get rid of damaged or unwanted parts. Ykt is a type of SNARE protein that helps fuse autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autolys. Without Ykt, autophagosomes build up and can't fuse with lysosomes. This leads to problems for the cell. The researchers found that Ykt localizes to lysosomes and autagosomes and forms a complex with Sy17 and Snap. However, V7 can outcompete Y from this complex. Overexpressing V7 rescues the defect caused by Y loss of function. A mutant Y with a change in the zeroionic layer of Y6 retains normal autagic activity and restores viability. Both Y and V are required for autag-lys fusion and are mutually exclusive in the Sy17-Snap complex. This suggests V is involved in membrane fusion and Y acts as a non-conventional SN in this process.
Researchers have studied how the bacterium Haemophilus influenza (NTH) resists the effects of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced by the human body to fight infection. TH is a common inhabitant of the nasal mucosa but can cause infections in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The bacterium has a protein called Sap that helps it resist AMPs, but the mechanism was unknown. The researchers found that Sap binds to AMP and is necessary for TH to be virulent in the body. They also showed that Sap delivers AMP to the inner membrane for transport into the cytoplasm where they are broken down. This is a new way for TH to avoid the body's defense. AMPs are amphipathic, cationic molecules that target bacterial membranes and cause cell death. TH must defend against AMPs to become a pathogen. The body produces AMP in response to infection and altered expression can affect colonization. The researchers previously showed that β-defin controls TH colonization in a model of disease. They neutralized β-def via antibody to assess AMP contribution to TH levels. Defins and cathelicin are abundant in neutrophils, epithelium, and secreted by lung and trache epithelium. AMP limit bacterial colonization of mucosal surfaces. This is the first evidence that Sap contributes to virulence by protecting from AMP lethality. The researchers monitored Sap-AMP in intact cells and found a new mechanism of inner transport of AMP via Sap to cytoplasm for degradation.
Researchers studied how the protein MarA, a key regulator of antibiotic resistance in E. coli, controls its downstream targets. They found that its short lifespan affects how it coordinates these targets. Mar has a short lifespan of 1-3 minutes due to a protease activity. It regulates 60 genes involved in antibiotic resistance, including efflux pumps and stress proteins. This short lifespan is rare in bacteria, so the researchers wondered why it's useful. They used CRISPR to change Mar's lifespan and found that a longer lifespan increases coordination between genes, but at a slower rate. A shorter lifespan allows for more responsive and agile signaling, but less coordination.
Researchers previously found that mice lacking the enzyme MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MK-2) were more susceptible to infection with the parasite Leishmania mexicana. This was due to increased Arginase-1 levels and reduced NO activity in their macrophages, as well as a diminished TH1 response. In a new study, mice lacking MK-2 were infected with Leishmania major, a different parasite, and surprisingly showed a similar healing response to wild-type mice in terms of lesion size and parasite numbers. Analysis of immune responses showed a reduced TH1 response in MK- mice with lower parasite-specific IgG levels, lower IFN-γ and TNF-α producing CD4 and CD8 T cells, and lower stimulated spleen IFNγ production. However, MK- mice also had reduced IL-4 levels in spleen and lymph node cells and parasite-specific IgG in serum, indicating a general cell hypo-responsiveness. The TH1/TH balance was unchanged in MK mice compared to wild-type. Although MK- macrophages were more permissive to L growth than wild-type macrophages, LPS/IF-γ was equally effective at controlling growth in MK- and wild-type macroages. No change in disease phenotype was observed in MK mice.
Researchers have studied how the pancreas develops its network of ducts, which carry digestive enzymes to the small intestine. Unlike other glands, the pancreas doesn't follow a typical branching pattern. Instead, its ducts form a mesh, then a treelike structure. This process is not well understood, so the team quantified properties at different stages. They found the pancreas has stereotypic traits at each stage and changes as it matures to optimize delivery to the intestine. Using computer modeling, they broke down development into simple rules, likely conserved in other glands. Early network formation is explained by random connections and new ducts forming. Later, the network prunes based on fluid flow to the intestine.

The pancreas' branches differ between mice, but its structure is stereic at each stage and changes as it matures. Observations were condensed into principles and simulated (Fig 4). The network has stereic properties between E12.5 and E.18.5. The transition from mesh to treel structure is reflected in changing properties. The duct system has stereic traits at each stage and remodeling can be quantified. Modeling deconstructed main steps into simple rules. Early formation from E.10 to E.12.5 is explained by noisy, redundant formation of new ducts. However, how ducts form the network is unclear. Remodeling from plex to treel is less understood. Villenor and colleagues provided insight with anatomical description [12]. They showed the pancreas might be more stereic than believed and identified trends in branches.

This work reveals new features of development. The organ is likely relevant to glands with micumen, like saliv and glands that secrete fluid. Proposed rules differ from deterministic branching or random in mammary.
Researchers have mapped the structural and dynamic features of kines motor proteins, which drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformation changes that mediate movement along microtubules. They analyzed 114 experimental structures and used molecular simulations to identify distinct conformations and their conversion mechanism. Three conformation clusters were found: ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5-inhibitor bound. These differ in key elements' orientation, notably microtule binding α-α5, loop subdomain and α2-β-4β-β-7 motor tip. Group membership didn't correlate with nucleotide state, but with necker orientation. Simulations showed all three states sample majorlogically observed conformations, with differences in coupling dist sites. In ATP bound, necker, loop, and α-5 sub display motions absent in AD bound. Dissection indicates communication network between active site, microule interface, and necker via loop and loop 13. Simulations show mutations G325 and G326 in loop reduce flexibility and disrupt couplings. Results indicate ATP and AD conformations are intrinsically accessible regardless of nucleotide, supporting a model where necker docking tightens microule and nucleotide regions. Simulations highlight critical conformation changes and alloster coupling between dist sites.
Researchers have developed a new approach to interpret bioluminescent data from the Lux system, a gene reporter used to measure gene expression. The Lux system is fast, sensitive, and non-destructive, and can be used in various cells, including eukaryotic and whole animals, without euthanasia. However, interpreting biolumines data is limited because biolumcence is different from gene expression due to nonlinear and molecular dynamics of the system. The new approach uses a mathematical model of Lux activity, including LuxAB, LuxC, and Fre, with improved mechanisms for reactions and protein synthesis and turn-over. The model is calibrated with data from Photorhabus lumcens, the source of modern Lux reporters, and literature data for Lux. Importantly, it shows evidence for previously unreported inhibition of the Lux reaction. Simulations show biolumcent profiles can differ from gene expression, with peaks of light output similar to some experimental data. By incorporating the model into a Bayesian scheme, promoter activity can be inferred from biolumcence. Examples show a decrease in biolum would be switching off the promoter, and increase biolum would longer expression. This approach benefits users of Lux technology.
Researchers have discovered the structure of Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA) in complex with a molecule called G3, a potential inhibitor of the virus that causes hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. This discovery helps understand how G3 interacts with the virus and how it can block its replication. The team used computer simulations to test two new molecules, NLD and ALD, which also bind to the virus and show promise as potential treatments. They tested these molecules against a range of enteroviruses and found them to be potent and broad-spectrum antiviral. 

The researchers analyzed the structure of CVA with G3 and found key residues involved in the interaction. They used computer simulations to test two new molecules, NLD and AL, which bind to the virus and show potential as treatments. They tested these molecules against a range of enteriruses and found them to be potent and broad-spectrum antiral.
In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the serpin Necrot plays a crucial role in regulating the immune response to fungal and Gram-positive bacterial infections. When the fly is infected, a proteolytic cascade is activated through the Toll receptor, leading to the synthesis of antibiotic peptides in the fat body and export to the hemolymph. Necrot is synthesized in the fat body, but its site of degradation was unclear. Researchers used a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation to "freeze" endocytosis and found that Necrot is removed from the hemolymph by two types of cells: giant cells and pericardial macrophages. Nec uptake increases rapidly after 30 minutes and peaks at 6-8 hours. The serpin is processed through multivesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, co-localizing with ubiquitin protein HRS. It does not co-localize with Rab11, indicating it's not re-exported from macrophages. Mutations blocking late endosome/lysosome fusion cause accumulation of Nec-positive endosomes, even without infection. Knocking down the Drosila ortholog of mammalian LDL receptor Lp1 identifies it as an enhancer of the immune uptake of Nec. Chromosomal deletion of Lp1 blocks uptake of Nec from hemolymph. The study identifies cells and receptor responsible for Nec uptake and degradation in Dophila. Scavenging ser/protein complexes may regulate proteolytic cascades.
In sea urchins, two opposing signals, Nodal and BMP, play a crucial role in establishing left-right (LR) asymmetry. Nodal signaling prevents the formation of the rudiment on the right side, but the opposing pathway to Nodal during LR establishment was unclear. Researchers found that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, but not in small micromeres. By perturbing BMP activities, they demonstrated that BMP signaling is required for the expression of left-sided genes and formation of left-sided structures. On the other hand, Nodal on the right inhibits BMP signaling and controls asymmetric apoptosis of small miceres. The study shows BMP is a positive signal for left-sided development in seaurchs, suggesting the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP in LR asymmetry are conserved in deuteromes.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread human pathogen that causes serious disease in immunocompromised patients and neonates. The virus exists in a latent, asymptomatic state or undergoes productive replication leading to lysis of the host. Lytic replication starts with the onset of viral early (IE) gene expression. Researchers found that inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity by checkpoint or chemical roscovine restores virus permissiveness in S2 cells. CD inhibition also antagonizes silencing of lytic expression during quiescent, latent infection of undifferentiated NT2 cells, suggesting a link between cell cycle and repression of IE transcription. Data suggest that DNA-dependent release of IE expression removes major obstacle to CM replication from S cells and infection proceeds with normal kinetics from G1 cells. The tumor suppressor p53 governs long-term response to genotoxic by inducing p21 cell arrest or apoptosis. Inhibitory function of CD on CM lytic expression is not restricted to cycle but likely has broader relevance for states of IE expression. Induction of IE by CD inhibition occurs in all cell phases of NT2, though S2 most sensitive at low concentrations. Rescue of CM expression in S relies on p-dependent signalling, induced by genotoxic or replicative stress.
Researchers studied how the immune system fights HIV in people who naturally control the virus without treatment. These individuals, called elite controllers, have strong HIV-specific T cells that keep the virus in check. However, how these cells develop is unclear. Dendritic cells, a type of immune cell, can recognize and help create HIV-specific T cells, but HIV often evades this recognition. The study found that in elite controllers, dendritic cells quickly produce interferons, proteins that fight viruses, and upregulate genes that help fight viruses. This innate response is linked to reduced viral replication and increased T cell death. Blocking this response with drugs or silencing a sensor gene reduced this effect. Importantly, this recognition in dendritic cells from controllers led to stronger HIV-specific T cell responses. The study suggests innate interferon production in dendritic cells is crucial for effective HIV-specific T cells and may aid in preventing or treating HIV.
Scientists have developed a new method to identify genes that control fat storage in fruit fly larvae. They used this method to find 66 genes that make the larvae store more fat, including a gene called Sir2. Sir2 regulates how the body stores and uses carbohydrates and fats by breaking down key proteins. In mammals, Sir2 works differently in different parts of the body, making it hard to understand its role in energy balance. The researchers found that knocking down Sir2 in larvae makes them store more fat. They also showed that Sir2 limits fat storage in individual cells of the body on its own. This suggests Sir2 helps switch from using nutrients to stored fat as energy. Surprisingly, Sir2 mutants survive longer than normal flies when starved of amino acids as long as they have sugar. The study points to a Sir pathway that helps respond to amino acid starvation, regardless of sugar levels. The researchers found that Sir2 regulates metabolic enzymes in mutants, showing a shift from burning to storing fat. They conclude that Sir2 is a key in switching from using nutrients to stored fat as energy.
Researchers studied the first embryonic division of 42 species of nematodes, closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, to understand how the mitotic spindle behaves during asymmetric cell division. This process is crucial for generating cellular diversity in animals. They recorded the division of 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabis and 15 non-Caenorhabis species and found variations in the degree of cell asymmetry and spindle movements, including oscillation, elongation, and displacement. Notably, these changes occurred without a clear direction in the species' phylogeny, except for spindle oscillations, which evolved at the base of the Caenorhabis genus. These changes were unrelated to embryo size variations. Importantly, elongation, displacement, and oscillation evolved independently. This contrasts with previous studies on C elegans and reveals new changes in spindle mechanics. The study shows that while asymmetric division has been conserved in nemode evolution, spindle parameters can combine in various ways, like other developmental processes.
Researchers studied how two closely related bacteria, Salmonella Typhimium and Escheria coli, respond to acid stress. They found that both have the same protein, Omp, but it's regulated differently in each species. In Salmonella Tyim, Omp is turned on at low pH, while in Escheria, it's not. This is due to differences in the promoter region of the O gene and the Esia O orthologue can be made acid-inducible by introducing sequences from Salmonella. The O regulon in Salmonella overlaps with Esia at 15 genes, including virulence genes Esia doesn't have. O binds to its targets more when DNA is relaxed, which happens in Salmon as a result of acid stress and is needed for virulence genes. Targets of O don't share a strong sequence consensus, suggesting O can recruit genes to its regulon from modest specificity and preference for relaxed DNA.
Researchers have identified a new protein, called N, secreted by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, that enters the host cells and targets histones in the cell's nucleus. This is the first time a bacterial protein has been found to directly target mammalian histones. The protein, named nuclear effector (N), contains a domain that suggests it functions as a histone methyltransfer, an enzyme that adds methyl groups to histones. Studies showed that N is secreted from the bacterium through a type III secretion mechanism and enters the host cell's nucleus, where it associates with chromatin. Experiments confirmed N is a histone methyltransfer that modifies histones H2, H3, and H4, and even itself, in a process called automethylation. Automethylation seems to enhance N's enzymatic activity, making it more effective at modifying histones. This is the first time a bacterial effector has been found to target mammalian histones. The study suggests N may play a role in Chydia's pathogenicity, but more research is needed to understand its function.
A new study of 35,000 people from 21 different populations found a link between inbreeding and lower height. Inbreeding is when two parents are closely related, like cousins or siblings. The study found that the children of cousins were 3cm shorter on average than children of unrelated parents. This effect remained even after accounting for factors like income and education. However, the effect size of inbreeding on height varied between populations. The study suggests that many rare genetic variants contribute to height, not just a few common ones. The method used in this study can be applied to other heritable traits, like diabetes or heart disease, to understand how inbreeding affects them.
Researchers have identified a distinct type of immune cell in the blood that helps fight off malaria parasites during an infection. This cell, called a monocyte (MO), has different forms and functions that change depending on the body's inflammatory state. The study looked at MO in people with acute malaria and those who had been exposed to malaria but didn't have the disease. They used a technique called flow cytometry to analyze the cells and tested their ability to fight parasites in a lab setting. Results showed that people with high numbers of a specific type of MO, CD14 CCR2CXCR1, had lower parasite levels in their blood compared to those with low numbers of this MO. This suggests a possible link between MO and parasite-fighting activity. The study also found that MO in people with malaria had higher levels of certain markers, such as CCR, CXCR, CD56, TN-α, and IF-γ, which are associated with strong parasite-fighting. Historically, MO have been seen as phagocytic cells, clearing parasites with or opson antibodies. However, this study found differences in MO subsets between people with malaria and healthy controls, with increased inflammatory MO in those with the disease. MO in people with malaria had higher levels of TREM, a marker of inflammation. The study found two groups of patients with different MO phenotypes, one with high CD CCR CXCR and low parasitemia, and the other with low CCR CXCR and high parasia.
A study of 34 HIV-uninfected Ugandan men found that Schistosoma mansoni infection was associated with an increase in HIV-susceptible T cell subsets in the blood, but not the foreskin. Men with S. mansoni infection had higher levels of Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells in their blood compared to those without the infection. Th17 cells in the blood of S mansoni-infected men also produced more cytokines. However, these immune changes were not seen in the foreskin tissue. The study suggests that S mansoni infection may increase HIV susceptibility through the mucosal immune system, but this effect is limited to the blood and does not extend to the foreskin, which is the primary site of HIV acquisition in heterosexual men.
Researchers have found that depleting Wolbachia, a bacteria that live inside filarial nematodes, causes extensive apoptosis, or cell death, in the nemat's reproductive cells and embryos. This is a promising approach to treating filarial diseases, which are caused by these nematodes. The study used whole mount confocal microscopy to observe the effects of Wolia depletion on nemat cells. They found that apoptosis occurs in adult reproductive cells, embryos, and microfilar, and fourth-stage larvae after Wolia depletion. Surprisingly, apoptosis occurs in most embryonic cells that were not infected with Wolia before treatment. Apoptosis does not occur in the hypermal, which has many Wolia, but the hypermal cytoskeleton is disrupted after Wolia depletion. This suggests that Wolia factors in the hypermal cause apoptosis. The pattern of apoptosis matches the nemat tissues affected by Wolia depletion, such as embryogenesis and sterilization, which last for months. The study provides a cellular explanation for reduced microilar loads and interrupted transmission after antibiotic therapy in fil nematodes.
Researchers studied how the malaria-causing parasite Plasium falcum requires a nutrient called pantoate to grow and multiply. They found that the parasite converts pantoate into a molecule called coenzyme A (CoA) using an enzyme called panto kinase (Pan). Some anti-malarial medicines, like panto and CJ-15,801, kill the parasite by targeting CoA production. However, the exact mechanism of action was unknown. The researchers created parasite lines resistant to these medicines by exposing them to panto and CJ-15,801. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in a Pan gene called Pfpan1 in all resistant lines. These mutations altered Pan activity, causing a fitness cost, suggesting Pfpan1 is essential for normal growth. The mutants showed different sensitivity to other anti-mial pantoate analogues, one being hypersensitive. The study suggests different pate classes have different mechanisms: some inhibit Co production while others inhibit using enzymes.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with the PR interval, a measure of atrial and ventricular conduction time, in African Americans. They analyzed data from 6,247 individuals and found a strong signal in the SCN5A gene, which encodes a cardiac sodium channel, associated with a 2% of PR variability in African Americans. The same variant was also associated with PR in Europeans, but with a smaller effect size and less variability. Further analysis identified additional variants in SCN5, ME1, and TBX5 associated with PR, some of which were also found in European and Asian studies. African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration in one cohort, but not others. The study demonstrates relevance of common variants in African at loci previously associated with PR in European and Asian samples and identifies a signal more strongly associated with PR in Africans than Europeans. The PR interval is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation, heart block, and mortality, with genetic factors explaining 30-50% of variability in European and Asian populations.
Researchers have identified a small GTP-binding protein called ARL8 that plays a crucial role in the replication of Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), a type of virus that infects plants. To replicate its genetic material, the virus forms complexes on cellular membranes inside the plant cells. Previous studies showed that a protein called TOM is necessary for the virus to multiply efficiently. The study found that ARL, along with TOM, is associated with the virus's replication protein in the membranes of infected tobacco plant cells. When membranes from infected cells expressing ARL were purified, TOM and the virus's replication proteins were also found together. This suggests that a complex of TOM, ARL, and virus proteins forms on membranes in infected cells. In plants, ARL has four family members. Mutations in two ARL genes stopped the virus from multiplying. In a lab experiment, lacking TOM or ARL inhibited the virus's replication. The study suggests TOM and ARL are crucial for the virus's replication process.
Researchers studied the role of inhibitory neurons in the locust's olfactory system to understand how they shape the firing patterns of principal neurons. Two types of inhibitory motifs emerged: feed-forward (FF) and feedback (FB). In the locust, a subset of lateral interneurons (LHNs) provided feed-forward inhibition to Kenyon cells (KCs) to maintain sparse firing, crucial for olfactory learning and memory. However, a single inhibitory cell, the GABAergic neuron (GN), was found to be the main source of inhibition in the mushroom body, mediated by a feedback loop including KCs and GN. A model of the locust olfactory system was used to compare the effects of FF and FB inhibition. Both motifs maintained KC responses and provided optimal odor discrimination, but only FB created a response consistent with in vivo data. This suggests that GN is potentially the primary source of inhibition to KCs. Understanding inhibitory motifs' impact on postsynaptic activity could reveal unknown structures in biological networks.
Researchers have developed a new laboratory test to diagnose rabies, a deadly viral disease that affects animals and humans. The test, called combined real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), can detect all types of lyssavirus, a group of viruses that includes rabies. It uses two methods: one detects rabies virus (RV) and the other detects other lyaviruses. The test was tested with many animal samples and human samples, including saliva, skin, and brain tissue. It correctly identified 91.5% of rabies cases in skin samples and 54% in saliva. The test was also used in two laboratories in Cambodia and Morocco. This new test is a useful tool for diagnosing rabies in animals and humans and for tracking the virus.
An outbreak of tset-transmitted trypanosomias resulted in over 50% losses of domestic pigs in the Eastern Region of Ghana. To control the disease, a trial was conducted from May to October 2007 to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito nets. Two villages were selected, one as control with 14 pigs and one experimental with 24 pigs protected by insecticide-treated nets. The nets were 100 high, 150 denier polyester with 100mg/m deltamethrin and UV protector attached to poles. Bi-monthly monitoring with geo-referenced traps showed a 90% reduction in the protected village within two months, exceeding 95% in subsequent months. The control village tset population remained unaffected, displaying seasonal variations. Fifty pigs from each village were ear-tagged and given curative treatment after blood samples taken. Initial trypan prevalence was 76% and 72 in protected and control, decreasing to 16 and 84 after three months. Six months later, 8% of protected were infected, 60 in control.
A recent survey of 441 biomedical articles published between 2000-2014 found low levels of reproducibility and transparency. Only one study provided a full protocol and none made raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare, with only 4 found in the sample, and 16 had data included in a systematic review or meta-analysis. Most studies didn't mention funding or conflicts of interest. The percentage of articles with no funding statement decreased from 94.4% in 2000 to 34.6% in 2014, while those reporting conflicts increased from 0 in 200 to 15.4% in 201 and no conflicts from 5.6 in 200 to 50 in 201. Articles in clinical medicine journals were more likely to lack funding information and have private funding. The study provides baseline data to track future progress in reproducibility.
Researchers studied how the bacteria Yersinia pestis causes primary pneumonic plague, a deadly disease with a 100% mortality rate. They found that the bacteria first target alveolar macrophages in the lungs, then switch to neutrophils, a type of immune cell. Neutrophils can't stop the bacteria from growing and cause severe inflammation, leading to the disease's lethal phase. The study used a special probe to track proteins delivered by the bacteria's type III secretion system, which is essential for its virulence and has anti-inflammatory effects on mammalian cells. They found that depleting 92% of alolar macroages had little effect on bacterial growth, suggesting they're not crucial in limiting the bacteria's survival. The bacteria create a protective environment in the lungs early stages of the disease, suppressing the host's immune response. The researchers hypothesized the bacteria target immune cells early via type III secretion of effectors. They tracked the fate of macrophages and neutils to understand the progression to the disease's inflammatory phase. This study is the first to identify host cells and population dynamics in the lung during pneumonic plague, showing the bacteria primarily target macroages and neutils in the pre-inflammatory phase.
Researchers conducted a study in Brazil to evaluate the accuracy of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using soluble recombinant antigens to detect asymptomatic Leishmaniasis infection. They collected blood samples from 136 participants, 97 of whom were positive and 39 negative by PCR, over a two-year follow-up period. None of the asymptomatic participants progressed to disease. Controls included samples from 22 healthy individuals and 8 patients with kala-azar. Molecular techniques confirmed Leishmania presence in all kala patients and 86% of participants. Kala patients showed high reactivity in ELISA, while asymptomatic individuals showed low reactivity against tested antigens. Compared to molecular methods, L. amazon and L. infant antigens showed higher sensitivity 49.6% and 41% respectively, while r39 had 26.5%. However, r39 had higher specificity 73.7% than L. amazon 52.6 and L. infant 36.8. There was low agreement among different antigens used. Serological tests were inaccurate diagnosing asymptomatic compared to molecular, leading to misclassification in population studies. Studies using serological to estimate prevalence, evaluate programs or identify risk Leish infection may have compromised results.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze retrotranson expression in mouse embryonic stem cells using Illumina and Affymetrix gene microarray data. This approach allowed them to identify histone deacetylase Hd1 as a component of the retrotranson silencing machinery in these cells. They also found retrotransons that are targets of other silencing mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and RingB/E-containing polycomb repressive complexes. The study suggests that multiple silencing mechanisms are independently targeted to retroons in embryonic cells, and different copies of the same retroon can be differentially sensitive to silencing. The researchers used repeat-annotation of microarray data to investigate established mechanisms of retroon silencing and found a complex interplay between DNA methylation and histone modifications regulating expression of repetitive elements in the mouse genome. They identified retroons that are silenced by methylation and histone modifications in embryonic cells and histone deetylase Hd1 as a regulator of retroons in these cells. The study shows that genome-wide silencing of elements can be monitored by extracting information from microarray data, revealing a complex interplay between mechanisms controlling retroon expression in embryonic and germ cells, and differences in behavior of different copies of individual retroons. This approach can generate new insights into retro regulation in mammals and identify components of defense mechanisms protecting the genome from retroposition.
Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY) plays a crucial role in regulating flowering time by controlling the expression of the Flowering Locus T (FT) gene. CRY-interacting bHL1 (C1) interacts with CRY in response to blue light to activate FT transcription. However, in vivo, C1 binds to the chromatin region of the FT promoter, which contains non-canonical E-box sequences, not canonical-box. Researchers found that CRY also interacts with at least C5 in response to blue light, but not in darkness or other wavelengths. Genetic analysis showed that C1, C2, C4, and C5 act redundantly activate FT transcription and are positive regulators of C2-mediated flowering. Importantly, C1 and other C proteins form heterodimers, some of which have higher affinity to non-canonical-box in vitro assays. This explains why C1 and C bind canonical-box with higher affinity in vitro, but are associated with non-canonical-box at FT promoter vivo. Consistent with hypothesis that C play similar roles in C2-mediated blue signaling, C expression is regulated by light. The study shows C redundantly regulate C2 flowering and different C form heterodimers interact non-canonical DNA vivo.
Researchers studied the cost-effectiveness of treating intestinal parasites in US-bound refugees from Asia. Parasites like hookworm, Trichuris, Ascaris, and Strongloides are rare in the US and often misdiagnosed, leading to serious consequences. They compared four options: no treatment, US domestic screening and treatment, overseas presumptive treatment with albendazole and ivermect, and overseas albazole and domestic screening for Stronglo. A model estimated costs and health impacts on 27,700 refugees. The "No" option was the least expensive ($165,923) and least effective (145 cases, 4 hospitalizations, 0 deaths). Overseas albazole and ivermect ($418,824) was less expensive than domestic treatment ($3,832,572) or overseas alb and screening ($2,182,483). The most effective option was overseas alb and iverect, reducing cases and deaths by 80% at a cost of $458,718 per death or $2,219 per QAL gained. Overse presum treatment for US-bound refugees is cost-effective and less expensive than domestic treatment.
Researchers have discovered a new species of microsporidian parasite that infects the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a worm commonly used in scientific research. This parasite, named Nematida displere, is unique because it can infect and replicate in multiple tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine, unlike other related parasites that only infect the intestine. Most of the parasite's replication occurs in the muscle and epider, not the intestine. The genome of Nematida displere is distinct from its relatives, with over 10% of its proteins belonging to a single family of unknown proteins that may help it interact with the host. This discovery provides a new model to study how pathogens grow in different tissues.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Cockayne syndrome B (CS) plays a crucial role in fixing damaged DNA during transcription, a process called transcription-coupled DNA repair. CS is essential for this process, but mutations in CS lead to Cockayne syndrome, a disease characterized by premature aging, sun sensitivity, and developmental issues. CS belongs to a family of proteins that remodel chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins that make up chromosomes. However, how CS remodels chromatin and if this activity is used in repair was unknown. The study found that CS repositions nucleosomes, the building blocks of chromatin, in an energy-dependent manner and this is enhanced by N1-like histone chaper, a new partner of CS. By analyzing CS and its derivatives, researchers showed that chromatin remodeling by CS and N1-like chaper is necessary for efficient transcription-cou DNA repair. They also found that chrom remodeling and repair by CS are separate activities. This collaboration between CS and N1 chaper adds to understanding of how chromatin remodelers and chaperons regulate chrom structure. The study provides new insights into CS function in transcription-c DNA repair and mechanisms of Cockayne syndrome.
Researchers have created a detailed map of epigenetic variation in the human genome by studying DNA methylation patterns in five different cell types. They found clusters of CpG sites with high individual variation, called Variably Methyl Regions (VM), which occur at enhancers and 3' untranslated regions. Most VM have heritability, but a subset show low heritability and form co-regulated networks specific to each cell type. These networks are enriched for transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue. For example, in T cells, a network of 95 co-regulated VMs is involved in T-cell activation, while in fibroblasts, a network of 34 co-reg VMs controls growth, and in neurons, a network of 18 VMs is involved in synaptic signaling. The researchers also showed that some VM networks are responsive to environment, with methylation levels changing in a coordinated fashion under different conditions. These environmentally-responsive VMs are enriched for imprinted loci, suggesting they are sensitive to environmental conditions. The study provides a map of epigenetic variation in the genome, showing both genetic and environmental causes underlie variation.
Researchers have developed a new rapid test for the dengue virus, called the Panbio Dengue Early, which detects a protein called NS1. This protein is present in the body early stages of infection, typically within 1-9 days of symptoms. The test was evaluated in Vietnam and Malaysia with 198 and 263 laboratory-confirmed samples. The test alone had a sensitivity of 69.2% and 68.9% and specificity of 96% and 96.7 compared to PCR. When combined with a commercial IgM/Ig rapid test, the sensitivity increased to 93%. The study found that using NS1 detection with IgM and Ig serology increased the sensitivity of acute deng diagnosis and extended the detection window to early samples. The test was compared to other NS rapid tests in the same region and showed good performance. The combination of NS1 with IgM and Ig detection resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity compared to individual markers. In Malaysia, the clinical utility of the Dengue Rapid alone and in combination with Dengue Cassette was assessed. The individual sensitivity of Dengue Rapid and Dengue Cassette was 62 and 72.5. The combination of NS1 with Ig detection resulted in a significant increase to 89.
Researchers have developed a new method called Trans to detect conserved helices of functional RNA structures, including transient, pseudo-knotted and alternative structures. These structures are important for understanding how RNA functions in living cells. Current methods assume a unique RNA structure and don't predict features needed for folding in cells. Trans uses evolutionarily related genes to find similar structures in cells. It predicts features of known structures, including pseudo-kotted ones and alternative configurations. It also identifies unstructured sequences bound by molecules and suggests new helices that define folding pathways. This supports the idea that homologous sequences don't just have similar structures, but also fold similarly. Unlike other methods, Trans doesn't predict function over time, but highlights conserved features and doesn't need cellular details. 

The co-transcription folding differs from re-folding in time and structure. Computational methods take kinetics into account, but await testing in cells. A new approach studies folding in cells. Errors in early stages are magnified as folding progresses. Knowing the start of RNA sequence is crucial. Existing methods' performance is on small data. Studying folding experimentally is challenging. Trans predicts novel helices of significance, corresponding to conserved cocription features, supporting homolog sequences fold similarly.
Plants have a built-in defense system to protect themselves from harmful microbes. This system, called immunity, must work even when some of its parts are damaged by the microbes. To be resilient, the system allows different parts to compensate for each other's loss. Scientists studied this system in Arabidopsis, a plant, by taking it apart and reassembling it to understand how it works. They found that the system is made of four main parts: salicylate, jasmon, ethylene, phytoalexin-deficient 4, and salicylate signaling. These parts interact with each other to control the plant's response to an immune trigger, flagellin-22. Some interactions help the system work even when one part is damaged. This is called buffering. The researchers used a new approach, called network reconstitution, to study the system. It involves taking apart and reassembling the system to see how it works. They found that some parts are key to the system even if they don't show changes when one or two are missing. This is because they work together with other parts to keep the system working. The study shows that looking at the system as a whole can help understand how it works, especially when it's resilient to damage.
In the fruit fly Drosila, the nervous system develops from a single layer of cells called neuroepithelial sheets. To create diversity in the nervous system, these sheets are subdivided into domains in a controlled and timely manner. The optic placode, a part of the nervous system, gives rise to the larval eye and optic lobe. The lar eye has two types of photoreceptors: primary and secondary, while the opticobe develops into prominent ganglia during larval and pupal stages. Researchers found a genetic network that controls the balance between eye and opticobe precursors, as well as primary and secondary photoreceptors. The gene proneural factor Aton specifies eye precursors, while the nuclear receptor Tailless is crucial for opticobe precursors. The Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways act upstream of A and T to coordinate precursor specification. The boundary between A and T controls the number of primary and secondary photore. Notch also controls cell fate, acting in a cascade of transcription interactions to define photore subtype. This study shows how extrinsic and intrinsic factors control neural patterning.
Human beta-defensin 1 (hBD1) is a naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide in the human body that has been shown to have distinct activities in its oxidized and reduced forms. Researchers have explored its mechanisms of action and found that the reduced form of h1 creates a net-like structure around bacteria, trapping them and preventing their migration, but not killing them. This is different from other antimicrobial peptides that primarily kill bacteria. The reduced form of h1 is stable even in the presence of digestive enzymes that break down proteins. In contrast, cysteine, a component of the peptide, is not necessary for net formation. The reduced form of h1 provides additional protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular structures, preventing invasion. This is a new mechanism of action for h1, different from other defensins like human-defin 6. The study highlights the difference between conventional antibiotics and endogenous host molecules like h1, which have multifunctional activities. The reduced form of h1 forms distinct structures post-translationally, controlled by the local environment. The TR system transforms oxidized h1 into the reduced form. The reduced form of h1 entraps bacteria, a previously unknown function. This mechanism is distinct from human-def 6, indicating a broad spectrum of conserved mechanisms. The presence of h1 in human colonic mucus was previously shown. The multiple strategies of defense might explain why humans have not lost the battle with microbes despite millions of years of exposure. The distinct activities of h1 represent an example of a host peptide using multiple strategies to combat bacteria.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called OCRL is essential for a process called endocytosis in the zebraf pronephric tub, a model of the mammalian kidney. Endocyt is the process by which cells take in substances from outside the body. In Lowe syndrome and Dent disease, caused by mutations in OCRL, patients have low levels of protein in their urine. The study found that OCRL-deficient zebraf embryos have reduced endocyt, with less uptake of fluid and protein from the glomerulate. They also found fewer early endytic compartments and large vacuolar endosomes in proneph cells. Cell polarity in the proneph tub is unaffected in mutant embryos. OCRL-deficient embryos have mild ciliogenesis, but this is not the cause of endocyt defect. Catalytic activity of OCRL is needed for renal endyt and endoc can be rescued by suppressing PIPK. This is the first time OCRL is shown to be needed for endytic in vivo and supports that endytic defects cause renalulopathy in Lowe and Dent disease. PIPK is a potential target for Lowe and Dent disease treatment.
Researchers studied the presence of Rift Valley Fever (RV) in livestock in the Kilom River Valley, Tanzania, a region that experiences annual flooding. They conducted a cross-sectional survey of cattle and sheep from May to August 2011, approximately four years after a 2007 RV outbreak. The study aimed to establish baseline exposure to RV virus and assess relationship between seropositivity and animal and environmental factors. Overall, 11.3% of animals had RV antibodies, with 5.5% born after the 2007 outbreak and 22.7 during the outbreak. There was a linear increase in prevalence in post-epid cohorts. Nine samples were positive for RV IgM antibodies, indicating recent infection. Seropreval exhibited hotspots, with no difference in males and females born after the epidemic, but significant in those during the outbreak. Animals over 15km from the floodplain were more likely to have antibodies than those under 5km. Species, breed, herd composition, and grazing practices were not associated with serositivity. Findings indicate post-epid transmission of RV in the area, with constant exposure and active foci preceding the survey.
Trypanosoma cruz, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, has a unique contractile vacuole complex (CVC) that helps regulate its osmolarity. As an obligate intracellular pathogen, it also relies on surface proteins to invade hosts. Researchers used genetic and biochemical approaches to study the VC's role in trafficking glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to the parasite's plasma membrane and host invasion. They found that T. cruzi Rab11 (GFP-TR11) localized to the VC, while a dominant negative mutant (DN) tagged GFP-TR11 localized to the cytosol, and epastigotes expressing this mutant were less responsive to hyposotic and hyperosmotic stress. Mutant parasites still differentiated into metacylic forms and infected cells. GPI-anch transialase (TTS), mucins of 60-200K family, and trypastigote surface antigen (TSS II) co-localized with GFP-TR to VC during intramastigotes transformation into trypastigotes. Parasites expressing GFP-TR11 prevented TS, but not other proteins, from reaching the plasma and were less infective compared to wild type. Incubation with exogenous recombinant active, not inactive TS and sialic acid before infecting cells partially rescued infectivity trypastigotes.
Researchers conducted a phase III clinical trial to compare the effectiveness and safety of a shortened rabies post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) regimen using a purified chick-embryo rabies vaccine (PCV) administered intradermally for 4 times in 1 week, versus the standard 2-site regimen. The study included 443 participants aged 1 year or older, divided into 4 groups to receive intradermal PCV with or without human rabies immunoglobulin (HR) at the first visit. Rabies virus neutralizing antibody (RV) concentrations were measured up to day 365 post-vaccination. The 4-site/1 regimen was noninferior to the 2-site regimen at day 49, with 95% of participants having adequate RV concentrations. Both regimens had similar safety profiles, with no vaccination-related serious events. The study suggests the 4/1 regimen could be an alternative to current recommendations, offering improved efficiency and compliance.
Researchers have studied the brain's ability to detect and respond to important events, focusing on the "salience network" (SN), a group of brain regions including the anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex. They used high-resolution brain scans from the Human Connectome Project and graph theory to investigate the SN's dynamic organization. The study found that the SN is highly flexible and interacts with other brain networks, such as the frontopetal, cingulateopular, and ventral dorsal attention networks. Its interactions are also highly varied in space and time. The SN acts as a central hub, connecting other networks, and its connections change over time are unique compared to other control systems like the frontopetal and ventral attention networks. The study found that the SN's flexibility is linked to individual differences in cognitive flexibility. The results were consistent in a second test, showing the findings are reliable. This research provides new insights into the SN's dynamic architecture and how it facilitates interactions with multiple brain systems, supporting various cognitive processes.
Scientists have been trying to understand how non-enveloped viruses, like SV40, are released from host cells. These viruses assemble in the nucleus and don't have a membrane, so they must be released without one. A new protein, VP4, is expressed late in the viral cycle and may play a role in this process. To investigate, VP4 was expressed and purified as a fusion protein from bacteria. It was found to bind and disrupt membranes, making them permeable to large molecules. The hydrophobic part of VP is essential for this. It prefers membranes with lipids like those in plasma membranes, not nuclear ones. Phosphatylethanol, a lipid in bacterial membranes, inhibits VP's activity. VP forms pores of 3nm in diameter in mammalian cells, including SV host cells. This suggests VP acts as a viropin to perforate membranes for viral release.
Researchers have developed a DNA vaccine that protects against deng, a serious disease spread in tropical and subtropical areas, by using a protein called NS1. The vaccine, called pcANS, was tested in mice and shown to be effective against the virus. To understand how it works, the researchers looked at the immune response it triggered in the mice. They found that the vaccine induced both antibodies and T cells that fight the virus. The antibodies alone provided some protection, but the combination of both was needed for full protection. The T cells, specifically CD4, played a crucial role in the protection. When these cells were removed, the vaccine no longer worked. Experiments showed that transferring CD4 cells from vaccinated mice to others, along with antibodies, gave the same protection as the vaccine alone. This suggests that CD4 cells and antibodies work together to fight deng. The study provides new insights into how the immune system responds to NS1 and may lead to a vaccine development.
Researchers have studied how the cell-to-cell communication system in Gram-positive bacteria, specifically in Streptococcus, which relies on extracellular peptides to trigger responses. They focused on the RNPP family of proteins, which regulate important processes like sporulation, conjugation, and virulence, and are considered targets for new antibacterial agents. The team elucidated the structure-function of ComR, a new member of the RNPP, which controls natural transformation in Streptoccus. Com is activated by binding to its pheromone X, a mature form of the ComS-inducing peptide. Crystal analysis and mutational assays revealed a mechanism: XIP induces release of the sequestered HTH domain and Com dimerization to DNA binding. This mechanism is conserved in Com orthologs, showing Com is not an R protein but a new RNPP member. Identifying X and Com residues for activation is crucial for designing antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges in Streptoccus. This is the first report of peptide-mediated control of a transcription regulator by sequestration of its DNA domain. The study proposes a molecular mechanism of Com activation and offers opportunities for controlled peptide-based systems in Strept and Gram bacteria.
Scientists have discovered a way to activate a protein called ELIC, a type of ion channel that helps transmit signals in the nervous system. ELIC is part of a large family of channels that includes receptors for important neurotransmitters like serotonin and acetylcholine. To understand how these channels work, researchers needed to know what activates them. They found that a class of molecules called primary amines, including the neurotransmitter GABA, can activate EL at high concentrations. These molecules bind to a specific site on the protein and cause the channel to open, but the effect wears off over time. The channel allows positively charged ions to pass through, similar to another type of receptor called nicotinic acetylcholine. EL's simple behavior makes it a good model to study how these channels work. Researchers used a library of molecules to find the right activators, located one in a crystal structure, and studied the channel's properties. This helps understand how signals are transmitted in the nervous system.
Researchers have found a link between skin barrier defects and the development of asthma in individuals with a history of eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD). They studied mice with skin-barrier defects and found they developed AD-like inflammation and were susceptible to asthma. A protein called thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSL) expressed by skin cells is the driver of bronial hyperresponsiveness. Mice with keratin-specific deletion of RBP showed high levels of TSL and developed severe asthma after allergen challenge. Eliminating TSL signaling blocked the atopic march, showing high TSL levels sensitize the lung to inflammation. Mice with high TSL without skin pathology developed asthma. Importantly, epidermal T was sufficient to trigger atopic sensitizing lung inhaled allergens without epicutaneous sensitization. The study suggests treating skin-bar defects and inhibiting TSL may prevent asthma in AD patients.
Scientists have developed a new approach to analyze the genetic data of microorganisms by combining multiple types of data with computer tools. This method was used to study the genome of Thermotoga marima, a type of bacteria that thrives in extremely hot environments. The analysis revealed unique features of its genome compared to other bacteria, such as a high number of genes per unit, few non-coding RNAs, and few units with multiple start sites. Transcription regulation is limited by lack of space between units. Many genes are expressed regardless of growth state and there is a strong link between mRNA and protein levels. These properties are thought to be due to its ability to live in hot conditions and could provide insights into life on Earth's evolution.
Researchers investigated how context influences our perception of visual features in images. They presented observers with a display of bars and asked if a target bar was present at the center. Observers were more likely to see the target when the context was weak rather than strong. When the context matched the target, weak bars made observers see the target more, while high-contrast bars made them less likely to see it. A Bayesian model showed that context affects perception in two ways: biasing prior belief in the target's presence and biasing internal model of input caused by the target. This suggests areas beyond primary visual cortex are responsible for inferences.
Researchers have found that the presence of "defectors" in a population can sometimes lead to conditions that rescue cooperation from destruction. Defectors are individuals that consume a common good without contributing to its production, which can lead to the depletion of the good and collapse of cooperation. However, in a structured population, small size can favor cooperation. This is because small size increases variability in cooperator frequency across locations, allowing cooperators to outgrow defectors globally despite defectors outgrowing cooperators in each location. The researchers used an individual-based model to demonstrate three mechanisms by which defectors can lead to conditions that rescue cooperation. First, def-induced population collapse can allow cooperators to grow when defectors go extinct by chance. Second, empty locations created by def-induced extinction can favor cooperation by allowing cooperator but not defector migrants to grow. Third, resource limitation induced by def can select for adaptive mutations to limitation, which can favor cooperation. These factors lead to the counterintuitive result that initial presence of defectors can improve survival of cooperation compared to when def are absent. In a structured population, small sizes precipitated by def provide a "built-in" mechanism for persistence of cooperation.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a type of bacteria that can cause infections in people with weakened immune systems or damaged epithelial barriers. Researchers found that P aerugin sticks to areas where epithelial cells touch each other, specifically at multi-cell junctions, and attaches to dead cells that have been pushed out of the epithelial layer. This attachment is not specific to one type of cell death, as P aerugin also binds to cells that are dying or already dead. The bacteria are then engulfed by surrounding epithelial cells through a process called efferytosis, where they dispose of the dead cells and debris. Inside the cell, the bacteria are in a special sac called an eocytic phagosome that gets lysosomal features and is killed. The study suggests that P aerugin elimination through eocytosis is a defense mechanism used by the body. This could be relevant for studying cystic fibrosis, a disease with high number of dead cells and ineffective eocytosis.
During embryonic development in fruit flies, the gonad is formed from two types of cells: primordial germ cells (PGCs) and somatic gonadal precursor (SG) cells. PGs form at the back of the embryo and are carried inside during gastrulation. To reach SGs, PGs must cross the midgut and migrate through the mesoderm. A combination of repulsive and attractive signals from SGs guide migration. The hedgehog (hh) pathway shifted (sh) gene plays a role in directing PG migration. sh encodes a protein that facilitates long-distance transmission of H through the proteoglycan matrix after released from basolateral membranes of H expressing cells in the wing disc. sh is in the gonadal meserm, loss and gain-function experiments show it's required for PG migration. Previous studies show the hmg-dependent isopoid biosynthetic pathway generates PG attract by SGs and other tissues when hmg is ectically expressed. We show production of PG attract depends on sh and second hh gene g1. Linking PG attract to H, evidence shows ectopic hmg in nervous promotes release of H from cells into the mesermal layer where H can contact PGs. Potentiation of H by hmg depends on cholesterol.
Scientists have been trying to develop a vaccine against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, for a long time. To make a vaccine work, we need to understand how the body fights off the virus. One way the body fights HIV is with a type of immune cell called CD8 T-cells. These cells can kill infected cells that have HIV. People who control HIV long-term, without getting sick have strong CD8-cells that can kill HIV-infected cells. Researchers tested a vaccine made from a virus called Adenovirus type 5 that carries HIV pieces of the virus. The vaccine did not stop people from getting HIV, but they wanted to see if it made CD8-cells that could kill HIV. They compared people who got the vaccine to those with HIV and those who control the virus long-term. People who got the vaccine had CD8-cells that could kill HIV-infected cells, but not as strong as those who control HIV long-term. However, those with certain genes, called HLA B27, B57, or B58, had stronger CD-cells. These genes are linked to controlling HIV in people with the virus. This suggests that these genes might help make vaccine work better by making stronger CD-cells.
Researchers have long believed that the ability to share intentions, or work together towards a common goal, played a key role in the evolution of humans' unique cognitive abilities. A new study models the co-evolution of intentional behavior and culture, showing that rapid technological advancements go hand-in-hand with the ability to work together. Without opportunities for significant improvement, the ability to work together is selected against. This provides a mechanism for the emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a reason for species diversity in prevalence of such behavior. The study suggests that early humans' high degree of collaborative behavior compared to other great apes aided development of modern cognitive abilities, known as the shared intention hypothesis or Vygotsian intelligence. The emergence of shared intentions at time of technological advance is consistent with evidence that tool-making and language evolved around the same time, with language facilitating joint behavior. The study formally models the evolution of ability to work together, showing under what conditions it likely emerges. Individuals with ability to share intentions can adjust strategies with neighbors for mutual benefit. Results show effects of joint behavior on speed of technological improvement. The study links technology adoption to evolution of collaboration, providing insight into why humans' ubiquitous ability to work together emerged.
Researchers have identified two microRNAs, miR-34b and mi-449, that play a crucial role in male fertility. These microRNAs are involved in the production of high-quality sperm and their absence leads to oligoasthenatozoospermia, a common cause of male infertility in humans. Oligoastatozoospermia is characterized by low sperm count, poor motility, and abnormal morphology. The study found that deletion of miR-34 and mi-449 in mice resulted in oligoastatoospermia, with low sperm count, poor motility, and abnormal morphology. The absence of these microRNAs impairs meiosis and final stages of sperm maturation. Analysis of pachene spermatocytes revealed deregulated genes, many of which are targets of mi-34. The study shows that mi-34 family is important for spermatogenesis and its deregulation causes oligoastatoospermia and infertility.
Escherichia coli Nle 191 (Ec) has been used therapeutically for over a century, but the determinants of its probiotic properties remain elusive. Ec produces two siderophore-microins (Mcc) responsible for antagonistic activity against Enterobacteraceae and synthesizes the genotoxin colactin encoded by the p island. Colactin is a virulence and putative pro-cinogenic compound. Researchers aimed to decouple antagonistic activity of Ec from genotoxicity. They found that p-encoded ClP, the peptase that activates colact, is required for antagonistic activity of Ec. Analysis of ClP mutants revealed activity linked to transmembrane helices of ClP not periplasm peptase domain, indicating transmembrane involved in aspect M biosynthesis or secretion. Amino acid substitution in ClP inactivates genotoxic but maintains antagon activity. In vivo salmonelis model, this mutant reduced clinical signs and fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly wild type, ClP deletion could neither protect nor compete pathogen. ClP-dependent antibacterial effect observed with other E coli strains carry truncated form M gene cluster p island.
Cryptococcus neoformans, a fungus that causes meningitis and kills hundreds of thousands annually, relies on glycans for survival and virulence. Glycans are made in the secretory pathway, but precursors are made in the cytos. Nucle sugar transporters solve this problem by exchanging nucleotides for nucleosides. The major virulence factor of C. neoans is its polysacchar capsule, which is also shed to impede the host response. Xylose, a monosacide absent in yeast, is a capsule component. We found two transporters, U1 and U2, specific for xylose donor UDPxy, with distinct localization and kinetic. Both also transport galactose UDPgalactose. U1 and U2 are necessary for xy incorporation into capsule and disease in mice, but not viability in infection. These findings provide a starting point for deciphering specificity of transporters, a pathway for therapy, and understanding glycology.
Researchers have created a global database to track and control neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as schistosomiasis, soil-transmitted helthias, and lemaniasis. The database is open to the public and constantly updated, allowing researchers and disease managers to use the data for interventions and monitoring. The database started with over 12,000 schosiasis survey locations in 35 African countries and is now expanded to include other NTDs. It allows for disease modeling, targeting, monitoring, and surveillance, and detailed analysis of disease distribution in space and time. A focus on schosias in Africa demonstrates the feasibility of the database and its expansion is recommended. The database was created by searching literature, contacting health ministries, and institutions in schias-endemic countries for location-specific data. Data was extracted, geferenced, and stored in a database with a web interface for free access and management. The goal is to extend the database to other NTDs such as ascari, hookworm, trichias, lymphatic filiasis, onchercis, and trach. The database is available at http://www.gd.org.
Researchers investigated whether chronic helminth infections, such as those caused by parasitic worms, worsen the course of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) infection. They tested this by infecting rats with a type of worm called Litomoides sigmodis and then challenging them with MT. Contrary to their hypothesis, they found that the worm infection did not make the MT infection worse. In fact, the rats infected with both worms and MT had fewer bacteria in their lungs and smaller lung granulomas than those with just MT alone. This suggests that programs to get rid of worms may not help control MT. However, it may be possible to use worm-derived treatments for diseases that don't increase the risk of getting MT. The study used rats because they are a natural host for the worm and good model for human MT infection. The researchers looked at immune responses, lung tissue, and bacteria in the rats two months after MT challenge. They found no difference in immune response and interferon production between rats with and without worms.
Researchers have discovered a new function for a family of ion channels called DEG/ENC in fruit flies, specifically in the species Drosophila melanogaster. These channels are responsible for responding to environmental cues, feeding, and threats, and mating. One member of this family, pp23, is found in sensory neurons that detect smells and tastes, but not those related to feeding. Disrupting pp23 or blocking its activity did not affect taste, but delayed and reduced male courtship behavior. Mutations in pp23 also changed how males respond to a female pheromone, a specific smell that attracts males. This suggests pp23 plays a role in the sensory system that determines sexual behavior in Dophila.

The study found pp23 in sensory neurons and lack response to female pherone, indicating it may be a pherone receptor or part of pher signaling. Data show DE/ENC signaling contributes to behaviors related to sex and a new function for this family of channels. It's possible pp23 plays a role in interactions between species, not related to sex. Females with pp23 mutation showed no change in sexual receptivity, but may play a role in other behaviors. The study identified pp23, a DE/EN member, in sensory neurons of the sex circuit in flies. It shows pp23 and cells play a role in normal male-female courtship but not feeding.
Researchers studied how mitochondria in the green alga Chlamdomonas import tRNAs from the cytosol to ensure proper translation. They found a correlation between mitochondrial cod usage and the amount of imported tRNAs, suggesting that tRNA import might adapt to the mitochondrial content. To test this, they modified Chlamdomonas' mitochondrial genome to change cod usage and found reduced translation levels and respiratory complex activities due to limited tRNA pool. This indicates tRNA import is not dynamic, but rather a co-evolved process between import and translation machinery. The study suggests that tRNA levels in mitochondria result from a co-evolution between import mechanism and translation requirements. In Chlamdomonas, tRNA import is not adaptable, and cod usage affects translation efficiency. The research shows that mitochondrial DNA information does not regulate tRNA import. The study also found that imported tRNA levels correlate with cod usage, suggesting they are defined by mitochondrial DNA for optimal translation.
Diabetes is a growing problem worldwide, affecting nearly 30 million people in the US, or 10% of the population, with 84 million more at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Current methods for measuring blood sugar control in diabetes and prediabetes are limited, relying on single-point measurements or average levels, neglecting the ups and downs of sugar levels. Researchers used continuous glucose monitoring (CG) to study how often and how people's sugar levels spike after eating, and how this varies between individuals given the same food. They found that underlying sugar control is different for each person, and developed a system to group people by specific sugar response patterns, called "glucotypes", revealing hidden subtypes within traditional categories. Importantly, even those considered healthy by standard measures show high sugar variability, with levels reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2 of the time, respectively. This shows sugar control is more widespread and varied than thought, affecting those considered healthy by standard measures, and patterns reflect underlying physiology. The study highlights the personal nature of sugar control. Through detailed analysis, a model was built to identify mechanisms of sugar control and a tool to visualize individual profiles and classify into glucotypes.
Researchers have found that a protein called EDR1 plays a key role in regulating plant defense against disease and cell death. EDR interacts with two other proteins, MK4 and MK5, which are part of a signaling pathway that helps plants respond to threats. When EDR is present, it reduces the activity of MK4 and MK5, keeping the pathway in check. Without EDR, the pathway is overactive, leading to increased defense and cell death. The study used Arabidopsis, a plant commonly used in research, and found that mutants lacking EDR had higher levels of MK4 and MK activity and proteins. They also found that EDR physically interacts with MK4 and MK, and that this interaction is necessary for its function. Overexpressing MK4 or MK in plants lacking EDR made them more resistant to disease. This suggests that EDR is a negative regulator of the pathway, fine-tuning plant responses to threats.
Researchers have developed a new computational tool to predict the spread of infectious diseases, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, using a method called Gaussian processes. This tool can help policymakers make informed decisions to control and prevent the spread of diseases. The researchers tested the tool on data from Turkey between 2004 and 2015 and compared it to two standard machine learning algorithms, random forests and boosted trees. The results showed that the Gaussian process tool was more accurate in predicting the spread of the disease over time and space. The tool can be used to predict the number of cases in the future, the prevalence of the disease in a location, and the spread of the disease over time and space. The researchers used Gaussian processes because they can capture complex relationships between data better than tree-based algorithms. They combined data on location and time to create a larger matrix and used it to train a model to make predictions. The tool was tested on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a disease with a 5-40% fatality rate in Africa, Balkans, Middle East, and Asia. The tool can be used to make predictions in three scenarios: predicting cases in the future, disease prevalence in a location, and spread over time and space.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease that affects humans and livestock in Africa and the Middle East, causing significant deaths and economic losses. The disease outbreaks are sporadic and influenced by seasonal and socioeconomic factors. Researchers developed a mathematical model to study the transmission of RV virus among ruminants with movement. The study found that in Northeast Africa, human activities like the Eid al-Adha festival, combined with climate factors like rainfall and hydrological variations, contribute to disease transmission and dispersal. Outbreaks may occur when two events happen together: abundant livestock are moved to areas at risk due to festival demand and abundant mosquitoes emerge. These factors impact outbreak severity. The model shows disease dynamics over short and long periods, particularly during festival time. It also investigates patterns of outbreaks driven by festival and seasonal factors like number of imported livestock, transportation speed, and death from sacrifices. When festival starts earlier than usual, risk of massive outbreaks increases, especially in the ceremony place.
Researchers studied the occurrence of anthrax in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010. They analyzed data on livestock outbreaks, vaccination efforts, and human cases during the Soviet and post-Sov governance periods. The study found a significant increase in anthrax cases from 1984 to 1995, followed by a decline after the introduction of livestock vaccination in 1996. The distribution of cases shifted from the west to the east over the 20 years after the Soviet Union's dissolution. Despite a decrease in cases, control measures are still needed to prevent its occurrence. The study highlights the need for an integrated "One Health" approach that considers the disease's changing distribution.

The study found two patterns: an increase in anthrax during Soviet governance, followed by a decline after vaccination, and a geographic shift in the disease's distribution. The study aimed to understand anthrax's occurrence, identify areas to control, and aid management. Cutaneous anthrax was concentrated in the west and south early, then shifted to the east in the mid-1990s and remained in the east and north during vaccination. A 1996 outbreak led to a comprehensive vaccination program. Anthrax has re-emerged in the Caucasus, raising concerns over potential spread.

The study found spatial and temporal changes in anthrax in Azerbaijan over 27 years, consistent with previous research on zoonotic diseases after the Soviet's dissolution.
Researchers have studied how polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUs) interact with the Shaker voltage-gated potassium (KV) channel, a protein that helps control the flow of potassium ions across cell membranes. They used computer simulations to model the interaction between the channel and a fatty acid-rich lipid layer. The study found a possible binding site for the fatty acid on the channel in its open state, at the protein-lip interface near the S3 and S helices of the voltage sensor domain. The fatty acid's tail interacted with non-specifically with the protein's hydrophobic core, while its head group interacted with charged residues on the S and S helices. The researchers also compared this to saturated fatty acids and found that polyunsaturated tails are more flexible, which may explain their specific effect on channels. Polyunsaturated acids are essential in cell membranes and have been shown to shift the Shaker channel's voltage sensitivity. However, the exact mechanism of this interaction was unclear. This study provides insight into how polyunsaturated acids modulate the channel, which could lead to new treatments for refractory epilepsy through ketogenic diets.
Researchers have developed a new pipeline to screen for anti-parasitic agents targeting Cryptosporidium parv's inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). This parasite causes significant disease in children in developing countries and can lead to life-threatening enteritis in AIDS patients. Current drugs are not effective in treating severe cases. The team engineered a related parasite, Toxoplas gondii, to serve as a model for C. parv infection, allowing them to test potential inhibitors. They also created a fluorescence-based assay to measure host cell proliferation and C. par growth, and a high-content imaging assay to measure C parum proliferation. Using these tools, they evaluated C. par IMH inhibitors and identified a subset of 1,2,3- triazole ethers with excellent selectivity in T. gondi and anti-parasitic activity. The pipeline uses a T. gondi model that mirrors C. par's purine pathway and depends on IMH for survival, providing a rapid assessment of anti-paras potential and target specificity. A host cell growth assay and high-content imaging assay were also developed to evaluate off-target effects. The team used this pipeline to probe structure-activity of a series of IMH inhibitors and identified two promising candidates, A103 and A110, which are 100 times more potent than the current standard paromycin.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the genetic factors influencing tooth development in infancy. They analyzed data from 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Birth Cohort and 1,518 from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. The study identified five genetic loci associated with tooth eruption time and number at one year of age. These loci included genes linked to tooth and organ development, such as KCNJ, EDA, HOXB, RADL, IGF1, HMGA, and MSRB. Four of the identified genes are involved in cancer development. A variant in the HO gene was linked to orthodontic treatment by age 31.

The study found that genes at these loci have roles in organogenesis, growth, and cancer. Mutations in three genes lead to altered organ development. KC2 affects teeth, jaws, palates, ears, fingers, toes, DA affects teeth, hair, sweat glands, saliv glands, and IGF1 intestines. A variant associated with breast cancer and a SNP near HM2 was linked to adult height. Given tooth's impact on dental occlusion, researchers hypothesized genetic determinants of tooth may associate with occlusion later life.

The study provides insight into primary dentition's genetic architecture and has implications for other developmental processes.
Researchers have created two new mouse models, TsY and MsY, to study the effects of trisomy and monomy of the Hspa-App region on chromosome 21, which is linked to Down syndrome. They found that trisomy and monomy of this region alter locomotion, muscle strength, mass, and balance. Gene expression in skeletal muscles showed changes in metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. Genes were downregulated in TsY mice and upregulated in MsY. Mitochondrial proliferation changed without altering function, but reactive oxygen species decreased in MsY while membrane permeability increased in Ts. The Hspa-App region controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles due to changes in Gabpa, N1, and Atp5. Results show that copy variation in this region affects locomotor by altering muscle function.
Researchers have created a mathematical model to understand how a type of potassium channel called GIRK/2 works. This channel is important for regulating heartbeat and brain cell activity. It's activated by a protein called Gβ from a group of proteins called Gi/o. There are two types of GIR/2 activities: one that happens all the time (basal) and one that happens when a neurotransmitter is present (evoked). The researchers wanted to know how these two activities are related. They studied GIR/2 in frog cells and brain cells and found that the amount of neurotransmitter needed to activate the channel (index) is inversely related to its basal activity. They created a model of GIR/2 function and tested it in frog cells and brain cells. The model accurately predicted basal and evoked currents in both. It also showed that the channel needs 3-4 Gβ molecules to work, but only 1-2 Gi molecules. The model suggests that Gβ binds to the channel, but Gi doesn't. This unequal association and how the channel works allows it to detect both Gβ and Gi.
Researchers have developed a new model, called PredTA, to predict where a type of protein called TALE (transcription activator-like effector) binds to DNA in plant cells. TALEs are secreted by a type of bacteria called Xanthomonas and help the bacteria infect the plant by turning on specific genes. TALEs have a unique structure with repeating parts that bind to DNA. The new model, PredTA, takes into account recent findings that TALEs can bind to DNA in different ways, such as with different lengths and orientations. It's trained on a large amount of data and tested on RNA data from Xanthas infecting rice. The results show PredTA is better than previous methods and finds new potential targets. However, some TALEs are not predicted by any tool, called orphan TALEs. The researchers think this is because of incomplete gene annotations and suggest looking at the whole genome for target boxes. They found known targets from whole-genome scans can be found with genome-wide scans and RNA data, detecting new targets not in existing genes.
Researchers have identified 24,189 possible non-synonymous amino acid changes in human mitochondrial DNA, but only a small subset has been functionally evaluated, while the majority's pathogenicity was assessed in-sil by software. These tools proved incongruent, so a new machine-learning algorithm, APOEE, was designed to outperform existing methods in estimating harmfulness of non-syn genome. APOEE was built on 864 known variants, randomly drawn with replacement, and tested on out-of-b sets. Performance metrics were calculated for individual and aggregated predictors, reported in Table 1. Co-evolving amino acids and mean Z-scores were computed for all 24,189 non-syn changes, available as a file. Variants were grouped and used to build and verify AEE. Predictions from tools were fed to AEE, a logistic model based on decision tree. APOEE's logic is transparent, finely tuned on mitochondrial variants, giving reproducible and easy-to-understand results. It uses three milestones: third-party features related to 13 proteins, multi-alignments and conservation, and decision tree learning to provide pathogenic rules. Assessing mitochondrial mutations is challenging in-vitro and inivo, due to paucity of funds or facilities, particularly with DNA being less studied than nuclear.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection, the most common mosquito-transmitted viral infection, can cause a range of diseases from self-limiting deng fever to life-threatening deng hemorrhagic fever syndrome. Thrombocopenia, a major observed in both mild and severe deng disease, is correlated with the progression of deng severity. Researchers found that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), secreted into patients' blood, can stimulate cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and cause endothelial leakage. However, it was unclear if DENV NS can directly induce platelet activation or thrombocytia during D infection. This study showed DENV, but not Zika virus culture supernatant, induced P-selectin expression and phosphatylser (PS) in human platelets, abolished when NS was depleted from D supernant. Similar results with recombinant NS from four D serotypes, blocked by anti-NS F(ab)2, anti-TL4, TLR antagonist LPS, and TLR inhibitor T242, but not polymyx B. Activation by D NS promoted adenos diphosphate (ADP)-induced plate aggregation and adhesion to endothelial and phagocyt by macrophages. D-induced thromocytia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR knockout and wild-type mice when NS was depleted from D supernant.
Researchers analyzed the complex systems that control blood pressure and blood volume in the body. They looked at three key players: arginine vasopressin (AV), atrial natriuretic peptide (AN), and renin-angiotin-aldosterone (RA) systems. These systems work together to regulate blood pressure and volume through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. The researchers found that these systems can be broken down into two main parts: one that affects blood pressure and one that affects volume. Both are like oscillators, meaning they can be stable or unstable. They also found that a part of the system involving AN and AV stimulation of smooth muscle cells can be unstable if feedback loops are delayed. This gives insight into how the body's long-term control of blood pressure and volume works, which is based on dynamic interactions between these systems.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism that regulates the growth of blood clots, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. They studied how a protein called fibrin, a component of blood clots, transports other proteins through its network. Experiments and computer simulations showed that the network's permeability and ability to let proteins pass through are key factors in this process. In mice studies, researchers found that clots covered in a layer of fibrin, called a fibr cap, prevent them from growing. Simulations using tiny devices that mimic blood flow and account for fibr's structure showed that thrombin inside the clot is washed out through the network, limiting platelets' exposure to it. This limits platelets' ability to reach high thrombin concentrations needed for activation and clot growth. The fibr cap also prevents small clots in small blood vessels from becoming life-threatening.
Researchers studied how a type of immune cell called invariant natural killer T (iKT) cells respond to infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a bacterium that causes tuberculosis. They found that iKT cells are activated during infection, but their role in controlling bacterial growth was unclear. The team investigated how iKT cells suppress Mtb replication when co-cultured with infected macrophages. They discovered that iKT activation, measured by CD25 upregulation and IFγ production, was primarily driven by IL-12 and IL-18 produced by macrophages. However, iKT control of M growth was CD1-dependent and did not require IL-12, IL-18, or IFγ. This showed that conventional markers of iKT activation did not correlate with their effector function during M infection. iKT control of M replication was also independent of TN and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. By separating cytokine-driven activation and CD1-restricted effector function, researchers found a novel mediator of iKT antimicrobial activity: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMF). iKT produced GMF in vitro and in vivo in a CD1-dependent manner during M infection, and GMF was necessary and sufficient to control M growth. The study identified GMF as a novel iKT antimicrobial effector function and a potential role for GM in cell immunity against M.
Researchers studied how the fungus Candida albicans, a common inhabitant of the human gut, regulates its population size during colonization. They found that the EF1 gene, which encodes a transcription factor, is highly expressed when C. albicans grows in the intestine. Surprisingly, a mutant lacking EF1 colonized the mouse intestine more than normal C. albicans, while overexpressing EF1 colonized the intestine and oral cavity of immune-deficient mice less. When injected into the bloodstream, both strains caused lethal infections, but other mutants with reduced virulence colonized normally. Expression of several genes depends on EF1 in lab, but not in the intestine. This shows EF1 regulates colonizing C. alb, favoring commensalism over candidiasis. Different genes are needed in different niches and pathways may differ from lab-grown.
Immunization with irradiated malaria sporozoites is the most effective way to protect against the liver stage of the malaria parasite, but how it works is not fully understood. Researchers found that CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell, need to see the parasite antigen for a long time to develop a strong response. They used a special cells that recognize a key protein of the parasite and found that the antigen stays in the body for 8 weeks after immunization. This is surprising because the irradiated sporites can't multiply and only live a short time. The antigen stays in lymph nodes and depends on a type of cell called dendritic cells. Having the antigen for a long time helps CD8 cells in three ways: it makes more of them, makes them last longer, and makes new ones that can fight the parasite. This study shows that to protect against malaria liver stage, CD8 cells need to see the antigen for a long time.
Researchers have developed a new way to deliver a drug called polymyxin B to fight leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites. This method uses tiny particles called nanocarriers to carry the drug, making it more effective and reducing side effects. The nanocarriers, called PBCp, were made with a special polymer and tested for size, shape, charge, and how they release the drug. They found that the drug released slowly over time, which is good for a prolonged effect. In lab tests, the nanocar with the drug killed Leish amastigotes, the parasite form that infects macrophages. However, the drug alone was not enough to kill all parasites, limiting its use. The nanar also had antibacterial properties, helping prevent secondary infections that often occur with leishiasis. This is the first time a drug delivery system has shown both leishicidal and antibacterial properties.
A study in Brazil investigated the factors associated with death from visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Belo Horizont. The analysis was based on data from the Report Disease Information System-SAN (Brazilian Ministry of Health) from 2002-2009. The study found that weakness, Leishmaniasis-HIV co-infection, and age 60 or older were associated with a higher risk of death from VL in the first period. In the second period, bleeding, other infections, jaundice, and age 60 or older were linked to a higher risk of death. A prognostic score was developed using the variables from the latest SIN version of the study. The score's performance was evaluated with sensitivity 71.4%, specificity 73.7%, positive predictive values 28.9% and 94.5, and area under the receiver characteristic curve 75.6. The findings agree with the Brazilian Ministry of Health that age, jaice, bleeding, and co-morbidities are associated with death from VL. Leishiasis-H co-infection can worsen the condition in co-infected patients. A study in north-east Brazil found six of nine Leishias-H co-infected patients progressed to death. VL causes 500,000 cases and 50,000 deaths worldwide, mostly in six countries. In Latin America, Leishias infantum is the causative agent.
Plants rely heavily on receptor-like kinases (RLs) to perceive and integrate external and internal stimuli. The Arabidopsis regulatory leucine-rich RL (L-RL) BAK is involved in hormone responses, immunity, and cell control. A novel allele of BAK, bak-1, regulates three different BAK-dependent pathways. Innate immune signaling by BAK-dependent RKs FLS and EFR is severely compromised in bak-1 mutants, but bak- mutants are not impaired in BR or cell control. FLS and E have low kinase activity and cannot phosphorylate BAK in vitro. Kinase activity is not required for ligand-induced heteromerization of F or E with BAK in planta. The suppression of F and E-dependent signaling in bak- is due to B interaction with the ligand RK but requires B activity. Our results show phosphorylation-dependent control of growth, immunity, and cell by RL BAK, revealing differences in mechanisms underlying regulation of ligand RD and non-RKs. The interaction of E and F with B is a requirement, not consequence of detectable phosphorylation, unlike BRI activity for lig-induced formation with B in planta. B dictates specificity downstream signaling as B- nearly blocked F and E-mediated PT signaling but influenced BR. The heterization with B in immunity is substantiated by targeting the lig-induced B- interaction by bacterial effector Avr to block PT signaling.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how cancer cells respond to treatment using a combination of time-lapse cell microscopy and flow cytometry data. They created a computer model that shows how cells go through the cell cycle and subsequent generations after treatment. The model describes the activity of main pathways that cause arrest, repair, and death in each phase of the cell cycle. This method was tested on human ovarian cancer cells treated with X-rays at different doses. The best model was built by combining data from all doses and platforms, giving the first complete in-silico rendering of cell cycle after X-ray exposure. The model shows how G1, S, and G2 checkpoint activities depend on dose in subsequent generations, reconciling known effects of ionizing radiation and new insights in a unique scenario. The method allows studying proliferation in presence of anticancer treatment by simulating cycling treated cells with modules that can be applied to any phase. It uses simple descriptors of intracellular controls and outputs that can be fitted to data from time-lapse microscopy and flow cytometry. The model gives a dynamic 72-hour rendering of cells through phases and generations for controls and X-ray doses. This method enables detailed study of mechanisms of anticancer response at population level, accounting for inter-cell variability.
Researchers have found that a genetic mutation in the Pd2 gene, which is involved in the production of coenzyme Q, leads to kidney disease in mice. Coenzyme Q is a crucial for energy production in cells and its deficiency has been linked to various human diseases. The study found that mice with a specific mutation in the P2 gene had lower levels of coenzyme Q in their kidneys and developed kidney disease. The disease started in the glomerular podocytes, a type of kidney cell, and not in other cells like liver or tubular epithelium. This suggests that glomer podocytes are more sensitive to co Q deficiency. The researchers also found that the disease was not caused by inflammation, but by the body's attempt to clean up damaged cells. They created mice without the P2 gene in just in kidney cells and found the same disease, but not in mice without it in other cells. The study suggests that co Q deficiency affects different tissues in different ways and glomer podocytes are most affected. This research can help understand human disease caused by co Q deficiency, which is linked to mutations in several genes.
Scientists have long known that living organisms can withstand environmental and genetic disruptions, but the mechanisms behind this ability, called phenotypic robustness, were unclear. Researchers studied the development of two types of organisms, protostomes and deuterostomes, and found that their cell lineages are structured in a way that makes them resistant to cell deaths. This robustness is due to several features of the lineages, including their simplicity, topology, early appearance of cells, and diversity of cell types. Simulations showed that this robustness may have evolved as an adaptation to random cell deaths during development. This study reveals new principles of developmental lineages and a mechanism of phenotypic robust, important for understanding development and evolution.
Researchers have developed a new high-throughput platform called EmbryoPhomics to study the development of aquatic embryos. This platform consists of an open-source microscope, OpenIM, which captures high-resolution videos of multiple embryos under controlled conditions, and a Python package Embryo Vision, EmbCV, which analyzes the videos to extract data on morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits during development. The team tested Embryoomics on two species, the pond snail Radix bica and the amphipod Orchestia gammellus, exposing them to different environmental changes in temperature and salinity. They acquired over 30 million images and extracted data from 95% of them, describing the embryos' responses. Embryoomics can capture functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest life stages, making it a game-changer for studying development and phenomics. The platform is versatile and can be applied to various experimental designs, from short to long-term exposures, and species with different patterns of development. EmbCV is a package for automated analysis of video data, extracting large quantities of biologically relevant measurements. OpenIM can image large numbers of embryos at different scales. The sequence can be used to visualize short-term changes in physiology and behavior.
Malaria parasites, such as Plasmodium, have different nutritional environments in their life cycles between mosquitoes and humans. To adapt to these environments, their metabolism changes dramatically, shifting from glycolytic in asexual stages to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism in mosquito stages. Researchers used stable isotope labeling, metabolomics, and genetics to study stage-specific changes in Plasium berghei carbon metabolism and its impact on survival in blood and mosquito stages. They found glutamine is a key input for T metabolism in both asexual and sexual stages and essential for gametogenesis. Glutamine catabolism and intermediary metabolism are crucial for ookin tooc transition in mosquito. This study extends knowledge of Plasium metabolism and suggests targets for transmission-blocking strategies. It also highlights differences between Plasium species not anticipated by genomics or transcriptomics, emphasizing the importance of integrating metabolomics with other platforms for drug discovery.
Biologists have long known that cells can distinguish between different types of signals, such as pulsatile and sustained signals, to regulate gene expression. A common underlying mechanism for this is the incoherent forward loop (IL), where an input activates an output and its inhibitor. This motif can adapt to sustained signals, making it useful for distinguishing signals with varying profiles. Researchers studied the IL's ability to process oscillatory signals and found it's limited by two constraints: the kinetics of its components and a match between network and signal characteristics. With proper parameters, the IL can respond to transient but not sustained signals. This property is crucial for processing oscillatory signals, which many natural networks exhibit. The IL is a general motif downstream of divergent signals in amoeba and mammalian cell differentiation, despite differences in dynamics.
Researchers have developed improved methods for growing, purifying, and storing Orientia tsutsamushi, a bacterium that causes scrub typhus, a serious illness in Southeast Asia. This bacterium is difficult to study because it can only grow in mammalian cells and requires specific conditions. The team grew O. tsamushi in mouse cells and measured its growth using a specific DNA test. They found conditions that improved its growth and viability. They also developed a method to compare its purity after treatment and storage under different conditions. This will help researchers studying O. tsam and other similar bacteria like Ricketts and Chlamydia. Scrub tyus is a leading cause of fever and miscarriage and poor birth outcomes in Laos. O. tsam is a member of the Ricketiaceae family but differs from Ricketia in structure and properties. The study aimed to create a toolkit for future research on this neglected pathogen. A simplified growth assay was used to compare its growth across conditions, useful for comparing antibiotic sensitivity of isolates. O. tsam was quantified by extracting DNA and measuring its genome copy number using a specific primer. This is a concern because bacterial culture can't be used for diagnosis and reduces isolates for research. The study improved methods for quantification, propagation, and storage of O. tsam.
Researchers investigated the safety and effectiveness of the antiparasitic drug praziquel (PQ) in treating schistosomiasis in children aged 1-5 years. Currently, children in this age group are excluded from schistosom control programs due to lack of P data on Q's safety in this age group. The study involved 104 Zimbabwean children aged 1-5 who received P tablets and their caregivers reported side effects within 24 hours. Efficacy was determined 6 weeks later through schosom egg counts in urine. Compared to 6-10 year olds, pre-treatment schosom infection in 1-5 olds was 14.6 eggs/10ml and prevalence 21%. 3.8% reported side effects: stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and face/body inflammation. P treatment reduced schom levels in 1-5 olds by 99% and 92% cure rate, comparable to 6-10 olds 96% and 67%. P is safe and effective in 1-5 olds as in 6-10 olds.
Researchers used fruit flies to identify genes that help prevent cancer caused by a common mutation in the Ras gene. This mutation is found in about 30% of human cancers, but alone it's not enough to cause cancer. They looked for other genes that work with Ras to cause cancer. They found many genes that are conserved between flies and humans, meaning they work the same way in both. Some of these genes were down in many human tumors, making them potential markers for cancer diagnosis. One of the top genes, Tetrasin 29b, was studied in more. It helps control growth and invasion of cancer cells by working with another gene, EGFR. The study found many new genes that work with Ras to cause cancer and one that could be targets for treatment.
Scientists have discovered a gene in the fungus Schizosaccharces pombe that acts as a "poison-antote" meiotic driver, meaning it kills spores that don't inherit it while protecting those that do. This gene, wtf13, is a type of selfish allele that tries to increase its own transmission into the next generation, but at a cost to the rest of the genome. Researchers found that w13 is suppressed by another gene, w18, which makes an antidote that only rescues spores that inherit it, not all spores in general. This is a new way for meiotic drivers to be suppressed and sheds light on how these systems evolve. Four other w genes in S. pombe were previously found to be meiotic drivers, killing spores that don't inherit them. One of these, w4, causes drive by poison and antidote mechanism. The new study shows w13 acts similarly, killing spores that don't inherit it, but w18 rescues those that do. This is different from how suppressors of meiotic drivers usually work, which rescue all spores indiscriminately.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm that can predict how genes are expressed in an individual's body based on their genetic information. The algorithm uses data from a group of individuals to predict how genes are expressed in another individual with similar genetic makeup. The predictions are surprisingly accurate, even when the group and individual are from different populations. This means the algorithm can identify which genes are affected by genetic variation and how much they are affected. However, the number of genes that can be predicted is limited because other factors like environment and sequence variation are not considered. The algorithm is improved by giving more weight to certain genetic variations that are close to genes or have high GC content. Genes that can be predicted have higher expression and more variation among individuals, showing what types of genes can be affected by genetic variation. The algorithm can also predict genes in individuals from different populations, suggesting some genetic variation is shared across populations. The goal is to predict gene expression based on genetic variation to understand disease susceptibility and phenotypes.
Researchers studied how different strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium chaudi interact with each other inside the body. They found that a more virulent strain can suppress the growth of a less virulent strain by changing how the immune system clears the parasite from the blood. The study used a mathematical model to test if this suppression was due to differences in how the parasite invades red blood cells, how long it stays in the blood, or how the immune system attacks it. They found that the rate at which the parasite is cleared from the blood is the key factor. This rate was the same for both strains when alone, but different when together. The difference was biggest in mice with a strong immune system and smallest in mice with weak immune system. This is why suppression was less in mice with weak immune. The study also found suppression happens early in infection, before parasite numbers peak. This suggests the immune system's first response to the parasite is the main cause of competition, but not the only one. In mixed infections, the parasite and immune system interact, changing how it clears the parasite. This interaction is unknown, but more data may reveal it.
Researchers have proposed a new model, called Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification (ODIR), to explain how genetic errors during DNA replication can lead to the formation of interstitial inverted duplications, a type of copy number variation (CNV) in the genome. This model suggests that replication errors at existing short, interrupted, inverted repeats in genomic sequences create an extrachromosomal, autonomously replicating intermediate, which integrates into the genome as a CNV without losing distal chromosomal sequences. To test this, scientists used a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. They found that the proposed replication error, where leading and lagging strands are ligated to create a closed fork, can occur in vitro at short, interrupted repeats. This results in a hairpin-linear duplex that replicates in vivo to create an inverted dimer plasmid, which integrates into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inversion. This model can also explain the generation of human, de novo, inverted amplicons with a 2:1 mixture of sequences from homologues of a single parent, a feature explained by a plasm intermediate from one homologue integrating into the other prior meiosis.
Researchers have studied how the influenza virus affects the way cells in which it infects to make proteins. They found that the virus can start making proteins at unusual places in the genetic code, called non-canonical start codons, in response to stress in the cell. This can lead to the creation of new immune targets for the immune system to attack. The team looked at how often this happens in human cells infected with the flu virus. They found that some lineages of the virus, which have adapted to infect humans, show signs of selection against using non-canonical start codons. They then used a technique called ribosome profiling to see where proteins are made in human cells infected with the virus. They found several places where the virus makes proteins at non-canonical start codons, including one that makes a shorter version of a protein called neuraminidase. This shorter version is active and found on the surface of the virus and is common in many lineages. They also found that some host proteins made by the cell in response to the virus infection are more likely to be made at non-canonical start codons. The study mapped the landscape of protein making in virus-infected cells and showed how evolution has shaped this process.
Enteric bacterial pathogens, such as Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHE), cause severe diarrhea and kidney disease in humans through contaminated food, water, and animal contact. HE has no effective treatment or prevention. HE and other enteric pathogens use a type III secretion system (TSS) to inject proteins into host cells. This study found that E. coli O157:H7's nH and nH2 genes bind to human ribosomal protein 3 (R3), a part of the NF-κ transcription complex. nH and n2 localized in the cytoplasm, not nucleus. The N-terminal of n and n required binding to R3's N-terminus. n and n are autophosphorylated, but binding to R3 is independent. n reduced R3 abundance without affecting NF-κ subunits or phosphorylation. n repressed a R3/NF-dependent reporter, but not R-independent. n stimulated R-dependent and AP-1 reporter. A region of n (40-45) is responsible for n's inhibitory activity toward R3. Deleting n from E. O:H produced a hyper-virulent phenotype in a pig model of Shiga toxin E infection. This suggests n disrupts host immune responses by binding a cofactor of transcription complexes.
Researchers have developed a new way to model how proteins bind to DNA, called feature models (FMs). This approach is different from the current method, position scoring matrix (PM), which assumes each spot on the DNA is independent. The new model, FMs, can capture complex relationships between spots and other features like palindromes. It's like a generalization of PM, allowing for more detailed understanding of protein-DNA interactions. The team created an algorithm to learn these features from data and a tool to find new FMs in sequences. They tested it on synthetic data and a large dataset of protein-DNA interactions and found it works better than PM. They applied it to high-throughput data from mice and humans, showing FMs explain protein binding better than PM. The new model and tool are available online.
Researchers studied the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system in humans and chimpanzees, focusing on the adrenergic α2 receptor (AD2) gene, which is an inhibitory modulator of the sympathetic nervous system. They found that knockout mice lacking this gene exhibit physiological and behavioral changes associated with the fight-or-flight response, suggesting its importance in regulating stress response. The gene's expression is lower in humans and chimpanzees compared to other primates. Using 3D chromatin structure, they identified a regulatory region with accelerated DNA sequences in humans and chimpanze, with active histone marks in rhes macaque but repressive marks in humans. This region contains neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRS) motifs, one of which has a polymorphism. Genotyping analysis shows the derived allele fixed in humans and chimpanze but not bonob, while the ancestral is present in macques. CRISPR/Cas editing and reporter assays show the derived repress AD2, likely by increasing NRS binding. Signatures of recent selection for lower AD2 expression in humans indicate pressure for enhanced sympathetic activity in evolution of humans and chimpanze.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the convergent evolution of the C4 photosynthetic pathway in plants, which allows for a 50% increase in productivity in tropical and subtropical areas. This complex trait has evolved independently in at least 60 lineages of monocots and dicots. To understand how these separate lineages use the same genetic networks to maintain C4 photosynthesis, researchers developed a new informatics framework to compare gene expression in species lacking reference genomes. They studied two independent C lineages, Cleomeandra and Zea mays, whose common ancestor diverged 140 million years ago. A cohort of 3,335 genes represent conserved in leaf and photosynthetic development in these species. Genes encoding the C cycle are recruited into networks by photos-related genes. Despite wide separation and independent origins, species use homolog transcription factors to induce C photosynthesis and maintain specific expression for the pathway. A core molecular signature is shared by angiosperms derived from the common ancestor of monocots and dicots. Deep comparisons reveal insight into convergence of complex phenotypes and parallel evolution of transactors underpinning C photosynthesis. Exploiting natural variation can identify regulators and shared transcription factors are key for engineering C pathway into C crops like rice.
During the 2013-2016 Ebola virus (EBO) epidemic in West Africa, the virus spread to Europe and North America, infecting several healthcare workers. To understand how EBO behaves in the body and how it's transmitted between people, researchers studied a healthcare worker infected with EBO in Sierra Leone who was hospitalized in Italy. They looked at EBO's genetic material (RNA) in the upper and lower respiratory tract and blood over time. They found EBO's genetic material persisted in the lower respiratory tract even after it was cleared from the blood, suggesting it might be replicating there. This study aims to improve understanding EBO's features that make it contagious and develop effective interventions. Further research is needed to understand what this means for human-to-human transmission.

Researchers compared EBO's genetic material in a patient's respiratory and blood samples over time. They found EBO RNA decayed faster in blood than in respiratory samples. This suggests EBO might be more stable in the respiratory tract than previously thought. Detection of EBO RNA in respiratory samples, but not blood, supports replication in the tract, not just stability. The presence of replication markers in respiratory with undetectable RNA in blood can be explained by EBO replicating in lung tissues. A recent study found EBO replicates in human airways, supported by post-mortem analysis of fatal cases.
Researchers studied the Machupo virus (MAC), a New Worldnavirus that causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, and its relative Jun virus (JUN), which causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever. They created a recombinant, chimeric virus (rMAC/Cd1-G) that expresses the glycoprotein from the Candid1 (Cd1) strain of JUN and found it to be completely attenuated in a murine model, protecting animals from lethal challenge with MAC. However, a single mutation in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of the glycoprotein, equivalent to the attenuating mutation in Cd1, was not sufficient to fully attenuate JUN. To investigate the role of different domains of Cd1 glycoprotein in attenuation, they created several rMACs expressing the ectomain glyprotein from Cd1 alone (MC1), with the TMD substitution (MC2), or the T of Cd1 (3). All rMAC exhibited similar growth in cultured cells, but MC1 showed significant reduction in lethality compared to rMAC. MC1 was detected in brains and spleens of MC-infected mice, associated with tissue inflammation, while MC2 and MC3-infected animals survived without detectable virus in organs, producing neutralizing antibodies against Cd1. The study suggests the indispensable role of each glycoprotein domain in full attenuation and immunogenicity of rMAC/C1-G.
Scientists have studied a protein called centromere histone 3 (CH) that helps separate chromosomes during cell division in plants. They made changes to the CH protein in Arabidopsis plants to see how it affects their growth and reproduction. Some plants with changed CH grew normally and produced seeds, but when crossed with regular plants, their seeds died or didn't develop properly. This is called postzygotic incompatibility and uniparent inheritance. The researchers found that changing just one amino acid in the CH protein's structure can cause this problem. This is similar to what happens when CH from different species are mixed. They also found a simple way to identify plants with this problem by looking for a specific change in the CH protein. They tested this method and found a plant with the change produced seeds that died or didn't develop when crossed with regular plants. The study shows that small changes in CH can cause big problems in plant reproduction and that can be identified with a simple test.
Researchers studied how human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) differentiate into cardiac precursors, focusing on the role of alternative splicing. They modified the H9 hESC line to select for pluripotent cells with neomycin resistance and cardiac progenitors with puromycin resistance. Analyzing microarray data from undifferentiated hES and cardiac precursors, they identified spliceforms with cardiac-restricted or common/neural expression patterns. These events corresponded to pathways like cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle control, as well as genes with ser/threon kinase and helase activity. A new program, AltAnalyze, predicted changes in protein and microRNA binding sites affecting function and expression. Enriched isoforms oppose cell arrest in hES and promote signaling and development in cardiac prec. Combining genome-wide splicing with new annotations, they suggest mechanisms influencing commitment and maintenance at the level of isoforms and regulation.
Researchers have identified a potential target for developing new antibiotics against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a bacterium that causes tuberculosis, by studying its trehalose biosynthesis pathway. Trehalose is a sugar molecule essential for the bacterium's growth and survival. Two enzymes, T6-phosphate synthase O and T-phosphatase, produce trehal from glucose and AD/UDP-glucose. To test the potential of Tphatase as a target, scientists created a mutant of M. tuberculosis that can turn off the Tphat gene. They found that Tphase is crucial for the bacterium's growth in lab and early infection in mice, but not in chronic infection. This suggests that trehal metabolism changes during infection. Blocking Tph led to a toxic buildup of its substrate, T, causing cell death. Blocking T production in a mutant without Tase made Tph non-essential. This led to over 800 gene upregulation, possibly due to increased RNA stability and toxin neutralization. Surprisingly, a similar buildup of another toxic molecule, maltose-phosphate, had minimal effect. A search for genes interacting with Tase revealed potential targets for combination therapies to prevent resistance to Tase inhibitors.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, affects 11-18 million people worldwide. Current treatments are limited and have poor efficacy and safety profiles. Researchers have identified an enzyme called Trypanosoma cruzi proline racemase (TPR) as a potential target for new treatments. The enzyme's shape changes when it binds to a substrate are thought to expose parts that trigger a strong immune response in the host, helping the parasite evade the immune system. To understand these changes, scientists used advanced computer simulations to study the enzyme's long-term movements. They found potential areas on the enzyme that could be targeted by the immune system. The study reveals new shapes of the enzyme and how it changes between open and closed states, advancing understanding of its function. This work is a step towards understanding why the enzyme triggers a strong immune response and could lead to new treatments for Chagas disease.
Scientists have developed a new method to turn genes on and off at will in mice, called the inducible knockout (iKO) system. This system uses two genetically modified mice: one with a gene knocked out (KO) and another with a gene that can be turned on and off with doxycycline. The KO line has a doxycycline-dependent activator replacing the target gene, while the other has doycine-inducible DNA of the gene inserted into a tightly regulated genomic locus. This allows for low expression and high inducibility. A method was created to introduce genes into the locus of embryonic stem cells by recombinase insertion. Both KO and lines were engineered for high-throughput and cost-effective production of iKO mice. The system was tested by creating iKO in the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene, allowing sensitive and quantitative analyses. Results showed reversible switching of Apo transcription, cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression and regression. The i system is a versatile and can be adapted to various applications.
Researchers studied how the placenta responds to an infection by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which can be passed from mother to fetus during pregnancy. They infected mice with two different strains of the parasite, K and V, and looked at how the placenta reacted. They used a technique called functional genomics to see which genes were turned on or off in the placenta. The results showed that the placenta had a strong response to the infection, but it was different depending on the type of parasite. One strain, V, made the placenta turn on genes that help fight infection, while the other, K, made it turn off genes that help the parasite survive. The study found that strain V was more likely to infect the placenta and stay there. This is the first study to look at how the placenta responds to Trypanosoma cruzi in a mouse model. It suggests that the placenta has a strong response to the parasite, but it's different depending on the type, which might help prevent the parasite from passing to the fetus.
Sindbis virus (SINV) polyarthritis, also known as Ockbo disease in Sweden and Pog disease in Finland, is a mosquito-borne virus that mainly occurs in tropical and subtropical countries. In Europe, it causes recurring outbreaks, with seven-year cycles reported in scientific papers, but based on human cases only. To find a more objective outbreak signal, researchers evaluated mosquito and SINV prevalence in vectors in an endemic area in central Sweden. Mosquitoes were collected in the Riveräl floodplains in 2000, 2001, and 2002, and assayed for virus on cell culture. Obtained isolates were sequenced, and nucleotide sequences analyzed using Bayesian clade and joining analysis. One SINV strain was found in 200, four in 200, and 15 in 200, with increased infection rates in both enzotic and bridge vectors in 200. Maximum likelihood infection rates were 1.0/1000 in enotic Cx torrentipiens and 0.62/100 in bridge Aedes in 200, compared to 0.9/100 and 0/100 in 200 and 0/100 and 0.32 in 200. Sequence analysis showed all isolates belonged to SINV I (S-I). Genetic analysis revealed local maintenance of S-I clades in Riveräl floodplains over years. Findings suggest increased S-I in vectors constitutes valuable marker for scrutinizing hypothesized seven-year S-I outbreaks and mechanisms.
Researchers studied how the locust's sense of smell works, specifically how the brain processes information from the antennae to the mushroom body, a region linked to memory. They found that only a few neurons in the mushroom body responded to a specific smells, while different smells triggered different neurons. To understand this, they created a model to see if changes in connections between brain cells could control which neurons respond to familiar smells. The model showed that changes in connections between the antennal lobe and mushroom body efficiently filtered out strong signals and condensed them into a sparse representation in the mushroom body. This process, driven by activity, made responses specific, reliable, and long-lasting, suggesting it plays a role in processing information and making predictions about plasticity at these connections. 

The study focused on Kenyon cells in the mushroom body, which receive information from antennal lobe neurons. It's a simple system to study how neural codes and plasticity interact, as other senses may use similar strategies. This is consistent with recent findings on pre-synaptic plasticity between Kenyon cells and mushroom neurons in olfactory memory. Recordings in locust showed synapses from Kenyon cells onto targets are excitatory and undergo short-term plasticity. Little is known about the circuit, architecture, properties, and role of ensembles in locust olfaction, but the spatio-temporal input to mushroom is well-characterized, making it ideal to study interaction of coding and plasticity. In the antennalobe, oscillation is a feature of population coding during odor presentation, transient ensembles are formed and participate in encoding.
Researchers conducted the Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene (ST) study to identify genes associated with the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). They analyzed the expression of 15,042 genes in liver, skeletal muscle, visceral fat, and atherosclerotic and unaffected arterial tissues from 278 patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery. The study found 60 clusters of genes, with two of which were associated with the extent of coronary stenosis in atherosclerotic arterial and visceral fat. These clusters were validated by analyzing carotid atheros expression profiles. One cluster related to carot stenosis and 27 genes to coronary stenosis were confirmed. Genes in the transendothelial migration of leukocytes (TE) pathway were overrepresented in all clusters, referred to as atherosclerosis module (A). The A-module was found to be enriched with CAD risk 1.8-fold. Transcription-factor LIM binding 2 (L2) was identified as a potential regulator of A, supported by subnetwork analysis and expression of 13 TE genes in L2-deficient arterial. The A-module appears to be important for atherosclerosis and L2 merits attention in CAD research.
Researchers have been studying the circadian clock in cyanobacteria, specifically the Synechoccus, to understand how it works. They found that the Kai protein, a central to the clock, is involved in both activating and repressing its own transcription. Kai goes through different phospho-states over 24 hours, but it was unclear which state promotes expression and which suppresses transcription. A new model, called TT/PT, was created to analyze combinations of positive and negative feedback regulation. Only one two-loop mechanism out of 32 tested could reproduce existing observations, including effects of knocking out or overexpressing Kai genes. Phosphorylated KaiC activates and unphosphorylated KaiC suppresses Kai transcription. The model suggests the ratio of positive and negative components of Kai expression is key to how two-loop models respond to removal or overexpression of Kai genes. This model could help reveal how the circadian pathways allow Kai to control rhythmically regulate genes in the cyanobacterial genome. Data supports the view that different phosph-states of Kai govern the timing of the cyanobacterial oscillator and clock. Kai promotes expression of its own transcript and represses it, but which state is unclear. The regulation of Kai plays a role in regulating the cyanob clock. In Synechoccus, the three genes are adjacent, with Kai and Kai expressed as a dicronic, while Kai has its own promoter. Kai is rhythmically abundant but not its protein. Activation and repression of Kai is accompanied by transcription activation and inhibition of clock genes. In Synechoccus, 30-64% of the transcriptome is under circadian control, while Kai and Kai exhibit circadian cycles. Overexpression of Kai resets the rhythm, but existing reports on transcription/translation regulation are inconsistent.
Researchers studied HIV-2 infection in people with slow or no disease progression to understand why it's not as severe as HIV-1. They found that HIV-2 doesn't infect immune cells called monocytes and mostly infects a specific type of immune cell called transitional-memory CD4 T cells. This is different from HIV-1, which infects both monocytes and central-memory CD T cells. The researchers also found that HIV-2 uses a different co-receptor, CXCR, to enter cells, while HIV-1 uses CCR5. This difference might explain why HIV-2 is less severe. They analyzed blood cells from 14 people with HIV-2 and found HIV-2 DNA in transitional CD T cells in 4 of them, but only 1 person had it in central-memory T cells. HIV-2 was activated in cells from 3 people. The study suggests HIV-2 reservoirs are different from HIV-1 reservoirs, with less infection in monocytes and more in transitional T cells due to lower CXCR expression and higher TRIM, a restriction factor. This sheds light on why HIV-2 is less severe, similar to other models of attenuated HIV/SIV infections.
Researchers have developed a new model called the Attention Routing Circuit (ARC) that explains how the brain processes selective attention in the visual cortex. This model is different from previous models because it's based on individual spiking neurons and shows how attention affects different areas of the brain. The ARC model was tested on macaque monkeys and matched several types of attention effects seen in the brain. It shows that when attention shifts, some neurons change their receptive fields and respond more strongly to certain features, but not others. This is different from previous models that said attention affects all features equally. The ARC also predicts that different attention effects are caused by a single mechanism, not multiple. This is supported by various data and makes testable predictions. 

The model overcomes past limitations by providing a unified explanation of attention effects, being implemented in spiking neurons, relating attention across areas, and comparing to data, and making predictions. It's a large-scale hierarchical model with a functional mechanism for attention routing and a spiking implementation for five attention effects. The model predicts that more neurons in higher areas show attention as they switch from default to selective state during demanding tasks. The magnitude of modulation increases in higher areas.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common and debilitating heart rhythm disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Researchers have identified over 35 genes linked to AF, but most were found in small studies with limited replication, leaving the role of genetic variation in AF unclear. A team of scientists analyzed whole genome data from 1,734 individuals with AF and 9,423 without AF from three large studies: Framingham Heart, Atherosclerosis Risk Communities, and NHLBI Exome Sequencing. They looked for genetic variations in 37 suspected AF genes and found none were significantly associated with AF after adjusting for multiple testing. A common variant in SYN2 gene was linked to AF, but more research is needed to determine if it causes the condition. The study suggests that large genetic variations are not the main cause of AF, and future efforts to find meaningful variations may require larger sample sizes or specific populations. AF is heritable, with one in four having a relative with the condition, and current treatments have limited efficacy and side effects. Genome-wide studies have identified variants near channels, transcription factors, and other genes in AF, but causal genes remain unknown. Whole-genome sequencing may clarify genetic contributions to AF.
Between 1990 and 2011, a total of 121 cases of alveolar echoccosis (AE) were diagnosed in Poland, with 83.6% confirmed, 16 probable, and 22 possible. The number of cases increased over the two decades. The average age of diagnosis was 47.7 years, with a male to female ratio of 0.86:1. The disease was fatal in 19% of patients, with an average age at death of 54.1 years. Aggregation of AE was found in 4 foci involving 9 patients, and 76 cases were diagnosed in an advanced stage. The liver was the primary location in all cases, with 24.8% of patients showing spread to other organs. 94 patients were treated with albendazole and 73 underwent surgery, including 15 liver transplants. Studies show AE is an emerging disease in Poland, the fourth in Europe with over 120 cases. The results indicate a need for a national screening program in highest risk areas (north-east Poland) and public awareness of Echinococcus multular and training of primary physicians for early detection.
Researchers studied how the bacteria E. coli responds to changes in zinc levels in its environment. They focused on the zinc-sensing protein, Zur, which regulates genes that help the bacteria cope with zinc fluctuations. The team solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to a specific promoter and found that it represses gene expression by binding cooperatively to two dimers around the promoter. This cooperative binding requires a specific interaction between two dimers. They also discovered a new gene, pliG, regulated by Zur in a zinc-dependent manner. The plG promoter forms complexes with one or two dimers with less cooperativity than other regulated promoters. The team compared Zur-DNA binding at four regulated promoters and found a 10,000-fold variation in binding constants. The degree of repression in vivo matches this trend, with a 100-fold difference in transcript copy number between wild-type and Δzur strains. This suggests that the number of Fur dimers binding varies and the thermodynamics of Zur-D interactions correlate with physiological responses at different promoters.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a zoonotic disease that affects livestock, causing high morbidity and mortality. In 2008-2009, an outbreak occurred in Madagascar, including the Anjoabe district in highlands. An entomological survey found no Aedes mosquitoes, the RV virus vector, and low mosquito abundance due to unfavorable climate. Serological and virological tests showed no infection in wild mammals, suggesting no RV virus reservoir. However, three-year follow-up in cattle showed RV circulation. To understand this, a spatial metapulation model combined with cattle trade network was designed. Three scenarios explained RV circulation: i) RV overwintering due to direct transmission between vemic cows, ii) low vector circulation due to residual population, iii) combination. Model results showed both mechanisms, 84% vector-borne, 16 direct transmission. Sensitivity analysis confirmed results. Interactions between agriculture, vector seasonality, and cattle practices are key to RV circulation in Madagascar highlands.
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an invasive and aggressive daytime-biting species that poses a major public health threat in its expanding range. To understand its history and contemporary movements in the Indo-Pacific region, researchers analyzed 13 microsatellite loci from 911 individuals and mitochondrial COI sequences. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) was used to test competing invasion routes of Ae. albict in the Southeast Asian-Australian region. Results show Ae. albict was likely introduced to New Guinea via mainland Asia, colonizing the Solomon Islands via Papua New Guinea or Asia. The incursion into northern Australia's Torres Strait was seeded from Indonesia. A recently colonized population in the Torres Islands has undergone rapid genetic changes, possibly due to drift or a secondary invasion from an unknown source. There is high genetic structure and gene flow between geographically distant populations, driven by human dispersal. This study provides a wider distribution of the species' range, revealing more spatial structure than previously shown. The probable invasion history of Ae. albict in the Australasian region was analyzed using ABC. Populations from the Indian Ocean, Fiji, Naur, and USA were not included due to insufficient sampling. COI and microsatellites were analyzed together using ABC in DIY 2.1.0. Populations from Naur, Torres Islands, Australia, and USA, and Asia were included for broader analysis.
Infection with Schistosoma mansoni has a significant impact on the quality of life of children in Mwan Region, North-West Tanzania, but not on their physical fitness. A cross-sectional study of 572 children aged 7-8 found 58.7% were infected with S. mansoni, with 56.5% having light and 16.4% heavy infections. Girls had higher mean intensities than boys. 30.1% were anemic, with no sex difference. Stunting and wasting were less than 10%. No association was found between S mans prevalence or intensities and anthropometry, anemia, or spleen pathology. However, infected children had lower emotional quality of life scores (77.3 vs 82.7) and higher VO2 max (51.4 vs 50.8) than uninfected. In multivar regression, age, S mans infection, hemoglobin, and VO max were predictors of emotional quality of life, while predictors of VO max were physical quality, height, age, and hemoglobin. S mans infection was not retained in multivar regression on VO max. The study suggests S mans infection affects emotional quality of life, not physical fitness.
Researchers studied how Leptira, a zoonosis caused by a spiroch, infects rats. They compared three routes of infection: intraperitoneal, mucosal, and subcutaneous. The goal was to understand how Leptira spreads in rats naturally, like it does in the wild. Rats are reservoirs of Leira, and can be infected without showing symptoms. Infection was the same with all three routes, with similar antibody production. Colonization rates were 8/8, 5/8, and 1/8 for intraper, muc, and subcut routes respectively. Mucosal was more efficient for urinary excretion than subcut, and slower than intraper. This helps understand Leira in rats, unlike studies in wild rats.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called Annexin A2 (An2) in the body's response to a severe infection called sepsis. Seps is a life-threatening condition that causes excessive inflammation, tissue damage, and organ failure, and is hard to treat. The study found that An2 helps reduce inflammation by controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) and a signaling molecule called IL-17. In experiments, mice without An2 had more inflammation, poor bacterial clearance, and lower survival rates. The team found that a specific part of An2, cysteine 9, is key to regulating ROS levels, which in turn affects IL-17 and inflammation. Depleting IL-17 reduced inflammation and protected An2-deficient mice from seps. The study reveals An2's previously unknown function in seps through the An2-ROS-IL-17 axis, providing insights into the disease's mechanisms. An2 may mitigate seps by modulating ROS and IL-17 levels. Targeting neutrophils in seps could be a therapeutic approach, as An2-deficient mice had more severe injury and mortality. The study also found IL-17 is regulated by ROS, and reduced after IL-17 knockdown. Increased IL-17 correlated with ROS in An2-deficient mice, and IL-17 knockdown inhibited inflammation in seps mice. An2 is an intracellular protein involved in various processes, including immunity, endosome function, and inflammation. Overall, An2 plays a critical role in reducing inflammation by regulating ROS and IL-17 in seps.
Researchers have found that a molecule called microRNA-155 (miR-155) plays a key role in making macrophages less susceptible to HIV-1 infection. Macrophages are a type of immune cell that HIV-1 infects and contributes to the progression of AIDS. The researchers used a synthetic molecule called polyinos-polycidylic acid (poly I:C) that activates a receptor called Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that activates TLR4 to reduce HIV-1 infection in macrophages. They found that only TLR3 and T4 activation significantly reduced HIV-1 infection, not TLR2, T7, or T9. The study showed that mi-155 levels increased in macrophages activated with TLR4 but not T7, and a mi-155 inhibitor restored infectivity in poly I-stimulated macrophages. Ectopic mi-155 expression reduced HIV-1 infection in primary macrophages and cell lines. The study suggests mi-155 targets HIV-1 factors involved in post-entry and pre-integration events, leading to reduced infection.
Plants grow at different rates at different times of the day, depending on the light and their internal clock. Scientists wanted to understand how light, the clock, and growth hormones work together to control growth. They studied Arabidopsis seedlings under different conditions and found a group of hormone genes are expressed when growth is fastest. These genes have a special element in their promoters that makes them turn on and off at the right time. The clock and light signals work together to control hormone levels, allowing plants to grow at the right time. This helps plants adjust to seasonal changes and shade. The clock changes chromatin, the way genes are read, to control growth. Hormones like IAA play a big role in growth and are regulated by the clock. Most Arabid genes are expressed at specific times of the day, controlled by the clock, light, and temperature. A group of hormone genes are expressed when growth is fastest, regulated by the clock and light. The clock and light work together to control hormone expression, allowing growth at the right time. This helps plants adjust to daily changes.
Scientists have found a new way to control the spread of Chagas disease, a serious illness caused by the insect Rhodnius prolix, by modifying its gut microbiota. They used a technology called RNA interference, or RNAi, to deliver molecules to the insect's gut. The researchers used two types of bacteria, Escherichia coli and Rhodoccus rhnii, to deliver RNA to the insect. The RNA targeted two proteins, Rhodni heme-binding protein (RH) and catalase (CAT), which are important for the insect's development and reproduction. The results showed that the RNAi had a systemic effect, meaning it affected the whole insect, not just the gut. Concentrations of bacteria above 3.35 x 10^7 CFU/mL produced significant knockdown of RH and CAT genes in nymphs and adults. RH expression in the body was reduced by 99% three days after feeding, returning to normal 10 days later. CAT expression was reduced 99% and 96 in ovary and midgut, respectively, five days after ingestion. Mortality increased 24-30% in first instars fed RH and CAT bacteria. Molting rates reduced 100% in first and 80 in third instars fed RH or CAT RNA. Oviposition reduced 43% RH and 84 CAT. Embryogenesis arrested 16 RH and 20 of eggs. Modifying the microbiota to induce RNAi R prolix may be a sustainable strategy for vector control.
Fever in pregnancy is a serious for both the mother and the baby. In the 1980s, malaria was the leading cause of death in pregnant women in refugee camps on the Thai-Burma border. However, artemisinin therapy has reduced malaria incidence in the population. The causes of fever in pregnancy are not well documented. Pregnant women attending antenatal care, where screening for malaria is routine, were invited for a comprehensive clinical and laboratory check if they had fever. Women were admitted, treated, and followed up until delivery. Convalescent serum was collected on day 21. Outcomes were recorded.

Fever episodes occurred in 5.0% (409/8,117) of pregnant women attending anten clinics from Jan-2004 to May-2006. Malaria was the main cause in 55.5% (227/409). A cohort of 203 (49.6%409) had fever investigations and follow-up. Arthrop-borne (malaria, ricketial, deng, and zoon disease leptospi) accounted for nearly half all febr illnesses 47.3 (96). Coinfection was in 3.9 (8/203) women, mostly malaria ricketia. Pyonephritis 19.7 (40) was also a cause of fever. Once malaria pyoneph and respiratory are excluded, one-third febr infections were ricket or leptpi. Scr and murine typhus were associated with poor outcomes, including stillbirth and low birth. One died (positive tests). Malaria remains the cause fever in pregnancy on Thaiurma. Scr and murine typh were important causes of fever with poor outcomes.
Researchers studied the relationship between a woman's age and the rate of genetic recombination during meiosis, a process that occurs when egg cells are formed in the ovaries. They analyzed data from 600,000 genetic markers in 69 French-Canadian families and found that recombination rates decrease with age, especially in specific parts of chromosomes near the ends. This may explain why older women are more likely to have extra or missing chromosomes in their eggs, leading to aneuploidy. The study suggests that recombination helps protect against non-disjunction, a process that causes aneuploidy, but this protection becomes less effective with age. The researchers propose a model that reconciles their findings with previous studies on age and aneupidy in trisomies. They also found chromosome-specific effects, which may vary between populations due to genetic differences in recombination regulation. The study supports the idea that different chromosomes are subject to distinct constraints, influencing recombination patterns over generations. The decrease in recombination with age is localized to middle chromosomal arms and subtelomeric regions, where re rates are lower in older mothers compared to younger.
Researchers have found a new way to boost the immune system's first line of defense, the macrophages, to fight off a common opportunistic infection called Cryptococcus neoformans. This fungus is a major threat to people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or taking immunosuppressive drugs. Current vaccines are hard to develop because they rely on the body's second line of defense, the adaptive immune system, which is weak in these patients. The scientists used a different approach, priming macrophages with a protein called interferon-gamma (IF-γ) in the body. This made the macroages remember the fungus for at least 70 days and protected against a second infection without the adaptive immune system's help. The team found that this was due to increased activity of a protein called STAT1, which binds to genes that help fight the fungus. This is a new way to make the body's first line of defense remember specific to a pathogen and provide long-lasting protection. This could lead to new vaccines for immunocompromised patients.
Researchers studied how a group of proteins called Polycomb repressive complexes (PCs) control gene expression and development in plants. They found that different combinations of PC members regulate different developmental programs, such as flower and embryo development, in Arabidopsis seedlings. A key protein called CURL LEAF (CL) plays a major role in suppressing flower development by working with other PC members, specifically with a protein called LIKE HETCHROMIN PROTEIN1 (LHP). On the other hand, embryo development is repressed by PC-catalytic subunits AtBMI and AtRING in combination with PC-catal enzymes CL or SWINGER (SW). The role of CL corresponds with changes in H3me3 profiles and is associated with different binding of transcription factors, including MADS and ABA factors. The study suggests that different PC members regulate distinct programs and specificity is modulated by transcription factors. The research used a new method to compare epigenomic data, showing high quality in dissecting epigen modifications in development. They compared genome-wide changes H3me3 and expression in loss-function mutants of PC components in Arabid seedlings. PC are classified into two complexes, PRC1 and P2, participating in transcription repression by catalyzing H3 triethylation and H2 ubiquination, respectively. Depletion of components in plants causes varied defects, raising questions about functional specificity.
Scientists have studied the "loop" or "trigger" part of an enzyme called RNA polymerase II in yeast cells. This enzyme is crucial for copying genetic information from DNA to make proteins. They made many versions of this loop with tiny changes and tested how they affected the enzyme's function. Three types of changes were found: some made the enzyme not work well, some made it work too well, and some had no effect. The changes that made the enzyme not work well were in a special pocket that helps the loop fold into the right shape. This shape is important for the enzyme to copy DNA. Other changes affected how the loop interacts with other parts of the enzyme. This study helps understand how the enzyme works and how it evolved. The method used can be applied to other important proteins in cells. The loop is important for the enzyme to move along DNA and copy genetic information. It also helps the enzyme pause or stop copying at certain points. The loop can fold into different shapes and change between these shapes to do its job. Changes in the loop can make it work better or worse and affect how it moves along DNA. The study found many changes that make the enzyme work better or worse and some that affect how it interacts with other parts.
Researchers studied how the rabies virus (RV) infects the brain. They wanted to know if the virus can spread to the brain through the bloodstream, not just through nerve cells. They infected mice with two types of RV: one from dogs (DOG) and one from silver-haired bats (SB). One group got the virus under the skin (intramuscular) and the other group got it through a vein (intravenous). The mice that got the virus under the skin got sick and died from rabies. But the ones that got it through the vein only got sick if it was from the bat virus. The researchers looked at how the virus spread in the brain and found that the bat virus went straight to the hypothalamus, a part of the brain connected to the pituitary gland. This is a new way the virus can infect the brain. This changes how we think about how to prevent rabies, especially from the bat virus.
Researchers studied the evolutionary history of the H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus, which has caused significant illness and death in humans since the 1918 pandemic. They analyzed 71 complete genome sequences from 191 to 2006 and found that segment reassortment, a process where parts of the virus swap, played a key role in the virus's evolution. Specifically, they found that an H1 virus from 1947 acquired new genes through reassort, which may explain its sudden change in severity. The 195 epidemic may have also been caused by reassorted H1 viruses. The study suggests reassort is more important in H1's evolution than thought. Reassort between different species can create pandemic viruses, like the 1957 and 68 pandemics. The H1's eight segments generally evolved together, but some reassort events affected specific segments. The study looked at long-term patterns in 71 sequences from 17 countries. Few studies have looked at reassort in H1 viruses. H1 is thought to evolve slower than H2, needing less frequent vaccine updates. H1 caused significant illness from 1917 to 195, then again from 197 to present. The 1918 pandemic killed 20 million, the deadliest event in history.
A new study has shed light on how nicotine affects the brain's reward system, specifically the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which plays a key role in motivation and addiction. Nicotine stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACh) in the V, releasing dopamine (DA), a chemical linked to pleasure and reward. Researchers used a computer model of the V's circuitry and ACh function to understand how nicotine works. They found that a type of ACh receptor, αβ2, on either directly stimulates or inhibits DA release, depending on the rate of ACh input. Low ACh input leads to stimulation, while high ACh leads to inhibition. This is due to known properties of α2 ACh receptors. The study also showed that GABA cells, a type of neuron, play a crucial role in nicotine's action. In vitro and in vivo data support these findings. The study suggests that the rate of ACh input determines the response to nicotine, and proposes an ACh dependence for nicotine's rewarding effects.
Researchers conducted a study in Kabul, Afghanistan to find a better way to treat cutaneous leishmanias, a chronic skin disease caused by Leishmania parasites. They tested a new method: high-frequency electrocauterization (EC) followed by moist-wound treatment (MWT) with or without sodium chlorite (DAC-055) on 200 patients with Leish infections. The goal was to prevent superinfections, accelerate wound closure, and improve cosmetic outcome. Patients under 5, with facial lesions, pregnancy, or serious comorbidities were excluded. The primary outcome was time for complete epithelialization. Biops were taken before EC, after closure, and 6 months later. Mean closure time was similar in both groups (43.1 and 42 days). DAC-055 caused faster wound healing in Leish-positive biops (37.2 vs 58.3 days). Superfections occurred at the same rate (8.8%) except in cases with high parasite loads. In vitro, DAC-055 showed lemanicidal effect on amastigotes. EC plus M led to rapid closure, lower relapse rate, and accelerated closure in patients with persistence, warranting future studies on DAC-055.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosila cells to identify factors impacting RAS-MAP signaling. They found 101 validated hits, most of which were previously known to be associated with the pathway. Epist experiments revealed new factors acting at different steps, including a protein modulating RAF activation. Unexpectedly, most hits worked downstream of ME and influenced MAP expression, mainly through constitutive splicing. This suggests splicing plays a role in establishing MAP levels. Two members of this group were characterized and found to regulate map alternative splicing. This study provides a comprehensive view of factors modulating R-MAP signaling in Dila. It shows pathway output is not solely reliant on classical events like RAF activation, but also MAP regulation. Additionally, splicing components can impact alternative splicing.
Researchers in Thailand studied 498 isolates of the Cryptococcus neoformans and C gatt species to better understand cryptococcosis in the country. They found that 386 were from clinical and 112 from environmental and veterinary sources. Most isolates were from males, aged 37.97 years, with 88.5% of C neoans and 37.5 of gatt from HIV patients. Molecular analysis showed that 94.8% of isolates were C neoans type V, regardless of source, while 2.4% were type II, 0.2 type IV, 0.2 type I, and 2.4 type II. Multilocus Sequence Type (ML) analysis identified 20 types in Thailand, with 5 unique to the country. Most gatt isolates were ST7, identical to the virulent Vancouver outbreak strain, indicating Thailand as a global spread stepping stone. The study found greater diversity and range of molecular types than previously reported. Demographics and HIV status matched previous reports, with neoans common in HIV patients and gatt in immunocompetent. Environmental and veterinary sampling would help fill gaps. Despite treatment, cryptocos remains a major opportunistic infection, further studies are needed for management.
Researchers studied the evolution of a large group of proteins called C2-H2 zinc finger transcription factors (TFs) in fruit flies over 45 million years. They found that a significant number of these TFs have variations that affect their ability to bind to DNA. In addition to losing or gaining C2-Z domains, they also found changes in DNA-contacting residues in 44% of shared domains between species. These changes were conserved across phylogenetic groups and evolved slower than other residues, suggesting they are important. They were rarely found as polymorphisms within a population of flies, indicating rapid fixation. The specificities of these domains changed across phylogen distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. Proteins with conserved C-Z domains were enriched in developmental functions, while varying domains showed no enrichments. The study suggests a subset of dynamic and understudied TFs are a source of variation in flies and other metazoa.
Scientists have developed a new way to quickly and accurately identify two types of bacteria that cause typhoid and paratyoid fevers, Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paraty A. These bacteria can be hard to diagnose, especially in areas where typing sera is not available. The new method uses a repeated DNA sequence called CRIS (clustered regularly interspaced palindrom repeats) that is specific to each serotype. Researchers created a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay that can detect and differentiate between the two serotypes. They tested the assay on 188 Typhi and 74 Paraty A strains from different parts of the world and time periods, and 70 other bacteria that can cause similar symptoms. The results showed 100% sensitivity and specificity, meaning it correctly identified all strains. The new method can be used in many clinical and public health labs with PCR technology. It was tested on cultured isolates, but could be adapted for clinical samples.
Researchers studied the role of Notch receptors in the immune response to Leishmania major, a parasite that causes skin lesions and swelling. They found that Notch1 and Notch2 are necessary for the development of helper T cells that produce IFN, a protein that helps fight the parasite. Mice with both Not1 and Not2 deleted in their T cells were unable to fight the infection and developed large lesions. However, mice with single deletion of Not1 or Not2 were able to fight the parasite and develop a protective immune response. This suggests that Not1 and Not2 are redundant in driving helper cell differentiation. The researchers also found that Notch signaling is required for IF production by helper cells. This effect is independent of a key Notch effector, RBP-J, since mice with R-J deleted in T cells were able to produce IF and fight the parasite. The study shows that Notch plays a crucial role in the development of a protective immune response to Leish major. Understanding how Notch regulates helper cell differentiation and its ligands could lead to new vaccines and treatments for Leish and other infections that require a protective helper response.
Researchers studied whether a parasitic worm infection called Schistosoma mansoni increases the risk of HIV infection in rhes macaques, a type of monkey. They infected some monkeys with the worm and then exposed them to a low doses of a virus that causes AIDS, called SHIV-C. The infected monkeys got sick with the virus at much lower doses than monkeys without the worm. In fact, it took 17 times less virus to infect the monkeys with the worm compared to those without it. The infected monkeys also had higher levels of the virus in their blood and more virus in a type of immune cell called CD4. This is the first study to show that the worm increases the risk of getting AIDS from a virus. Most new HIV infections happen through mucosal transmission, which is when the virus enters the body through the mouth, vagina, rectum, or penis. The worm is common in many parts of the world where HIV is also common. The study suggests that controlling the worm could help reduce the spread of HIV.
Researchers have created a computer model to study how the brain chemical acetylcholine (ACh) affects brain activity during sleep and wakefulness. ACh is a key player in regulating brain excitability and sleep. The model shows how changes in brain activity and structure create three distinct patterns: localized, traveling, asynchronous, and synchronous. These patterns match what's seen in brain activity during slow wave sleep, REM, and waking states. During slow wave sleep, traveling patterns occur in the brain, while in other states, stationary patterns do. The model is made of neurons with a special current regulated by ACh. A's level can change between these patterns. When ACh is low, patterns are localized and easily pinned by network irregularities. When A is high, traveling waves arise. Further decrease in A leads to high synchrony within waves. A also determines how sensitive the network is to irregularities. These patterns may be important, as stationary may encode input and traveling could lead to synaptic regularization.
Researchers studied how genetic mutations in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway affect the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a type of cancer. They found that 14.6% of EAC tumors had non-synonymous mutations in the TLR pathway, with TLR4 being the most frequently mutated gene with 5.8% of tumors. These mutations were associated with more proximal and metastatic disease, suggesting clinical significance. The researchers also found TLR mutations in other solid tumors exposed to microbiomes, including uterine endrioid carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, colorectal adenocarcin, and stomach adenocarcin. TLR mutants had impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which may play a role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients.
Scientists have long known that the sense of taste is crucial for animal survival, but the process of how taste cells develop has remained a mystery. Researchers used a new approach to study taste development in mice by combining computer analysis and lab experiments. They found that certain molecules called TRMs, which help detect sweet and bitter tastes, are present in developing taste buds on the tongue. To understand how these molecules work, they looked at the DNA sequences that control TRM genes and found a common factor called H1 that might be involved. They studied H1's role in taste development and found that in mice without H1, taste buds had more cells that could detect sweet and bitter tastes than normal mice. This suggests H1 plays a key role in helping taste cells develop in taste buds.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling root development. Unlike Arabidopsis, the interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice is not well understood. They found that the activation of OsIL on the expression of Y8RE7 and indole-3-pyric acid (IPA)-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Using a chemical inhibitor, they showed that ethylene-inhibited primary root elong is dependent on Y-based auxin biosynthesis. They identified a rice mutant, rein-1, which is insensitive to ethylene, and found that YRE7 is truncated at its C-terminus. Mutation in Y7 reduced auxin biosynthesis in rice, while overexpression of Y enhanced eth sensitivity in roots. Y catalyzed the conversion of IPA to IAA, and a truncated version of Y resulted in reduced enzymatic activity, indicating Y is required for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and eth-inhibited elong in early seedlings. Eth induced Y expression and promoted aux accumulation in roots. Low concentrations of IAA rescued the eth response in rein-1, demonstrating eth-in elong depends on IPA-dependent biosynthesis. Genetic studies revealed Y-mediated aux biosynthesis functions downstream of OsIL, which directly activates Y7. The findings reveal a model of interaction between eth and aux in seedling root elong, enhancing understanding eth signaling in rice.
A nationwide study in Saudi Arabia has revealed the challenges of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NT) diseases, which are increasing globally and unclear in the country. The study collected 527 isolates of NT with clinical and demographical data for 24 months. Primary identification was by probe assays and 16S rRNA, 16-23 ITS, rpo, and h65 genes. The findings were analyzed against demographical and clinical data. 76.5% were Saudi citizens, 34.2% elderly, and 65.3% male. 75.1 isolates were pulmonary with 44.7 clinical significance. 34 NT species, including 17 rare, and 8 undefined were identified. M. simiae 22.6, M. fortuit 18.1, and M. absus 17.8 were predominant. New cases of M. riyense were noticed. Rare events like mycobemia, abscess, peritonitis, and ascites caused by M wol, hatic, duii, and monence. Diabetes and previous TB were risk factors. NT disease and pathogen diversity is a challenge in Saudi. Priorities should be given to NT with diagnostic and management plans.
Yeast cells have a unique way of surviving when they don't have enough food, called quiescence. This state helps them live longer. Scientists wanted to know what makes this happen. They looked at a library of yeast genes and found that three kinases, Rim15, Mck, and Yak, are important for quies. These kinases are like messengers that help cells talk to each other. When yeast don't have food, Rim, Mck, and Yak send signals that help them prepare for quies. They make carbohydrates, like glycogen and trehalose, to store energy. This helps them live longer. When these kinases are missing, yeast can't make these carbohydrates and live shorter. Adding glycogen and treose to the food helps them live longer. Scientists also found that these kinases help control oxygen in the cell, which is important for quies. They think Rim, Mck, and Yak work together to help yeast prepare for quies by making energy and protecting themselves from damage. This helps them live longer.
Researchers have discovered a new way that the influenza A virus evades the immune system by adding sugar molecules to its surface protein, called hemagglutinin (HA). This helps the virus survive even when it has mutations that make it less recognizable to antibodies. The study used a new method to sequence the virus population and found that adding sugar molecules, called N-glycans, to the HA protein increased its ability to bind to receptors, making it more fit and able to spread. This is a new understanding of how the virus stays fit during antigen evolution and shows the power of precise virus sequencing to reveal new mechanisms. 

The virus needs to balance being new and fit to spread, and adding sugar may play a role in this process. The study also found that sugar can increase the fitness of variants that escape antibodies, even without pressure. This suggests that both mechanisms, sugar addition and mutations, contribute to the evolution of sugar in the HA protein. The research used a new method to sequence the virus population and found a new role for sugar in immune evasion. It shows that sugar can compensate for fitness costs of escape mutations, making variants more viable and able to emerge. The study highlights the potential of sequencing to uncover new viral mechanisms through precise genetics.
Researchers analyzed 13 models of ventricular myocytes to understand why some antiarrhythmic drugs don't work well at slow heart rates. These drugs prolong the cardiac action potential (AP), but their effect is stronger at slow rates, making arrhythmia worse at fast rates and better at slow rates. The opposite property, forward dependence, would solve this problem, but forward-dependent antiarrhythmics are rare. The study found that forward dependence is possible in some ionic perturbations of the AP. By simulating myocytes with varying properties and analyzing results, they predicted rate-dependent changes in multiple parameters. They tested 40 parameters and assessed AP at slow and fast rates. The analysis identified forward-dependent ionic perturbations and their mechanisms, such as increased L-type calcium current with indirect changes in delayed potassium current. Inward rectifier potassium and sodium-potassium pump are likely to produce forward prolongation. Models with minimal AP shape changes have little forward potential, while those with large changes have considerable potential. This explains differences between species and ventricular types. The study provides insights into AP duration dependence and a strategy for beneficial antiarrhythmic design.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how genetic variations in people's genes affect their traits, called Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PAS). They applied this method to thiopurine-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity in patients taking thiopine drugs. TPMT is an enzyme that helps break down thiopine, a medication used to treat certain conditions. The study used data from a French hospital's clinical database from 2000 to 2013. They analyzed 442 patient records with 10,252 ICD-10 codes and 7,711 biological test results. The results showed that iron deficiency and diabetes were associated with high TP activity. This is the first study to use ICD-10 codes, not I-9-CM codes, to identify phenotypes. In pharmacogenomics, this method can help identify patients who need personalized treatment.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies on the use of stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries in animals. They found that allogenic stem cells, which come from a different individuals, improved motor function by 27.2% and sensory function by 26.3% in animal models of spinal cord injury. However, the quality of the studies varied greatly, with some using different types of stem cells, implantation methods, and delivery routes. The best results were seen when stem cells were differentiated before implantation and delivered intravenously. Female animals did not benefit from stem cell treatment and anesthesia with isoflurane seemed to enhance the effect. A dose-response relationship was also observed. Motor outcomes were less affected by stem cell type, but more by experimental design and outcome measures. Injury location, method, and immunosuppression impacted results. Reporting bias was higher than in other neuroscience studies, but still suboptimal. Studies without blinded outcome assessment overestimated efficacy. The review suggests stem-cell therapies may be promising, but internal validity and bias may lower reported efficacy.
Soil-transmitted helmin (STH) infections, such as Ascaris lumbricoid, hookworm, and Trichuris trura, affect over a billion people worldwide. Preventive chemotherapy, or repeated administration of anthelmint drugs to at-risk populations, is the main control strategy, but does not prevent reinfection. A systematic review and meta-analysis assessed patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after treatment. 154 studies were identified, 51 included 24 reported STH rates pre- and post-treatment, and 42 determinants of predisposition to reinfection. At 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, Ascaris lumicoid prevalence reached 26%, 68%, and 94% of pretreatment levels, respectively. Trichisura reinfection were 36%, 67, and 82, and hookworm 30, 55, 57. Prevalence and intensity of reinfection were correlated with pretreatment status. S reinfections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly Ascaris and Trichis. Frequent anthint drug administrations are needed to maximize preventive benefit. Integrated approaches emphasizing health and sanitation are needed to interrupt transmission.
Researchers have developed a new method called Minimum Enrich Analysis (MiA) to study nonalcoholic liver disease (NAFL) by analyzing metabolic processes at the molecular level. NAFL is a spectrum of diseases from simple steatosis to complex noncoholic stehepatitis. Current methods, such as pathway analysis, use predefined maps of metabolic processes, but these can be biased by different annotations and don't capture complex interactions. MiA generates minimal networks of reactions that can synthesize a target metabolite and applies to genome-scale metabolic networks. The researchers used MiA to investigate deregulated networks in NAFL phenotypes, such as fatty liver and inflammation in humans and mice. They found key deregulations in cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, and hexadecate synthesis in both humans and mice, and regulators of hydrogen peroxide synthesis were different in humans and mice. MiA identified general and specific characteristics of NAFL phenotypes. This method is applicable to any genome and target metabolite, making it flexible for studying metabolism in any disease or organism.
Researchers have found that the brain's sense of smell, or olfactory system, can identify a wide variety of odors despite their intensity by using a method called primacy coding. This method encodes odor identity by the types of receptors that respond first, providing a compact and efficient representation that the brain can interpret. A model of primacy was analyzed using simulations and statistical descriptions, showing that the encoded information depends on the number of receptor types, but not the size of the repertoire. The representation is independent of odor intensity and useful for olfactory tasks, similar to experimentally measured. Interestingly, a smaller receptor repertoire can be advantageous for discriminating odors. The model suggests overly sensitive receptors can dominate and make the array useless, allowing prediction of receptor adaptation to environmental changes. Primacy is more useful than binary coding, as the sparsity is independent of odor statistics, unlike alternatives. It provides an efficient representation independent of intensity, helping identify odors in the olfactory cortex.
Researchers studied the behavior of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnMA) against HIV, which are designed to neutralize the virus in the body. They found that some bnMA did not completely neutralize the virus, even at high concentrations. This was seen in both in lab-grown viruses and viruses grown in human cells. The study looked at 278 pseudoviruses and 117 viruses in two different assays, and found that bnMA targeting the V2 of the spike protein and gp41 were most likely to show incomplete neutralization. Conversely, bn targeting the high-mose patch were less likely to show this behavior. CD4 binding antibodies also showed this behavior infrequently. The phenomenon of incomplete neutralization was also seen in viruses grown in human cells. Five bnMA were tested against 18 virus clones produced in cells and assayed in TZ-bl cells, with examples of plateaus at 90% seen. The study suggests that incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoid neutral curves are possible for all bnMA against a wide range of viruses, with implications for use in therapy and vaccine design.
Researchers studied how cancer cells use glucose and glutamine to grow and produce energy. They found that when cells use a lot of glutamine, they make less energy from glucose and more from glutamine. This happens when there's not enough oxygen to fully use all the glucose. A computer model showed that this is the best way for cells to make energy and grow. It involves a special pathway that uses glutamine to make lipids and proteins. This was tested in a cancer cell line and confirmed by computer predictions. The study suggests that how cancer cells change their metabolism to grow. Cancer cells often use glucose to make lactate instead of energy. To understand how they use glutamine, researchers looked at when cells make lactate from glucose in the presence of oxygen. They found that high glutamine use reduces glucose energy production and increases lactate from glutamine. This happens when there's not enough oxygen to use all glucose. A computer model showed this is the best way for cells to make energy and grow. It involves a special pathway that uses glutamine to make lipids and proteins. This was tested in a cancer cell and confirmed by computer predictions. The study shows how cancer cells change their metabolism to grow.
Researchers have been trying to figure out how a protein called Pr, which is linked to a group of deadly brain diseases, changes its shape in the body. To do this, they studied how Pr interacts with other proteins in a lab-grown cells. They also looked at two similar proteins, called Doppel and Shadoo, which are related to Pr. Surprisingly, they found that all three proteins are in the same environment and interact with each other. They also found that Pr interacts with a protein called lamin, which helps cells stick together, and with an enzyme called PDI, which fixes damaged proteins. This helps explain previous findings that said Pr interacts with these proteins separately. Experiments showed that Pr and PDI interact outside of a part of the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum, and might play a new role in Pr's buildup. A theory is proposed that Pr sticks to proteins with immunoglobulin-like domains, which recognize membrane proteins with oliganns. This explains most interactions in healthy cells.
Researchers studied how the immune system responds to influenza virus infection in the lungs. They found that a type of immune cell called group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC) produces a protein called interleukin-5 (IL-5) during infection. IL-5 is important for a type of white blood cell called eosin to mature and leave the bone marrow. The study showed that IL-5 is released into the airways of infected lungs and eosin accumulate in the lungs, especially after the virus is cleared. The source of IL-5 is IL2 cells that enter the lungs during infection. These cells produce more IL-5 when they interact with another type of immune cell called NKT and a type of lung cell called alveolar macrophage. This interaction leads to more IL-5 production and eosin accumulation in lungs during recovery from infection.
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (NT) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of NT disease in Asia are not well-documented. This study retrospectively identified 102 cases of NT infections in an infectious hospital in Vietnam between 2008 and 2013. Clinical records were accessed to evaluate demographic and clinical factors associated with NT infection and identify risk factors with death. Multi-locus typing and antimicrobial testing was performed on all organisms. 71% of NT patients were HIV-infected, 90% were adults, 71 were male, and 33 reported intravenous use. 26/92 (28) patients had known outcome; HIV was associated with death (p=0.039). Enteridis (ST11) and Typhimium (19,34,154) were most identified serovars. Tyim was more common in HIV-infected (p=0.003). Isolates from HIV-inf patients were more susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamox than HIV-negative (p=0.037). NT disease is severe in Vietnam with high mortality. In sub-Saharan, HIV was factor for death, majority burden in population HIV-inf adult.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify viral and phage proteins using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Phages are viruses that infect bacteria and play a crucial role in their survival and pathogenicity. However, most of their genes have unknown functions, making it hard to understand their impact on microbial communities and human health. The new method uses ANNs to classify protein sequences based on amino acid frequencies and isoelectric points. It correctly identifies a large fraction of test cases with high specificity and sensitivity. The ANNs were also trained to specialize in identifying major capsid and tail proteins, which are more accurate than the general ANNs. To validate the predictions, researchers examined several ORFs with no similarities to known sequences and found they self-assembled into virus-like structures. The ANNs are a new tool to identify phage and prophage proteins that are hard to detect by other methods. They will be useful when sequence data is available but propagation is not practical.
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSH) is a cancer-causing virus with a large genome that encodes over 85 proteins. One of these proteins is ORF20, a member of the herpesviral UL24 family, but its function is not well understood. OR20 has three uncharacterized isoforms that are mostly found in the nucleus and nucleoli. Researchers used a technique called quantitative purification to mass spectrometry (q-APMS) to find proteins that interact with OR20, including a protein called interferon-stimulated gene (IS) oligoadyl synthase-like (OL). They found that OL and OR20 interacted with each other, and this was true for all OR20 isoforms and OR20 homologs in other herpesviruses. OL is a protein that helps fight viruses, but its role in herpesviruses was unknown. The study found that OL and OR20 worked together with ribosomes, the parts of cells that make proteins, but didn't affect overall protein production. They also found that OR20 helped increase expression of a protein called R-I, which is part of the immune system. OL has antiviral activity against some viruses, but its role in herpesviruses was unknown. The study showed that OL and OR20 were made early in cells that had been infected with SH. Interestingly, OL helped SH infection, but this effect was lost when OR20 was not working. The study found that OL and OR interacted with many proteins, including ribosomal and nucleolar proteins.
A study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in children with fever and convulsions in an endemic area of Nigeria. Out of 913 children admitted to a hospital, 373 (40.9%) had fever and 108 (29%) had convulsions. The overall prevalence of LVD was 13.5% (95% CI 1.9, 5.7) in febr admissions, 2.8% in children with convuls and 3.8% without convuls. Vomiting and bleeding were associated with increased prevalence of LVD. L is an important cause of undifferentiated fever in children in endemic areas but not associated with convuls. Its prevalence and lack of clinical presentation highlights the importance of high suspicion in diagnosis. Screening febr children with undifferent fever in endemic for L could be a medical and public health measure.
Researchers have identified a new genetic factor that helps plants resist drought, a major cause of crop yield loss worldwide. The factor, called Karri receptor K2 (KAR2), is a protein that responds to a type of chemical called karri found in smoke, which promotes seed germination and plant growth under stressful conditions. They found that a mutation in the K2 gene makes plants more sensitive to water loss, leading to increased water loss, cell damage, and stomatal opening. K2 plants also have reduced anthocyan production and are less responsive to abscisic acid, a hormone involved in stomatal closure and cotyledon opening. A genome-wide analysis of K2 under watered and dehydrated conditions revealed associated genes involved in these changes. The study suggests a connection between K2 and abisic acid signaling in drought response. Comparing K2 to another receptor mutant, strigact14, showed stract also contributes to drought adaptation but not through cuticle development. The findings suggest manipulating K2 and stract signaling may improve drought resistance.
Researchers have investigated the role of insulin receptors in the growth and development of Schistosoma japonicum, a parasite that causes schistosomiasis in humans. They focused on the insulin receptors (SIR) of S. japonicum, which they had previously cloned and characterized. They found that human insulin binds to a specific part of the IR, called the L subdomain, using a technique called biolayer interferometry. They then used a method called RNA interference (RNAi) to reduce the expression of IR in adult S. japon in a lab dish and found that this reduced the transcription of other genes involved in insulin signaling and glucose metabolism. They also saw a decrease in glucose uptake in the IR-knockdown worms compared to controls. In experiments with mice infected with S. japon, they found that the recombinant L domains of IR (rLD1 and rLD2) reduced growth, intestinal worm density, and egg production. These results suggest that the IR could be a target for a vaccine against schistosomiasis, a disease that affects millions in China and the Philippines.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a major cause of disability in the Pacific region, where over 96% of 1.7 million people are at risk of infection. While mass drug administration (MDA) has reduced lymphatic filariasis prevalence, mosquito biology complicates the MD strategy in some areas, making it difficult to attain the goal of elimination. Aedes aegypti, the primary vector in the Pacific, is hard to control with existing methods. Researchers created a new strain of Ae. aegypt, called 'CP', by introducing Wolbachia bacteria from Ae. albopictus, making it incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory tests showed CP males are competitive, leading to population elimination when introduced into wild Ae. aegpt populations. This strategy is a potential tool to supplement ongoing MD efforts to eliminate LF. The Pacific's geography is ideal for this approach, as Ae.egpt is the primary vector in low microfilaraemic areas and is an obligate host for W. bancfti, a key to breaking the transmission cycle.
African trypanosomiasis, also known as Rhodesian sleeping sickness, is a deadly disease spread by a tsetes fly bites if left untreated. In Tanzania, it's a major health and socio-economic issue in affected communities. This study estimated the disease burden of Rhodesian sleeping sickness in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and costs in a highly endemic area of Tanzania. Data from 143 patients admitted in 2004 for treatment at Kali Health Centre in Uram District was used. Direct and indirect costs incurred by patients and health services were calculated. DALs were estimated using the Global Burden Disease method and previous Rhodesian estimates, assuming 45% under-reporting. The DALs for Uram District with and without weighting were 215.7 (95% CI 155.3-287.5) and 281.6 (95 CI 209.1-362.6) respectively. When 45% underreporting was included, results were 622.5 (95 CI 155.3-109.9) and 978.9 (95 CI 201.1-187.8). Treating 143 patients cost $15,514, with patients paying $3,673 and services $11,841. Non-medical indirect costs for 143 patients were $9,781. The study shows sleeping sickness imposes a significant burden on rural communities in Tanzania, highlighting the need for location-specific estimates in countries like Tanzania where many diseases are concentrated.
Researchers studied mice with a genetic mutation in the Ngly gene, which codes for an enzyme that removes sugar molecules from proteins. This mutation causes severe symptoms in humans, but the exact function of the enzyme is unclear. They found that mice with the mutation are born dead in a specific genetic background, but deleting another enzyme, Eng, which also removes sugar molecules, partially rescues the lethality. They also found that changing the genetic background of the mice to a mix of two strains partially rescues the lethality. However, the mice still have severe symptoms similar to humans with the mutation. Deleting Eng in the mixed background also suppresses the symptoms. The study suggests that Ng1 or Ng1/Eng-deficient mice can model human disease and that Eng is a potential target for treatment.
Researchers studied how the gene expression of the hunchback (hb) gene in fruit fly embryos is controlled by a maternal gradient of the Boid (B) protein. They found that gene expression is subject to noise, or variability, which must be constrained for development to be reproducible and coordinated. They identified how noise is controlled by characterizing the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output on promoter structure and transcription dynamics. A model of the hb promoter was created, where the number and strength of B and self-regulatory binding sites can be varied. The model was fit to data from wild-type, self-regulatory mutant, and lacZ reporter constructs using different portions of the promoter. The results indicate that wild-type self-regulatory hb noise is dependent on transcription and translation dynamics, not B fluctuations. Constructs lacking self-regulation show that multiple B binding sites in the promoter play a role in buffering noise. The model is robust to variation in B binding site number across fly species. This study identifies how promoter structure and dynamics reduce noise, features common in many genes, such as multiple sites, cooperativity, and self-feedback, contributing to understanding of reproducibility and determinacy in early development.
Scientists have studied how the genetic material from Neanderthals, an extinct human species, has mixed with modern humans. They found that selection, or natural selection, has removed Neander genes from the human population over time. To understand this, they developed a new method to measure the strength of selection against Neander genes in modern humans. The results show that East Asians have more Neander genes than Europeans, even after accounting for selection. Most selection against Neander genes is due to weak, or slightly bad, genes that were neutral in Neander but became bad in humans. These genes had a big impact on early human-Neander hybrids. The study suggests that population size may play a bigger role in gene mixing than thought. 

The researchers used data on Neander genes in modern humans to test their method. Their work helps understand how selection shaped Neander genes in humans and the nature of human-Neander mixing. There is evidence that selection acted against Neander genes in modern humans. This study is one of the first to measure strength of selection between populations. The method is based on previous work on selection and its effect on neutral genes. The results show patterns of Neander in humans are consistent with selection against weak bad genes. The study suggests selection against Neander may be due to genes that were neutral in Neander but became bad in humans due to larger human population size. These genes had a big impact on early human-Ne hybrids. The study suggests population size and neutral dynamics may be key to gene mixing between species.
Researchers have studied how the HIV virus controls its own gene expression after it has integrated into a host cells. They found that the virus can switch between an active and inactive state, and that this switching may help it hide from the immune system. The virus uses two main elements, Sp1 and NF-κ, to control this switching. Sp1 stabilizes both states, making it harder for the virus to turn on and off, while NFκ has two parts, one that activate and one repress. The team made mutations in these elements and found that Sp1 helps reduce noise in gene expression and makes it harder for the virus to turn on, while NFκ has a stronger activating part that helps the virus turn on. They also found that Sp1 is important for recruiting proteins to the promoter. In cells with mutated Sp1 were more likely to turn on and off the virus. This study helps understand how HIV hides from the immune system and may lead to new treatments.
Accurate genome-wide identification of orthologs is a crucial in comparative genomics, reflected by numerous orthology projects developed in recent years. However, few have compared their accuracy, and several have not been systematically evaluated. Orthology is typically assessed in terms of function, despite phylogeny's original definition by Fitch. This study collected results of nine orthology projects (CO, KOG, Inparan, OrthoCL, Ensembl Com, Homene, Round, EggG, and OMA) and two methods (bidirectional best and reciprocal distance) and compared their predictions to both phylogeny and function using six tests. Phylogen or functional analysis with high specificity, OMA and Homene perform best. At lower specificity but higher coverage, OrthCL outperforms En Com and Inan. Egg provides large coverage for broad grouping but is not specific for phylogen or detailed analyses. Methodologically, En Com's tree/reconciliation approach was outperformed by pairwise, even in phylogen tests. Bidirectional best often outperforms complex projects. This study provides guidance for orth users, introduces methodology, and sets standards for future approaches.
Researchers have developed a new approach to find treatments for schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic worms that infect millions of people in the tropics and sub-tropics. The current treatment, praziquel, has been used for 40 years but is becoming less effective due to resistance. The team used a computational method called drug repurposing to find new targets for the disease. They focused on kinases, proteins that play key roles in parasite's biology, and identified several as potential targets. They also mapped the kinomes of three Schistoma species that infect humans and compared them to the human kinome to find unique targets. This allowed them to suggest existing drugs that could be effective against the parasites, including bosutin, dasatin, and imatinib, as well as new inhibitors vetan, saratin, tideus, alocib, dinlib, and 22 others. The team also identified primary and secondary targets of these drugs in Schoma, enabling the development of new treatments for this neglected disease.
Researchers studied how a protein called CREB binds to a partner protein called CBP to control gene expression. CRE is unstructured when not bound, but becomes structured upon binding. They used computer simulations to predict a folding and binding mechanism, and found that CRE becomes structured after binding, not before. This is different from some models where CRE is structured before binding. Adding more structure to CRE makes it bind slower, like a "fly-casting" process. Including attractive forces between CRE and CBP increases binding speed, but doesn't change mechanism. This study shows how unstructured proteins can help recognize targets. Results match a recent nuclear magnetic resonance study and help understand binding kinetics. CRE's phosphorylated domain (pID) is unstructured when not bound, suggesting folding and binding happen together. Simulations show binding and folding occur together, but pID folds into a helix after binding. The transition state of pID is like the unbound state. Researchers used a G-type model based on pID/CBP structure and analyzed transition states. A recent NMR study suggested pID becomes structured after binding, with transient complexes evolving to a high-affinity. Here, pID changes upon binding, but concepts are relevant. Analysis shows structure forms after binding, making pID binding consistent with induced-fit, where the ligand changes.
A systematic review of schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity in children in Latin America and the Caribbean countries (LAC) was conducted from 1942 to 2014. The study aimed to analyze the progress towards the World Health Assembly's 2012 resolution to eliminate schosomias by 2020. The review included 132 articles with 1242 prevalence and intensity data points, mostly from Brazil (69.7%). High prevalence and intensity were found in Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia, requiring updated epidemiological status to redesign national programs. Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted transmission, but follow-up is needed to verify status. Heterogeneity in methodologies made cross-national comparisons difficult. The review recommends updating schos status in historically endemic countries and territories to address public health interventions and verify elimination. Improved reporting and standardization of monitoring methodologies are needed using WHO guidelines. Meeting the elimination goal requires additional epidemiological data by age and sex.
Researchers studied how HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, is transmitted from one person to another through sex. They looked at 167 full-length HIV-1 genomes and created 40 copies of the virus from 6 couples who transmitted the virus to each other. The goal was to see what makes HIV-1 more likely to be transmitted. They found that the version of the virus that was transmitted, called the "transmitted founder" (TF), didn't have any special traits that made it more likely to be transmitted. It didn't have higher ability to infect cells or replicate in the body's immune system. Also, it wasn't more resistant to a protein called interferon-alpha (IF-α) that helps fight the virus. The study suggests that how the virus adapts to the body's immune system makes it less likely to be transmitted, not the other way around. 

The researchers used a method to get full HIV-1 genomes and made copies of the virus from 6 couples who transmitted to each other. They tested the copies to see how well they could infect and replicate in immune cells and how resistant to IF-α. This study is different from others because it looked at the whole virus, not just one gene, and had copies from both partners. They found that the transmitted virus wasn't more resistant to IF-α than the other versions from the same partner. This means other factors, not IF-α, make the virus more likely to be transmitted. Previous studies found that some versions of HIV-1 were more resistant to IF-α, suggesting the virus adapts to escape the body's immune system. This study looked at 6 couples and found the transmitted virus wasn't more resistant to IFα than other versions.
Researchers studied how filarial parasites, which cause lymphatic filariasis, affect the lymphatic system in the body. They found that in mice without an immune system, lymphatic dilation occurs, but severe lymphedema and elephantiasis require an immune response. To see how parasites directly affect lymphatics, they exposed human lymphatic cells to parasites, antigens, or infected serum. Live parasites and antigens made cells multiply and form tube-like structures. Serum from infected patients and those with chronic lymphatic issues made cells multiply more than uninfected individuals. Tube formation was linked to increased metalloproteases and TIM inhibitors. Comparing gene expression in parasite-exposed and unexposed cells, parasites changed genes involved in organization and junctions, decreasing transport. This suggests parasites induce lymphogenesis and provide insight into filariasis pathology.
Scientists have developed a new way to extract and amplify the genetic material from individual bacteria without growing them in a lab. This is a big deal because most bacteria can't be grown in a lab, making it hard to study them. They used a tiny device to isolate and amplify the DNA from a single E. coli cell in a 60-nanol reaction. The results showed that using smaller reactions reduced errors and gave a more accurate picture of the genome. The quality of the amplified DNA was compared to standard 50-microl reactions and was similar. High-throughput sequencing of single amplicons from both small and large reactions gave good results, making it a straightforward way to sequence single cells. 

The team tested the performance of this method and found that smaller reactions reduced bias and increased specificity. They used a microfluidic chip to isolate and amplify single cells in 60-nanol reactors. Whole genome recovery from single cells helps study ecology and evolution because most microbes can't be cultured. A method called Multiple Displacement Amplification (DA) enables amplification from isolated cells by flow cytometry or dilution. Micromanipulation allowed cells to be selected by fluorescent probes, increasing confidence in single DA reactions.
Researchers studied how viruses from the Orthohant genus, which can cause disease in humans, are transmitted by rodents in the Atlantic Forest, savannas, and wetlands of South America. These rodents shed different viruses, such as the lethal Araraquohantavirus, and factors like population variation may influence transmission within and between populations. They tested if landscape, particularly agricultural and forest remnants, influence rodent havirus hosts in the Atlantic Forest. Using 283 rodent captures and geographically weighted models, they found that havirus proportions were more influenced by landscape diversity than habitat or agricultural type. Small mammal diversity positively influenced pathogenic havirus hosts, indicating habitat quality may be more important than competition with native species. Sugarcane plantations increased rodent hosts, while defaunation did not correlate with potentially pathogenic havirus genotypes. The match between hotspots and human vulnerability was 17%, coldspots 20%. Landscape change influences havirus hosts across the Forest. Findings suggest surveillance in southern and southeastern regions where high host and vulnerability match. Analyses suggest complex rodent dynamics and disease interactions than hypothesized.
Researchers have found that a protein called BCL is crucial for the survival of cells infected with flaviviruses, a family of viruses that includes Japanese encephalitis, Dengue, and Zika viruses. When cells are infected with these viruses, the protein BCL helps to delay apoptosis, or programmed cell death, by suppressing another protein called M1. This delay is important for the virus to spread to neighboring cells and cause disease. The study showed that treatment with BCL inhibitors or lack of the BCL gene leads to apoptosis in infected cells, which reduces viral spread and inflammation. Infection. The researchers also found that BCL is essential for survival of cells infected with flaviruses in the body, and that inhibiting BCL may be a new way to stop the spread of these viruses.
A study estimated the economic impact of rabies in Vietnam from 2005-2014 and found that the total cost of the disease was over $719 million. The largest portion of this cost, 92%, was due to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) treatments. Canine rabies resulted in 36,560 to 45,700 disability-adjusted life years (DALs) and 914 human deaths over the 10-year period. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75. The study suggests that the most effective way to control rabies is through public health campaigns that prevent the disease, not just treating it with P. The results show that Vietnam's rabies burden is similar to other Asian countries, with high P costs and low vaccination investments. The majority of rabies costs in Vietnam are from P, while only a small portion is from dog vaccination. Livestock losses are a small part of the total costs, but may be significant for individual producers. The study found that Vietnam spends more on P than prevention through vaccination, similar to other rabies-endemic countries in Asia.
Scientists have studied the Type II Secretion System (TSS), a molecular machine that helps bacteria secrete proteins across their outer membrane. A key part of this machine is the secretin, a protein that forms a pore in the outer membrane. They found that there are three types of TSS based on the secretin's characteristics. Two types, Klebsella and Vibrio, were compared and found to be different by a protein called pilot that helps assemble the secretin into the membrane. The structure of a new pilot protein, Asp, from Vibrio cholera, was determined. It's similar to other pilots in function but not in structure. Asp binds to a specific sequence in Vibrio secretin and helps assemble the secretin, and is found in many Vibrio and some Escherichia and Shella bacteria.
Researchers have identified a protein called Omp37 on the surface of Leptira bacteria that binds to a protein called elastin found in human skin and blood vessels. This binding is a crucial step in the bacteria's ability to infect the host and cause disease. The study found that Omp37 has a strong affinity for elastin and also binds to other proteins such as fibrinogen, fibronectin, and laminin. This suggests that O37 may play a role in the bacteria's ability to attach to tissues and cause infection. The researchers also found that antibodies in the blood of people infected with leptospi can recognize O37, indicating that the immune system is responding to the protein. Additionally, O37 was found in pathogenic Leptira but not in non-pathogenic Leptira. This suggests that O37 may be a key factor in the bacteria's ability to cause disease. The study suggests that O37 may be involved in the initial stages of infection, allowing the bacteria to attach to the skin through the elastin layer. Further research is needed to understand the role of O37 in the bacteria's lifecycle and how the immune system responds to it.
Researchers have identified two antibodies, 4E and 2F, that can neutralize HIV by binding to a specific regions on the virus called the membrane-proximal external (MP) region of gp41. This region is exposed during the early stages of viral entry into a host cells. To understand how these antibodies work, a model was created to calculate the probability of an antibody disabling gp41 before fusion is complete. The model shows that for these antibodies to be effective, the time to disable the region must be less than 5 minutes. The study also looked at the role of antibody strength in neutralization and found that 2F is more effective than 4. This is because 2 interacts more strongly with the viral membrane. The model was used to determine the factors that allow these antibodies to disable regions and extended to analyze neutralization data. The model shows that a small number of gp41 must be disabled to prevent fusion, but can't determine the exact number from experiments alone.
Researchers conducted a study in Mali and Senegal to see if mass treatment with ivermectin could eliminate onchercias, a disease spread by blackflies, in areas where the disease is common. They gave ivermect to people in three areas for 15 years, every 6 months, and checked for 5 years after to see if it worked. They tested 29,753 people and 49,600 blackflies for the parasite. Results showed a decline in infection and transmission after treatment. In two areas, the parasite was gone 3-4 years later. In the third, where it was high before, it declined to low levels 3-5 years later. The study proved that iverectin can eliminate onchias in some African areas. The findings helped change onchias control to elimination efforts in Africa.
Researchers have studied how a protein called VP4 from the rhinovirus virus, a common cause of the common cold, helps the virus enter cells. Rhinovirus is a type of non-enveloped virus, which means it doesn't have a protective layer around its genetic material. To get inside a cell, the virus needs to deliver its genetic material through the cell membrane without fusing with it. VP4 is a small protein on the virus that helps with this process. Scientists created a version of VP with a tag to study its behavior. They found that VP4 can make holes in model membranes, allowing single-stranded RNA to pass through. The size of the hole matches the size of the virus's genetic material. The team also found that pH affects how well VP4 works and that it's similar to how the real virus works. This study shows how VP4 helps the virus enter cells and suggests it could be a target for new treatments for related viruses like poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease.
Francisella tularens (Ft) is a highly infectious Gram-negative bacterium that causes tularemia, a disease classified as a class A select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The bacterium's lipid A structure is similar to that of Francisella novicida (Fn), a pathogen of mice. Researchers identified three enzymes required for lipid carbohydrate modifications: mannose (m1), galactamine (m2), or both (mK). Mutants lacking galactamine (m2) or galos/mannose (m) were attenuated in mice by both pulmonary and subcutaneous routes of infection. Aerosolization of mutants m2 and mK provided protection against wild-type Fn, while subcut administration of mK provided protection from Fn. Infection of alveolar macrophage cells by mK induced higher levels of tumor necrosis-α (TN-α) and macrophage inhibitory-2 (M-2) compared to Fn. Bone marrow-derived macrophages from TLR4 and TLR2 knockout mice infected with m produced higher IL-6 and M-2 than those infected with Fn. However, IL-6 and M-2 were undetectable in MyD−/− mice infected with either strain. My−/− mice were susceptible to m mutant infection. The researchers hypothesize that m's ability to activate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemine production and innate responses by MyD signaling may be responsible for its attenuation, leading to protective immunity.
Researchers studied the role of Era, a protein involved in ribosome assembly, in Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Era is a GTPase that acts as a switch to coordinate ribosome assembly and is conserved across all domains of life. However, its function in ribosome assembly is unclear. The study found that Era is not essential for S. aureus growth but important for 30 ribosomal subunit assembly. Era interacts with 16 rRNA enduclease Y and DEAD RNA helicase C, crucial for rRNA processing and growth at low temperatures. Era and C also interact with ppG synthase Rel, impacting Gase activity and helic activity. Era acts as a hub on ribosome, directing enzymes for r processing and assembly. The stringent response, triggered by ppG, inhibits Era activity, contributing to slowed growth. The study suggests Era's role as a guide for ribosome maturation enzymes to their substrates.
Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) causes vascular insufficiency in experimental animals through unknown mechanisms. Researchers investigated the role of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in this process. They found that OS-deficient mice are more sensitive to LT, while OS and endothelial OS-deficient mice are not. The increased sensitivity of OS-deficient mice is not due to macrophage sensitivity or cytokine responses, but can be replicated in OSufficient mice through pharmacological inhibition. Histological analysis showed LT-induced changes in heart morphology of OS-def mice, with novel inter-fiber spaces and no cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Electron microscopy revealed pathological changes in hearts of both OS-def and OSufficient mice, varying in severity and timing. Biomarkers of cardiac injury were elevated in LT mice rapidly, indicating cardiac damage. Cardioprotective therapy and allopurin had no effect, but nitric oxide scavenger carbox-PT showed some protection. Echocardiography showed reduced ejection fraction in both OS and OS mice, indicating decreased contractile function. The heart is an early target of LT and OS plays a protective role against cardiac damage.
Scientists have developed a new method to edit genes in parasitic worms that infect over a billion people worldwide. These worms cause some of the most common tropical diseases, but their biology is not well understood due to lack of tools for genetic study. Researchers used a technique called CRISPR-C9 to disrupt a gene in the human parasitic worm Strongyloides steralis, causing severe movement problems in the worms. They also disrupted a similar gene in another parasitic worm, Strongyloides ratti. This shows CRPR-C9 can be used in parasitic worms, making it possible to study their genes and develop new treatments.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the effects of ribosome drop on translation and ribosome density along mRNA. Ribosome drop occurs when cells are under stress, such as amino acid starvation or high recombinant protein expression, affecting protein expression efficiency. The model shows ribosome premature termination leads to non-intuitive ribosome profiles, like increased density from 5' to 3' end. Importantly, it predicts rib drop effects on translation are mRNA-specific and quantifies resilience to drop, showing mRNAs with ribosomes are less affected than those without. Among mRN without ribosomes, resilience to drop correlates with elongation rate, fast codons are less affected. Genome-wide analysis in S. cerevisiae reveals mRN coding proteins involved in translation, using fast codons, are resilient to drop. In physiological conditions, mRN coding regulatory stress proteins are less resilient to drop. The model explains variations in translational efficiency by accounting for ribosome behaviors and mRNA variations in rib density from profiling studies.
Researchers are trying to find out if it's possible to stop the spread of soil-transmitted helminths (STH) infections by giving medicine to everyone in a community at the same time. The World Health Organization's current plan is to control STH by giving medicine to school-aged children, but this doesn't stop the spread because there are still infected people and contaminated soil in the environment. Some think giving medicine to everyone at once could speed up stopping the spread, but it's hard to get everyone to take it. A study called DeW3 is testing this idea. It will give medicine for 3 years and then watch for 2 years to see if the spread stops. The researchers want to know if they can tell if the spread is stopped earlier than 2 years. They used a computer model to simulate the study and found that it's hard to tell if the spread is stopped after 1 year unless almost everyone took the medicine. If the spread isn't stopped, it can come back to the same level before medicine was given. Knowing if it's stopped early can save time and money in places where it's unlikely to come back. The study also looked at how much medicine is needed to stop the spread.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine against cholera, a disease caused by Vibrio cholera bacteria. The vaccine is made from a part of the bacteria's outer layer called O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) and a fragment of tetanus toxin. They tested the vaccine in mice and found it was effective in protecting against cholera. The vaccine worked best when given with an adjuvant, a substance that helps the body's immune system respond. Mice that got the vaccine with adju had high levels of antibodies against OSP, a key to fighting cholera. Those that got the vaccine without adju also had some antibodies, but not as many. Mice that got only OSP or adju had no antibodies. The vaccine also triggered memory cells that remember OSP, helping fight cholera. In a test, 95% of mice that got the vaccine with adju survived cholera. The researchers think this vaccine could help young children, who don't respond well to OSP alone. They used a part of tetanus toxin as a carrier, which can be used in other vaccines too. They chose OSP from Vibrio cholera O1 because it's known to be protective in mice. However, infection with O1 doesn't protect against O139 and vice versa, showing OSP is key.
Researchers have discovered that the fungus Candida albicans can inhibit the virulence of the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa by suppressing the production of pyelin and pyoverine, which play a crucial role in iron acquisition and virulence. In a mouse model of gastrointestinal colonization and dissemination, Candida albicans was shown to reduce the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inhibiting pyelin and pyd gene expression. Deletion of both pyelin and pyd genes attenuated Pseudas virulence. Heat-killed Candida alb had no effect on Pseud, whereas Candida secreted proteins directly suppressed pyd and pyelin expression and inhibited P vir in mice. Interestingly, suppression or deletion of pyelin and pyd genes had no effect on P's ability to colonize the GI tract but decreased P's cytotoxic effect on colonocytes. Iron supplementation restored P vir in Pseud and Candida colonized mice. The findings provide insight into how bacterial-fungal interactions can modulate virulence in the intestine.
Researchers studied how a type of virus that evades CD8 T cells, a key part of the immune system, affects the outcome of infection. This virus, called EM, is less fit than the normal virus and often reverts back to normal upon transmission to a new host. However, the time it takes for this to happen varies greatly. They infected macaques with a mix of EM and normal virus and found that if the mix contained at least 10% normal virus, the normal virus took over within 7 days. But if the mix had smaller amounts of normal virus, it took weeks for the normal to become dominant. This delay was linked to lower viral loads. The amount of virus in the initial infection determines how quickly it reverts to normal, which in turn affects the outcome of the infection. Delaying the reversion of virus-reducing CD T escape mutations may reduce the severity of HIV in early infection.
Researchers studied yeast populations in Evolution Canyon, Israel, and found that some strains are highly resistant to the heavy metal cadmium. They discovered that this resistance is mainly due to a gene called PCA1, which helps remove cadmium from the cell. Analysis showed that changes in the PCA1's promoter, not its coding region, are responsible for the increased activity. Experiments showed that three specific mutations in the promoter increase PCA's activity, making cells more resistant to cadmium. These mutations are also found in other yeast species, suggesting they're an ancient adaptation. However, they're not present in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which grows better without cadmium. The study suggests a trade-off between metal resistance and fitness in yeast populations.
Researchers have identified three major cancer-causing pathways in stomach cancer that are linked to patient survival rates. They used a computer-based method to map these pathways in 301 stomach cancer samples, the second leading cause of global cancer deaths. The three pathways, proliferation/stem cell, NF-κ, and Wnt/β-caten, are deregulated in over 70% of stomach cancers. These pathways were validated in a panel of stomach cancer cell lines. Patient stratification by these pathways showed significant differences in survival in multiple groups, suggesting interactions play a role in disease behavior. Stomach cancers can be grouped by pathway activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups. Predicting pathway activity by expression allows study of multiple pathways in cancers simultaneously, not achievable by other methods.

A computer method was developed to map pathway levels in tumor profiles and validated using breast cancer examples. This method was applied to stomach cancer to evaluate pathways implicated in carcinogenesis. Eleven pathways were selected, including tumor suppressor and oncogenic, previously implicated in stomach carcinogenesis. A four-step strategy was used to predict pathway activation: defining pathway signatures, mapping onto cancer profiles, validation, and applying to stomach cancer.

Stomach cancer is the second cause of global mortality, prevalent in Asia, most patients diagnosed with advanced disease. Deregulation of pathways such as E, KAS, p, and W/βaten signaling occur in stomach, indicating molecular heterogeneity.
Researchers have developed a method called stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) to identify areas in DNA that are prone to separation under stress. They applied this method to the Escherichia coli genome and found that destabilized sites occur more often in non-coding regions, particularly near known or inferred promoters. The study investigated whether genes in different categories have characteristic S properties in their upstream regions. They found that strong S sites in the E coli genome are significantly associated with the upstream of genes encoding transcription regulators, especially those responding to environmental stimuli. If a gene is controlled by a transcription regulator with a destabilized 5' flank, the genes in that pathway usually have strong S sites in their 5' flanks. This association was observed in 38 free-living bacteria but not in 18 endosymbion or obligate parasitic bacteria. The results suggest that S sites may be involved in transcriptional responses to environmental changes that alter superelicity. The researchers propose that these sites are active participants in superically mediated mechanisms governing gene expression changes in response to physiological or environmental changes.
Researchers studied the role of high-mob group (HMG) proteins in the fungus Podospora anserina, a type of fungus. HMG proteins are DNA-binding proteins that control gene expression. They found 12 HMG genes in P anina, 4 of which control mating and fruit development, and 1 involved in mitochondrial stability. Deleting the remaining 8 uncharacterized HMG genes showed none were essential, but 7 involved in the sexual cycle. Two HMG genes, PaMG5 and Pa9, stood out. Pa5 is an activator of mating genes, while Pa9 represses specific genes in stationary phase. Analyzing HMG genes in deletion strains showed Pa5 is central to a network regulating mating genes. Genetic analysis revealed this network also controls fertility genes not regulated by mating factors. This study highlights HMG's role in sexual reproduction, with 11 of 12 involved in P anina's cycle. Pa5 and Ste11, from Schizoscharomyces pombe, are conserved regulators of mating genes, despite diverging 550 million years ago. Two HMG, SO9 and its regulator S, also play role in sex determination in mammals. Pina and pom mating genes and regulator form an H-box module like SRY/SOX, showing common sex regulation in animals and fungi.
During the 2013-2016 West African Ebola virus epidemic, there was a lack of data on how long the virus persisted in survivors' bodies and the risk of transmission, including sexual transmission. To address this, an observational study was conducted in Sierra Leone during the epidemic response. The study aimed to determine the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors' body fluids and assess the risk of transmission. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase, initiated within five months of discussions, assessed the persistence of Ebola in semen of 100 men. The second phase assessed the persistence in multiple fluids (semenstrual, vaginal, blood, breast milk, urine, rectal, sweat, saliva, tears) of 120 men and 120 women. Data informed national and global guidelines in real-time, demonstrating the need for semen testing among Ebola survivors. The study accelerated implementation of such programs in virus-affected countries and informed persistence of Zika virus studies. Research is crucial in responding to a poorly understood disease.
Scientists have studied how bacteria, specifically Escherichia coli, detect and respond to chemical signals in their environment. They used a technique called FRET to measure how the bacteria's chemotactic pathway responds to different concentrations of chemicals. By analyzing this data, they predicted the types of chemical gradients the bacteria typically encounter in their natural habitat. The researchers also used information theory and simulations to understand how the bacteria's internal and external noise affect their ability to detect these gradients. They found that the bacteria usually encounter exponential gradients, which lead to a log-normal distribution of stimuli and maximum velocity. This is a step towards understanding the complex environments bacteria live in, like the human intestine.

The study used a multidisciplinary approach, combining FRET measurements, theory, and simulations of bacteria swimming. They found that maximizing information means aligning the bacteria's trajectory with the chemical gradient and increasing their velocity. This suggests the bacteria's pathway has evolved to detect exponential gradients. The Weber-Fech law doesn't predict gradient distribution, but views changes in concentration as useful for the cell. The researchers quantified this view of signaling and characterized the environment in terms of distributions.

The chemotactic system allows bacteria to detect and move towards nutrients or toxins. It's relatively simple with few components and well-understood at the molecular level. It shares design principles with other sensory systems, including Weber's law, Weber-Fech law, and fold detection. The study connects these laws with information at the molecular level, unlike previous research.
Scientists have long believed that hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which produce all blood cells, have an indefinite lifespan due to their ability to self-renew. However, new research suggests that identical HSC differ in lifespan and that lifespan is predetermined and intrinsic to the cell. Lifespan is defined as the time H gives rise to mature blood cells. A new model based on reliability theory explains the diversity of lifespans of Hs. Using experiments and computational modeling, small-scale molecular failures at H population level were tested. The best fit of data is provided by a model where repulation kinetics of H are largely anti-persistent or mean-reverting processes. Failure rates increase during division events are counteracted by repair processes, leading to a crossover from anti-persistent to persistent behavior. This is due to increased failure rate of selfnew leading to clonal extinction. The capacity of Hs is self-limit. Lifespan of each H depends on amplitudes and frequencies of failure kinetics. Short and longer Hs differ in ability to dissipate perturbations. This suggests lifespan is determined by differences in repair capacity.
Antibodies play a crucial role in protecting against chronic helminth infections, which affect one-third of the world's population. Researchers have long known that antibodies and a type of immune cell called macrophages help fight these parasites, but how they work together was unclear. A new study found that helth-specific antibodies trap and prevent damage caused by helmin larvae by changing macroage behavior. Macrophages are a type of immune cell that help fight infection, but can also cause damage if not controlled. The study used mice infected with a common parasite and found that without antibodies, the larvae moved freely and caused tissue damage. With antibodies, the larvae were trapped and macroages expressed a gene that helps heal wounds. This happened without a known signaling pathway, called IL-4α, which is usually involved in macroage activation. The study suggests a new way antibodies activate macroages to fight helmin and prevent tissue damage. This is a step towards understanding how to develop a vaccine or treatment for helmin infections.
Scientists have developed a new way to study how cells repair damaged DNA breaks in their chromosomes without interfering with the process. This is a major threat to the cell's integrity and can lead to cancer or cell death. The new method, called ParBINT, uses small proteins to mark the broken DNA ends, allowing researchers to track its movement in real-time in living cells. They used it to study yeast cells and found that the broken DNA is confined to a small area near the break in the early stages of repair. This is consistent with the idea that the ends need to stay in contact to fix the damage. In some cells with a mutation that affects repair, the process started 10 minutes earlier than normal, showing a key step in the repair process. The new tool can be used to study other processes like gene expression and replication in normal and diseased cells.
Researchers studied how often people in areas with Chagas disease get infected with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi again. They used computer models to estimate the rate of re-infection and how often it happens during the acute and chronic stages of the disease. The models were based on data from villages in Argentina where 56% of people have mixed infections. The best model predicted 0.032 re-infections per person per year, with 98% happening in the chronic stage. The parasite evades the immune system in 20% of re-infections. This means people have a 14-18% risk of re-infection after 5 years and 21-70% after 30 years, with most getting infected 1-3 times. The low rates are due to weak transmission and not a strong immune response. This is important for vaccine development and understanding disease risk in endemic areas.
Researchers studied blood samples from a group of Thai children who got infected with deng virus (DENV) to understand why some people get sick and others don't. They found that people who got sick had higher levels of certain cytokines, like IL-15 and MCP-1, in their blood before they got infected. People who got sick also had lower levels of other cytokines like IL-12, IL-2, MIP-α, RANT, GM-CSF, and TNα. This suggests there are two types of immune responses to DENV: one that protects and one that makes people sick. The study found higher levels of some cytokines in people who got sick and higher levels of others in people who didn't. This could help us understand how to make better deng vaccines. Previous studies found higher levels of certain cytokines in people with severe deng, like TNα, IFγ, IL18, ILβ, IL6. But this study looked at people before they got infected to see if their immune system could predict if they'd get sick or not. The study had few people who got very sick, so can't say if this profile is linked to severe deng. Also, they only looked at blood 4-7 months before infection, so don't know if other infections or waning immunity changed profiles.
In the fruit fly wing disc, the Hedgehog (H) protein forms a gradient that organizes patterning along the anterior-posterior axis and specifies at least three different domains of gene expression. The prevailing view is that H functions as a classical morphogen, but a direct correspondence between the borders of these patterns and H concentration has not been demonstrated. Researchers found that interpretation of H signaling depends on the history of exposure to H and that a single concentration is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Using mathematical modeling, they predict that at steady state, only two domains can be in response to H, suggesting the boundaries of two or more gene patterns cannot be specified by a static H gradient. Computer simulations suggest a "overshoot" of the H gradient, a transient in which H is expanded compared to H-state. Through examination of H target expression, patterns expand initially and then refine, providing in vivo evidence for overshoot. The H gene architecture suggests overshoot results from H-dependent upregulation of receptor Patched (Ptc). Altering the network such that P is no longer upregulated in response to H-signaling, found patterns of expression, distinct in wild-type discs now overlap.
Researchers have identified a gene called unc-79 in mice that plays a crucial role in how the nervous system responds to ethanol. They found a mutation in this gene, called Lightweight, which makes mice more active and sensitive to ethanol. When exposed to ethanol, Lightweight mice are more likely to die than normal mice. However, mice with one copy of the mutation are more sensitive to ethanol, but not as much as those with two copies. Similar results were seen in a worm called C. elegans, which has a related gene called unc-79. Mice with one copy of the mutation are also more active in new environments and eat more food, but are leaner than normal mice. They also drink more ethanol than normal mice. This suggests a shared pathway in humans and mice that might influence alcohol behavior. The researchers found a mutation in the unc-79 gene in mice, which affects how they respond to ethanol and anesthetics, similar to C. elegans and fruit flies. Mice with one copy of the mutation are more active and sensitive to anesthetics, like isoflurane. They are also more active in new environments and eat more, but are leaner than normal. They drink more ethanol than normal mice. This suggests a shared pathway in humans and mice that might influence alcohol behavior.
Researchers have identified a key immune pathway in the Anopheles gambia mosquito that helps fight off the malaria parasite Plasium falcum, which causes malaria in humans. This pathway, called the Imd, is a powerful defense mechanism that can be used to control malaria transmission. By silencing a gene that regulates the Imd pathway or overexpressing a factor that controls it, mosquitoes become resistant to the parasite. However, more research is needed to understand how to use this mechanism for malaria control. Scientists used RNA interference to silence genes in the Imd pathway and found other genes that work with it to fight the parasite. They found that the Imd is most effective against the parasite's early stage, but also works against other stages. Silencing a key gene in the pathway alone is enough to trigger a strong response against the parasite, even without the mosquito's gut bacteria. The study also found that certain genes in the I pathway, TEP, APL, and LR1, play a role in infection-dependent defense, showing the importance of lab versus natural infection models. These findings highlight considerations for using the I pathway in mosquitoes to limit malaria transmission and reveal nuances in the immune response against the parasite.
Researchers investigated the anti-fibrotic effect of bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BSCs) in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis caused by the fungus Paroccidiococcus brasiliensis. They found that BSCs did not have an anti-frotic effect and may even worsened the condition by promoting collagen expression and tissue remodeling. Mice were infected with P. brasili and received either BSCs or the antifungal drug itraconazole (TC) alone or in combination. Histological analysis showed increased granulomatous areas and fibrocy count in BSC-treated mice. Soluble collagen and collagen-3, TGF-3, MMP-8, and MMP-15 genes were also increased in those mice. Combined therapy BSC/TC reduced TIM-1 and MMP-13 expression. Human fibroblasts stimulated with lung homogen from infected BSC-transplanted mice showed higher collagen expression. The study suggests that BSC therapy may not be effective against P. brasili infection and could even exacerbate fibrosis.
Researchers studied the seasonal patterns of sand fly species that transmit Leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania infant, in the Mediterranean region. They collected over 99,000 sand flies from 2011-2013 in 8 countries where the disease was reported. The study found 56,000 flies belonged to 6 species that can transmit Leishias. The flies were active at different times and in different places, with some appearing as early as April and others in June. The density of flies varied, with a peak in July-August and multiple peaks in May-September. A unique pattern was found in Cyprus with 3 peaks. Flies were active from September-November without correlation with temperature. The period of exposure to Leishias was July-September with a peak in July-October. No transmission occurred from December-March. Flies were most active at night, peaking between 11pm-2am. The study found a pattern of behavior that can be used for monitoring. The risk of Leishias transmission was highest June-October, but not evenly distributed, with earlier and more frequent in southern territories.
Scientists have discovered that the bacteria Orientia tsutsamushi, which causes scrub typhus, a disease prevalent in the Asia-Pacific region, can infect and alter the behavior of immune cells called monocytes. Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off infections. When exposed to Orientia tsamushi, monocytes changed the expression of over 4,500 genes, including those involved in the production of interferon, a protein that helps fight off viruses and bacteria. The bacteria also induced the expression of genes related to apoptosis, or cell death, in a small percentage of monocytes. Researchers found that the changes in monocytes exposed to Orientia tsam were similar to those found in patients with scrub typhus. This is the first time monocytes have been shown to be polarized, or changed, in response to Orientia tsam in a lab setting. The study sheds light on the pathogenesis of scrub typh, which involves interferon activation of monocytes and their transformation into a specific type called M1. This may lead to new tools for diagnosing patients with typhus.
Scientists have long wondered how ants and other animals navigate complex environments using memory. A key part of the insect brain, called the mushroom body, has been linked to memory, but its function has been mostly studied for simple tasks like recognizing smells. Researchers took a model of the mushroom body developed for fruit flies and applied it to desert ants to see if it could help them learn routes in complex environments. They found that the model worked, allowing ants to quickly learn and remember routes in natural settings. The study suggests the mushroom body can store hundreds of images, or "snapshots," of the environment. 

The researchers used a computer simulation to test the model, feeding it real images of ants' views in their habitat. The model learned to distinguish between on-route and off-route images, showing it can be used for navigation. Notably, the model, made for simple smell recognition, needed little change to work for the more complex task of navigation. Ants and other insects have larger mushroom bodies than flies, which may help with this ability.
Plants have an innate immune system to protect themselves from disease, but they also have unique defense mechanisms like shedding leaves to replace damaged organs. Researchers studied how Arabidopsis thaliana leaves respond to bacterial infection by shedding. They infected Arabidopsis leaves with Pseudomonas syringae, a bacterium that lacks a type III secretion system, and found that it didn't trigger shedding. This suggests shedding is a new form of immunity triggered by bacterial effectors. Genes HAESA/HA2, INFRESC, and NES are needed for shedding to occur. Plants with mutations in genes for bacterial defense and salicylic acid signaling, like phytoalex, disease, and senescence, fail to shed leaves normally. Bacteria touching shedding zones trigger a strong response, but signals are also sent from infected tissue to alert the shedding zone of danger. The researchers propose a model where minor infections are handled by limiting growth, but when out of control, leaves are shed. Salicylic acid regulates both pathogen and drought-triggered shedding. They developed a system to study Pseudas syring pv tomato DC0 in Arabidopsis to understand defense mechanisms. This builds on a well-studied system where non-flowering Arabid leaves are infected with Pseudas syringe. The study defines a model for pathogen-triggered shedding in Arabid and explains genetics. The abission pathway is required for all forms of inducible shedding in Arabid. The response is robust and can be triggered by disease or ET. Disparate pathways regulating defense and shedding are connected, and components are necessary for pathogen-trigger shedding. Salicy acid is necessary for full pathogen and drought shedding.
Researchers studied how starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the retina detect motion direction. These cells generate larger calcium signals when motion is moving towards their tips than away from them. To understand how this direction selectivity (DS) works, they measured responses to expanding and contracting circular visual stimuli. They found that fundamental and harmonic frequency components were larger for expanding stimuli, suggesting nonlinearity. The relationship between harmonic amplitudes and potential indicates activation of voltage-gated channels. Calcium changes in dendrites due to voltage steps were monitored by two-photon microscopy, showing the distal dendrite is depolarized relative to the soma, due to tonic glutamgic input and high-voltage Ca+ channels. Compartment modeling suggests DS in SACs can be computed by dendrites relying on voltage channels and dendritic gradient, providing spatial asymmetry for discrimination.

Experiments used circular and CP wave stimuli, evoking DS somatic and dendritic Ca+ responses. Dendritic Ca+ responses were seen in a minority of cells, while electrical responses were present in all. Inhibitory blockers showed DS can be generated by a dend-intrinsic mechanism. Blocking GABA and glycine receptors was required to block effects on dendritic Ca signals, indicating GABA and glycine lateral inhibition contributes to DS. Pharmacological data showed DS persists when GABA receptor connections are blocked, suggesting SACs generate DS by themselves. Optical recordings showed strongest Ca+ increases in distal dendrites, near synapses. Dend morphology and low impedance at soma provide electrical isolation, necessary for local processing.
Researchers studied how different types of pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi, infect humans and cause harm. They found that the number of pathogens needed to infect a host, called the infective dose, varies greatly between species. The type of molecules pathogens use to infect also plays a role. Those that act locally require fewer pathogens to infect than those that act from a distance. However, pathogens that act from a distance may be more harmful because they can infect many cells at once. The study tested this on 43 human pathogens from various groups and found that locally acting pathogens have lower infect doses but are not more harmful. Instead, harm is linked to the number of pathogens and how they enter the body. Those that enter through skin cause more harm than those inhaled or ingested. The study shows that understanding how pathogens work can explain why some are more infectious and harmful than others.
Researchers studied the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of the parasitic worm Schistosoma mansoni, which causes schistosomiasis, a disease affecting 200 million people worldwide. They analyzed the 3' untranslated regions (3-UTR) of transcripts in juvenile and adult worms and found that the mi-277/498 family was significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult stage. They identified a novel miRNA, sm-mi-498, located near smi-277, suggesting a miRNA cluster, and proposed hairpin structures for both miRNAs compatible with the miRNA pathway. Expression of smi-277/498 was upregulated in adults, while their targets were downregulated in adults but not in immature females. Smi-498 was expressed in tegument cells near the oesophagus and throughout the male body. The study suggests mi-277/498 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation during development and sexual maturation of schistosomes.
Researchers have discovered a large pool of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) in horseshoe bats in China. These viruses are different from the SARS virus that caused a global outbreak in 2003. The researchers found 11 new SARS-Co viruses in a cave in Yunn Province, China and compared them to previous findings. They found that S-CoVs in this cave are diverse, especially in genes OR3 and OR8. Importantly, some strains are similar to SARS in the hypervar N-terminal (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S gene. They also found S-Co similar to human SARS in OR3 and split OR8. Additionally, S-Co from this cave are closer to S in non-structural genes OR1 and 1 compared to others. Recombination analysis shows recombination events in the gene and OR8 between S-Co. The researchers think the direct SARS progenitor may have come from recombination of these-Co precursors. Cell studies show three new-Co with different proteins can use human ACE as receptor, close to S-Co. This study gives new insights into SARS origin and importance of preparedness for future S-like diseases.
Researchers are examining the effectiveness of the faecal egg reduction test (FECRT) in detecting drug resistance in human hookworms. The test measures egg output before and after treatment to determine drug efficacy. However, a phenomenon called density-dependent fecundity, where worms increase egg production after treatment, may distort results. This can lead to underestimation of drug efficacy. The degree of underestimation depends on worms' ability to increase egg output, which varies among individuals. Cases with heaviest infections may increase egg output the most. Omitting these cases from FEC may reduce underestimation. Density-dependent fecundity affects the utility of FEC as a resistance tool, highlighting need for new methods like in vitro assays or genotypic changes.
Researchers have discovered that a molecule called heparan sulfate, found on the surface of epithelial cells, plays a crucial role in the development of the lung's tree-like structure. This structure is formed through a process called branching morphogenesis, where the lung grows and divides into smaller branches. The study found that removing heparan sulfate synthase, an enzyme that makes hepar, from epithelial cells, resulted in abnormal lung development. The lung's tips were larger and there were fewer branches, and there was a problem with the development of mesenchymal cells. The researchers also found that a protein called FGF was overexpressed in the mutant lungs, which likely contributed to the abnormal development. Further investigation showed that a protein called SHH, which suppresses FGF, was reduced in the mutant lungs. Reactivating SH in the lungs rescued the abnormal development and reduced FGF activity. The study found that the biologically active form of SH was reduced in the epithelial and surrounding mesenchym cells. This highlights the importance of hepar sulfate in SH signaling for lung development.
Researchers have developed a new technique called paired-end sequencing to detect genetic rearrangements in the genome, which are common in cancer and can create new genes. They wanted to know how much DNA to sequence to detect these rearrangements and where they are in the genome. They created a formula to calculate the probability of a gene fusion in a cancer genome given paired sequences and tested it on breast cancer samples. They found they could predict genes with a small number of large fragments. The ability to detect genes depends on gene length and sequencing parameters, and errors can lead to false positives. This will help future large-scale cancer studies enabled by next-generation sequencing technologies.

Paired-end sequencing is useful for detecting copy-neutral rearrangements like inversions and translocations, which are common in cancer and create new genes. The researchers focused on detecting rearrangement breakpoints, where two non-adjacent coordinates in the genome are adjacent in cancer. They extended this to fusion genes, which are created by rearrangements. Next-generation sequencing will make paired-end of cancer genomes reliable and precise for fusion detection. This will analyze all genomic events leading to cancer and shed light on cancer's genetic and genomic basis.

The probability of detecting genes depends on factors like number and length of sequenced clones, gene length, and errors in localization. They derived and tested formulae for experimental design of current and next-generation technologies. This makes studies more reliable across samples with limited reads. Paired sequencing has errors like artifacts, assembly errors, and mis-mapping, leading to incorrect or false positives. Whole-genome paired sequencing surveys all potential genes and rearrangements in tumors, advantages over transcript or protein studies.
Chemotaxis, the ability of cells to sense and move towards chemical gradients, is a complex process involving motility, gradient sensing, and polarization. Researchers have proposed that these processes are mediated by separate modules that, which, when combined, recreate the behaviors of chemotactic cells. A mathematical model using reaction-diffusion equations and a mechanical model of the cell's cortex demonstrates how these modules work together. The model includes an excitable network for random migration, a local excitation-global inhibition module for direction, and a polarization module linked to the cytoskeleton for persistent movement. By adjusting the strengths of feedback loops, the model replicates behaviors of genetically altered cell lines.

Experiments show that adaptation is not necessary for chemaxis, as cells without it perform less efficiently in uniform stimuli. However, adaptation allows cells to adjust sensitivity in the midpoint of a gradient. Simulations demonstrate that adaptation is not required for chemaxis. Cells can sense direction and respond to chemical gradients by polarizing and migrating towards attractants, a fundamental property of single and multicellular organisms. Experiments suggest chemaxis involves motility, sensing, and polarization.

A previous model, LEG-B, captured some features of chemotactic signaling, is expanded with two modules. A mechanical model simulates cytoskeleton deformations and movements. Polarized and unpolar cells coexist, and can acquire polarity during migration. The LEG-B simulates movement in various scenarios, illustrating complexity of chemactic machinery. Experiments show pathways have redundancy at the biochemical level.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called Tudor domain-containing 6 (TD6) in the development of sperm cells. TD6 is essential for the formation of a structure called the chromatoid body, which is crucial for sperm development and fertility. The study found that TD6 interacts with a protein called protein methyltransferase 5, which helps with RNA splicing. TD6 also interacts with a protein called Sm in the absence of RNA, and this interaction is dependent on a process called arginine methylation. Without TD6, the assembly of a complex called the spliceosome is impaired, leading to increased levels of a type of RNA. In the nucleus, this affects the formation of structures called SM bodies and Cajal bodies, which are involved in RNA maturation. Analysis of TD-deficient sperm cells showed high levels of splicing errors, such as incorrect use of introns and exons and aberrant splicing junctions. This study reveals a new function of TD6 in the maturation of the spliceosome and splicing in early sperm development.
Researchers have studied how bacteria colonize a host and play a crucial role in health, serving as a reservoir for transmitting to other hosts and invasive strains emerging. To understand this, they need to know how bacteria are acquired and cleared from the host. Previous studies have used genetic distance between isolates to determine if they are the same or different, but this approach doesn't account for the diversity within-host population, time between measurements, and uncertainty. A new Bayesian model is presented that calculates the probability of two strains being the same, allowing to determine clearance and acquisition from genomes over time. It models within-host variation using genetic simulation and uses Approximate Bayesian Computation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo for inference. The method is validated with simulations and applied to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a clinical study. The model doesn't rely on a fixed distance threshold and provides uncertainty estimates for relevant quantities. It's based on the idea that a "strain" is a population of closely related isolates. The study aims to understand colonization dynamics by inferring if bacteria at different times represent the same or distinct events, enabling calculation of acquisition and clearance rates. Whole-genome sequencing provides genetic distance between isolates, used to infer their relationship.
Plants grow new organs through the activity of stem cells called meristems. The shoot apical meristem creates leaves and flowers, while lateral merist create highly ordered, spiraled or whorled patterns through a process called phyllaxis. The transport of the hormone auxin is thought to play a major role in this process. Current hypotheses propose that hormone transporters of the PIN family create auxin maxima at precise positions, leading to organ initiation. To explain how transporters create flux to regions within the plant, different concepts have been proposed. A major hypothesis, canalization, suggests transporters amplify and stabilize existing flux, which could be initiated by diffusion. This explains organized auxin flux during vein formation, but shoot apical meristem requires a second hypothesis where hormone is transported to areas with highest concentrations. This implies two different mechanisms for PIN in membrane, based on sensing and concentration. Patterning requires interaction of hundreds of cells, making it impossible to estimate if a scenario is plausible. Computational modeling provides a means to test this hypothesis. A computer simulation shows flux-based hypothesis explains auxin at meristem, providing a unifying concept for control in plants. Experiments are needed to distinguish flux-based and other hypotheses.
Researchers have been working to develop a new diagnostic test for visceral leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani. They used a combination of lab experiments and computer searches to find potential biomarkers. Previous studies showed that IgG, a part of the immune system, could be used to monitor the disease in rapid tests. However, these tests were not very reliable. The researchers replaced the crude antigen used in these tests with specific ones and found that they were more accurate. They identified proteins from the parasite that IgG reacted with and used computer searches to predict which parts of these proteins were most likely to be recognized by the immune system. They tested these predictions in a small group of patients and found that one was 84% sensitive and 95% specific. This is a promising result for developing more reliable tests to monitor the disease. The team used computer searches to reduce the number of proteins to test, focusing on those with specific features. They predicted which parts of these proteins were likely to be recognized by the immune and tested these in a small group of patients, finding one that was 84% sensitive and 95 specific. This is a proof of concept for developing more reliable tests to monitor the disease.

Researchers studied 317 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from six countries: Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Iran, and others. They found caseating granulomas in 61.5% of cases, which were divided into three types: caseating (25.2%), suppurative (4.6%), and tuberculoid without necrosis (70.2%). Caseating and tuboid granuloma groups were different in terms of geography, with more cases in Saudi Arabia. Histologically, both groups differed in the distribution of Ridley's pattern (RP), with RP3 in caseating granulomas (31%) and RP5 in tuboid granuloma (38%). Time to healing was shorter in tuboid vs case group (4.0 vs 6.2 months). Parasitic index, species, and other variables did not differ between granuloma groups. 18.2% of CL cases had caseating granulomas, suggesting CL should be considered in differential diagnosis in endemic regions. Cases with caseating granulomas showed slower healing, no association with species, possibly due to worse immune response or aggressive leishmania strains.
Researchers have identified a gene that may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes in mice. The gene, called Zfp69, is a zinc finger transcription factor that helps control the expression of other genes. In mice with a version of the gene that doesn't work properly develop diabetes and obesity. The researchers found that a retrotransposon, a piece of genetic material that can jump from one location to another, disrupted the gene in mice that don't develop diabetes. In contrast, mice with a working version of the gene develop diabetes and obesity. The researchers also found that mice with a working version of the gene on a human gene, ZNF642, had higher levels in fat tissue of people with type 2 diabetes. This suggests that Zfp may play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes. The researchers conclude that Zfp is the most likely cause of the diabetes in mice and that the retrotranson contributes to genetic differences between strains.
Researchers have developed a new model to predict how cells in the vertebrate hematopoietic system differentiate into different types. This system has many branching pathways and cell types, making it a challenging to understand. The model combines regulatory and signalling pathways controlling cell differentiation. It uses a logical approach to analyze extensive data, which is mostly qualitative. To handle the network's size and complexity, a reduction method is used with a state identification algorithm. Simulations were done in various environments to see how they affect cell differentiation. Stable states were found for Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg subtypes, but also hybrid cells co-expressing Th, Th, Th2, and Treg markers in environment-dependent. The model shows the nature of these types and their relationships with Th subtypes. It can be used to explore new pathways in silico.
Researchers used a mathematical model to study how proteins called transcription factors bind to DNA in fruit fly embryos. These proteins help control which genes are turned on or off during development. They bind to thousands of spots on the genome, but how and where they bind is not well understood. The model predicted where and how five proteins bind based on DNA and protein-DNA affinities, but was only 40% accurate. Adding interactions between proteins and spatial patterns in the nucleus didn't improve accuracy. Many predicted bindings didn't happen in real life, likely due to closed chromatin. Measuring DNA accessibility improved predictions to 60-90% accuracy. The model showed that in open chromatin, binding is mostly determined by protein sequence, not interactions. Combining accessibility data and simple models can predict protein binding with high accuracy.
In the fruit fly Drosila, two proteins called Daughterless (Da) and Extramacchaetea (Em) play a crucial role in regulating cell growth and development. These proteins belong to a family of transcription factors called basic helix-loop-helix (bHL) that control cell proliferation in many animals. Research has shown that these factors are often misregulated in cancer cells. To understand how they work, scientists studied the development of epithelial cells in imaginal discs. They found that Em controls the transition from G2 to M phase and cell division through a protein called Cdc phosphatase string. When Em levels are low or Da are high, string is overexpressed, which rescues proliferative defects. The study also shows Da acts as a transcription repressor of string. This defines a mechanism by which Em controls cell growth by regulating Da, which represses string transcription.
Scientists have developed a new method to study how cells respond to stress by changing the way they grow and divide. They used a technique called phosphoproteomics to look at how proteins in yeast cells change when they are stressed. Phosphroteomics is different from proteomics because it looks at how proteins change, not just what proteins are there. The team created a pipeline to analyze phosphrote data from experiments to find important proteins and how they interact. They used this pipeline to study yeast and found 24 proteins involved in stress response and 9 in growth. Four of these proteins were tested and shown to affect growth, validating the method. This pipeline can be used to study other cells and find new proteins to investigate.
Researchers studied how the regulation of the X chromosome in fruit fly (Drosophila) male germline. They found that the X chromosome does not undergo dosage compensation, which is the equalization of X gene expression in males and females, in most of the male germl. They also found no evidence of meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI), which is the silencing and heterochromization of the X during meiosis in the male or female germl. The team discovered that the reduced expression of X-linked genes in Doph testes does not reflect a meiosis process, and microarray data show no overall reduced expression of the X in cells for meiosis-stage spermatocytes. They found that the expression of endogenous X-linked genes in Doph test is affected by evolved differences in chromosomal gene content, not dosage compensation or MCI. The study resolves previous conflicting reports and has implications for patterns of genome and speciation in Doph.
Researchers have studied how Citrobacterium, a bacteria that causes diarrhea in mice, infects the gut. They found that the bacteria form colonies on the gut lining of the intestines, called "attachment and effacement" (A/E) lesions. These colonies must constantly renew themselves by re-infecting the rapidly regenerating gut lining. It was unclear if these colonies come from planktonic bacteria in the gut or spread from sessile bacteria without a plankton phase. The study focused on the early stages of infection and found that colonic A/E colonies are clonal populations that depend on local growth to persist. In healthy mice, these colonies are established within 18 hours of infection. These early events shape the severity of infection despite the presence of virulent bacteria. Mechanistically, resistance to A lesion formation is mediated by TLR4/My88/Tr signaling and induced by virulent Citrobium in a gene-dependent manner. The study shows that Citrobium pathogenesis is restricted to a short window that determines disease severity.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the overlap between two populations, such as species or genes, when only a fraction of each population is sampled. This is a common problem in fields like ecology and epidemiology, where data is often incomplete. The new method, called Bay-opt estimation, uses Bayesian inference to account for the sampling rates and produces unbiased estimates of overlap. It also calculates the uncertainty of the estimates and can be used to plan future studies by balancing sampling effort and uncertainty.

The method is based on a special case of the diversity problem, where the total number of objects in each population is known. This is different from most existing indices, which assume complete data and lead to bias. The new method can be used for presence-absence data, but requires species abundance data for others. An example is estimating the overlap between two types of malaria parasites, each with 60 types. The goal is to find the true overlap if both were fully sampled. The method can also quantify uncertainty in the estimates.

The method can be improved by incorporating whole-genome data as prior, making it useful for studying Plasium spp. multig antigen families or general diversity in multig families.
Scientists have long known that eukaryotic kinases, a type of enzyme, regulate cellular functions by adding a phosphate group to targeted proteins through a highly conserved catalytic core. However, the interactions that control the active state of this core were not well understood. Researchers used cAMP protein kinase as a model and combined biochemical, biophysical, and computational techniques to identify a set of conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions that harmoniously regulate the mechanics. These include a salt bridge between a lysine from the β-strand and glutamate from α-helix, and electrostatic interaction between phosphorylated loop and α-helix and ensemble of hydrophobic residues of Regulatory Shell. Contrary to previous thought, the conserved lysine in β-str is not required for phosphorylation but essential for active state. The α-phates of ATP interact with conserved lysine in β-strand, forming a bridge with glutamate from α-helix. In absence of bridge and electro interaction, active state can be regulated through Shell. Enhancing hydrophity of from leucine to phenylane connected β-region and α-h through hydro interaction between Sh2 and Sh from β-region and RS from α-h. Results show it's possible to rescue catalytic activity by repositioning lys onto loop. Mutating glutamate to alanine destabilized active conformation associated with Shell, unable to undergo autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation, or catalysis. However, assembly can be partially restored by coexpressing with PDK, introducing interaction between phosphorylated loop and H from α-h. β is not required for phosphorylation but structural sensor facilitating state by coordinating β-region with α-h.
American Samoa conducted seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF) from 2000-2006. The World Health Organization recommends systematic post-MDA surveillance using Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) for epidemiological assessment of recent transmission. This study compared the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-M surveillance: a school-based survey of children aged 6-7 and community-based survey of people aged 8. In 2016, a school survey was conducted in 29 elementary schools and a cluster survey in 28 villages on two islands. Blood samples were tested for circulating filarial antigen (CA) using Alere Filariasis Strip. The school survey identified 9 antigen-positive children with an overall CA prevalence of 0.7%, while the community survey identified 102-positive people with a prevalence of 6.2%. Prevalence increased with age and was higher in males. The school survey had limited sensitivity and negative predictive value but high specificity and positive value for identifying villages with transmission. The community survey identified antigen individuals of all ages and foci of high prevalence. Both confirmed recrudence of transmission.
Researchers studied how sex is determined in zebraf fish, a common model organism. They found that sex is not just determined by one gene, but by multiple factors that can vary between strains and are influenced by environment. Germ cells, specifically oocytes, are needed for females to develop. But how oocytes control sex and maintain the female state is unknown. The study looked at two oocyte-produced signals, Bmp and Gdf9, and found Bmp plays a role in maintaining female sex in zraf. Females without Bmp develop normally but switch to males during mid-juvenile stage and become fertile. They also found estrogen is needed for female development and Bmp's function is linked to regulating estrogen production in oocytes. 

In the study, researchers tested if G9 and Bmp have a role in sex determination or female differentiation in zraf. They found Bmp females develop normally but switch to males during juvenile stage. Results provide insights into how oocytes regulate sex in zraf. The hypothesis is that o-gon interaction stabilizes c19a1 expression and estrogen by somatic gonad. Consistent, somatic gonad expresses Bmp receptors. c19 functions as a switch to determine female in zraf and medaka, animals without o develop as males, regardless of genotype, and oocytes are needed in adult zraf to maintain sex. This led to hypothesis that oocytes produce a signal to stabilize female expression in somatic gon, promoting ovarian fate. Two genes, c19a and Bmp, are needed for female development and maintenance. These establish a pathway for female development and maintenance inraf likely conserved in other fish.
Scientists have long known that a group of proteins called Hox play a crucial role in shaping the development of an animal bodies by controlling the expression of specific genes along the front-to-back axis. To achieve this precise control, it's thought that H proteins work together with other factors to turn genes on or off in a highly specific way. However, only a few of these factors have been identified. Researchers studied the regulation of a gene called reaper (r) by the H protein Deformed (D) in fruit flies and found that its expression in the front part of the maxillary segment is achieved through a combination of D with eight different transcription regulators on a small enhancer. This suggests that combinations of H proteins and other factors on small modules called H response elements (HRE) are responsible for the correct placement and timing of H targets. The study found that eight regulators, including Apt, Gcm, E, ms, En, Sl1, Br, Doc, and Disco, are needed in addition to D to properly regulate r in a specific cells of the maxillary. Another H target gene, pr, is activated by D in the front of maxillary through four sites in a fragment. Since D is throughout maxillary, but pr is only locally, it's likely other factors contribute to specific D-dependent pr expression. The findings suggest that proper H target regulation is achieved by multiple regulators: H proteins and many diverse factors.
Plants have a built-in defense system to fight off pathogens, using proteins called nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-L) sensors. These sensors recognize and respond to pathogen molecules inside and outside the cell. One such sensor, ADR-L2, works with salicylic acid (SA) to trigger defense responses. We studied the genetic requirements for ADR-L2 to function and found it acts as a "helper" to transduce signals from other sensors. ADR2 doesn't need an intact P-loop, but two related proteins do. We created an autoactive ADR2 mutation, A1D484, which leads to dwarf plants with high SA levels and disease resistance. This requires an intact P. We used A1D to define signaling requirements. A1 signaling doesn't need NAD oxidase and is regulated by E1 and At1. Transcription of A1 is linked to its outputs, both SA-dependent and-independent. Requirements resemble those for SA-dependent signal amplification and cell death. Importantly, A1 auto-signaling is controlled by E and SA in separate but linked pathways. This suggests a model for SA feedback regulation, including A2. ADR2 has non-canonical, P-independent helper functions in defense. We defined its canonical P-dependent functions and requirements. Wild-type A2 is required at BTH cell death in lsd mutant. Redundant E and SA in defense by sensor NB functions have been reported. Our results support this, constitutive A1 results in SA-dependent and-independent phenotypes. Plants respond to effectors with highly polymorphic intracellular resistance R proteins. NB-Ls are activated by effectors to trigger robust responses, including hypersensitive death. We created auto A1, A1 plants exhibit dwarf and constitutive defense. This requires an P. We used as proxy for canonical A in epistasis. A model consistent with new and previous analyses. Several NBs work in pairs, one as effector-sensor, the other helper. This may form higher complexes for regulated activation.
Researchers have identified two components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway in Arabidopsis, SUVH and ID2, which interact with the protein MOR6 to mediate transcriptional silencing. They found that SUV2 and SUV9 can act together with MOR6 or synergistically to silence genes, and ID2 interacts with MOR6 to silence a subset of MOR6 target loci. Other RDM components, including Pol IV, V, R2, and DRM2, are also required for silencing at a subset of MOR6 loci. MOR6 was previously shown to silence genes through heterochrom condensation, and researchers found that the SWI/SNF chrom-remodeling complex interacts with MOR6 and SUV9 to mediate silencing. This suggests that RDM components are involved in both methylation and MOR6-mediated heteroch condensation. The study shows how methylation is linked to heteroch condensation and enhances silencing at methylated regions.
Researchers studied the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp) in modifying phenotypes in vertebrates, using zebraf as a model. They found that inhibiting H90 did not induce a heat shock response or perturb phenotype in wild-type strains, but increased the severity of a recessive eye phenotype caused by a p6 mutation, while decreasing the severity of another caused by su mutation. A new spectrum of severe eye malformations, including anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanthalmia, was uncovered by limited H90 inhibition. Breeding offspring from unaffected parents led to elevated malformation frequencies, revealing the oligogenic nature of this phenotype. Unlike Drosila, H90 inhibition decreased developmental stability in zraf, indicated by increased asymmetric presentation of anophia, microphthalm, and nanthalm phenotypes. Analysis of p6 mutation suggests a mechanism for buffering by H90. The studies imply that mild perturbation of H90 at developmental stages may underpin variable penetrance and express of anomalies where genotype and environment play a role.
Researchers have identified and studied a common protein modification in living organisms called N-terminal acetylation, where the N-terminus of a protein becomes acetylated after translation. They analyzed proteins from fruit fly cells and found over 1,200 mature N-termini, showing N acylation occurs with similar frequency in insects and humans. A rule, called the X PX rule, determines when acetylation happens, and can be used to genetically engineer proteins to study its importance. By expressing mutated proteins in cells and flies, the researchers created an assay to test N acylation's role. This method can be applied to other species, as the rule seems valid in both simple and complex organisms, allowing the study of N acylation's function.
Researchers studied how an enzyme called RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) helps produce a type of RNA called transfer RNA (tRNA) in cells. tRNA is crucial for cell growth and development and cancer. To understand how RN III works, they looked for mutations that affect its ability to stop and start producing tRNA. They found 122 mutations in the yeast Saccharomyces pombe and mapped them to a 3.9 angstrom structure of RN III. The mutations were in the active center of the enzyme, including the bridge, loop, and pore, and funnel. The pore is where the RNA is cut by the C subunit. They purified RN III from a mutant that didn't stop producing tRNA and found it had a faster elongation rate. This suggests that the rate of producing RNA is inversely related to stopping. Mutants that didn't stop producing tRNA made more of it than normal cells, not just because they produced it faster. This was confirmed with a reporter gene that had a processing defect and strong terminator. They ruled out differences in RNA decay and found that mutants made more tRNA. Mutations didn't affect the III repressor M1. The study shows that parts of the active center, including C, are key to stopping and some activate III for transcription. Similar mutations in cancer suggest a new way III is activated in disease.
Researchers have developed a new method to predict which proteins interact with SH2 domains, a type of protein that binds to phosphopeptides. They used the structure of SH-phosphope complexes and an algorithm called FoldX to make predictions. The approach worked as well as experimentally derived sequences and substitution matrices in predicting known SH2 targets in vitro and in vivo. The team applied the method to a set of human SH domains with known structure and phosphorylation state, providing a list of high-confidence interactions. Predictions were validated using literature-derived SH interactions and a probabilistic score from Bayes integration of coexpression, conservation, interaction in other species, shared partners, and functions. The predictions led to a new hypothesis for SH role in signaling.

The method was tested on nine SH domains and showed applicability for genome-wide predictions. Structure-based prediction of SH-mediated protein-protein interactions has been addressed once before. The team believes future methods should account for both physics and biology of SH domains. They used Fold to predict in vivo interactions for nine SH-containing proteins and annotated with predicted interactions, providing a resource for further testing. Fold performed as well as consensus or substitution matrices in prediction in vitro SH-phope binding and SH-mediated protein interactions. With information on phosphorylation and structure, Fold gave accurate predictions of protein-protein interactions.
Researchers have discovered a protein called cyclophilin 40 (Cy40) that can break down toxic protein clumps called amyloids in the brain, which are a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. These clumps are made of a protein called tau, which is normally helps with cell structure but becomes toxic when misfolded. Cy40 is a type of enzyme that changes the shape of proline, a type of amino acid in tau, which makes it less likely to clump together. In lab tests, Cy40 broke down tau clumps and improved brain health and memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer's. It also interacted with other proteins with prolines and broke them apart. Without its enzyme activity, it couldn't do this. This is the first time a protein has been found to break down amyloids inside cells. The researchers think this could be a new way to treat Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study how cyanobacteria filaments form and sustain heteroc patterns, a type of cellular differentiation in multicellular organisms. The model combines the genetic circuit of a single cyanobacter with the diffusion of nitrogen along the filament, capturing the development and maintenance of heteroc patterns. By simulating the behavior of a single cyanacter under nitrogen deprivation and coupling their genetic circuits via diffusion, the model shows how heteroc patterns can be generated and sustained. Including noise and external conditions in the model reproduces the main features of heteroc formation and sustainment observed in experiments. The model is based on recent results on the genetic network of cyanobacteria and system biology theory, connecting macroscopic and microscopic processes. It captures the dynamical properties of the genetic circuit and diffusion of nitrogen along the filament. The model shows that noise plays a key role in the onset of differentiation, enabling characteristic heteroc patterns for various parameters. This suggests cyanobacteria have an efficient response to environmental conditions. The model consists of a filament of cyanacteria, each with a dynamical circuit, interacting via protein diffusion.
In Cameroon, despite over 15 years of mass treatment, onchocerciasis prevalence remains above the transmission threshold. A study in three districts with high oncherciasis prevalence aimed to explore the association between people's perceptions of onchiasis and the Community Treatment with Ivermect (CTI) program and their adherence to iverectin. The study found that perceptions of the program were the most determinant of adherence toiverin. Those with a positive opinion ofiverect distribution were more compliant than those with a negative opinion (40% vs 55 in Bang, 48 vs 62 in Bafia). Misconceptions about onchias transmission were common, especially in Bafia and Yassi, where people believed it was due to lack of hygiene. In Bang, many believed it was due to high sugar consumption. Perceptions ofiver distribution were strongly associated with adherence. Education and sensitization onchias during CT implementation and community involvement are recommended.
Researchers investigated the relationship between genetic and epigenetic variations and protein biomarkers for cancer and cardiovascular disease by combining DNA methylation and SNP data with protein measurements. They analyzed 121 biomarkers in relation to DNA methylation at 470,000 positions and 10 million SNPs in 698,103 samples. Epigen-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide association study (GW) analyses were performed, and biomarker, DNA methylation, and SNP data were integrated. The study found 124 loci with significant effects up to 0.22 units change per 1% methylation and 4 units per allele copy in EW and GW, respectively. Most GW loci were cis-regulatory, while EW were in trans. Eleven EW loci were associated with multiple biomarkers, including NL5 with CX11, CX9, IL-12, and IL-18. EW signals overlapping with GW were driven by genetic variants, while EW were confounded by smoking. Cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers had effect on methylation, but not vice versa. The study suggests epigenetic variation has limited direct effect on biomarkers, reflecting genetic, environmental, or secondary effects of disease pathogenesis.
Researchers studied how the varicella zoster virus (VZV) affects natural killer (NK) cells, a type of immune cell that fights off viruses. They found that VV directly impairs NK cells' ability to respond to stimulation, leading to a loss of killing and cytokine production. Not only infected NK cells, but also uninfected cells exposed to VV in culture were affected. This impairment was due to direct contact between NK cells and VV-infected cells. NK cells maintained surface receptor expression but couldn't respond to stimulation, suggesting VV paralysed them from responding. VV also blocked degranulation and cytokine production, including IF-γ and TNF. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) also infected NK cells and made them unresponsive, but differently affected cytokine production compared to VV. The study reveals a new way VV evades the immune system by paralysing NK cells.
Researchers investigated the neural basis of apparent motion (AM), a phenomenon where two stimuli presented at different locations create the illusion of a moving stimulus between them. They found that AM affects the detection of gratings along the path, with maximum impairment at high contrast levels, and strongest when target orientation matches inducers. A population model of early visual processing, based on contrast normalization, suggests that AM-related activation in visual cortex is too small to cause masking or perceived motion. Instead, it predicts suppression of early responses during AM, consistent with predictive coding theory. Predictive models propose higher-level motion predictions "explain" lower-level responses to expected input. AM evokes responses in V cells tuned to locations and properties of inducers, interfering with actual stimuli perception. However, masking doesn't necessarily imply V1 activation. Predictive coding accounts provide an alternative, considering motion as predictable context. A stimulus on path is predictable when features match moving and appears at consistent time and place. Responses along path are suppressed in V1 when predictable. The study examined AM's effect on low-level processing, investigating detection of gratings along path. AM impairs detection when target matches inducers' orientation. A previous study measured performance at single intensity, but not maximum reduction, linked to uncertainty. The model captures results, but can't rule out effects in other early cortex areas.
Researchers have found that the HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax plays a key role in transforming CD4 T cells by promoting cell growth and survival, mainly by activating the NF-κB pathway and inducing NF-κ target genes. To understand this process, they studied how Tax activates IK, a key component of the NF-κ pathway, in a cell-free system. They discovered Tax acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, working with Ubc2, Ubc5, or U7, to create mixed-link polyubiquitin chains. These chains directly activate IK by binding to its NEM subunit. This biochemical process clarifies how Tax activates IK, using minimal ubiquitination components for NF- activation, resolving confusion on HTL-1-induced IK-NF-κ activation. The study reveals cellular factors hijacked by HT-1 and may lead to new treatments for ATL and TSPAM.
Researchers have studied how the number of individuals introduced to a new population, known as propagule pressure, affects the success of alien species establishment. They analyzed data from various life forms, including invertebrates, plants, and vertebrates, and found a positive relationship between propagule pressure and success. However, success was most dependent on a range of 10-100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect was mainly due to different analytical approaches, with larger effect sizes in animal introductions than plant introductions. Study scale and methodology did not influence the relationship. The study is the first to quantify the relationship between propag pressure and alien establishment, using meta-analytical methods. It reveals consistency in the form of the relationship between propag pressure and success.
Interleukin-17 (IL-17), a protein involved in chronic and severe inflammation, reduces the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by degrading encoding mRNAs. The degradation of these mRN depends on proteins (AUBs) that target AU-rich elements in the 3'-translated region of mRN, either facilitating decay or stabilization. Researchers found that AUs and mRNAs assemble in a ribonucleoprotein complex in the presence of microRNA (miR16), leading to degradation. Notably, IL-17 reduces miR expression and promotes binding of stabilizing AUs over destabilizing AUs, reducing degradation. This indicates miR independently directs competition between degrading and stabilizing AUs for mRN. Since AUs affect about 8% of the human transcriptome and miR is ubiquitously expressed, IL-17 may affect other cellular processes besides inflammation.

IL-17 changes the contribution of miR and AUs to degrade mRN. Besides IL-17, IL-β also degrades mRN. Epithelial and fibroblast IL-17 with TN-α degrades mRN encoding inflammatory mediators, resulting in hyper production of pro-inflammatory mediators. Researchers found mRN encoding IL-8, IL-6, and G-CS degraded by AMD pathway, depending on AUs and mi16. These findings show modulation of Ap-miR regulation by IL- depends on specific target, mi usage, and AUs participation.

IL-8 degradation was inhibited by AUF in absence mi16. IL-17 reduced mi binding to complex and promoted IL8 to AUF, stabilizing IL8. Similar for other ARE-mRN, AUs compete for binding, balance regulated by IL, via mi. IL-17 inhibition mi and mi using LNA resulted in degradation. Enhancing mi expression with lentiviral constructs promoted degradation.
In Uganda, both chronic and acute forms of sleeping sickness, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, have been found in different areas of the country. Acute form has spread to new districts, linked to infected cattle movement. Cattle are long-term reservoirs of the parasite, showing few signs of illness but posing significant risk to human health. This study examined the relationship between cattle and human infection in villages in Kaberido and Dokolo districts. Villages with recent sleeping sickness cases had higher odds of cattle infection than those without. Cattle age affected the likelihood of infection, with those 18-36 months and over 36 months old having higher odds than under 18 months. Villages with sleeping sickness had higher detection of Trypanosoma brucei in cattle, with higher likelihood in case villages than non-case villages. A higher average Tryosoma bruce prevalence in a herd was associated with higher likelihood of Tryosoma rhodesense detection. The study found a strong association between high Tryoma bruce and Tryos rhodesense in villages, providing a means to determine risk at village level in districts.
Researchers have studied the role of the NS complex in regulating housekeeping genes in fruit flies. The NS complex is made up of several proteins, including NS1, NS3, MBD2, and MCR2, and is involved in modifying histone H4. They found that 85% of genes bound by the NS complex are constantly expressed across different cell types. These genes have specific histone modifications, such as H4ac, H2, H3, and H9, and a defined nucleosome-free region and broad transcription initiation patterns. The complex is required for efficient recruitment of RNA polymerase II to these genes, and its absence leads to reduced polymerase II and TBP and TFI binding. Genes that lose the most polymerase upon NS knockdown are involved in DNA replication. The study also found that NS targets constitutively expressed genes, or housekeeping genes, across 30 developmental stages of flies. These genes have elevated histone modifications and nucleosome-free regions.
Researchers have created a new mouse model to study a genetic disorder called facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FD), which causes progressive muscle weakness and wasting. This disorder is caused by a decrease in epigenetic repression of the D4 macrosatellite repeat and ectopic expression of DUX, a gene encoding a transcription factor. People with FD generally have more than 10 repeats in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4, while the most common form of FD is caused by contraction of the array to fewer than 10, associated with decreased epigen repression and variegated expression of DUX in muscle. The researchers generated transgenic mice carrying D4 arrays from FD allele and a control allele. These mice recapitulate epigen and DUX expression seen in patients and controls, including high DUX levels in germline, incomplete epigen repression in somatic tissue, and FD-specific varieg D4 expression in sporadic muscle associated D4 chromatin. They also show DUX activates similar gene groups in mouse cells as in human cells. These mice represent a valuable model for FD and will help study molecular mechanisms and test therapeutic strategies.
Researchers have been trying to develop a vaccine against malaria, a disease caused by Plasmodium falcum parasite, using a protein called Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1). However, the current vaccine only protects against strains similar to the one used in the vaccine, not all strains of the parasite. To overcome this problem, scientists need to understand how the vaccine works against different strains. They created a vaccine with four different versions of AMA1 proteins, called Quax or Q, and found it elicited antibodies that inhibited four different strains of the parasite. Comparing these antibodies to ones made by a single-strain vaccine, they found Quax induced higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies, associated with conserved domain-3 and reduced domain-2 responses. Monoclonal antibodies against Qu reacted with a cross-reactive epitope on the hydrophobic trough domain-1, which is conserved on AMA1 and includes the 1-loop. These antibodies were 10 times more potent than previous ones and blocked AMA binding to its ligand R2. Another antibody, E, bound to domain-3, was broadly inhibitory and blocked proteolytic processing of AMA. By itself was weakly inhibitory but synergized with another antibody, G, which binds to conserved face and inhibits R2 binding to AMA. Novel susceptible and epitopes identified can improve antigen breadth and inhibitory response of AMA vaccines. Vaccination with diverse proteins may provide universal coverage by redirecting response to conserved epitopes.
Researchers have discovered a mechanism that controls the timing of mitotic spindle displacement in cells, which is crucial for unequal cell division. The mitotic spindle is a structure that separates chromosomes during cell division, and its displacement to one side of the cell is necessary for cells to divide unequally. While some molecular mechanisms of spindle displacement are known, the timing of this process was unclear. A conserved mechanism of mitotic progression, the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, its target cyclin, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), was linked to spindle timing. The researchers found that these components form a timer for spindle displacement in Caenorhabditis zygote. Mitotic spindle displacement begins at a precise time after chromosomes congress to metaphase plate. Reducing function of proteasome, APC, or C20/Fizzy delayed spindle, while inactivating CD in metaphase caused spindle to displace early. Experimentally unlinking spindle from this mechanism resulted in premature displacement of incompletely assembled mitotic components. The study shows that spindle positioning is delayed until APC inactivates CD, ensuring spindle does not move until fully assembled. This is the first demonstration of mitotic timing spindle in animal cell division. The link between cell cycle and asymmetric division might be evolutionarily conserved, as spindle displaced at similar stage of mitosis in diverse systems.
Researchers studied the genetic adaptations of people living in high-altitude regions, specifically the Andean and Tibetan populations, to understand how they cope with low oxygen levels. These populations have developed unique physiological responses to high altitude, but the genetic basis of these adaptations was unknown. A genome scan was conducted to identify genes showing signs of adaptation to low oxygen levels. The study looked at each chromosome for regions with unknown functions related to altitude and examined genes involved in oxygen sensing. Four statistics were used to detect natural selection, identifying candidate genes and regions in both populations. Results showed distinct patterns of adaptation, with different genes and regions selected in each population. One gene, EGLN, important for oxygen sensing, was selected in both groups, but with different variations. Key genes and chromosomal regions were linked to high-altitude adaptation, providing a basis for future studies to confirm the role of selected genes.
Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA are a major source of genetic instability that can result from environmental assaults or DNA replication errors. Efficient repair of DSBs is crucial for cell survival, but faulty repair can lead to genetic instability, making the choice of DSB repair pathway important. Researchers found that inverted DNA repeats (IRs) near DSBs can channel repair into a pathway that leads to gene conversion instead of break-induced replication (BIR) that causes instability. IRs form unusual DNA structures when in single-strand DNA is formed by D-section. They can form two types of structures: inter-molecular single-strand annealing (SSA) leading to inverted dimers and intra-molecular SSA leading to fold-back (FB) structures. Both interfere with accurate DSB repair and channel D into BIR, promoting genomic destabilization. Different protein complexes process FB with short (12-b) versus long (1-k) DNA loops: MR-Sae2 for short and Rad-Rad10 for long. The study uncovers mechanisms of genomic destabilization from DSB repair by IR. Given IRs abundance in the genome, findings may contribute to understanding IR-mediated destabilization with human disease.
Researchers have developed a new animal model to study how the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes infections in the fruit fly Drosila melanogaster. Pseudas aerugin is an opportunistic pathogen that can cause both acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts, and chronic infections are thought to be caused by biofilms. Biofilms are structured, multicellular communities of microbes encased in an extracellular matrix that enable long-term survival in the host. The researchers infected Drosila with P aerugin and found biofilms formed in the fly's crop, with a characteristic structure and extracellular matrix of DNA and exopolysacide. Pugin cells from biofilms had increased resistance to antibiotics compared to planktonic cells. Biofilm formation was dependent on the exopolyside genes, as a mutant failed to form biofilms. The mutant was more virulent than PA1, while a hyperfilm strain demonstrated less virulence than PA1, indicated by fly survival at 14 postinfection. Biofilm formation by PA1 and in the crop was associated with induction of antimicrobial gene expression 24 postin.
Researchers studied the vasopressin 1 receptor 1 (Av1) gene, which plays a key role in social behaviors, and found that its expression varies between and within species. They looked at the 5' flanking region of the gene and a microsatellite element, a repetitive DNA sequence, to see if they contribute to this variation. Using mice, they found that the 5' flanking region contributes to differences in Av receptor distribution in the brain and impacts behavior in a stress test. They also found that the microsatellite structure affects Av expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring species differences in receptor patterns. This is the first evidence that microsatellites near genes can affect brain expression and contribute to behavior diversity. However, many species-specific patterns are not explained by the 5 flanking region alone. A 4kb of the 5 flanking region contributes to species-specific receptor patterns in the brain. Transgenic mice with the prairie vole Av1 locus show similar receptor patterns to prairie voles and increased affiliative behavior. This shows Av1 expression in the brain contributes to inter and intra-species variability in vasopress behaviors. The Av1 is a model for exploring genomic mechanisms of brain expression and behavior. The findings suggest that microsatellites can enhance evolvability by increasing gene expression.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) can cause double-strand breaks in the DNA at specific regions of the immunoglobulin genes and the c-MYC gene in yeast cells. These breaks can lead to chromosomal translocations, which are responsible for a type of cancer called Burkitt's lymphoma. The study used yeast cells that are impaired in a complex called TH, which is involved in making ribonucleic acid (RNA), to understand how ID causes instability in the genome. They found that ID induces breaks in the DNA at the immunoglobulin and c-M sequences in TH mutants, which are unable to make RNA. The breaks are then repaired by a process called Non-homous Joining (NHE). The study shows that yeast and human cells have similar ways to process ID-induced breaks into double-strand breaks, which can lead to chromosomal rearrangements. The research provides new insights into the role of RNA in preventing genome rearrangements and the mechanism of ID-mediated instability. It also shows that once cytosine residues produced by ID are processed into double-strand breaks and chromosomal rearrangements by conserved DNA repair functions in yeast and human cells.
Researchers studied how the bacteria E. coli divides its cells when the division plane is not properly aligned with its chromosomes. They used a microscope to track the movement of DNA during cell division and found that a protein called Fts can move up to 80% of the chromosome from one daughter cell to the other at a rate of 1700-800 base pairs per second. This movement happens when the cell is almost fully divided and the division protein ZipA has left the septum. The sept is a narrow channel with a diameter smaller than 250 nanometers, which is necessary for Fts to move the DNA. The study shows that E. coli can reposition its chromosomes even if the division plane is not aligned. This is different from the common view that the division plane must be aligned with the chromosomes for the cell to be viable. The researchers also found that F can move more DNA than previously thought, up to 3.7 megabases, which is the entire chromosome. The movement happens when the sept is small and F can bind to DNA. The study suggests that the sept acts as a checkpoint to prevent the daughters from separating too early.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework for selecting the optimal set of peptides for epitope-based vaccines, which are used to prevent or treat various diseases, including infectious and cancer. The framework, based on integer linear programming, identifies the best combination of peptides from a given set that will elicit the strongest immune response. This is important because each person's major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are unique, making a combination effective for one person may not work for another. The framework can incorporate various requirements for a good vaccine, such as covering multiple antigens and avoiding peptides with high mutation rates. It outperforms previous methods and can solve problems in seconds. The approach is flexible and can be applied to personalized vaccines. The goal is to maximize overall immunogenicity while meeting requirements, such as covering all MHC alleles. This is the first framework to find provably optimal solutions for vaccine design. Examples show how immunological requirements can be translated into the framework, yielding optimal sets of peptides. The approach does not suggest a single strategy, but a framework to work with different definitions of a good vaccine. The goal is to maximize immunogenicity while meeting requirements, which can be formulated as an integer program.
Interleukin-7 Facilitates HIV-1 Transmission to Cervico-Vag Tissue

A new study investigated the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in HIV-1 transmission to the cervico-vaginal tissue. IL-7 is a cytokine found in semen, and its levels are higher in HIV-1-infected men. Researchers simulated HIV-1 transmission by depositing the virus on cerv-vaginal tissue with IL-7 concentrations similar to those in HIV-1-infected men. They found that IL-7 increased HIV-1 replication in the tissue and in lymphoid explants. Analysis of infected cells showed IL-7 reduced CD4 T cell apoptosis and increased the number of cycling CD4 cells. High IL-7 levels in semen may help HIV-1 survive and spread in the cervag mucosa at the start of infection.

The study is the first to look at IL-7's role in male-to-female HIV transmission. Results show that cervag and lymph tissues exposed to IL-7 at semen levels found in HIV-1-infected men are more susceptible to HIV-1. IL-7 increased HIV-1 in tissues from different donors and even when HIV-1 was low. In lymph tissues, IL-7 increased HIV-infected CD4 cells. The study suggests high IL-7 in semen may make the female genital tract more susceptible to HIV.
Researchers studied how the Zika virus (ZIK) interacts with the RNA response system of Aedes aegypt mosquitoes, which spread the virus. They found that ZIK triggers the production of two types of small RNAs: virus-specific siRNAs and piRNAs. The siRNAs are loaded into a protein called Argonaute 2 (Ago2), but knocking down this protein did not stop the virus from replicating. However, in cells without Ago2, the virus replicated more, suggesting the siRNA pathway helps fight the virus. ZIK-specific piRNAs were detected, but lacked a specific signature and bound to Ago3, not Piwi or Pi6. Silencing these proteins did not enhance virus replication, but Pi4 showed antiv activity. The study also found that ZIK capsid protein increased replication of a different virus, unlike yellow fever protein which blocks siRNA.
In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a study found that Sporothrix brasiliensis is associated with atypical presentations of sporotrichosis, a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix species. Researchers analyzed 50 patients with different clinical manifestations of sporrichosis and found that Sporrix brasili was linked to disseminated cutaneous infection, mucosal infection, and hypersensitivity reactions, while Sporrix schenii was associated with more localized and severe disease. Patients with Sporrix brasili required shorter treatment with itraconazole, 16 weeks, compared to 24 weeks for Sporrix schii. This study is the first to demonstrate genotypic identification of Sporrix species and clinical aspects of sporrichosis. Sporrix species are linked to different manifestations of sporrichosis, and Spor brasili is effectively treated with itraconazole. The majority of isolates were Spor schii, but this study adds to knowledge on Sporili disease and supports careful speciation of Sporrix isolates for clinical care. Sporili has been found in other Brazilian states, but is less common than Sporii. Sporili caused typical forms of sporrich, but also disseminated in one case. Spor presentations of sporrich by Sporrix are variable and poorly understood.
Recent studies have suggested that a significant portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed beyond annotated genes, but the nature and quantity of these transcripts were unclear. Researchers used single-end and paired RNA-Seq and tiling to assess the quantity and composition of transcripts in Poly+ RNA from human and mouse tissues. They found that RNASeq identified many transcribed regions outside known exons and non-coding RNAs, mostly introns, suggesting they are fragments of pre-mRNAs. Chromosomal locations of intergenic regions in RNASeq data near genes consistent with alternative splicing and polyadenylation, promoter and terminator transcripts or new exons. Reads bridging splice sites identified 5,544 new exons, 3,554 genes. Remaining seqags correspond to single reads with characteristics of random sampling low background or small transcripts (median 111 bp) present higher, displaying conservation and originating from open chromatin. The study concludes that while there are new intergenic transcripts, their number is low compared to known exons and genome not as pervasively transcribed as reported.
Scientists have developed a new method to make proteins more stable and useful for use in extreme environments. They used a combination of computer and lab work to improve the stability of a protein called Bacillus subtilis YLO domain by 31 degrees Celsius. This allows it to be used in systems that are very hot or very cold. The method involves five steps: finding stable mutants, testing them, redesigning the stable parts, testing again, and combining mutations. This method is simple and can be used for other proteins that are hard to make stable with other methods. It provides a new tool to make proteins more stable.

A previous study changed a protein to make it 10 times brighter, but it was not very stable. A more stable version is needed for studying microorganisms that live in extreme conditions. The new method worked 62% of the time, showing its effectiveness. The most stable sites are at the protein's surface, suggesting stronger connections between parts make it more stable. One mutant was 54.2 degrees stable, the highest. Stable proteins are important for many uses. There are three ways to make proteins stable: evolution, consensus, and design. Each has strengths and weaknesses and has made proteins more stable before.
Researchers studied the diversity of sand flies in the Lutzia genus on Barro Island in Panama, a region where cutaneous leishmanias is a health threat to residents and tourists. They found two "cryptic" species, Lu. sp. vespilion and Lu. gzi, and detected Leish DNA in 43.3% of Lu. trapi and 26.3% of Lu. gzi individuals. The Leish infecting Lu. trapi and. gzi had a 93% similarity to Leish viannia naiff, a species previously unknown in Panama but known to cause cutaneous leish in northern and central America. Distinct Wolia strains were found in three sand species, including Lu. trapi, which frequently co-occurred with Leish. Two species, Lu. trap and Lu. gzi, carried Leish at high frequency and are likely vectors of leish to humans or mammals. A single Leish species, Le naiff, was identified in both, known to cause cutaneous in America but not reported in Panama, suggesting its range may have expanded or introduced. The occurrence of Leish and Wolia in Lu. trap identifies it as a target for Wolia population control.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation in dendritic cells (DCs) can have devastating clinical consequences, making it crucial to understand what triggers HCV reactivation. Researchers found that the mitogen-activated kinase (MS) family plays a key role in HCV reactivation, specifically through its interaction with the transcription factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein). CREB binds to the major early promoter (MP) of HCV, allowing MS to be recruited, which then phosphorylates histone H3. This leads to histone demethylation and HCV exit from latency. The study suggests that CREB's role in HCV reactivation is not only as a transcription factor but also in promoting chromatin modifications for viral gene expression. Inhibiting the interaction between CRE and MS could be a therapeutic strategy. In vitro studies showed that chromatin bound to the c-fos promoter is resistant to MS-mediated phosphorylation, but CREB binding promotes histone phosphorylation, similar to HCV latency and reactivation. Adenovirus vectors were used to study the ER-MS relationship with CRE-histone H phosphorylation and IE expression from latency. MS binding to MP before reactivation supports this. IE expression in DCs is sensitive to MS inhibition and HCV reactivation involves histone phosphorylation at latent MP. MS phosphorylation is dependent on concurrent CRE binding to MP.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for a protein called N11 in the development of the face and skull in frogs and other vertebrates. N11 is involved in the production of ribosomes, which are essential for all living cells. Defects in ribosome production lead to a group of disorders called ribosomies. The team found that N11 is highly expressed in the cells that form the face and skull in both frogs and mammals. They knocked out N11 in frogs and saw impaired ribosome production, increased cell death, and abnormal skull development. Inhibiting a protein p53, which helps remove damaged cells, rescued the skull defect but not the ribosome issue. This shows a conserved mechanism between ribosome and cell survival. The study reveals a new role for N11 in face development and provides insight into the link between ribosome production and cell survival.
Researchers have developed a new tool to help diagnose leptospi, a zoonotic disease that affects humans and animals worldwide. Leptpi is hard to diagnose, especially in early stages when treatment is most effective. They created a protein chip with 61% of the Leptira proteome and tested IgG from 274 individuals, including those with acute, convalescent, and healthy subjects from areas with high and no transmission. The test found 16 antigens that distinguish acute cases from healthy individuals in high transmission areas and 18 that convalescent cases. Some antigens are already known to be recognized by human sera, while others are new, like LIC15, which showed good sensitivity and specificity for acute and convales patients. This study is the first large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with leptiral infection and known seragnostic leptiral antigens. The new antigens may help develop new tests and improve current ones for diagnosing this neglected disease. Further research is needed to assess their utility in deployable platforms.
Researchers studied the immune response of mosquitoes to a fungus called Beauveria bassiana, which infects and kills mosquitoes. They used the malaria-carrying mosquito Anopheles gambia as a model to investigate the role of melanization, a potent immune mechanism in arthropods, in defense against this fungus. They found that melan formed on all stages of the fungus, including conidia, tubes, and hyphae, but rarely stopped its growth. Silencing key regulators of melanization, TEP and CL8, abolished melan on hypha but not germinating conidia or tubes. A layer of hemocytes surrounded germinating conidia but not hypha, suggesting melan of early stages is cell-mediated and late is humoral dependent on T and CL8. Microscopic analysis showed association of T with hypha surfaces and requirement of both T and CL8 for recruiting phenolase to these. Fungal growth was rapid in T and CL8 knockdown mosquitoes with increased sensitivity to B infections. The study found melan response significantly retards B growth and dissemination, a finding that may be used to design fungi with more potent control against mosquitoes.
Researchers have found a new way to stop the spread of dengue virus by blocking the mosquito's ability to carry it. They tested four chemicals that are known to stop the virus in mammals and found that two of them, bafilomycin (BAF) and myopholic acid (M), can also stop the virus in the mosquito. Injecting these chemicals into the mosquito before feeding on infected blood reduced the virus by 56-60% in the mosquito's gut and 90-83% in the salivary gland. Giving the mosquito a meal with the chemicals and infected blood also reduced the virus. Silencing the genes that the chemicals target in the mosquito also reduced the virus. The timing of when the chemicals are given is important, as giving them after the mosquito is infected does not work. This study shows that blocking the mosquito's ability to carry the virus can stop the spread of deng.
Scientists have long known that changes in cell volume play a crucial role in both normal and abnormal brain activity. However, the exact impact of cell volume on neuronal dynamics is not well understood. A recent study investigated the effects of cell volume on neuronal behavior by combining cell swelling with ion and oxygen levels in a mathematical model of brain activity. The research found that as cells swell and contract in response to changes in pressure, they can transition between seizure and spreading states. The study also revealed a threshold that separates seizure from spreading and another state, and a second threshold that distinguishes spreading from anoxic depolarization. The findings highlight the protective role of glial cells against seizures and spreading, and provide new insights into anoxic depolar and cell swelling during ischemia. The research suggests that seizures, spreading, and anoxic depolar are part of a continuum of neuronal behavior that can only be understood when considering ion, oxygen, and swelling in response to pressure. The study demonstrates a framework for a range of behaviors that may be important in understanding and treating these conditions.
Researchers studied how the body's immune system responds to a type of fungus called Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which causes a disease called paracidiomycosis in Latin America. They found that a protein complex called NLR3 inflamome is activated when the fungus infects cells, leading to the release of a cytokine called IL-1. This IL-1 is important for fighting off infections, but its role in fighting a primary pathogen like P. brasili is not well understood. The study showed that mouse cells called dendritic cells release IL-1 when infected with P. brasili, and that this is dependent on a protein called Syk, caspase-1, and NLR3. The activation of N3 inflamome also depends on potassium, reactive oxygen, acid, and cathepsin release. Without IL-1 receptor, mice showed that IL-1 plays a role in killing P. bras by macrophages. The study suggests that N3 inflome senses and responds to P. bras and plays a role in defense against the fungus.
Toxoplas gondii, a brain-tropic parasite, primarily infects neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) rather than astrocytes, despite being able to infect both cell types in vitro. Researchers used a novel Tooplas-mouse model to track host cells interacting with parasites, finding Tooplas shows a strong preference for neurons throughout infection. This preference remains even when interferon-gamma is depleted, which normally helps astrocytes clear parasites, and when parasites are injected directly into the brain. Studies suggest neurons are not incidentally infected, but Tooplas's primary target in vivo. Tooplas invades both astrocytes and neurons in vitro, but in vivo, it predominantly interacts with neurons, which may be due to neurons' inability to clear intracellular parasites. A study using Tooplas strains that inject Cre recombinase into host cells found neurons make up the majority of GFP+ parenchymal CNS cells, contradicting the "astrocyte-killing" model of CNS-Tooplas interactions. Understanding host-pathogen dynamics can lead to therapies for currently incurable pathogens. Tooplas chronically infects CNS of up to 1/3 of the world's population.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to explain how cells move and change shape, specifically those that use a type of movement called lamellipodial motility. This movement involves the interaction between actin, a protein that makes up the cell's skeleton, and myosin, a protein that makes the cell contract and move. The model shows that the cell's movement depends on three key factors: how strong myosin is, how sticky the actin is, and how fast the cell grows. When myin is strong enough, the cell breaks its symmetry and moves in a straight or curved path. The model also shows that the cell's movement is sensitive to its boundary conditions. The researchers tested the model and found that it agrees with real cell behavior, where myin concentrates at the back of the cell and causes it to turn. They also found that the cell's shape can be stable or unstable depending on how fast it moves and how sticky the actin is. This study helps understand how cells move and change shape, which is important for many biological processes like development and disease.
Researchers have developed a new method to assess the reliability of protein-protein interactions (PPI) networks, which are complex networks of proteins that interact with each other in living cells. These interactions are crucial for many biological processes, but detecting them is challenging due to high levels of noise and incompleteness in experimental data. For example, yeast-2-hybrid (YH) screens have a false positive rate of up to 64% and false negative rate of 43-71%, while tandem purification (T) experiments have comparable levels of noise. The new technique uses geometric graphs, a fitting model for P networks, to predict interactions and guide future experiments. It achieves 85% specificity and 90 sensitivity. The method was applied to the human P network from BioGRID, predicting 251 interactions, many of which correspond to proteins with shared functions. Predictions were validated in HPRD and BioGRID databases. The code is available online.
Researchers have created a fruit fly model to study myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM), a disease caused by a DNA expansion of non-coding CT repeats. They tested if the role of interactions between expanded CTG and CAG transcripts. The study found that co-expressing CT and CAG repeats led to enhanced toxicity. This was due to the generation of 21-nt repeat-derived siRNAs that targeted genes with CAG repeats, such as Ataxin-2 and T binding protein (TBP). These findings suggest that repeat-derived siRNAs may enhance toxicity in diseases with anti-sense transcription.

 Studies showed that noncoding CT repeats confer length-dependent toxicity in brain and muscle of flies. Expanded CTG transcripts accumulated in nuclei and affected splicing, similar to human DM. To understand CUG toxicity, researchers created flies with pure CT repeats in a protein's 3'UTR. These recapitulated human features of C RNA expansion. Given that 70% of genes have antiense transcription, they tested co-expressing CT and CAG. This resulted in enhanced toxicity and generation of repeat-derived siRNAs.

Trinucle expansions in noncoding RNA cause several diseases, including DM, fragile X, spinocerebellar ataxia, and Huntington's disease. DM, FAS, S8, and HD2 are caused by CTG expansions. Since antiense occurs widely in the genome, understanding its role may reveal disease mechanisms. Fruit flies have been used to study neurological diseases relevant to humans.
Soft rot is a devastating disease that affects plants worldwide, causing significant economic losses. Researchers studied the soft rot pathogen Pectobacter sp. SCC3, isolated from a diseased potato in Finland in the 1980s. They found that SCC3, previously classified as Pectacter carovorum, is actually Pobacter wasiae. This changes the understanding of the phylogeny of P carov and wasiae, which has been present in potato fields unnoticed. The team used genomics and experiments to identify features that separate SCC3 and other P wasiae from other soft bacteria, such as the absence of a type III secretion system. They found virulence determinants, including a transcription regulator, two type VI secretion systems, and horizontally acquired clusters Vic1 and Vic2, containing vir genes. The genome also revealed traits related to life in planta or specific conditions, such as a benzoic acid carboxyltransferase of eukary origin. These findings indicate soft bacteria have a reservoir of unknown traits used in the latent stage in planta. The study provides a basis for further investigation of virulence and phylog of soft bacteria and other pathogens.
Researchers have discovered that when mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, change their protein composition in response to dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction is linked to various human diseases, including aging and cell death. To understand this, scientists analyzed protein data from cells with and without mitochondria. They found two main groups of proteins: those that decrease and those that increase. Decreased proteins are involved in basic functions like energy production and protein folding, while increased proteins help with DNA repair and protein transport. This suggests cells try to compensate for missing DNA by adjusting protein expression and transport. The study provides a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial problems.
Researchers have developed a new method to calculate the rates of complex biological processes that occur inside living cells, called in vivo, from rates measured in a lab dish, in vitro. This method has two main parts. First, they introduced a concept called kinetic distance, a way to compare the speed of processes in different environments. The distance depends on the rates and can be understood in terms of energy barriers. Second, they minimize the distance between in vitro and in vivo processes, ensuring the calculated rates match a known property like overall speed in vivo. To test the method, they applied it to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression. They described the process by a model with three paths for tRNA binding and determined rates in vitro. Then, they predicted in vivo rates by minimizing and validated with three sets of in vivo data on translation speed, dynamics, and error. Results showed good agreement without adjusting parameters. Calculated in vivo rates were more accurate than in vitro, mainly due to improved tRNA selection. The method is simple and can be applied to any biological process with in vitro kinetics.
Researchers studied the evolution of Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacteria that infects humans, by analyzing DNA sequences from 97 isolates, including 34 pairs of samples taken from the same individuals over time periods of 0.25 to 10.2 years and 29 isolates from 10 families. They found that genetic diversity increased over time in a predictable way, like a clock, and estimated short-term mutation and recombination rates. The short-term mutation rate was 1.4×10^-6 to 4.5×10^-6 per nucleotide per year, with recombination introducing three times as many substitutions as mutation. Long-term rate over millennia was 5-17 times lower due to removal of non-synonymous mutations by purifying selection. This is different from previous estimates of 1.4×^-9 per year for Escherichia coli and Salmonella, which was based on universal clock for bacterial RNA sequences. The study's short-term rate is similar to other bacteria, but varies greatly between species.
Researchers have found that melanopsin, a pigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, plays a significant role in visual perception beyond driving reflex responses such as circadian rhythms and pupil movements. They investigated its contribution to the thalamocortical visual pathway, which is responsible for visual perception. Using reporter lines, they found melanin projections extend to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the origin of thalamortical neurons, and support physiological responses in the GN and visual cortex in mice lacking rods and cones. Chromatic stimuli isolated melanin responses in mice with intact visual systems revealed strong melanin input to 40% of LGN neurons showing sustained activation to light. Melanin input increases firing rate of these neurons. Melan knockout mice showed melanin is required for accurate irradiance encoding. The study establishes melanin-based photoreception as a significant source of sensory input to the thalamortical system, providing irradiance information even in the absence of rods and cones. This identifies melanin as a potential origin of visual perception and may support vision in retinal degeneration.
HIV-1 infection leads to a significant depletion of mucosal CD4 T cells, which play a crucial role in regulating the immune response to antigens at mucosal surfaces. Researchers investigated whether this depletion affects humoral responses to antigens at mucosal surfaces in HIV-1-infected individuals. They found reduced IgG responses to Proteobacteria and Firmutes but not Bacteroid antigens in intestinal secretions. Importantly, antiretroviral therapy-treated HIV-1-infected individuals showed elevated IgM and decreased IgA/Ig and IgG/Ig ratios to various microbial and food antigens. This indicates reduced mucosal B cells' ability to switch from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their response to gut antigens. Decreased IgA and IgG to microbiota may contribute to microbial translocation across the mucosal barrier, driving chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals. The study found four key points: elevated IgM and antigen-specific in intestinal secretions, reduced Ig/Ig and Ig/Ig ratios to microbial and food antigens, reduced Ig to Proteobacteria and Firmutes in plasma, and a negative correlation between Ig and CD4 T cell counts. Altered mucosal humoral responses in HIV-1-infected may be due to depleted or altered CD4 T and T cells. The study shows low interdependence of Ig responses between intestinal and systemic compartments. ART-treated HIV-1 individuals had increased IgM and decreased Ig/Ig and Ig/Ig to mucosal antigens, indicating lack of help for class recombination. Altered isotype response may promote inflammation and mucosal damage. HIV-1 individuals with low CD4 counts had reduced Ig to Proteob and Firmutes.
Researchers have developed a new model to study how populations of species in ecosystems change over time. In traditional models, populations grow and shrink due to births and deaths of individuals. This new model adds a new mechanism: when one population crashes, it frees up resources for others. This can happen in communities like bacteria, where one strain is wiped out by a virus, or in ecosystems where diseases play a big role. The new model shows that populations go through "diversity waves" triggered by crashes of dominant species. Diversity peaks at the start of each wave, then decreases. Species have a bimodal time-aggregated distribution, with lower peaks of recently collapsed or new species and upper ones that haven't crashed yet. Most waves have multiple peaks. This self-organized structure has long-term memory across waves, leading to a scale-free population distribution with an exponent of 1.7. The model is robust to variations in rules like diffusion, growth rates, and extinction. Simulations of the model show the same patterns: diversity waves and scale-free distribution for most species.
Scientists have long studied how bacteria like Escherichia coli navigate their environment by following chemical gradients, a process called chemotaxis. This ability gives them a competitive advantage and helps them evolve quickly. They do this by comparing chemical concentrations along their path, a strategy efficient for their size and speed. Concentration differences are detected by a system and sent to flagellar motors, decreasing the chance of tumbling and reorientation if the change is positive. This regulation of tumbling is enough to explain chemot drift up the gradient and was thought to be the only mechanism. Researchers used computer simulations to predict an additional navigation mechanism in E coli. They found that not only tumbling probability but also the degree of reorientation during tumbling depends on swimming direction along the gradient. Although the difference is small, it enhances cellular velocity along the gradient. This is a new level of optimization in coli chemaxis, arising from flagellar switching and fine-tuning tumbling. A similar strategy is likely used by other peritously flagellated bacteria, showing another level of bacterial chemaxis development.
Researchers have found that a signaling pathway called Stat3 plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTE). These cells are essential for establishing tolerance by presenting self-peptides to autoreactive thymocytes and diverting them into regulatory T cells. The Stat3 pathway is activated in TE precursors and is necessary for their maturation and proliferation, leading to proper medull region formation. The study shows that Stat3 signaling promotes TE survival, not proliferation, and is vital for medull region and TE homeostasis. Expressing a constitutively active Stat3 gene in TE compartment increases TE cellularity, bypassing signals from positively selected thymocytes for medull formation. Conversely, deleting Stat disrupts medull architecture and reduces TE cells. Stat does not affect TE proliferation, but promotes immature MHCloCDlo TE precursors. In contrast, altering TE compartment, neither expressing nor deleting Stat affects TE cellularity or organization.
Researchers have identified 511 small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) in the bacterium Clostridium difficile, a common cause of hospital-acquired diarrhea. They used a computer-based approach to find these RNAs in both coding and non-coding regions of the genome. To confirm their findings, they used a technique called RNA-seq and 5-end RNA-seq to identify RNs and their start sites at different growth stages. This approach found 251 putative RNs, including 94 regulators in non-coding regions, 91 antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. Expression of 35 RNs was confirmed by specific experiments. Some RNs, including antisense that may control Clostrid autolytic activity, showed growth-dependent profiles. 16 ribwitches that respond to a molecule called c-GMP were found and shown to control motility and biofilm formation. RNs from multiple Clostr CRIS loci were also detected, which may help Clostr survive in gut communities. This study provides a basis for future research on RN regulation in Clostrid difficile.
Researchers have discovered that the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein plays a key role in reducing the levels of a specific microRNA called mi-122 in the liver. mi-122 is important for liver development and metabolism, and also helps the virus to replicate. The study found that the HCV core protein destabilizes mi-122 by inhibiting a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly (A) polymer called GL-2. This leads to a decrease in mi-122 levels and disrupts its functions, including its role in helping the virus. Analysis of small RNAs from liver biops showed that mi-122 is modified at its 3 end with non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. The proportion of mi-122 with a single nucleotide tail decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. These single-nucle-tailed mi-122 isomers have increased stability and activity compared to the 22-nt prototype mi-122. The H core protein specifically inhibits GL-2, and its interaction with GL-2 in the cytoplasm is responsible for mi- downregulation. The study also found that HCV affects multiple miRNAs, including mi-122, by decreasing the proportion of mono-adenylated isomers.
Researchers have found that African lions in the Serengeti ecosystem develop immunity to Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite that causes disease in humans and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa. This is the first evidence of acquired immunity to trypanosomiasis in any species. The immunity is likely due to exposure to other trypan species, such as Trypanosoma congolense, which causes sleeping sickness in humans, and Trypanosoma brucei, a non-pathogenic subspecies. Lions are co-infected with multiple trypan species, including Trypanosoma congense, Trypanosoma bruce, and Trypanosoma rhodesense. Trypan parasites change their surface proteins every 3-5 days to avoid immune recognition. The study found that lions clear Tryosoma bruce infections by 3-5 years old and Tryosoma rhense by 6 years old. Frequent exposure to trypan bites accelerates immunity, making prevalence lower in areas with high tset exposure. This challenges the idea that immunity is impossible, making vaccines impractical.
Researchers used a mathematical model to study the blood clotting process, or coagulation, to identify potential weak points that could be targeted for treatment. They tested the model on a well-studied coagulation cascade and compared the results to real-world data. The model, made up of 92 proteins and 148 interactions, was validated using data from two different in vitro coagulation models. It accurately simulated platelet activation and thrombin generation in the presence and absence of anticoagulants, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across trials. Sensitivity coefficients, which measure fragility, were calculated using a Monte Carlo strategy. In the absence of anticoulants, factor Xa and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were fragile, while IXa and V activation were robust. Anti-Xa and thrombin inhibitors are anticoagulant classes, used to prevent venous thromboembism and treat deep venous thromosis. In vitro and vivo evidence supports IXa robustness. Results support computationally derived fragility as a basis for target selection despite uncertainty.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how bacteriophages, or viruses that infect bacteria, interact with their hosts. This is important for phage therapy, which uses bacteriophages as a treatment for bacterial infections. They tested the model on Campylobacterium jejuni, a foodborne pathogen, and a bacteriophage that infects it. The model showed that even a simple model can fit the data well and that certain thresholds, like "inundation" and proliferation, are crucial for phage therapy. The model was used to estimate these thresholds and rate constants from data. The study found features of phage infectivity that depend on bacterial density, which needs further investigation. This research combines experimental and theoretical approaches to understand phage-bacteria interactions. It's a step towards understanding phage therapy in the body.
Schistosomias, a disease caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistoma, affects over 260 million people worldwide, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. The snail Biomphalaria glabra is an intermediate host for Schistoma mansoni, the causative agent of intestinal schosias in Africa and South America. A unique host-parasite relationship presents an opportunity to study conserved immunological features and new adaptations. The sn immune response is important for protecting against schist infection, but few snail factors have been identified and functionally characterized. This study reports a sn Toll-like receptor, TLR, playing a role in snail immune response to Schistoma mansoni. TLR was identified in a screen of snail surface proteins differing between snail phenotypes. The resistant snails displayed higher TLR levels than susceptible ones. Transcript of TLR increased 27 fold in resistant snails, but not in susceptible ones. Knocking down TLR in resistant snails via siRNA resulted in 43% patent infections, similar to susceptible ones. This is the first characterization of a gastrop TLR and shows TLR is a sn receptor influencing infection outcome.
Scientists have developed a new tool to measure how often people are bitten by mosquitoes that spread diseases in the Pacific Islands of French Polynes. These mosquitoes, called Aedes aegypt and Aedes polensis, transmit diseases like dengue chikung, Zika, and Bancroftian filari. The researchers created an ELISA test to detect antibodies in people's blood against the saliva of these mosquitoes. They tested the test on people in Tahiti and Moore islands where the mosquitoes are present and found that 98% and 68% of individuals had antibodies against Aedes aegpt and Aedes polensis respectively. In contrast, people from metropolitan France, not exposed to these mosquitoes, had no antibodies. The test showed no cross-reactivity between the two mosquito species' saliva. This means the test is a valid biomarker for exposure to bites of Aedes aeg and Aedes polensis. This tool will help understand where disease transmission is high and evaluate control strategies in the Pacific and other tropical areas.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, has a unique ability to survive inside human cells called macrophages. To understand how it does this, researchers looked at how the bacteria affects the cell's metabolism. They found that the bacteria changes the cell's metabolic pathways to help it survive and grow. This is a key to its ability to cause disease. The study also found that the bacteria targets specific pathways that help the cell survive, but also help the bacteria grow. This is a balance between the host and pathogen that determines the severity of the disease. The bacteria's ability to adapt to the cell's metabolism is linked to its virulence, or ability to cause disease. The study used different strains of the bacteria with varying levels of virulence to confirm this. They also found that the cell's metabolism is affected in a time-dependent manner, meaning it changes over time. The researchers used a panel of bacteria with different traits to understand this process. They found that glucose levels in the blood, or glycemic status, affects the cell's ability to fight the bacteria. This is a new aspect of why diabetes is a risk factor for TB. The study suggests revisiting the understanding of TB's pathogenicity, or ability to cause disease, may be necessary. It highlights the importance of metabolic pathways in disease.
Scientists have studied a protein called ZHP-3 in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, which is involved in a process called crossover recombination during meiosis. This process ensures that homologous chromosomes separate properly during the first meiotic division. They found that Z-3 protein is dynamic and moves along the synaptonal complex (SC) at a key point in meiotic prophase, then localizes asymmetrically on the SC, and eventually to foci marking crossover events. A fusion of Z-3 with a green fluorescent protein partially complements a mutation, showing separation of function, but leads to high aneuploidy among progeny, indicating meiotic segregation defects. The bivalent structure is perturbed in this mutant, suggesting segregation defect from inability to remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers. Similar phenotypes are seen in smo-1 mutants at higher temperatures, and smo-; z- double mutants exhibit more meiotic defects than single, suggesting SUMO role in SC assembly and bivalent differentiation. The study proposes coordination of crossover with SC assembly and bivalent formation reflects conserved role of Zip/Z-3 in recombination with morphogenesis.
Aedes albopus, a tropical mosquito species, has spread to temperate regions of Europe and the US, causing health concerns due to its ability to transmit diseases and nuisance due to its daytime biting behavior. Researchers studied eco-climatic factors affecting Ae. albicuts abundance in metropolitan and suburban areas in Rome, Italy, which is one of the most infested areas in Southern Europe. They monitored adult mosquitoes along a 70km-long transect and analyzed the effect of climatic and environmental variables on Ae. abundance. Results showed a strong association between urban areas and high abundance, with "green islands" hotspots in metropolitan areas, and bimodal dynamics with a peak in autumn due to heavy rains and warm temperatures. High vegetation cover in a 300m radius was negatively associated with mosquito abundance. The study highlights the importance of prioritizing mosquito control in urban areas with high human-mosquito contact and arboirus transmission risk, and potential health risks after summer months with high densities.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) uses a group of lipids called phiocer dimocates (DIM) to help it invade host cells called macrophages. Macrophages are a type of immune cell that eat foreign particles and bacteria, but Mtb tricks them into taking it in instead. Researchers found that DIM helps Mtb enter macrophages by changing the way the lipids in the cell's outer layer, called the plasma membrane. This change makes it easier for Mtb to be taken in and also helps it survive inside the cell. The researchers used special drugs to remove cholesterol from the cell membrane and found that this reduced M's ability to enter and survive. They also found that DIM changes the way the membrane's fatty core, making it more fluid, which helps M enter the cell. This effect was specific to DIM and not just other parts of Mtb. The study suggests that DIM helps Mtb by changing the host cell's membrane, making it more welcoming to the bacteria.
Researchers have been using mean-field approximations to study large neural networks, but these methods don't work well for small networks of a few neurons. This is a problem because mean-field approximations don't capture the behavior of small networks, leading to differences between mean-field and real network behavior. Many neuroscience problems involve studying networks of tens of neurons, but methods to describe small networks are rare, hindering progress in understanding neural dynamics at these scales. A new analysis of small networks of homogeneous excitatory and inhibitory neurons is developed, studying local bifurcations with an analytically tractable approach and numerically determining global bifurcations. For strong inhibition, networks show complex dynamics due to multiple solutions emerging through spontaneous symmetry-breaking. This is a finite-size effect, revealing differences between mesoscopic circuits and mean-field approximations. Symmetry-breaking allows mesoscopic networks to regulate heterogeneity, reducing noise effects on information processing. 

In networks with strong inhibition, spontaneous symmetry leads to a bifurcation known as a pitchfork or branching, with multiple solutions emerging. New bifcations occur, enriching complexity. Analysis of small networks was pioneered by Beer, studying bifurcations with symmetric weights and asymptotic approximations. Most literature deals with 2-4 neurons, while methods for tens of neurons are limited. This work extends analysis to biologically plausible networks with exact bifcation manifolds and less constraints. A finite-size model with excitatory and inhibitory populations is considered. Mean-field provides an approximation, neglecting phenomena like transitions and correlations.
Researchers studied the presence of Leishmania parasites in extraional tissues of patients with dermalishiasis, a disease caused by Leishmania parasites. They used a specific RNA target, Leish 7SL, to detect and quantify parasites in blood, tonsils, skin, and skin lesions of 28 patients with cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishiasis. Results showed that Leish 7RNA was present in 100% of patients with DNA in extraional samples and 73% of patients had Leish 7RNA transcripts. Parasites were detected in 68% of monocytes, 42% tonsil swabs, 36% normal skin aspirates, and 88% lesions. The number of Leish 7RNA transcripts correlated with parasite viability in response to treatment, confirming its validity as a viability marker. Leish parasites were found in blood, tonsils, and normal skin of dermalias patients, indicating dissemination of infection without triggering pathogenesis. This study shows that Leish viability and parasite burden in extraional tissues can be established by Leish 7RNA amplification. Detection and quantification of parasites is crucial for infection status, treatment, and understanding natural history of human infection.
Researchers have found a way to predict when and where DNA replicates in fruit fly cells using a combination of chromatin features. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and proteins that makes up chromosomes. The team used data from 95 different proteins and modifications to build a model that can accurately predict when and where DNA replicates across the fly genome. They found that combinations of these proteins and their interactions are key to making accurate predictions, suggesting that they play a role in regulating DNA replication. The model can also predict replication timing in different cell types of fly cells. This study supports the idea that combinations of chromatin features contribute to DNA replication and identifies key elements that can be studied to understand how this process works.
Dengue virus, a mosquito-borne disease, affects 390 million people worldwide and causes at least 25,000 deaths annually, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. Researchers studied the spread of three deng virus serotypes (DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3) in Brazil using genetic data. They found that new lineages of the virus were introduced every 7-10 years and likely came from the Caribbean to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, then spread at a rate of 0.5 km/day. The study suggests that human and mosquito transportation, not mosquito infestation or distance, determines the spread of the virus in Brazil. 

The researchers analyzed 178 Brazilian genome sequences and found that air travel was 5 times faster than other factors in spreading the virus. They used a model to predict the spread of the virus, including distances, air traffic, mosquito infestation, population, and area. The study supports the role of human and mosquito transportation in the spread of the virus. The investigation shows distinct introductions and circulation of serotypes and genotypes, and the impact of air traffic in the spread of the virus in Brazil. New lineages are introduced followed by outbreaks every 7-10 years. The results agree with epidemiological data, showing peaks in incidence coincide with new line introductions every 7-10 years. However, caution is needed when predicting emergence, as new line from outside the Americas can be introduced by chance.
Scientists have been trying to figure out how the brain processes sensory information to create perception and behavior, known as the neural code, for a long time. They've found that neurons don't work alone, but are connected and correlated with each other, which affects how they code information. Researchers studied how differences in the center-surround receptive field (RF) organization across three sensory maps in weak electric fish influence correlations between electrosens pyram neurons. Using a model based on anatomical differences in RF size and overlap, they predicted large differences in correlated activity across maps. However, in vivo recordings showed the opposite, electens pyram neurons in all three segments had nearly identical correlations. To explain, they included RF effects in the model. By varying RF size and gain, they found multiple structures gave similar correlations. Incorporating physiological differences between maps in the model gave similar correlations. The study shows RF alone doesn't determine correlations, important for understanding how structure affects activity.
Researchers investigated how noise in the responses of neurons affects the ability to encode a stimulus in a population of neurons. They considered a general setting where the tuning curves and heterogeneity of the neurons were not specified, and varied the level of noise to see how it impacted performance. The results showed that if the noise between pairs of neurons had opposite signs to their signal correlations, coding improved compared to independent responses. This "sign rule" (SR) held for different metrics and levels of heterogeneity. However, it was not a necessary condition for good coding, as diverse correlation structures that violated it could also improve performance. The optimal structures were found to lie on the boundaries of possible correlations. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions was provided for performance to be as good as without noise. An example illustrated two regimes with different properties of noise leading to optimal coding. The SR was established for homogenous correlations, but held for heterogenous populations as well. Conditions for chosen noise to yield performance as good as deterministic responses were identified, satisfied with high probability for large populations.
Researchers studied how the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa affects the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to antibiotics. They found that Pseudas aerugin can make S aureus more or less susceptible to antibiotics, depending on the strain of Pseudasugin used. The team identified three factors that contribute to this effect: Las endopeptase, rhamolids, and 2-hepty-4-hydroquinoline Noxide (HQ). Lasopeptase breaks down S aure's cell wall, making it more vulnerable to vancomycin. Rhamids help vancom enter S's cells, increasing its effectiveness. HQ inhibits S's respiration, making it more resistant to multiple antibiotics. These factors vary between Pseudugin isolates, affecting how much they alter S's susceptibility. The study also showed that vancom treatment of S aure in mice was more effective when Pseudas was present. The findings suggest that antibiotic effectiveness depends not only on the targeted pathogen, but also on interactions with other microorganisms in the environment. Considering these interactions can improve treatment of polymicrobial infections.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism of platelet clearance that contributes to thrombocytopenia, a condition characterized by low platelet count, in patients with deng virus (DENV) infection. Thrombocytopenia can lead to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. The study found that patients with deng had higher levels of von Wille factor (VWF), a protein involved in blood clotting, and platelets bound more VWF to their surface. The amount of VWF on platelets correlated with plate count. Additionally, sialic acid on platelets was reduced in deng patients. Sialic is a molecule that helps platelets stick to blood vessel walls. The virus does not have an enzyme that breaks down sial, but researchers found no enzyme activity in deng patients' plasma. The study suggests that VWF binding to platelets leads to removal of sial through an enzyme on the plate surface. An inhibitor of this enzyme, oseltivir, may treat thrombocytopenia in deng.
Researchers have identified a new type of gene regulation in the human genome called bidirectional promoters. These are pairs of genes that face each other and are controlled by a shared regulatory region called a bidirectional promoter. This region is often found near genes involved in DNA repair and may play a role in cancer development. The study used a large database of expressed genes to find all bidirectional promoters in the human genome and found many function as alternative promoters or new transcripts. They also found a strong link between bidirectional promoters and cancer genes, including breast and ovarian cancer. The researchers used microarray data from 79 human tissues to verify regulation among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters. Some promoters have similar binding sites for transcription factors, including ER2, FCD, and BRCA. The study suggests that misregulation of bidirectional promoters, especially those with common sites, may contribute to cancer. Data confirmed expression pairs of flanking transcripts for 91%, 58%, and 65% of promoters in known genes, EST, and datasets. The enrichment of bidirectional with DNA repair genes implies a link to cancer pathways. The study found association between bidirectional and somatic cancer, indicating type relevant. They examined bid promoters with genes in uter and ovarian cancers. Expression-clustering showed bid promoters not a single network or thousands of pairs, but intermediate relationships between.
Scientists have studied the sex chromosomes of flies, including fruit flies and mosquitoes, and found that they are more diverse than previously thought. Most flies, like fruit flies, have XY sex chromosomes, but some have different arrangements of these chromosomes. Researchers analyzed the genomes of 37 fly species from 22 families and found over a dozen different sex chromosome arrangements. The small chromosome, called the dot, is used as the sex chromosome in many flies and is thought to be the original form of sex chromosomes in flies. However, some flies have undifferentiated sex chromosomes, others replaced the dot with a different chromosome, or combined multiple elements into sex chromosomes, and some have two different sex chromosomes like humans. Gene expression analysis shows that males have more genes than females, possibly due to selective pressures. This study provides a resource to understand sex biology and shows that similar forces shaped sex chromosomes in different fly species.
Researchers in Hawaii tested blood samples from mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and those who gave birth to healthy babies between 2009 and 2012. They looked for the presence of Zika virus (ZIK) IgM and IgG antibodies in the mothers' blood using a commercial test kit. The study found that 16.6% of mothers who gave birth to babies with microaly tested positive for ZIK IgM antibody and 50% tested positive for ZIK IgG antibody. Mothers with ZIK IgG antibodies were more likely to give birth to babies with microaly than those without ZIKG antibodies. Similarly, mothers with ZIKM antibodies were also more likely to give birth to babies with microaly than those without ZM antibodies. These results suggest a link between ZIK infection and microaly and show that ZIK cases may have been present in the US as early as 2009.
Researchers studied Mycobacterium ulcer (MU) infections in the Ashanti region of Ghana, where the disease Buruli ulcer (BU) is common. They wanted to find out how the bacteria are spread and where they come from. They used a genetic tool called Variable Number Tand Repeat (VN) typing to match bacteria from humans to the environment. They collected water samples from 10 bodies in 4 communities where BU is common and compared them to bacteria from 14 patients in the same area. They found MU in 3 types of water, but more in biofilm. 4 genotypes, W, X, Y, and Z, were in both humans and water. Other genotypes only in water. They also found a mouse with a BU-like lesion infected with MU. This suggests people may get infected from water they use. Small animals in the area may also get infected. The study shows MU can spread through contact with the environment, with water helping to spread the bacteria.
A new study analyzed a large database of bird species to understand why some areas have more alien species than others. The researchers found that the number of alien species in an area depends on a mix of human and environmental factors. Human activities like colonialism and trade introduced many bird species to new places, while environmental factors like native species richness and climate affect how many alien species can survive. The study shows that areas with high native species richness are less likely to be invaded by alien species, and that human activities like colonization are key to understanding alien species richness. The study used a database of 27,723 records of 971 bird species worldwide and found that alien species richness is highest at mid-latitudes and is driven by human activities like colonization. Environmental factors also play a role, with native and alien species being positively associated. The study emphasizes the threat of alien species introductions to global environments.
Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is a protein that helps regulate the transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes, which are essential for cell growth and development. Research has shown that UBF is not only important for rRNA transcription, but also for the structure of chromatin, the material that makes up chromosomes. A study in mice found that UBF is necessary for embryo development beyond the morula stage. In cell cultures, UBF was found to be essential for r gene transcription and the active chromatin conformation of gene and enhancer sequences. Loss of UBF prevented the formation of the SL/TIFB initiation complex and recruitment of the Rrn/TIF complex. It also led to the recruitment of H3me3, histone H1, and HPα, but not de novo DNA methylation. Genes retained p-acetyl4 and H2, suggesting r genes can maintain an active state without UBF. Unexpectedly, loss of U did not suppress transcription of 5, tRNA or snRNA, or expression of hundreds of genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. r gene activity does not coordinate gene expression for ribosome biogenesis. Loss of U also induced formation of a large nuclear structure resembling the nucleolar precursor body (NPB) of oocytes and embryos. These somatic NPB contain r synthesis and processing factors but not with r loci.
Researchers have found that the protein Wingless/Wnt plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the adult intestine. In the past, it was thought that Wingless had to be secreted from cells and move to other parts of the body to have an effect. However, new findings show that Wingless can act directly on nearby cells without moving. In the adult intestine, Wingless helps form boundaries between compartments, regulate cell growth, and differentiation, and communicate with other pathways. When Wingless is tethered, or stuck in place, these functions are disrupted. This suggests that Wingless needs to act directly on nearby cells to work properly. This is important for development, tissue health, and preventing disease. The study focused on the adult intestine, which is made differently than during metamorphosis and has different needs, such as continuous cell turnover and regeneration. The researchers looked at Wingless gradients in the intestine, which separate major compartments. They found that Wingless movement is necessary for proper activation, boundary formation, stem cell growth, epithelial cell fate, muscle differentiation, and signaling with the Decaplegic pathway. This supports the idea that Wingless needs to act directly on cells for tissue patterning. This has implications for development, tissue homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease. The findings may also apply to the mammalian intestine, which is divided into compartments and relies on Wnt for regionalization.
Researchers studied the role of urokinase plasogen activator (uPA) in invasive Group A streptococcus (GAS) infections, a leading cause of global morbidity and mortality. They found that uPA contributes to plasmin recruitment and invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of host plmin activators, streokinase was required for surface plmin acquisition by GAS. However, in absence of streokin, uPA was sufficient for surface plmin acquisition by strain 544 during incubation with plmin or human plasma. GAS also activated zym pro-uPA in human plasma. To assess uPA's contribution to invasive disease, a transgenic mouse model was used. C57/BL6 and AlbG mice expressing human plmin transgene were more susceptible to invasive disease than u− mice. Decreased virulence in u− mice correlated with reduced dissemination and surface plmin by GAS. These findings have implications for understanding GAS pathogenesis and targeting plmin activation in bacterial infections.
Helicobacter pylori exploits a unique repertoire of Type IV secretion system components for pilus assembly at the bacteria-host interface. Colonization of the stomach by H. pylori is a risk factor for gastric cancer development. The H. pylori pathogenic island (cPAI) encodes components of Type IV system (T4) that translocates the oncoprotein Cag into gastric epithelial cells and Cag is a component of cTSS that binds host αβ1 integrin. Researchers used mass spectrometry to co-purify Cag, Cag (integrin-binding protein), and Cag (protein with sequence similarity to C). These proteins are encoded by contiguous genes in cPA and detectable on bacterial surface. All proteins required C translocation into cells and H. pyl-induced IL-8 by gastric epithelial cells; however, not homologous components of T in other species. Scanning microscopy reveals proteins involved pilus formation between H. pyl and epithelial cells. Δag and ΔcL strains fail pilus, whereas ΔH exhibits hyperiliated and elongated pilus compared to wild-type. This suggests pilus regulated by C. Conserved C-terminal hexapeptide in C, C, C, and C. Deletion motifs C translocation and IL-8, and motifs C-terminal C and C required pilus formation.
Scientists have been working to develop a vaccine against bovine tuberculosis (bTB), a disease caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a type of bacteria that affects cattle. To create a vaccine, researchers need to understand how the immune system protects against the disease. They studied gene expression in vaccinated and unvaccinated cattle to identify predictors of protection. Cattle were vaccinated with BCG, a common vaccine, or a combination of BCG and adenovirus vectored subunit. After challenge with M bovis, researchers found 668 genes differently expressed in vaccinated-protected compared to vaccinated-unacc and unacc cattle. Cytokine-cytokine interaction was significant, with IL-22 identified as key protector besides INFγ. Expression of these genes was confirmed in an independent set of PB samples from BCG vaccinated and unacc calves. This suggests IL-22 is a predictor of vaccine efficacy. BCG vaccination can induce immunity in some calves, resolving Mbo infection, similar to humans with M tuberculosis. Most promising strategies improve BCG, not replace it. Predicting success after vaccination before exposure to TB would aid vaccine development. Previous studies showed BCG induced cell-mediated immunity with strong INFγ production. Several strategies improved B, such as DNA, protein, live, or recombinant vaccines. No reliable correlates of protection exist. In a study, IL-17 predicted BCG protection, but not significant in this study. Cattle were vaccinated with B or B/Ad, resulting in protection against Mbo compared to uninf.
Scientists have long known that non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) are present in most cells, but how they regulate microtule organization and dynamics is unclear. Researchers used a tissue-specific degradation system to test the role of the centrosomal microtub nucleators γ-tulin complex (γ-TRC) and AIR-1/AurA at the apical MOC in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic intestinal cells. They found that the core-TRC component G-1/G3 is required to recruit other-T components to the apical MOC, including MT/MT, characterized for the first time in animal development. In contrast, AIR-1 and MT were required to recruit-T to the centros but not to the apical MOC. Surprisingly, microtules remained organized at the apical MOC upon-T and AIR co-depletion and depletion of other microule regulators. However, loss of G-1 removed a subset of dynamic microules and the remaining microules grew faster. These results suggest that microule centers use different proteins for function and the apical MOC is composed of distinct γu-dependent and -independent microules competing for limited resources.
Researchers compared 11 different methods for phasing human genomes, which is the process of determining the origin of genetic material from each parent. They used the NA128 genome as a reference. Most sequencing initiatives ignore this process due to costs and complexity. The methods included laboratory-based and computational approaches. Laboratory methods prepared DNA in unique ways to facilitate phasing, while computational methods reconstructed information from sequencing data or population haplotype frequencies. Metrics used to assess performance included error rates, haplotype lengths, and phasing accuracy. A hybrid approach combining population phasing, genome sequencing data, and haplotype frequencies produced accurate results. Population phasing improved with genome data, and parental genotypes reduced errors by tenfold. A voting scheme combining multiple predictions enhanced performance and coverage. Regions with phasing errors were identified, including low polymorphism and SNV density.
Scientists have studied how certain bacteria, like Salmonella, secrete proteins to cause disease. They use a system called type-III secretion to send proteins into host cells. This system needs energy from a molecule called ATP to work. But researchers found that it can work without this energy source. They made changes to the bacteria so it couldn't use ATP and it still secreted proteins. They also found that a strong energy source, called proton motive force, helped the process. This force made up for the lack of ATP. The study shows that the energy from ATP is not always needed for this process. It helps deliver proteins to the machine that sends them out and makes sure they are ready to be sent. If there's enough energy from the force, the machine can work without the energy from ATP. This is important for how these bacteria make their flagella and how they cause disease. The flagella are like tails that help them move and cause infection. The study helps us understand how these bacteria work and how they cause disease.
Researchers studied a large family of simple biochemical networks, called gene regulatory networks (GRNs), which control essential biological functions like cell differentiation and cell cycle. They used computer simulations to analyze over 40,000 possible networks formed by two-factor genes and their proteins, assuming basic biochemical processes. The study found that about 90% of these networks can be bistable, meaning they can switch between two or more states, including some without typical features associated with bistable systems. Most could only be identified as bistable through detailed analysis. Bistable networks were grouped into 11 minimal types, meaning they don't contain smaller bistable sub-networks. This suggests bistable behavior arises easily and isn't lost through evolution. The researchers applied their method to yeast data and found several GRNs predicted to be bistable. They used a computer algorithm to analyze 40,680 possible two-gene networks, finding 36,771 bistable, 9% with multiple states, and 6.5% monostable. The study focused on basic transcriptional regulation but didn't include all processes. One mechanism for nonlinearity is dimer degradation, which protects against proteolysis. The identified networks are bistable candidates, providing hypotheses for experimentation. This approach can be used for other systems with available data.
Researchers have identified a new genetic cause of orofacial cleft, a common birth defect, in humans and mice. They found that mutations in the HY2 gene, which encodes hyaluronidase 2, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, a key component of the developing palate and heart tissue. Experiments showed that these mutations reduce the amount of HY2 protein, leading to abnormalities in the face and heart. In mice without HY2, researchers saw cleft palate, coratri sinister, and hearing loss. These features were also seen in some humans with HY2 mutations. The study highlights the importance of HY2 and hyuronic acid for normal development in humans and mice. It reveals a new pathway involved in the development of oracial cleft and coratri sinister, which may lead to new treatments.
Scientists have long known that inner hair cells in the ear rely on tiny links called stereocilia to detect sound, but the details of how these links work have been unclear. These links are made of two proteins, protocadherin 15 (PCD15) and cadherin 23 (CD23), but it was thought they were always together in the same order. Researchers used a new microscope to look at the links and found two types: one with PC15 at both ends and one with PC15 at one end and CD23 at the other. When links break, the PC23 disappears and PC15 moves to the side, then forms new link with PC15 at both ends. This new link works, but doesn't adapt to sound well. Later, the PC15/CD23 link forms and hearing returns to normal. This study shows how links are remade after breaking and helps us understand how hearing works.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a prevalent arbovirus that causes an estimated 100 million symptomatic deng infections every year, with a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from mild deng fever (DF) to life-threatening deng hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The transition from DF to DHF is not well understood. Researchers performed mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling of sera from adult DF and DH patients at critical and recovery phases of infection, identifying 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DH. Bile acids, purines, acylcarnines, phospholipids, and amino acids were up to 5-fold higher in DH compared to DF, correlated with liver injury. Uric acid, the most abundant antioxidant in blood, was 1.5-fold lower in DH, suggesting decreased endogenous defense and oxidative stress. In the recovery phase, eight metabolites remained higher or lower in DH, including chenodeoxycholic acid, indicating prolonged liver impact. The study linked metabolic pathways to DH in critical and recovery phases and host-DENV interactions, advancing understanding DH pathogenesis and possible therapeutic targets.
Researchers have identified a key enzyme called guanine 5'-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) in the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, which causes African sleeping sickness in humans and nagana disease in cattle. This enzyme plays a crucial role in converting guanine 5'-monophosphate to inosine 5'-monophosphate, maintaining the balance of purine nucleotides in the cell. The study found that the GR in T. brucei is distinct from its host animals, having a unique insertion of cystathion synthase domain. The recombinant protein of T. bruce GR catalyzed the conversion of GMP to IMP in the presence of NAD and showed different affinities for G and NAD compared to its mammalian counterparts. The addition of monoval cations such as K and NH4 increased GR activity of T. bruce, whereas none of mammalian GRs were affected. The purine analog ribavir inhibited T. br GR, but not mammalian GRs. This suggests the mechanism of GR in T. br is distinct from its host. The study also showed that ribavir inhibited the proliferation of trypanosomes in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent against African trypaniasis.
Researchers used computer simulations to study how two drugs, benzocaine and phenyto, block sodium channels in cells. These channels control electrical activity in the body and are used to treat conditions like epilepsy and heart arrhythmia. To develop new drugs that target specific channels, scientists need to know how current blockers work. The study found both drugs bind to two sites in the channel: one above the gate and one at the entrance to the lipid-filled fenestrations. The gate site is slightly more favorable for binding. The drugs can pass through the fenestr with little energy, suggesting a hydrophobic route. Residues direct drugs into the fen and form binding sites are important.
MyD signaling plays a crucial role in the body's defense against bacterial infections, particularly in the intestines. Research has shown that mice lacking MyD are highly susceptible to various bacterial infections, but the specific role of MyD in intestinal immunity is not well understood. To investigate this, scientists created a mouse model that allows for MyD to be turned on in specific cells in My-deficient mice. They found that My signaling in dendritic cells, a type of immune cell, is enough to activate an early response against the intestinal pathogen C. rodium. This response includes the activation of group 3 innate lymphoid cells and development of Th17/1 cells. In contrast, My signaling in other cells like macrophages, T cells, or innate lymphoid cells did not induce a response. Surprisingly, My in intestinal epithelial cells also helped protect against infection by maintaining the epithelial barrier and increasing antimicrobial peptides. The study suggests My signaling in dendritic cells and epithelial cells is essential for a full response against C. rodium infection.
Researchers are working to eliminate onchocerciasis, a parasitic worm disease, in Africa through annual or biannual mass drug administration (MDA). One tool to determine if transmission is interrupted and treatment can stop is an immunodiagnostic test detecting IgG antibodies in blood to Onchocerca volulus antigen Ov16. A mathematical model, ONOS, was extended to study the relationship between post-M Ov16 antibody prevalence in children 1 year after last MDA and duration of M, population mf prevalence, and probability ofchercias elimination. The study found that yearly M reduces parasite rate in humans, lowering sero rate in newborns and children, while those serconverted remain positive. Both mf prevalence in 5+ and Ov antibody in under 10 declined with M duration. The association between indicators and predicted elimination probability was influenced by endemic levels, serconversion trigger, and test sensitivity/specificity. Understanding Ov antibody dynamics is crucial for accurate interpretation and precise endpoint MDA. The study shows endpoint depends on endemic levels, which should be considered in guidelines for stopping M.
Researchers have found that prions, a type of infectious protein, can change their properties when grown in different environments. When prions that were sensitive to a drug called swainine were grown in a cell line called PK1 in the presence of swine, drug-resistant variants emerged. This suggests that prions are made up of a mix of variants with different properties, and the fittest ones are selected in a particular environment. Even after cloning, prion populations showed heterogeneity, indicating that mutation-like processes occur at the conformation level. Brain-derived prions are naturally swine-resistant, so it was not surprising that pr that became sensitive after growth in cells could revert to resistance. However, pr grown in brain or PK cells are swine-sensitive, researchers investigated if it was possible to select swine-resistant by growth in presence of drug. Interestingly, this was not possible with standard PK cells, but certain sublines of PK allowed swine-resistant, even swine-dependent (propagated more in presence of drug) to be isolated. Once established, they could be passed in PK cells, even absence of drug without swine dependence. Misfolded pr protein associated with swine variant was rapidly cleared in PK cells than its sensitive counterpart, indicating structural differences of misfold pr underlie pr properties. Propagation of pr in presence inhibitory drug not only selects drug-resistant pr but stable variants that propagate efficiently in presence drug. Adaptations likely due conformation changes abnormal pr protein.
Scientists have mapped out the vast space of all possible metabolic systems that extract energy from carbon, a fundamental to life. They analyzed 101 of these systems, called metabolisms, to see how they work on 10 different carbon sources. This led to 102 possible outcomes, or phenotypes. Most metabolisms with one outcome make up a small part of the space, but there are many of them. These metabolisms with one outcome often connect to others through small changes, making it easy to get from one to another. The distance between metabolisms with different outcomes is small, so it's possible to get new outcomes with few changes. However, some metabolisms with many reactions are hard to change. Adding more reactions makes it easier to evolve and innovate. 

The researchers looked at neighborhoods of metabolisms on one source to see if they have new outcomes. If so, which outcomes depend on where they are in space. They picked 1000 pairs of metabolisms, each different by a few reactions, and looked at their outcomes on 10 sources. A change in metabolism is new if it works on new sources. To study this, they looked at a small space of 101 metabolisms. Metabolism is key to energy from carbon and limited to 10 sources, so 102 outcomes. Metabolisms can be very different and most are in one network. They looked at metabolisms on many sources to see how previous findings apply. This is harder as there are many combinations of sources. They picked 1000 metabolisms from each network and looked for new outcomes nearby.
Researchers studied the genetic variation and geographic distribution of the Triatoma dimata complex, a parasite that transmits Trypanosoma cruzi, the cause of Chagas disease, across Mexico and the Neotropics. They analyzed two fragments of the ND4 gene, a part of the parasite's DNA, to understand the genetic differences between three haplogroups, or groups of the parasite. The study found that the lowest genetic diversity of the parasite occurs where there is most human modification of the landscape and highest prevalence of the disease. Trypanosoma cruz was more common in haplog 1 and 3, but less in hap 2. There was also a difference in the type of infection in hap 1 and 3, but not in 2. All haplog from the Neotrop had moderate to high genetic diversity, with most difference between hap 1 and 3. The parasite diverged from a common ancestor around 0.97-0.85 million years ago, with hap 2 and 3 diverging later. The study supports previous evidence that the complex originated in the Tehuante Isthmus region and shows recent divergence of three haplog with different Tryos cruz frequency and DT specificity, important for vector capacity.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFR) is a rod-borne disease caused by two hantaviruses: Hanta virus and Seoul virus. Environmental factors can affect the risk of contracting hant infections, mainly through their impact on rodent population and human-rod contact. Researchers studied 10 years of data on rod hosts, havirus, epidemiology, and environment to understand how environment affects rod-to-human transmission. They found that rod species play different roles in various land types, but all are associated with transmission risk. Some species are linked to FR occurrence in forests and water, while others in grasslands and built-up areas. Rod community composition also varies with environment. Predictive models show cultivated land is highest risk for FR incidence, matching 2014-201 statistics. The study suggests FR disease heterogeneity is influenced by rod community, associated with local conditions. Future work should focus on preventing FR in moist environments.
Researchers have found that mutations in the HRAS gene, which can cause Costello syndrome (CS), a rare genetic disorder, have different effects on cancer and CS. They discovered a new mutation, c.35_36>T, in a 12-year-old boy with mild CS. Analysis showed high levels of exon 2 skipping in HRAS DNA. Using wild and mutant HR genes, they confirmed that c.35_36>T causes skipping by disrupting a splicing enhancer and creating a splicing silencer. They found that HR exon 2 is vulnerable due to a weak 3' splice site, making it dependent on splicing proteins like SRS2. Most cancer and CS mutations are located here, affecting splicing differently. Results show that CS and cancer phenotypes are not only due to mutant HR protein potential, but also exon inclusion efficiency from different mutations. A splicing oligonucleotide (SO) that blocks the enhancer causes skipping and halts cancer cell growth, revealing a potential for new cancer therapy.
Researchers have found that a specific enzyme called METTL3 plays a crucial role in the development of the cerebellum, a part of the brain that helps with movement and balance. When MET3 is inactivated in mice, the cerebellum doesn't develop properly, leading to a condition called cerebellar hypoplasia. This is caused by the death of new cerebellar granule cells, which are essential for the cerebellum's function. The study shows that MET3 adds a chemical modification called m6 to RNAs, which helps regulate gene expression and cell death. Without MET3, the m6 modification is lost, leading to abnormal gene expression and cell death. The researchers conclude that MET3 is essential for cerebell development and that the loss of m6 causes gene dysregulation and cell death. They also found that MET3 is necessary for the development of the nervous system at the post-transcriptional level, meaning it affects how genes are expressed. The study suggests that MET3 is a key regulator of cerebell development.
Researchers studied how transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG work together to regulate gene expression in embryonic stem cells. These cells can become any cell type in the developing embryo. They found that when these factors bind together, it's associated with a co-activator called H3ac and increased expression of nearby genes. The same loci bound by OCT, NAN, and SOX in human and mouse cells drive expression in early development. However, only 5% of individual binding events are shared between species, but 15% of combinatorial binding and 53-63% of enhancers active in early development are conserved. This suggests combination of OCT, SO2, and NANOG is critical for transcription in ES and plays a role in embryogenesis by binding conserved enhancers. Evolutionary rewiring mainly affects individual binding, but "regulatory hotspots" bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues are under stronger constraints. Combinatorial binding of OCT, SO2, and NAN identifies enhancers with H3ac and Med localization in ES cells. Many combinatorially bound enhancers are active in early development. This implies conserved combinatorial events in ES have downstream impact controlling key genes in differentiation and tight connection between pluripotency and development by OCT, SO2 and NAN through enhancers.
Researchers have studied the AML/ETO protein, a result of a chromosomal translocation that causes acute myeloid leukemia. AML. They found that AMLETO binds to specific regions on DNA and co-localizes with its wild-type counterpart A1, but doesn't primarily displace it. The protein also interacts with E-protein H and targets other sites on DNA. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling revealed AETO's transcriptional regulation. AETO was found to co-localize with A1 and H on many regulated targets, and increased H levels were seen in cells expressing AETO. The study suggests AETO's interaction with A1 and H plays a major role in its transcriptional regulation. AETO was hypothesized to target E-box motifs through interactions with E-pro family factors, particularly H/TC12. E-proteins are regulators of lymphoc differentiation and ALL, but their role in myoid and AML was unknown. AETO's regulation is associated with co-occurrence of A1 and H, suggesting common binding sites for the three factors are relevant to AETO function. Some genes regulated by AETO didn't show binding proximity to the protein. A1 and H share targets in wild conditions, pointing to common functions in hematopoies. When binding common sites, A1 and H are less displaced by AETO, representing preferential sites for the protein. AETO includes E exon 9, leading to a frameshift and C-terminally truncated protein. Co-expression AETO and AETOa results in earlier AML and blocks myoid differentiation at a more immature stage, suggesting cooperation in patients.
Researchers studied the role of histone acetyltransferase H2 (H2) in Leishmania donani, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. They found that H2 acetylates histone H4 in vitro and in vivo, and is essential for cell growth and survival. Without H2, cells had defects in cell cycle and survival. The team discovered that cyclins CY4 and CY9, which regulate cell cycle, were downregulated in H2-depleted cells. These cyclins are part of polycronic units, which are clusters of genes that are transcribed together. They found that CY4 and CY9 have their own promoters, which are activated at specific cell stages of the cycle. This is a new way of regulating genes in Leish donani. The team also found that H acetylation of H4 on promoters of CY4 and CY9 is important for their expression. Without H2, these promoters were not activated, leading to downregulation of cyclins. This study shows that Leishani has two levels of gene regulation: one for polyc units and one for individual genes. The first is constant, the second is cell-cycle dependent and sensitive to H acetylation. This is the first study to show cell-specific activation of promoters in trypanosids, a family of parasites. It uncovers new facets of gene regulation in Leish.
Researchers studied how people infer the intentions of others in social interactions. They created a game where two people played together, one as "player" and one "adviser". The player got information about a lottery from a chart and the adviser gave a recommendation. The adviser's goal was to help or mislead the player, changing over time. The researchers used a mathematical model to see how people learn and make decisions. They found that people use a "hierarchical learning" to figure out the adviser's intentions. This means they think about how likely the adviser is to help or mislead and use that to decide if to trust the advice. They also found that people are more likely to trust advice when they think adviser's intentions are stable. The model predicted how people rate the adviser's helpfulness and the adviser's own strategy. The study suggests people use hierarchical models to infer others' intentions, use volatility to make decisions, and combine advice with other information.
Scrub typhus, a disease typically found in rural areas of Asia, has been reported in urban areas of South Korea, particularly in Seoul, the country's largest city. Researchers analyzed data from 2010 to 2013 and found 88 cases of urban scrub typhus in Seoul. Most patients were infected in mountainous areas, parks, near their homes, or rivers. Chigger mites, the disease-carrying insects, were collected in the city and identified using DNA sequencing. Eighty-seven chigger mites were found in Gak mountain, one of the suspected infection sites, and 87.4% were identified as Helenula miag and 9.2 as Leotridium scell. DNA from miag mites yielded O tsugushi Bong strain. Twenty-six patients showed low fever, low complication rate, and no hypalemia. The study found indigenous scrub typh in Seoul and a subgroup with mild features. Chigger m miag infected O tsugushi within the city was found. Scrub tyus needs to be considered as a differential disease and target for prevention.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called HENN-1 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which is involved in the regulation of gene activity through a process called RNA interference (RNAi). They found that HENN-1 affects two types of RNA molecules called 26 and 21, which are involved in gene silencing. Surprisingly, the stability of 21 RNAs was only mildly affected by loss of H-1, but introduction of artificial 21 target RNA did not destabilize non-methylated 21 RN. In contrast, 26 RN displayed reduced stability and responded to loss of H- by increased 3-uridylation. Within the 26 class, they found that ER-1-bound 26 RN were modified by H- while AL-3/4-bound 26 were not. Global expression analysis of- mutants revealed mild effects, including downregulation of gerine-expressed genes. The study suggests that apart from direct effects on 26 levels, most effects on gene expression are indirect.
Scientists have discovered a new role for a protein called Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 (HNF1) in controlling a process called glycosylation, which affects how proteins work in the body. Glycosylation is when sugar molecules attach to proteins, changing their function. This process is important in many diseases, including cancer, heart disease, and metabolic disorders. Researchers studied 2,705 people in three groups and found that variations in NF1 and two other genes, FUT6 and F8, affect sugar levels in blood. They showed NF1 and its partner NF4 control genes that make sugar and build sugar molecules. NF1 is key to making these genes work in liver cells. This means NF is a master regulator of glycos process, affecting immunity, development, protein folding, and disease. Changes in NF may be linked to cancer, heart disease, and metabolic disorders.
Scientists have discovered that a protein called Centromere Protein C (CPC) is stabilized by single-stranded RNA at the centromeres, which are the points where the genome attaches to the cytoskeleton. Centromeres bind to kinetochores, which in turn bind spindles and move chromosomes. But surprisingly, the DNA sequence of centrom has little role in recruiting kinetocho. Instead, RNA transcribed from centrom remains within the kinetoch region and is thought to be part of the epigenetic system. Researchers studied maize CPC, a key kinetoch protein, and found that DNA binding is conferred by a region of 122 amino acids and is sensitive to single-stranded RNA. Long single-stranded nucleic acids promote binding of CPC to DNA, and types of RNAs that stabilize binding match those present in kinetocho in vivo. Removing the binding module causes partial delocalization of CPC in vivo. The data suggest centrom RNA recruits CPC to kinoch by altering DNA characteristics.

 Maize centrom repeats are undermethyl transcribed and produce stable RNAs that remain bound to chromatin. Centrom RNAs are 40-200 in length, transcribed from both strands and maintained single-stranded. RNA may serve as a template to recruit kinoch proteins. Researchers used in vitro and vivo studies to show maize CPC has DNA and RNA-binding capacities, the DNA/RNA domain localized to exon region, and binding required for centere localization. RNA facilitates binding of CPC to DNA in vitro, providing a mechanism for RNA involvement in centere specification. Single-stranded RNA has strong effect on binding, suggesting centrom RNA as epetic mark that mediates final assembly. CPC is recruited kin by protein contacts then converted to DNA-binding by centrom RNA.
Researchers have found that the placenta, a vital organ for fetal development and postnatal health, plays a significant role in determining birth weight and childhood obesity risk. They analyzed genetic variants associated with birth weight, childhood obesity, and body mass index (BMI) and discovered that the placenta's genetic code, or transcriptome, is crucial in mediating these traits. The study found that genetic variants linked to birth weight, obesity, and BMI were significantly enriched in the placenta's transcriptome, six, four, and two and a half times more than in other tissues. Importantly, the placenta's genetic code contributes to body size at birth and weight in childhood. The researchers identified hundreds of genes controlled by genetic variants that influence these traits, showing the placenta's role in determining birth and childhood weight. The study highlights the placenta's importance in determining not just birth weight but also body weight in childhood, making it a key area for understanding and preventing obesity.
Researchers in India conducted a study to determine the prevalence of post-kala-azar dermal leishiasis (PKDL) in Malda district, West Bengal, a region where the disease is endemic. PKDL is a condition that occurs in some people who have recovered from visceral leishiasis (VL) and is not life-threatening, but can cause skin lesions. The study aimed to compare three diagnostic methods for PKDL detection and track lesion regression after treatment. Twenty-six PK cases were found, with a prevalence of 27.5% among VL antibody-positive cases. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was most sensitive, detecting 88.46% of cases. Most lesions persisted after treatment but disappeared within 6-12 months. Two cases relapsed after 1.5 years of treatment. A significant number of PK patients would remain undiagnosed without active surveys. Surveys are needed in other areas to eliminate kalaazar. PCR is helpful for PK diagnosis, but a larger study is needed to determine if patients are parasite-free after treatment and which need longer treatment.
Scientists have studied how the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae, a type of bacteria, becomes "competent" to take up new genetic material from its environment. This process, called competence, is crucial for the bacteria's survival and evolution. They found that competence in a population of these bacteria is coordinated by a self-activated cell fraction that arises through a growth-dependent mechanism. This means that a small group of cells first becomes competent and then triggers the rest of the population to follow. The competent cells produce a signaling molecule, CSP, which creates a positive feedback loop, but it's unclear how it's coordinated. The researchers monitored competence in real-time in four distinct pneumocococcal lineages and found that it relies on cell-to-cell contact. They showed that CSP remains bound to cells during this process and the rate of competence corresponds to contact between activated and quiescent cells. They also found that a protein, ComD, retains CSP, limiting its diffusion in the medium. The team proposes that competent cells originate stochastically in response to stress, forming a subpopulation that transmits CSP by cell contact. This two-step mechanism provides an efficient way to maintain CSP-based feedback in all cells. The study suggests that pneumoccal competence is a two-step process: a fraction of cells switches to CSP-expression, then induces competence in the rest. The second step occurs through CSP transmission between cells via cell-to-cell collision.
Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV) uses a protein called L2 to help its genetic material (DNA) travel from the endosomes to the trans-Gol network (TGN) and eventually the nucleus, where it replicates. To get to the nucleus, the L2-DNA complex must cross a membrane within the cell. Researchers created a system to study this process and found that L2's movement to the TGN depends on the cell entering mitosis, or cell division. If the cell is arrested, L-DNA stays at the TGN, but when it progresses to the G2/M phase, it crosses the membrane and infects the cell. Microscopy showed that the DNA rapidly changes location during mitosis, moving from the TGN to the perinuclear area and then to chromosomes. By metaphase and anaphase, it's bound to chromosomes, ensuring it's distributed to both daughter cells. Mutations in L's chromatin binding region blocked this process, suggesting it's dependent on chromatin during prometaph. This is the first time a virus has been shown to couple membrane penetration with mitosis, explaining HPV's preference for mitotic keratinocytes.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to measure the transmissibility of one strain of a pathogen compared to another, using data from experiments where animals are co-infected with a mixture of two strains. They observed the mixture in each animal over time and multiple generations of transmission, using influenza in ferrets as an example. This is important in three contexts: when new strains of influenza arise and compete for hosts, during a pandemic where a new strain competes with existing ones, and with neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) that can reduce transmission but promote resistant strains. The framework also estimates the size of the transmitted inoculum, or initial amount of pathogen, and can be applied to other viral and bacterial pathogens.
Scientists have long known that light and a plant hormone called abscisic acid (ABA) play crucial roles in plant growth and development, but how they work together to help plants adapt to their environment is not well understood. Researchers found that a protein called BBX21, which helps seedlings grow towards light, is also involved in ABA signaling. They discovered that BB21 acts upstream of two other proteins, ABI5 and HY5, which control seed germination. Previous studies showed HY activates ABI5, and BB21 interacts with HY. The study found BB21 negatively regulates ABI5 by stopping HY from binding to the ABI promoter. Additionally, ABI activates its own expression, but BB21 blocks this by interacting with ABI. The study shows BB21 works with HY and ABI on the ABI promoter, integrating light and ABA signals in Arabidopsis. This integration is important for seed germination and early seedling development.
Researchers have studied the Mediator complex in Candida albicans, a fungus that causes infections in humans. The Mediator is a protein complex that helps control gene expression in cells. The study focused on three parts of the Med complex: Med31, Med20, and Srb/M13. They found that C. albicans Med has some similarities with other yeasts, like Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizoscharomyces pombe, in responding to stress and regulating certain genes. However, it also has unique roles in genes related to virulence, such as morphogenesis and adhesion. Med31, Med, and S/M13 contribute to virulence of C. albicans, including filamentation, biofilm formation, and cell adhesion. ALS is a target of Med for biofilm development. In a worm infection model, Med affects virulence of C. alb. The study also found that Med subunits regulate adhesion differently in C. alb and S cerevisiae, repressing FLO genes in S cerevis and activating ALS in C. alb. This suggests distinct regulation of adhesion in two related species.
Researchers studied how the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa develops resistance to antibiotics when it forms a biofilm, a sticky community of bacteria that adheres to a surface. They found that biofilms are more resistant to antibiotics than individual bacteria floating in liquid. To understand why, they created a library of mutant Pseudas aeruginosa and tested how each mutation affected its ability to resist the antibiotic tobrycin in both biofilm and plankic states. The study revealed many genes that contribute to resistance in one state but not the other, and some that the biofilm state itself plays a significant role in resistance. This knowledge can help develop new treatments for infections caused by Pseudas aerugin biofilms, which are hard to treat with antibiotics. The researchers used a technique called transposon mutagenesis to create the library of mutants and tested them in four conditions: biofilm with tobrycin, bio without toycin, plankic with tobr, and plankic without toycin. This design allowed them to see which genes are important in each state and how they interact with the environment. They found that while some genes contribute to resistance in both states, most are specific to one or the other. For example, genes that help in biofilms are weak in plankic and vice versa. The study provides a comprehensive look at antibiotic resistance in bio and plankic states and how they share and differ.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Flexible Algorithm for Model Selection (FoS) to analyze complex biological systems. These systems are hard to study because they have many parts that interact with each other and not much is known about how they work. Finding a model that describes them well and shows what's important can be difficult because there are many possibilities. The algorithm compares many models against data to find the best one that fits. Unlike others, it doesn't rely on searching all possibilities, which can be too many. It uses local and new search methods to avoid getting stuck in a bad solution. The team tested it on simulated data and showed it can handle different model structures. They also used it on real data from T cells grown in different conditions. The results showed changes in cell growth were different in 3D cultures compared to suspension. The algorithm is flexible and can be used for many problems, making it a useful tool for studying complex systems.
Researchers in Bolivia conducted a 12-month study to evaluate the effectiveness of benznidazole (BN) treatment in children infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease. The study involved 103 seropositive children who received BN, with 3 dropping out due to side effects. Blood samples were taken before, during, and after treatment, and analyzed for serology, PCR, and real-time PCR, and Th1/2/17 cytokines, including IL-17. 57 children completed the study, with 6 (11%) showing both PCR+ and qPCR+, 24 (42%) PCR- but q+, and 27 (47%) PCR- and q-. IL-17 levels were higher in seropitive children before treatment and decreased to normal levels after. IL-17 levels were positively related to parasite counts by qPCR. At 12 months, IL-17 levels in non-reactive subjects were higher than reactive or ambiguous, suggesting IL-17 as a potential biomarker for treatment response to BN.
Researchers have studied the Coria elements, a type of repetitive DNA found in the genome of Neisseria meningitidis, a bacterium that causes meningitis. They found eight subtypes of Coria with distinct ends and identified two strong promoters that drive gene expression. The strongest promoter's activity is influenced by a specific sequence variation at the end of the element. Some Coria elements drive expression of adjacent genes, while others may produce non-coding RNAs. Comparing three meningococ genomes, researchers found that more than two-thirds of Coria maintain the same subtype at a particular location, due to recombination between elements in a single strain. This process allows new subtype to spread through population by natural transformation. This may be a new mechanism for variation in meningococcus. Coria's variability and strong promoters enable widespread effects in the population. By defining promoters, researchers can predict transcription effects of a subtype at a given location.
Researchers have identified two genes, Chae and Vel, in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostus that regulate the production of a toxin called Txin. This toxin promotes virulence, or the ability of the pathogen to cause disease, in maize plants with a specific genetic trait called Texas sterile cytoplasm. The toxin production of Txin is increased in the dark and decreased in the absence of Chae and Vel. The genes responsible for making Txin, called Tox, are also upregulated in the dark and downregulated in Chae and Vel mutants. Overexpressing Ch Vel in the dark and Chae in light increases Txin production and Tox gene expression. This shows that Chae and Vel positively regulate Txin production. The virulence of Chae and Vel mutants and overexpressing strains is altered on normal and Texas cytoplasm maize, indicating that Txin mediated virulence and pathogenic ability are affected. Deletion of Chae or Vel reduces tolerance to oxidative stress. Chae and Vel mutants also show reduced aerial growth, increased sporulation, and sterility. Chae overexpressing strains are sterile while Vel overing strains are more fertile. Ch and Vel repress melanin biosynthesis genes, leading to enhanced melanization in Ch and Vel mutants and reduced in overing strains. Overall, Ch and Vel regulate Txin biosynthesis, pathogenicity, virulence, oxidative stress, development, and aerial growth, and control melanin biosynthesis and differentiation.
Researchers have studied the mechanism of ion selectivity in bacterial Nav channels, which allow certain ions to pass through while blocking others. They used computer simulations to model the movement of ions through the channel and found that two potassium ions can block the entrance in one direction, but not the other. This block is due to an unstable state in the energy landscape of the ions, which can be locked in place by force. In contrast, sodium ions move through together as a unit in a "knock-on" mechanism in both directions and don't have a similar block state. The simulations predicted energy needed to break the potassium block matches experimentally measured values for bacterial channels to induce potassium currents. This shows that including non-equilibrium factors in simulations can reveal mechanisms of selectivity missing from structures or equilibrium landscapes. The results differ from previous findings and match electrophysiological measurements of bacterial channels. Non-equilibrium simulations suggest a "pass-by" configuration of potassium can block the filter and prevent permeation at negative voltages. This aligns with experimentally observed potentials for bacterial channels to induce potassium currents.
Researchers studied the spread of the rabies virus in the brains of dogs with two different forms of the disease: furious and paralytic rabies. They found that the virus spread faster in the furious form, with more viral particles in the cerebral hemispheres and higher levels of viral RNA. To understand how the virus moves, they looked at the amount of viral antigen in cell bodies and processes. In paralytic dogs, the amount of viral antigen in processes was lower than in bodies, with a delay in cell involvement. In contrast, furious dogs had more antigen in processes at all levels examined. This suggests the virus moves slower in paraly form, possibly due to differences in how it's transported within cells. This could be related to inflammation, as previous studies showed more inflammation in paraly form.
Researchers studied the protein CTC in fruit flies to understand its role in gene regulation. CTC is a zinc-finger protein known to block enhancer-promoter interaction in vertebrates. In flies, only one CTC binding site was known, the Fab-8 insulator in the Bithax complex (BX). The team used chromatin immunoprecipitation with microarray to find CTC sites in other regions of the fly genome, including 3-M Adh, BX, and Antennedia. They found CTC sites in BX map to known insulators Mc, Fab-6, and Fab-8, and three new sites Fab-2, Fab-3, and Fab-4. CTC is associated with all known or predicted insulators in BX, suggesting a common mechanism. They compared CTC sites with Polycomb target and histone modification, supporting BX regulation model.

CTC is not just in Fab8, but also in other boundary elements Fab6 and Mc. A study showed Fab8 contains CTC sites and mutation reduces its insulator activity. The team used chromatin immunoprecitation with microarray to investigate CTC in BX and other regions. They found CTC in open domain Fab8 and site B, enabling enhancers to Abd-B promoter. They compared CTC with Su(H) binding sites, another fly insulator protein. C can form clusters, mediating chromatin domains. Partitioning elements into domains is key to enhancer-promoter interaction. A C homolog was found in flies, required for Fab8 function in BX. C binds a core sequence in flies and vertebrates.
Scientists have long understood that enzymes recognize their substrates by changing shape to fit them better. This process, called induced fit, is crucial for efficient catalysis, but has been hard to study due to its dynamic nature. Researchers used a slow-binding inhibitor, actin, to peptide deformylase, a metal-dependent enzyme. They solved crystal structures of the initial and final states, as well as intermediate snapshots during the process. Actin reshapes a hydrophobic pocket, closing the site, which is sealed by additional interactions. Biochemical and computational analyses reveal the sequence of events from encounter to key binding. A "movie" reconstructs this process, which can be applied to catalysis.

The study integrates crystallography, biophysics, and kinetics to understand slow-binding. It focuses on induced mechanism, but applies to broader receptor-lig interactions. Slow-binding inhibitors are favored for therapeutics due to potency and long-lasting effects. Actin is a tight inhibitor of peptide deformase, a metal-dependent enzyme. Crystallography and reconstructions have shown enzyme motions and catalytic events, but often with unnatural inhibitors, not mimicking actin. Actin's slow binding (10 seconds) is puzzling compared to catalysis (10 milliseconds). Conformation may align substrate and stabilize the complex. Structural and kinetic clues have hinted at induced fit, but direct evidence is critical. Enzyme-inhibitor interaction is easier to study than enzyme-substrate as no chemical change occurs.
Researchers studied how the thalamus, a part of the brain that relays sensory information to the cortex, processes signals from the retina. They found that the efficiency of this transfer depends on three key factors: the number of thalamocortical cells involved, the statistics of corticothalamic synaptic bombardment, and the level of correlation between converging thal relay cells. Surprisingly, they discovered that retocort signal efficiency increases when thal cells are desynchronized by cortical feedback. This mechanism could direct attention to specific thal subassemblies and select input to cortex according to cortically-defined priorities. The study used dynamic-clamp techniques in thal slices and simulated a hybrid retinothalocort pathway with biological cells and circuits. Synaptic bombardment was mimicked by injecting a mixture of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, resulting in a gradable level of afferent activity in thal cells. Results showed that decorrelation of synaptic activity in thal layer optimizes retoc signal transfer. This could be achieved by recording thal cells involved in convergent circuit and their cortical targets, or recording many cells intracellular to unravel correlation. The study proposes a novel mechanism for attention modulation of sensory signals at thal level.
Researchers have found that a protein called NMAD-1 plays a crucial role in regulating DNA replication and repair during a process called meiosis in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans. Meiosis is a stage of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells, where genetic material is passed from one generation to the next. NM-1 mutants have reduced fertility and defects in meiosis, leading to reduced embryo production and increased incidence of males due to chromosomal errors. Studies showed that NM-1 binds to proteins involved in DNA repair and replication, including topoisomerase-2, and localizes with it on chromatin. This suggests NM-1 acts on chromatin to regulate these processes during meiosis. NM-1 binds to same sites on chromatin as topoisomerase-2 and physically interacts with it in vitro and in vivo, indicating NM-1 acts on chrom to regulate processes meiosis in Caenorhabdis. NM- mutants have impaired fertility, increased males, RAD-51 foci, and reduced replication rates, suggesting NM-1 demethylation at DNA is central to its role in meiosis. NM- was previously identified as 6 DNA demethylase and proposed conserved 6 demethylase in silkwormy mori and mice.
Researchers have identified a new protein called adipocyte membrane-associated protein (AAP) that plays a crucial role in the early stages of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. CMV is a common virus that can cause serious diseases in newborns and people with weakened immune systems. The virus has a large genome and complex proteins that can infect many types of human cells, but how it infects cells is not fully understood. The study found that AAP is necessary for CMV to infect epithelial and fibroblast cells, and knocking it out AAP reduced infection in these cells. Surprisingly, adding AAP to cells that are resistant to CMV, such as canine and murine cells, made them more susceptible to infection. The researchers also found that AAP helps CM enter cells by interacting with a specific proteins on the virus at low pH and moving a key protein to the nucleus. This suggests AAP is a new player in the complex process of CMV infection.
Researchers have developed a new model that combines both internal and external factors to understand how cells decide which lineage to become in hematopoiesis. Hematopoies is the process by which blood cells are made. The model shows that external signals, such as cytokines, can influence cell decisions and make them more likely to become certain types of cells. This challenges the idea that cell decisions are solely based on internal factors. Cytokines are proteins that help cells communicate with each other. The model also shows that cells can respond to multiple signals and make different choices. It suggests that the path to becoming a mature cell depends on the starting cell and the signals it receives. The model matches data from experiments and provides a way to understand how cells choose lineage in hematies.
Researchers have studied the ultrastructure of the Bunyamwera virus, a member of the Orthunavirus genus, using electron cryo-microscopy. They found that the virus has a pleomorphic shape with a lattice of glycoprotein spikes protruding from the membrane. Each spike is 18 nanometers long and changes shape when introduced to an acidic environment. Using subtomography, they created a 3D model of the trimeric glycoprotein spike at 3 nanometer resolution. The glycoprotein consists of a putative class II fusion glycoprotein with a unique tripod arrangement. Protein-protein contacts occur between spikes at membrane-proximal and intra-spike at membrane-distal regions. This assembly is different from previously observed fusion glycop arrangements. The study shows a pH-dependent conformation change during orthunaviral entry into cells and provides a blueprint for this group of emerging pathogens. The glyprotein sequences of Bunyamwera virus are similar to more pathogenic relatives, sharing 54 and 53% similarity with SBV and ORO, respectively. The study provides the first 3D analysis of an orthunavirus and a model for this medically important group.
Researchers have identified a gene called ABCC5 that is linked to the depth of the space in the front of the eye, called the anterior chamber. This space is a risk factor for a type of glaucoma called primary angle glaucoma (PACG). The study looked at 5,308 people of Asian descent and found a variation in the AB5 gene that was associated with a smaller anterior chamber depth. This variation increased the risk of PG in a separate study of 4,276 people with PG and 18,801 without PG. The link was stronger when people with open angles were included in the analysis. The study suggests that genetic factors that affect the size of the anterior chamber may contribute to the risk of PG. PG is a major cause of blindness, especially in Asia, where 10% of people have narrow angles, a precursor to PG. The study found AB5 is expressed in parts of the eye relevant to PG, such as the iris and lens. The researchers also looked at other genes linked to PG and found no change in the link to AB5.
Scientists have long sought to understand the similarities and differences between deuterostomes and protomes, two groups of animals that diverged early in evolution. They share a common toolkit of developmental genes and signaling pathways, but previous studies found no conserved regulatory sequences between them. Researchers have now identified the first enhancers, called bilater conserved regulatory elements (Bres), conserved between deuteromes and protomes. These elements show sequence and gene conservation, reflecting conserved patterns of transcription factor binding. Bres are predicted to act as response elements to signaling pathways and drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate nervous system. The small number of identified Bres suggests extensive rewiring of regulation between the two clades, but more may be revealed as understanding of cis-regulatory logic and bilian genomes grows. The discovery of Bres offers a new avenue to explore how developmental logic is encoded in the genome and how it evolves.
Researchers studied the impact of vaccination on the diversity of the H3N2 influenza virus within individuals. They used next-generation sequencing to analyze viruses from a vaccine trial and found that vaccine-induced immunity had a minimal effect on the virus' evolution within hosts. The study isolated the impact of vaccination from natural infection by comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. The researchers found that most single nucleotide variants were rare and few were found in more than one individual. The level of diversity did not vary with vaccination status or antibody levels. Contrary to expectations, vaccination had little impact on intrah diversity in natural infection and vaccine immunity may be a minor contributor to antigen drift at local scales. The study did not find differences between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations in genome or antigen diversity over three H3N seasons.
Researchers studied the effectiveness of a weakened Leishmania donov parasite vaccine in mice of different ages. The parasite causes visceral leishmaniasis, a severe disease with no effective vaccine. Previous studies showed the weakened parasite induced strong immune response in young mice. This study compared immune response in young and aged mice. Analysis of immune cells from young and aged mice infected with weakened parasite showed enhanced response, especially CD4 T cell function. Weakened parasite also induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and down-regulated anti-inflammatory cytokines in young and aged mice. Immunized young and aged mice showed higher antibodies, lymphocyte response, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and leishmanicidal activity with nitric oxide production. Upon challenge, immunized mice had multifunctional Th-type CD and cytotoxic T cells, reduced parasite burden in spleen and liver. However, aged mice had reduced response and less protection compared to young.
Researchers studied how two types of viruses, enteric and enteroviruses (EVs), that cause different diseases in humans despite being genetically similar. They found that EVs have different properties, such as sensitivity to acid, optimal growth temperature, and where they replicate in the body, which affect their ability to cause disease. To understand these differences, they created chimeras, or hybrids, between EV-D68, a respiratory virus, and EV94, an enteric virus. Some chimeras were non-functional, but one with EV94's capsid and EV68's protease was viable. Using this, they found that capsid proteins determine acid sensitivity and tropism in cells and tissues, including respiratory and intestinal. Capsid genes also affect optimal growth, as EV94 adapts to temperature with VP1 mutation, while EV68 can't adapt to higher temperatures. They showed EV68 retains binding capacity after acid treatment, but loses infectivity. Non-structural proteins modulate immune response in tissues. This study reveals another layer of diversity in one of the world's most prevalent pathogens, aiding vaccine and antiviral development.
Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gE-I is a receptor on the surface of infected cells and viruses that binds human immunoglobulin G (Ig). It can also participate in antibody bridging (ABB), a process where antibody fragments (Fab) of IgG bind viral antigen while Fc binds to gE-I. IgFc binds gE at basic, but not acidic pH, suggesting Ig bound extracellular surface gE would dissociate and degrade in acidic endosomes/lysosomes if endocytosed. The fate of viral antigens with gE-bound Ig was unknown: could remain surface or endocyt with Ig. Researchers created an in vitro system to study ABB and trafficking using 4-D confocal imaging of A complexes with transferrin or epidermal growth, characterized intracellular markers. Data showed cells expressing gE and viral HSV-1 endocyt antiD Ig and g in gE-dependent, resulting lysosomal localization. This suggests gE can mediate clearance of infected surfaces of anti-viral host Ig and viral antig to evade Ig-mediated responses, a mechanism for viral evasion and pathogenesis.
Researchers have studied the genetic makeup of a parasite that causes a disease called cystic hydatid, which affects humans and animals worldwide. They looked at the part of the parasite that interacts with hosts, called protoscole, to understand how it adapts to its environment and evades the immune system. Using advanced technology, they analyzed the genetic material released by the parasite, called excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs), and found many involved in metabolism, such as breaking down carbohydrates and proteins. Some ESPs were enzymes that regulate energy production, while others were involved in signaling pathways that help the parasite grow and develop. The study also found ESPs that help the parasite interact with hosts, such as insulin and TGF-beta pathways. This research provides new information on how the parasite adapts to hosts, which can aid in developing new treatments for the disease.
In the fungus Aspergillus nidans, the protein NirA plays a crucial role in regulating the assimilation of nitrate, a key nitrogen source in soil. When nitrate is present, NirA accumulates in the nucleus and activates transcription of genes involved in nit assimilation. However, when nitrate is absent, Nir moves to the cytosol and is inactive. Researchers used mass spectrometry to find that a specific methine in Nir's export sequence, Met169, is oxidized to Metox when nit is absent. This oxidation depends on Fmo, a flav-containing monxygen, which uses methine and cystine but not glutathione as substrates. The function of Fmo cannot be replaced by other proteins in A. nidans. Exposure to nit leads to rapid reduction of Nir-Met169 to Met, independent of thiorexin and methine sulfox reductases. Replacing Met169 with ileucine, a similar but not oxidizable residue, leads to partial loss of Nir activity and insensitivity to Fmo. In contrast, replacing Met with alanine makes the protein permanently nuclear and active. Studies show that Met oxidation changes Nir's conformation and leads to exposure of its activation domain. In the presence of nit, the domain is exposed but masked by a portion of the protein, restricting Nir to the nucleus. In absence of nit, Met is oxidized, leading to loss of protection and relocation to the cyol.
Researchers studied how functional constraints shape the evolution of voltage-gated sodium channels in mammals. These channels allow action potentials to propagate. Since the 1950s, mathematical models suggested that sodium channel properties must be tightly constrained for this to happen. There are nine mammalian genes encoding sodium channels, many of which are 90% identical in sequence. This similarity suggests their properties are similar, consistent with the idea they must be tightly constrained. However, having many genes raises the question: why are there so many? The researchers found that two constraints - membrane excitability and unique resting potential - directly shape sodium properties. They compared predicted constraints with data on mammalian channel properties from 172 sets of measurements from 40 publications, wild and mutant, under various conditions. Data from all channels, including mutants, obeyed the excitability constraint. On the other hand, channels in muscle obeyed the resting constraint, while those in neuronal did not. Excitability alone distinguished channels into four groups consistent with phylogenetic analysis. Calculations suggest functional differences between these groups.
Scientists have been searching for new ways to treat serious flu infections that are resistant to current treatments. A key part of the flu virus, called the polymerase, is a good target for new drugs because it can stop the virus from replicating early on. The polymer is made up of three parts, PA, PB1, and PB2, and researchers have studied these parts to find a way to stop the virus. One part, called the endonuc domain, can be targeted to stop the virus from making copies of itself. A team of researchers looked at the enduc domain of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 flu virus and how it binds to specific inhibitors, or blockers. They used X-ray crystal structures to see how four different compounds, including a green tea compound, bind to the enduc. The results show how different parts of the blocker can fit into the active site and how the site can change to fit the blocker. This will help design better blockers to stop the virus from making copies. This is important for developing new treatments that target the virus's replication.
Researchers have developed a new method to produce a single antivenom that can treat bites from three types of venomous snakes: the White-lipped viper, Malayan viper, and Russell's viper. These snakes are common in Thailand and neighboring countries and cause 1.8 million bites and 94,000 deaths annually. The new antiven is made by immunizing horses with a mixture of the three venoms using a "low dose, low multi-site" method. The antiven showed high levels of antibodies against all three venoms and effectively neutralized their deadly effects. The antiven was more potent than the standard antiven made for each snake separately. This method could save lives by treating bites without knowing the snake species.
Researchers have found that a protein called Sse, produced by the Salmonella bacteria, helps the bacteria to stay in the body for a long time by stopping the movement of immune cells called macrophages and dendritic cells. These cells are important for fighting off infections, but when they can't move properly, the body can't get rid of the bacteria. Sse works by binding to a host protein called IQAP, which helps with cell movement. Without S, the bacteria can't stay in the body for as long and the immune system can clear them out. The study found that mice infected with Salmonella that couldn't make S had fewer immune cells in their spleen compared to those that could make S. This shows that S is important for Salmonella's ability to stay in the body.
Researchers have found that a genetic element called SCCmec plays a key role in making Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) less virulent. MRSA is a type of bacteria that can cause severe disease in healthy individuals and is more virulent than hospital-associated MRSA. The element SCCec is found in most hospital MRSA but not community-acquired MR. The element contains a gene called psmec that suppresses the production of a toxin called phenol-sol-soluble modulin (PSM), which is a toxin of S. aureus. The researchers found that p-m RNA binds to a gene called agr, which codes for a factor that makes PSM, and inhibits its translation. They also found that 25% of MRSA isolates had a mutation in the p-m promoter that reduced transcription and 9% had no p-m. Most of these strains with mutated or deleted p-m produced more PSM than those with intact p-m and some produced as much as community-acquired MR. Deletion of p-m from MRSA with intact p increased expression of Agr and PSM and virulence in mice. The study suggests p-m RNA suppresses MR virulence by inhibiting agr translation and absence of p-m in community-acquired MR causes its high virulence.
Researchers have studied a phenomenon called antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) in mice that occurs when mothers pass on antibodies to their babies that don't neutralize the deng virus. This can make the babies more susceptible to severe disease when they get infected with the virus. In a previous study, mice born to mothers with antibodies against one type of deng virus (DENV1) got sicker and died faster when infected with another type (DENV2) than those born to mothers with no antibodies. To replicate this, scientists used mice that can't make type I interferon, a protein that helps fight viruses, and found similar results. Now, they used mice that can't make type I interferon to see if ADE happens again. Mice born to mothers with DENV antibodies got sicker and died faster than those born to mothers with no antibodies. Symptoms included liver damage, blood vessel leakage, and low blood cell counts. Treatment with a protein that blocks inflammation saved the mice, but blocking another protein didn't affect the virus or disease. This model can help understand how deng works and test treatments.
Researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify factors associated with visceral leishmaniasis, a disease caused by the Leishmania infantum parasite, in the Americas. They analyzed 51 studies and found that male sex was linked to the disease when diagnosed with a skin test, but not when diagnosed with a blood test. Younger individuals were less likely to be infected but more prone to illness. Presence of dogs at home, higher dog seropositivity nearby, lower socioeconomic status, and vegetated areas were associated with infection. However, presence of chickens at home and nutritional status were not linked. The study highlights the importance of dogs as a marker for visceral leishias occurrence in humans. This is the first review of its kind in the Americas, clarifying some aspects of the disease dynamics and raising new questions. The findings cannot be applied to other contexts due to the disease's unique characteristics. A review of risk factors in Asia showed similar patterns, but results cannot be used for American leishmanias.
Inhaling the bacteria Francisella tularens (Ft) causes a deadly form of pneumonia, known as tularemia. Researchers wanted to understand why this infection is so fatal. They found that the body's initial response to the bacteria, not the number of bacteria itself, is the main cause of death. When a small amount of F. tularens is inhaled, a large number of immature immune cells called myeloid and myeloid suppressor cells (IM/MD) are recruited to the lungs. These cells fail to mature and die, leading to lung damage, loss of function, and death. This process is partly due to a specific type of cell called Ly6+. In contrast, when a smaller amount of F. tulare is inhaled, mature immune cells like neutrophils and monocytes are recruited, which help protect the body. The study suggests that the type of immune response, not the number of bacteria, determines survival or death in tularem.
Aedes albopict, the Asian tiger mosquito, is an invasive species that spreads rapidly and can transmit diseases such as chikungunya, deng, and Zika viruses. Understanding its colonization pattern is crucial to mitigating its spread and disease risks. Researchers used genetic analysis to study the history of Aedes populations in Southeast Asia and recently colonized areas. They found that in Southeast Asia, populations from China, Thailand, and Japan have low differentiation and high co-ancestry, indicating a common origin and high connectivity. China is the oldest population. Outside Asia, invasion in La Reunion, America, and the Mediterranean is supported by chaotic distribution, maintaining high diversity in advent populations. Independent introductions may have facilitated establishment through admixture of unrelated genomes, resulting in high intra-population variability. This may extend to genetic mechanisms controlling virus transmission. In the invasion context, ancestry and admixture create conditions for efficient virus transmission and outbreaks. The study provides origins of populations from Asia, the Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Pacific islands, and America, valuable for models predicting risk of outbreaks. The spread occurred under different conditions, varying competence between eco-geographic populations due to genetic and environmental interactions. Knowledge is crucial for assessing risk in old and new areas where Aedes has established.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes chronic infections in wounds and found that its ability to grow in high-density, not its virulence or biofilm functions, is key to its fitness. They analyzed isolates from human wounds and found that many were defective in virulence and biofilm formation, and that these functions were not required for bacterial fitness in mouse wounds. In contrast, genes involved in anaerobic growth, metabolism, energy, and membrane integrity were critical. This suggests that bacteria in wounds may be stressed by their own growth conditions, not the host. The study sheds light on bacterial functions in chronic infections and stresses in wounds, and suggests potential targets to prevent infection. 

The researchers tested the importance of virulence and biofilm functions in wounds and identified genes that mediate bacterial fitness in mouse wounds. They found that many virulence functions were inactivated in human isolates and only one affected bacterial fitness in mouse wounds. This raises the possibility that stresses in wounds are applied by bacteria, not the host. The study also shows the role of biofilms in chronic infections and that isolates that infect humans are often bio-deficient in vitro. The findings suggest that wounds may be permissive environments for bacterial growth, not requiring invasive or toxic functions. A permissive environment could explain why low-virulence organisms inhabit wounds. The study used diabetic mice, a key factor in human pathogenesis, and P aeruginosa inhibited wound-healing, linking infection to disease.
Chronic hydrocele is the most common manifestation of bancroian filariasis, a disease affecting 80 countries worldwide. Researchers studied 1,128 patients with unilateral or bilateral hydrocele in a bancrofilariasis-endemic area and compared them to 218 patients who had undergone hydrocele-sparing hydrocelectomy elsewhere. After a mean follow-up of 8.6 years, hydro recurrence rates were 0.3% in the first group and 19.3% in the comparison group (p<0.001). The testicles were abnormal in shape, volume, and consistency in 18% and 35.7% of patients, respectively (p=0.025). Lymph fluid from dilated lymphatic vessels is a key component of chronic hydrocele fluid threatening the testis integrity in bancrofilari-endemic areas. To prevent recurrence, complete excision of hydrocele and suture or excision of leaking vessels is advised.
Researchers have identified a key enzyme in the parasite Trichella spiralis, a zoonotic nematode that causes trichlosis, a disease found on all continents except Antarctica. The enzyme, called Ts37, is a deubiquinating enzyme that helps break down proteins in the parasite's cells. It is similar to a human enzyme, UCH5, and has been found to interact with other proteins in the parasite's proteome, or set of proteins. This interaction has been conserved, or remained the same, throughout evolution. The researchers also found that a compound, LD-44, can inhibit Ts37 and reduce the parasite's viability. This suggests that deubiquating enzymes may play a role in the parasite's biology and could be a target for treatment.
Researchers have been searching for new ways to treat Chagas disease, a tropical illness caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. One potential target is the enzyme cruzain, a cysteine protease that the parasite uses to survive. A new compounds, nitrile-based cystine inhibitors, were tested for anti-tryosomal activity against the parasite. Two compounds showed strong activity, with EC50 values of 0.12 and 0.25 micromolar, significantly lower than against cruzain, a related enzyme. This suggests the compounds may work by targeting other cystine proteases, not just cruzain. Another group of compounds, based on a cyclohexane dicarbox scaffold, were also tested. Their anti-tryosomal activity was greater than expected from their cruzain inhibition, indicating they may target other cystine proteases. The study questions the relevance of cruzain inhibition as a predictor of anti-tryosomal activity. Chagas is a validated target for treatment, with previous studies showing efficacy of cystine inhibitors in animal models. The results suggest new compounds may have a polypharmacological profile, targeting multiple cystine proteases. The cystine inhibition profile suggests a new target may share characteristics with catheps K, and phenic screening for antag agents should include inhibitors of this enzyme.
Scientists have created a detailed map of the physical structure of the maize genome, a crucial for understanding its evolution and domestication. The map covers 93.5% of the genome, with 86.1% aligned to a genetic map. It contains 25,908 genetic markers, allowing 73% of the genome to be aligned to the rice genome. Sequence tags show recombination patterns, with 1 kb in rice corresponding to 3.2 kb in maize. Maize has a 6-fold larger genome size due to its polyploid origin, with most regions corresponding to two in maize. Inversions account for most chromosome variations during diploidization. Ancient genome duplication occurred before maize and rice divergence. Reconstructing the maize genome's past shows its progenitors had 10 chromosomes.

Comparing genomes revealed chromosome organization of progenitors contributing to polloid, rearrangements and diploid, and homologous regions. RFLP mapping showed two maize chromosomes aligning with one in rice and sorghum, a whole genome duplication. Table 3 lists primary and secondary duplications in maize. Average 3 copies per over (Table 2) support tetraploid emergence. Rice duplications are not limited to its ancestor. Fingerprint size is similar to the rice map. A genetic map was developed to anchor and orient contigs along chromosomes. Multiple events contribute to maize duplication, recent easier to identify than ancient. Synteny shows rearrangements since maize and rice divergence.
Scientists have long believed that prions, the infectious agents responsible for transmissible spong encephalopathies, are composed of misfolded versions of the prion protein (PrP) that replicate in the body without nucleic acids by inducing misfolding of cellular protein (Pr). The most common form of human prion disease, sporadic, is thought to originate from a low frequency of spontaneous misfolding generating the first PrP particle that propagates as the infectious form of disease. Researchers attempted to mimic the early etiology of sporadic disease by de novo generation of infectious PrSc in vitro. They analyzed the possibility of spontaneous generation PrSc by protein misfolding amplification (PM) procedure. Under standard PM conditions, de novo generation of PrSc was not observed, supporting its use for diagnostic applications. However, PM was modified to generate PrSc in absence of pre-existing Pr in different species at low and variable rate. De generated PrSc was infectious when inoculated into wild hamsters, producing new disease with unique clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features.
Researchers have developed a new model called the Angular Velocity Unit (AV) that can estimate the angular velocity of a bee's movement, which is the rate of rotation of its visual field of view. This model can explain behaviors that were not previously understood, such as how bees deviate from the center when navigating a corridor with different patterns on the walls. The model is based on electrophysiological data and tested with behavioral data. It suggests that the AV is an extension of the optomotor response, a pathway in the bee's brain that helps with movement. The model was tested in a virtual environment where bees fly through a corridor with different patterns on the walls. When combined with an existing control algorithm, it replicates the bee's flight path invariance to pattern frequency and contrast, including deviations from centering. The model also shows a constant response to movement along the corridor for a range of pattern frequencies, suggesting it can be used as a visual odometer.
Untreated Infections by Trypanosoma brucei gambense Are Not 100% Fatal

Researchers have long believed that infection with Trypanosoma brucei gambense, the parasite that causes African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness, is always fatal. However, a new study in the Ivory Coast found that 10 out of 11 people who refused treatment after being diagnosed with the disease showed no signs of the parasite in their blood after 15 years. Most of these people also had lower levels of antibodies against the parasite, indicating their immune system was fighting the infection. Some even showed no signs of the parasite or antibodies after a long time, similar to people who received treatment.

The study followed 50 people with trypanomiasis from the Ivory Coast who refused treatment after diagnosis. Researchers used sensitive tests to detect the parasite and antibodies in their blood. They found two types of natural progressions of the disease: one where people had no signs of the parasite but high levels of antibodies, and another where people had no signs of parasite or antibodies. This is different from the classic fatal outcome of trypaniasis.

The study does not know how common these alternative progressions are, but it shows that some people can live with the disease without treatment. This is important for controlling the disease in the field, where some people test positive for antibodies but not the parasite. Recognizing that humans can tolerate the parasite, like animals do, is a step forward for future research on trypanias.
Researchers investigated how ionizing radiation affects the development of cancer in mice. They focused on the role of the p53 gene, a tumor suppressor that helps protect cells from damage. When p53 is missing, cells are more likely to become cancerous. The team wanted to see if radiation selects for cells without p53, making them more likely to become cancerous. They used mice with and without p53 and exposed them to radiation. Without radiation, p53 didn't give an advantage. But with radiation, p53-deficient cells grew more and more cancer developed. This was due to several factors: protection from radiation damage, keeping stem cells alive, preventing loss of ability to make new cells, and eliminating healthy cells with p53. The study suggests radiation's cancer-causing effect is partly due to selecting cells without p53, which protects them from radiation damage.
Researchers have discovered a protein called SmKI-1 in the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, a type of flatworm that causes schistosomiasis in humans. This protein acts as a serine protease inhibitor, which means it blocks the activity of enzymes called trypsin and neutrophil elastase. These enzymes are important for the body's defense against infection and inflammation. The study found that Sm-1's Kunit domain, a part of the protein, blocks the active site of neutil elastase, preventing it from working. This could be a way the parasite evades the body's immune system. The researchers also showed that Sm-1 reduces the ability of neutils to kill the parasite. To understand its role, they knocked down the Sm-1 gene in the parasite and found it affected its development. They tested Sm-1's ability to reduce inflammation in mouse models of diseases, such as liver damage and arthritis, and found it reduced neutil recruitment and enzyme activity. In another model, it reduced inflammation and pain. Sm-1 also blocked neutil recruitment in response to injury. The study suggests Sm-1 is crucial for parasite survival and has potential as a therapeutic against inflammatory diseases.
Researchers have developed a new method to accurately model high-resolution structures of transmembrane helix (TM) proteins from distant homologues with distinct loop and TM conformations. These proteins are crucial for various cellular functions, but their structures are largely uncharacterized and hard to predict due to lack of close structural homologues. The method was tested on 50 TM protein pairs with diverse topology, size, and sequence identity, and achieved near-atomic accuracy in membrane-embedded regions. It outperformed starting templates and is suitable for computer-based protein engineering, redesigned and X-ray structures showed similar interactions. The technique was validated in two blind predictions and a benchmark of membrane homolog pairs with wide diversity. It ranked first in predictions for full receptor accuracy and improved starting templates to reach atomic prediction in TM regions. The method was applied to adenosine receptor AAR and chemokine CX4 receptors in GPCRDO blind contests. The closest template to AAR was beta 1 adrenerg receptor with 32 sequence identity and excellent alignment in TM region, no remodeling needed. However, results suggest method useful for rebuilding and refining X-ray receptors with missing or deleted loop densities. The accuracy of models may not reflect method's ability due to ICL loop mistake in B template, preventing all-atom refinement.
Listeria monocytogen, the bacterium that causes listeriosis, a foodborne disease that poses serious risks to fetuses, newborns, and immunocompromised adults, has been found to change its behavior during infection in human cells. Initially, it proliferates in the cytos and exploits the host's actin polymer machinery to spread from cell-to-cell and disseminate in the host. However, after several days of infection in human hepatocytes or trophlast cells, it switches to a stage of persistence in vacoles. The bacteria stop producing the actin-nucle protein Act and become trapped in lysosome-like vacoles called Lister-Containing Vacoles (Lis). Some bacteria resist degradation in Lis and enter a slow-replicative state. When Act is absent, as in ΔAct mutants, vacolar bacteria parasitize host cells in a "viable but non-culturable" (VB) state, making them undetectable by conventional counting. Exposure to high doses of gentamicin does not trigger Lis formation but selects for vacolar and VB bacteria. These results show L monocogen's ability to enter a persistent state in epithelial cells, favoring asymptomatic carriage, lengthening incubation of listiosis and bacterial survival during therapy.
Researchers have developed a new model to understand how our brains process sound patterns of high and low-pitched tones that repeat in a specific order, such as A-B-A-B-A-B. This pattern can create two different perceptions: a single stream of A-B-A-B-A-B or separate streams of A and B. People may switch between these perceptions over time. The model combines brain cell activity and sound experiments to study these switches and how changing the tone difference between A and B affects the dominant perception. The model shows that the stronger tone should be perceived more often than the weaker, which has been found in other studies. Experiments confirmed this prediction and helped improve the model. The model can be used to study other sound patterns and how context affects perception. 

The model is based on brain studies of sound processing and perception. It includes how brain cells respond to sound and how they compete to create perception. It also includes how brain cells talk to each other over time to link sounds. Perceptions are found in brain cell activity, not assumed beforehand. The model can be used to study how attention affects sound perception in the future.
Researchers have developed a new method to assess the allergenicity of Schistosoma mansoni proteins using a humanized Ratophil Leukemia (RSAT8) cell line. This cell line is used to detect IgE responses, which are thought to be linked to protection against S. mansoni infection. The method involves translating S. mans proteins in a wheat germ extract and testing them on the RSAT8 cell line. The cell's response is measured by luciferase activity, indicating activation by the allergen. The method was tested with known allergens such as Par 2, SmAL-1, and IgE factor SE/alpha-1, expressed in wheat and E. coli. coli. SmAL-1, but not SmAL2, activated the cell line. This method is suitable for high-throughput studies of S. mans allergens and could lead to a better understanding of the allergome, the set of all allergens of a parasite. It may also help unravel the relationship between parasite-specific Ig and host protection at the molecular level.
Researchers studied the effects of transposable elements (TEs) on gene expression in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly, when parents have different TE profiles. They found that when TEs from the father are not present in the mother's genome, they can become active in the offspring, causing germline damage and sterility. Using D. virilis as a model, they showed that divergence in TE profile between parents leads to differences in germl expression in offspring, which are transmitted to the next generation. They also found that chronic TE expression is associated with increased levels of piRNAs that reduce gene expression. Additionally, they demonstrated that gene expression is influenced by differences in piRNA profile of parents due to polymorphic TE insertions. These results support a model where early germl events establish a stable state of TE and gene expression in germl maintained through adulthood and transmitted to next generation. This study shows that TE divergence is associated with piRNA-mediated transgener effects on gene expression within populations.
Fragile X Syndrome (FXT) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CG repeat expansion in the 5'UTR of the FMR1 gene. Researchers found that overexpressing three histone deacetylases (HD3, 6, or 11) suppresses CG repeat-induced neurodegeneration in a Drosila model of FXT. This suppression is due to selective transcriptional repression of the CG repeat-containing gene. The study suggests that the CG repeat induces changes in histone acetylation at the F1 locus, leading to increased F1 expression and neurodegeneration. In human cell lines from Fragile X patients, there is increased acetylation of histones at the F1 locus compared to control lines. This epigenetic change correlates with elevated F1 expression. Histone acetylase inhibitors repress F1 to control levels in Fragile carrier lines and extend lifespan in CG-repeat Dila. The findings support a model where the CG repeat promotes chromatin remodeling, increasing toxic F1 expression.
Researchers have found that genetics play a crucial role in controlling CD8 T cell function and immunopathology during chronic viral infection. CD8 T cells are vital for controlling chronic viral infections, but factors such as host genetics and immune response contribute to their effectiveness. Specific MHC alleles and degree of MHC heterogeneity are associated with CD8 cell function and viral control during human infection. To examine the impact of M heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on chronic infection, mice were infected with lymphocytic choriomitis virus (LCMV). Mice with increased viral control compared to homozygous mice. Strikingly, mice on C57 genetic background succumbed to infection. CD T depletion prevented mortality in infected mice, indicating mortality was T-cell dependent. Mice maintained T effector cytokine production and reduced T exhaustion marker PD-1. Also, mice induced larger T response than mice and mortality in mice was dependent T-mediated IF-γ production. Results indicate increasing M heterogeneity results in CD T frequency during chronic infection. Mice on C57 background succumbed to infection. Mice mounted higher T response than mice determined by cells upregulating CD and downregulating CD. Both environment and M diversity contribute T-dependent clearance and mortality in mice.
Researchers studied the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis, the bacteria that causes anthrax, in northwestern China from 1990 to 2016. They analyzed 106 strains from six provinces, including Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jiangsu, and Yunn. The study found five subgroups of B. anthracis, A. Br.001/002, A. Br. Voll, A. Aust, A. Br. Ames, and A. Br.008/009. All subgroups were found in Xinjiang, while one in Shaanxi, two in Gans, three Qinghai, and four in Inner Mongolia. However, the distribution of B. anthrac populations showed different characteristics from strains isolated before 1990 in China. A. Br Ames was also found in Inner Mongolia and other provinces. The researchers used two methods, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and multilocus-number tandem repeat (MLVA) with 15 markers to analyze the strains. They found 36 MLVA genotypes, 21 of which were new. Strains from recent anthrax outbreaks were classified as subgroups A. Br.001 and A. Ames with genotypes MLVA-28, ML-30, ML-31, ML-38, ML-CH3, and MLCH18. The study found diversification of ML genotypes and distribution of B anthrac populations is becoming balanced in northwestern China.
Researchers studied how the body defends against a type of bacteria called Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, which can cause severe diarrhea and colon infections. They found that a type of immune cell called goblet cells play a key role in this defense. Goblet cells produce a mediator called REL-β, which recruits CD4 T cells to the infected area. CD4 cells help goblet cells to multiply and fight the infection. Without REL-β, mice were more likely to die from the infection and had worse damage to their intestines. The researchers found that REL- didn't directly make gob cells multiply, but instead attracted CD4 cells to the area. Without REL- mice had fewer CD4 cells and less of a cytokine called IL-22, which helps gob cells multiply. Giving REL- to these mice restored CD4 cells and IL-22, and reduced damage. This shows that goblet cells and RELβ are important in recruiting CD4 cells to fight off the bacteria.
Researchers have discovered a crucial interaction between a specific part of the norovirus protein (VPg) and a part of a host cell protein (eIF4) that is essential for translation initiation of the virus's genetic material. Noroviruses are a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans and have an unusual mechanism of protein synthesis that relies on interactions between VP and eukotic factors in the host cell. The study focused on murine norirus (MNV) and found that VP binds to a middle part of e4 (residues 652-113). Further analysis showed that a 20 amino acids at the end of MN VP mediate direct and specific binding to the HE-1 domain of e4. This interaction is conserved in all noriruses and involves a helical conformation. NMR spectroscopy defined the binding site on e4, confirmed by mutagenesis and binding assays. The site is non-overlapping with the binding for e4 on e1, showing norirus VP can form ternary VP-e4-e4 complexes. Fusion proteins containing the C-terminal of MN VP inhibited in vitro translation of norirus but not cap or I-dependent. This defines structural and functional details of interaction norirus VP and e4 and a potential target for antiviral therapy.
Scientists have long wondered why genes that work together in the same process are often found near each other on a bacterial chromosome. Several ideas have been proposed to explain this. One idea is that natural selection favors clusters because they work better together. Another is the selfish operon model, which says clusters are more likely to be passed to other species, helping them survive. A third idea is the persistence model, which says genes near each other are less likely to be deleted. Researchers created computer models to study when clusters can evolve. They tested the selfish model under many conditions and found it doesn't always work. They also looked at a model where selection for clustering happens through gene rearrangements and a model with selection and rearrangements. Surprisingly, clusters don't evolve under many conditions. Factors that help clusters form are few genes in a pathway, big population, and for selfish model, high transfer rate. The study shows clusters can evolve with direct or indirect selection under certain conditions. The selfish model still explains clusters under these conditions.

The operon model can't explain why genes in clusters are in order of reactions. Another idea is horizontal transfer of operons. Researchers re-examined the basis for clusters. They studied different models and found conditions for clustering. The persistence model doesn't need selection and explains clusters of essential genes. It says clustered genes are less likely to be deleted. The selfish model proposes clusters without selection and applies to non-essential genes. Researchers created a model with a Moran process and genome inversion. They tracked a population of bacteria with 3 or more genes. The population started with all same genome and genes randomly placed. The population size was. Clusters didn't evolve under used parameters. They re-examined the selfish model to find conditions. Varying parameters showed the effect on distance.
Malaria, caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical regions worldwide. Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to severe consequences of the infection due to the adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by a variant of Pf1, a parasite-encoded antigen on the surface of infected cells. The variant, VARCS, binds to chroit sulfate on syncyotrophlasts in the intervillous space of placent. VARCS is only expressed in the presence of placenta, suggesting its expression is repressed in men or non-pregnant women, but the mechanism is not understood. Researchers found that the gene encoding VARCS contains a small open reading frame that represses translation of the mRNA, a novel form of regulation in malaria parasites. This mechanism is reversible, allowing high levels of protein upon selection, enabling parasites to upregulate the antigen in host tissue.

 Studies on VARCS expression and protein in general will provide insights into host-parasite interactions underlying the disease. The 5 leader of VARCS transcripts from parasites and pregnant women revealed the open frame is not spliced and present in mRNA, indicating VARCS is a bicronic transcript. This suggests additional regulation of Pf1 variant with pregnancy, preventing expression when plac is not available. VARCS can be detected in non-pregn individuals, including children and men, suggesting post-transcription mechanisms in these, lower immune exposure. A proteomic study detected VARCS in parasites non-plental and earlier study CSA-binding parasites non-pregn hosts. The parasite genome contains 60 genes varying between isolates, VARCS conserved in most, if not all isolates.
Researchers studied blood samples from 34 children in Nicaragua infected with the deng virus (DENV) to understand why some develop severe symptoms while others do not. They analyzed the genes expressed in the blood cells and found differences between those with and without severe symptoms, especially in proteins involved in energy production and immune response. In patients with hemorrhagic fever, certain genes related to fighting infection were more active. Combining their data with previous studies, they found that ENV infection affects metabolism and protein and nucleic acid production. In contrast, lab experiments showed an interferon response, but this was not seen in patient samples, suggesting it's short-lived. The study highlights differences between severe and non-severe cases and identifies commonalities, suggesting a systems approach could predict disease outcome.
Herpesviruses, a type of virus that causes disease, are hard to get rid of once they're inside the body. To stop them from getting in, scientists need to understand how they enter the body. Herpesviruses have been studied in the lab, but how they enter mucus-covered surfaces in the body is unclear. Researchers studied Murid Herpesvirus-4 (Mu-4), a virus related to the one that causes Kaposi's Sarcoma, and found it targets the olfactory epithelium, the part of the nose that senses smells. Like other herpesviruses, Mu-4 binds to a molecule called heparan sulfate (HS). Without HS, the virus can't get in. The olfactory epithelium has HS on its surface and the virus uses it to get in. The virus goes down the cilia, tiny hair-like structures, and infects the neurons or the cells that support them. The olfactory epithelium is a key entry point for herpesviruses.

 Mu-4 infects neurons even though it's not supposed to, and the olfactory epithelium might be a way for herpesviruses to get in. HS is thought to just help the virus stick to the surface, but it's also important for Mu-4 to get in. This suggests that targeting HS in the olfactory epithelium could stop herpesviruses from getting in. The study used Mu-4 to see how HS, virus binding, and infection work together in the body. They found that the virus infects the cells that support the neurons, not just the neurons. The olfactory epithel has different types of cells: neurons that sense smell, cells that support, and precursor cells.
Scientists have discovered a new way that the bacterium Salmonella regulates its ability to invade human cells. This regulation happens at the post-transcription level, meaning it doesn't affect how genes are made, but how they are used. A protein called CRP-c is a key player in this process. Without CR-c, Salmonella produces too many genes that help it invade cells, making it less virulent. Researchers found that CR-c affects a master regulator called Hil, which controls invasion. This happens through a specific part of Hil's genetic code called the 3'UTR. Another player, a small RNA called Spot 42, is also controlled by CR-c and helps Hil. Spot 42 targets Hil's 3'UT, making it more active. This is important for Salmon's ability to invade cells. The study shows that CR-c is crucial for Salmon's virulence and helps it adapt to changing conditions.
Researchers studied the expansion of CAG/CT repeats, which causes diseases like Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy 1, to understand why they become unstable in certain tissues and accelerate disease progression. They used two mouse lines, R6 and R/2, with similar transgenes integrated at different sites, to investigate the relationship between CAG instability, chromatin, and transcription at the Huntington's disease (HD) locus. The results show that instability is higher in R2 tissues compared to R1, and correlates with high gene expression and chromatin accessibility. High levels of gene expression and histone marks, such as H3 trimylation, were found in R2 tissues, while H9 dimethylation was reduced. However, levels of gene expression and histone marks were similar in striatum and cerebellum, two tissues with different instability levels. Elongating RNA polymerase II at the locus, but not initiating form, was tissue-specific and correlated with instability. H3 trimylation, a mark of transcription, was increased at locus in striatum but not cerebellum. The study suggests transcription modulates somatic C instability and elongation is tissue-dependent, contributing to tissue-selective instability.
Enterovirus 71 (EV) is a highly virulent virus, but the specific features that allow it to spread in humans are unknown. Researchers analyzed the virus in immunocompromised patients with disseminated disease at different infection sites. They compared full-length sequenced genomes from respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous, and blood specimens and found three nucleotide changes within five days: a non-conservative amino acid in VP1 within the loop (LR), a region considered immunogenic and important in poliovirus adaptation; a amino substitution in protein 2 (AV); and a mutation in protein (L). Infectious clones were constructed using Br (A) and clinical (C) backgrounds with one or both nonsyn mutations. In vitro tropism and competition revealed VP1 Leu to Arg substitution within loop conferred replicative in SHY5Y neuroblastoma cells. This mutation was associated with second non-cons mutation (EG or EA) in VP1 loop in neuroblast cells. Models of EV71 VP variants were built to determine how substitutions affect VP structure and host interactions. No significant changes were observed, but substitutions may alter interactions with cell receptors. Results show VP1 loop of EV plays critical role in tropism independent of lineage, contributing to dissemination and neurotrop in immunocompromised patients.
Scientists have long known that bacteria can take in DNA from their surroundings, a process called natural transformation, which helps them quickly gain new traits like antibiotic resistance. This is especially important for disease-causing bacteria. In the genus Streptoccus, a type of bacteria, genes for this ability are controlled by a system called quorum sensing, which uses peptides to communicate. One such system, ComRS, involves a peptide Com that's broken down, secreted, and enters the cell where it activates a protein ComR. Com then turns on a feedback loop to make more Com and another protein. ComRS is found in most Streptoccus species, but the Com and Com parts are different, suggesting a way for species to talk to each other. To study this, researchers created a test to see how different Com proteins react to their own and other species' peptides. They found three types: strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity. They also solved the structure of Com from one species to see how it interacts with peptides. By looking at this, they found a spot on Com where peptides bind and how it's different in each species. This helps understand how Com recognizes peptides and predict new ones that can turn it on.
Researchers have studied how centromeres, the specific sites on chromosomes where DNA replicates, in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans. Unlike other eukaryotes, centeres in C. albicans are epetically inherited, meaning their position is determined by epigenetic mechanisms rather than DNA sequence. The team found that each centere is associated with a replication origin that fires first on its respective chromosome, and epetic formation of new centeres (neocromeres) is accompanied by changes in replication timing. Neoceres become the first to replicate and are associated with origin complex (ORC) components. Changing the level of centere-specific histone H isoform led to changes in OR association with centere regions, supporting the idea that centere proteins determine origin activity. Analysis of centere-associated DNA revealed a replication pattern characteristic of constitutively active origins. This pattern is conserved with centere position among strains and species, independent of DNA sequence. The study suggests that timing of DNA replication is an epetic mechanism for inheritance of centere position.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors contributing to chronic back pain, a leading cause of disability worldwide. They analyzed data from 158,025 individuals of European ancestry, including 29,531 with chronic back pain cases and 128,494 controls. The study found a significant association with a variant in the SOX5 gene, which was replicated in an additional 283,752 participants and exceeded genome-wide significance. Two other loci, CC26/GMC and DCC, also reached genome-wide significance in a joint analysis. This is the first genome-wide association study for chronic pain and identifies a genetic link to the SO5 gene.
Taenia solium cysticosis is a neglected zoonotic disease that affects humans and pigs in many developing countries, particularly in West Cameroon. The disease is underreported due to its various symptoms and lack of diagnostic tools in endemic areas. A study was conducted to estimate the burden of the disease in Cameroon using cost and Disability Adjusted Life (DAL) Year estimations. The prevalence of epilepsy was 3.6% and the number of people with neurocystercosis-associated epilepsy was estimated at 50,326, representing 1% of the population. The number of pigs with cysticosis was 15,961, which is 5.6% of the pig population. The total cost of Taenia solium cystosis in Cameroon was estimated at €10,255,202, with 4.7% due to losses in pig husbandry and 95.3% to direct and indirect losses from human cystosis. The cost per case was €194. The number of DALs lost was 9.0 per thousand per year. This study provides an estimation of the burden of Taenia solium cystosis using country-specific parameters, including human and animal disease. A comparison with a study in South Africa shows salaries play a significant role in the monetary burden of Taenia solium cystosis. Knowing salary and prevalence can indicate the total cost of Taenia cystosis in a country. The estimated DALs lost were higher than other neglected diseases.
Researchers have discovered a small non-coding RNA called Rsa in Staphylococcus aureus, a type of bacteria that can cause infections in humans. They found that Rsa makes the bacteria less virulent, meaning less able to cause disease, by regulating a key regulator called mgrA. Rsa forms a special structure with the mRNA of mgr, preventing it from being translated into a protein. This leads to increased biofilm formation and decreased capsule production, making the bacteria more resistant to the immune system's attack. In animal models, Rsa reduced the severity of acute infections and increased chronic infections. Rsa is part of a network that helps S. aureus interact with the host, making it less invasive and more likely to cause chronic infections. This is the first example of a small RNA in S. aureus that reduces virulence. Since S. aureus is a common human commensal, it's thought that Rsa has evolved to help it coexist with the host without causing harm.
Scientists have developed a new way to visualize the process of HIV-1 uncoating, a crucial step in the virus's life cycle, using a fluorescently tagged protein called cyclophilin A-DRed (CA-DRed). This protein binds tightly to the HIV-1 capsid and remains associated with the core even after the viral membrane is removed, allowing researchers to track its loss in vitro and in living cells. The rate of loss is linked to the stability of the core and is accelerated when reverse transcription begins. Most cores lose CA-DRed shortly after fusion, but a small fraction remains intact for hours. Single particle tracking at late post-infection shows gradual loss of CA-DRed dependent on reverse transcription. Unating occurs in the cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane. The new assay enables time-resolved visualization of single HIV-1 unating in cells, revealing previously unknown spatial-temporal features of this process. The researchers improved the binding of CA to HIV-1 virions by increasing its avidity and fused it with a fluorescent protein to make it visible. The CA-DRed efficiently incorporates into HIV particles without affecting infectivity and reports the loss of CA during unating. The correlation between CA-D retention and caps stability supports that it reflects unating.
Researchers studied the patterns of oligonucleotide usage in bacterial and archaeal genomes to understand how information is encoded in DNA. They found that prokotic DNA can be described by hexanucle frequencies, suggesting that information is encoded in short oligonucleotides. Oligonucle usage varied more in AT-rich and host-associated genomes than GC-rich free-living genomes, mainly in non-coding regions. Bias in tetranucle usage correlated with GC content, with coding regions more biased than nonoding. Nonoding regions were 5.5% more AT-rich than coding, on average, in 402 examined chromosomes. Pronounced compositional differences were found within and between AT-rich and GC genomes. GC genomes were more similar in tetranucle usage nonoding than AT genomes. Differences may be due to lifestyle, as tetranucle usage host-associated was more dissimilar and less biased than freeiving archaea.
Scientists have discovered a new way that meiotic recombination, a process that helps mix and match DNA during reproduction, can be biased in favor of certain versions of a gene. This bias, called meiotic drive, can lead to one version of a gene becoming more common in a population over time. The researchers looked at six hotspots, areas where recombination happens often, and found that two of them showed a bias towards a specific type of recombination called noncrossover. This type of recombination is different from the more common type, crossover, and happens in a different way. The bias is thought to be due to differences in how the two versions of the gene pair up and how mistakes are fixed. This type of bias is not related to how recombination starts, but is a new source of drive that can affect many hotspots in the human genome. Interestingly, the bias favors certain base pairs, like G and C, over others, like A and T, which is consistent with how recombination is more common in areas with high G and C content in the genome. The study suggests this bias can contribute to how the genome's base composition changes over time.
Researchers have developed a new way to understand how chemicals in the environment can affect human health by creating a network of proteins and chemicals. This network helps identify which chemicals may cause diseases and which proteins they target. The method combines data from toxicology, biology, and protein interactions to predict connections between chemicals and diseases. It can also find unexpected links between chemicals and proteins. The researchers tested the method on chemicals linked to breast cancer, lung cancer, and necrosis, and identified potential targets for diethylhexylphthalate, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloribenzo-p-diox, pirix acid, and permethrin. The results were supported by recent studies, showing the power of integrating toxicogenomics data with other types of data. This approach can help develop systems to predict high-level associations between chemicals and diseases and detailed associations between chemicals and proteins. It's different from other computational biology methods that mainly use drug information to identify targets and link to diseases. The researchers used the Comparative Toxicogen Database, which contains curated data on chemicals and proteins associated with diseases. They selected 42,194 associations between 2,490 compounds and 6,060 proteins involved in human diseases. To predict which chemicals affect health, they analyzed clusters to identify new disease-chemical associations. The network can't separate positive from negative associations between a chemical and disease.
Researchers have developed a new way to study how the brain processes sound by using a computer model called a network receptive field. This model shows that neurons in the auditory cortex, the part of the brain that deals with hearing, are more sensitive to a wider range of sounds than previously thought. They are not just sensitive to a single point in time and frequency, but to a larger area of time and frequency. The model also shows that these neurons interact with each other in a complex way, not just a simple on or off. This interaction is important for recognizing complex sounds, like music or voices. The model is better at predicting how the brain responds to sounds than previous models and is easy to understand in terms of how the brain works. 

The researchers used this model to study the primary auditory cortex, the part of the brain that deals with basic sounds. They found that the neurons in this area are sensitive to a wide range of sounds and interact with each other in a complex way. This is different from previous models that said they were just sensitive to a single point in time and frequency. The model also shows that the neurons have excitatory and inhibitory parts that work together to control how they respond to sounds. This is important for recognizing complex sounds and may be a stage in how the brain recognizes sounds. The model is a new way to study how the brain processes sound and can help understand how it works.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called casein kinase 2 (CK-2) in regulating the body's internal clock, which helps us anticipate day and night cycles. CK-2 adds a phosphate group to a protein called BMAL1, which is crucial for the clock's function. They found that another protein called RY acts as a brake on CK-2, preventing it from adding the phosphate to BM1. This brake is a new function for RY, as it's also known to suppress a different part of the clock. Without R, BM1 is over-phosphorylated, leading to a disrupted clock. The researchers propose a model where RY's brake on CK-2 is part of the clock's feedback loop, keeping it in balance. This study reveals CK-2's role in the clock and R's new function in regulating CK-2's activity.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Salmonella enterica adapts to bile, a substance in the digestive system that kills bacteria. They found that bile disrupts membranes, denatures proteins, and damages DNA, making it hard for bacteria to survive. However, Salmonella can adapt to low levels of bile and survive high levels. This adaptation is linked to changes in gene expression, including upregulation of the Rpo-dependent stress response and other stress responses. A crucial role of the stress response is shown by Rpo mutants being sensitive to bile. Adaptation is not just a population response, but individual cells can become resistant without it. When a non-adapted Salmonella culture is plated on lethal bile, resistant colonies appear at a frequency of 10^-6 to 10^-7 per cell. Fluctuation analysis shows these colonies come from resistant cells in the culture. Some isolates are stable, indicating resistance can be acquired by mutation. Genome sequencing of resistant mutants shows alteration in lipopolysaccharide transport is a common cause of resistance. However, selection on lethal bile also provides non-mutated isolates. These may come from cells in a physiological state that allows survival upon bile. This is supported by single cell analysis of gene expression using a microscope system: Salmonella cells activate stress genes in the absence of DOC. This shows phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal populations and adaptive value of gene fluctuations.
Researchers have found that the bacteriophage Mu, a virus that infects E. coli, is organized as a stable domain within the E. coli chromosome. This domain is formed by the proximity of the Mu's ends, which are 37 kilobases apart on the genome. The formation and maintenance of this domain is dependent on a strong gyrase site at the center of Mu, Mu's ends, and E. coli proteins IHF, F, and H. This domain was observed at two different chromosomal locations, but prophage lambda does not form an independent domain. Low-level transcription from phage promoters, one of which is domain-dependent, promotes the establishment and maintenance of the Mu domain. The researchers propose that this domain makes Mu ready for transposition by creating topological requirements and proximity of ends. The benefits to the host from a subset of proteins expressed by prophage may help its long-term stability.
Primaquine (PQ) is the only licensed drug that prevents Plasium vivax (Pv) relapses and clears mature gametocytes of Plasium falciparum (Pf). A study in Papua New Guinea investigated the effect of PQ on Pv and Pf gamocyte carriage after treatment. Children received radical cure with chloroquine, artemether-lumeftrine plus PQ or placebo, and blood samples were collected every 2-4 weeks for 8 months. PQ reduced Pv gamocyte incidence by 73%, similar to its effect on blood-stage infections. 92% of Pv and 79% Pf gamocyte infections were asymptomatic. Pv gamocyte positivity and density were associated with high-stage parasite densities. Mixed-species infections had lower gamocyte odds than single-species for both Pv (OR 0.39, CI 0.25-0.62) and Pf (OR 0.33, CI 0.18-0.6, p<0.001). PQ had no effect on Pv gamocyte density or proportion in placebo arm. Relapses likely caused by hypnoite were as likely to carry gamocytes as new infections by infective bite. Relapses contributed to Pv reservoir, highlighting importance of anti-hypite treatment for control.
Researchers studied how a family of proteins called Rho GTPases, which play a crucial role in various cellular processes such as cell movement, division, and the breakdown of cellular waste. These proteins have different effects on the structure of actin, a key component of the cell's skeleton, but share a common mechanism of activation by binding to a molecule called GTP. The scientists developed a model to analyze data on how these proteins cycle between the cell membrane and cytoplasm, which they believe is key to understanding how they are regulated. Their analysis revealed details on how a protein called GDI helps or hinders the cycling and distinguishes between two types of mechanisms: one dependent on GDI and the other not. They found that a lower affinity of GDI for one of the proteins, Rac, can be explained by its faster release from the membrane. Charts were created to show the amount of GTP on the membrane and how it's affected by other proteins and GDI. These charts can be used to understand how changes in the balance of GTP and GDI can be compensated for in diseases. The study shows that Rho-GTP cycling can access different pathways in various systems through different manipulations.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programs collect data to assess the impact of interventions on schistosomiasis control and elimination. Typically, data is collected from school-aged children (SAC) as they are easy to sample and likely to be infected. However, adults are also infected. This study investigates how the age distribution of infection impacts treatment recommendations for Schistoma mansoni with low, moderate, and high burdens in adults. For moderate prevalence regions, treating SAC may achieve World Health Organization (WHO) goals, but for high prevalence with high infection, adult treatment is needed. The optimal strategy requires considering adult burden, not just SAC prevalence. Past data informed models, but more accurate data are needed to determine treatment for a region. Collecting data from a broader age range, including adults, is crucial to accurately determine treatment. Additional data, such as individual adherence, should be collected. Including adults in treatment efforts, a large schistome burden remains untreated, creating a reservoir. In 2002, adults in high-risk areas and women of childbearing age were excluded from mass drug administration (MDA). Mathematical models recommend adaptations, such as increased coverage or frequency. Burden in adults varies geographically, impacted by behavioral, cultural, and access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) facilities. Infection profiles and burden in adults vary in countries and communities. This study explores how different infection profiles impact treatment levels to achieve WHO goals. Collecting age-specific data, including adults, is important in M&E. SAC are likely infected due to age-related contact and absence of immunity, treatment focused on this age to prevent morbidity.
Researchers have developed a computational model to predict the effectiveness of surgery for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), a disorder causing seizures. The model uses data from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 22 patients with TLE and 39 healthy individuals. It simulates seizure onset and spreading in the brain networks. The study found that patients with TLE tend to switch from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls. Regions in the left hemisphere, particularly temporal and subcortical areas, are frequent starting points for seizures. Contralateral frontal regions may play a role in seizure spreading or resistance. The model predicts that patient-specific surgery, chosen based on individual model, may lead to better outcomes than standard procedure. This work provides a step towards personalized modeling epilepsy surgery to inform treatment strategies.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) uses several strategies to evade the host's antiviral defenses, including interference with interferon and apoptotic signaling. The virus encodes four interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) that function in a dominant negative fashion to block cellular IR activities and target IR-induced proteins such as p53 and TGF-β-activated Smad transcription factors. Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which HHV-8 inactivates the pro-apopt Bcl-2 family member Bim, a key regulator of HH-8 replication. The viral factor vIR-1 targets Bim to the nucleus, preventing its pro-apopt function. In infected cells, vIR-1 and B were found to co-localize in the nucleus by immunofluorescence and western analysis. The interaction between v-1 and B was confirmed by co-precipitation and deletion mutagenesis. Blocking the interaction with a peptide corresponding to the B-binding region of v-1 inhibited v- replication. This is the first report of an IR protein interacting with a B-2 family member and sequestering B or any member as a means of inactivation. The study reveals a novel mechanism used by HH-8 to control replication-induced apoptosis and suggests targeting v-1:B interaction may be an antiral strategy.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called epithelial integrin, specifically αVβ6, plays a crucial role in regulating the immune response of the lungs to injury and infection. This protein helps the lungs maintain a state of readiness to respond to invaders and is upregulated during injury. When αβ is expressed, it moderates acute lung injury (ALI) through unknown mechanisms. The study found that upregulation of β during influenza infection is involved in disease pathogenesis. Mice lacking β6 have increased survival during infection due to limited viral spread into alveolar spaces leading to reduced ALI. Although β KO mice have normal lungs, they harbor constitutively activated CD11+ alolar macrophages (AM) and elevated type IFN signaling, traced to loss β-activated growth factor (TGFβ). Administration of exogenous TGF to β KO mice reduces CD11+ AM, type IF activity and protective phenotype during infection. Protection extended to other respiratory pathogens such as Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia. The study shows that loss of epithelial protein αβ integrin alters lung environment during homeostasis and infection leading to reduced injury and improved survival.
Researchers in Argentina evaluated the effectiveness of the Leishman Skin Test (LST) in diagnosing cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania Viannia brazili, the most common species in the Americas. They analyzed 733 cases from 2006-2015 at a reference center in Oran, Argentina. Most (93%) were cutaneous, 7% mucosal, and <1% disseminated. Diagnosis was confirmed in 65% through skin or mucosal smears, with 6 having negative LST. Among negative smears, 190 were also negative LST, but 69 were positive. Results were similar across age groups, but lesions over 21 days old correlated with positive smears and LST. The study supports using LST as a diagnostic tool for cutaneous leishiasis in all age groups in endemic areas, with high correlation with smears. Standardizing the technique and researching protocols will help manage suspicious cases.
Lipid-induced epigenetic changes in macrophages identify a coronary artery disease-associated variant that regulates PP2B expression through C/EB-beta binding. Genome-wide association studies have identified over 40 loci that affect coronary artery disease risk, but the mechanisms behind most of these loci are unknown. Recent studies suggest that many of these variants influence disease through altered transcription regulation in disease-relevant cell types. This study explored changes in transcription regulation during a key pathophysiological event in coronary artery disease, the lipid-induced transformation of macrophages to lipid foam cells. Researchers used a combination of chromatin mapping and enhancer and factor mapping in primary macrophages before and after exposure to oxidized low-density lipoprotein, resulting in foam cell formation. Lipid-induced cell formation was associated with changes in a subset of open chromatin and enhancers that correlated with expression of nearby genes. Lipid-regulated enhancers were enriched for transcription factors, including CEB-beta, which has no documented role in foam formation. Lipid exposure upregulated CEB expression and genomic binding, most around genes in inflammatory pathways. Variants at coronary disease loci were enriched in subset chrom sites altered by lipid, including rs643 at PP2 locus. Lipid increased CEB binding to site and CEB binding were stronger with protective allele rs643. Expression of PP2 product L3 was present in foam human atherosclerotic plaques and lipid upregulated L3 in macrophages, increasing pro-inflammatory mediators.
Researchers in Malawi conducted a study to see if one round of azithromycin mass treatment could reduce the prevalence of trachoma in districts with a baseline prevalence of 5.0-9% in 1-9 year olds. The World Health Organization recommends three rounds of treatment in such districts, but this may not be practical due to the number of districts and resources needed. The Malawi Ministry of Health gave one round of azrom to each district, achieving 80% coverage. Surveys were done in 18 units of the districts 6 months after treatment. Each unit had a TF-9 prevalence of less than 5%. The study shows that one round of azrom with 80% coverage can reduce TF to less than 5% in Malawi districts with 5.0-9% prevalence. This approach may be a way to eliminate trach in Malawi by 2020.
Plants have a built-in defense system to fight off pathogens without the help of immune cells or the immune system. A group of proteins called nucleotide-binding leucine repeat (NLR) recognize pathogens and trigger a strong response, including cell death, oxygen production, and changes in gene expression. Researchers found six calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPs) in Arabidopsis that play a key role in this response. One CP, CP2, controls the start of cell death, while others, CP4, 5, and 11, activate specific transcription factors WRKY28 and 48 to fight the pathogen, and CP1, 2, and 11 produce oxygen. This study shows how different CPs work together to create a complex response to pathogens. 

LR proteins, like R2 and 1, recognize specific pathogen effectors and start a response. CP1 and 2 are involved in this process, as shown by reduced oxygen production in mutants. A study found a group of transcription factors that work with CPs to fight the pathogen. CP4, 5, and 11 activate WR28, 48 to fight the pathogen, while CP1, 2, and 11 produce oxygen and contribute to cell death. Pathogens don't directly interact with LR, but affect host proteins to trigger response.
In Mali, a region of sub-Saharan Africa, Schistosoma haematium, a parasitic disease, causes high morbidity and mortality. It infects over 500 million people in 77 countries, mainly due to irrigation projects, sedentary lifestyle, and ineffective control programs. Despite its impact, less than 0.5% of Schosma investigations predict its spatial and temporal distributions. Public health programs could benefit from forecasting and warning systems to manage parasitic diseases. This study used exponential smoothing methods to forecast Schos haematium time-series in Nion, Mali from 1996-2004. The methods, in a state-space framework, captured seasonal and interannual fluctuations. Mean error was 25% for 1-5 month forecasts. The state-space framework produced accurate forecasts for S haematium-induced hematuria, capturing non-linear interactions between disease and covariates like climate, irrigation, and health. This framework can help manage and assess S haemat transmission and intervention in Nion, Mali and potentially Sahel.
Researchers studied how a virus called human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) interacts with human cells to infect them. They found that the virus has a protein called pp150 that stops its own genes from being expressed in cells that are in a certain stage of their life cycle called G2. This is because pp binds to a protein called cyclin A, which is important for cell growth and division. The virus also has another protein called p21 that breaks down cyclin A to stop cells from entering mitosis, or cell division. The researchers made a mutant virus that can't bind to cyclin and found that it can't infect cells as well as the normal virus. They also found that both pp and p21 work together to stop cells from entering mitosis, which is necessary for the virus to grow. This is a strategy the virus uses to control the cell cycle and replicate. The study suggests that this mechanism is important for the virus to infect cells and replicate.
Researchers studied the genetic causes of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a neurodegenerative disease that leads to paralysis and death. They looked at 242 people with ALS and 129 without the disease, sequencing 169 genes known to be linked to ALS. They found more new and rare variants in people with ALS, suggesting these might be disease-causing mutations. This study shows how next-generation sequencing can help understand the genetics of complex diseases like ALS. 

The researchers used a gene-by-gene approach to find new mutations in ALS-relevant genes in sporadic cases. They used many tools to study new variants and see if they're linked to disease. When possible, they compared new variants to other ALS variants. They also used computer tools to see if variants are harmful and combined with a rare variant approach to show people with ALS have more bad mutations than without. This suggests new or rare mutations in some genes might cause sporadic ALS. Next-generation sequencing is making it easier to study disease, but it's hard to know which variants are disease-causing. New methods are needed to make sequencing results useful. Familial ALS is more uniform than sporadic, with 20 genes explaining 60% of cases. Researchers looked at how many cases and controls had new or rare variants. Of 242 sequenced, 144 had new or rare, suggesting at least 40% of cases have no genetic cause they could find with their method and genes. They found new variants in ALS genes and associated genes, no link between some SNPs and ALS, except APO, and new in genes through trio and RRM studies.
Researchers have found that interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a crucial role in the development of immune cells that remember the flu virus. They studied mice with and without IL-6 and found that those without IL- had a harder time fighting off the flu. Specifically, IL-6 helps a type of immune cell called CD4 T cells remember the flu, but not another type called CD8 cells. This is because IL-6 limits the activity of a type of cell that suppresses the immune response, called Tregs. Without IL-6, these Tregs are more active and suppress the CD4 cells, making it harder for the body to fight the flu. The study suggests that IL-6 helps the body clear the flu by stopping Tregs from suppressing the immune response.
Researchers have discovered a new function of an enzyme called enol in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Enol is a glycolytic enzyme that converts 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenpyruate, but it also interacts with a protein called Dmt2, which is involved in DNA and RNA methylation. They found that enol acts as an inhibitor of Dmt, and its activity is controlled by glucose levels of 2-phoglycer. When glucose is low, enol accumulates in the nucleus and forms a complex with Dmt, reducing RNA methylation in the parasite. This is the first time a glycol enzyme has been shown to interact with Dmt. The study suggests a link between glucose metabolism and Dmt activity, and raises questions about the role of RNA methylation in the parasite.
Researchers have discovered microRNAs (miRNAs) in the saliva of mosquitoes, which play a crucial role in transmitting diseases like Chikungunya virus (CHV) to humans. Mosquito saliva is a complex mixture of secretions that helps pathogens infect humans during feeding. The team used next-generation sequencing to identify 103 miRNAs in mosquito saliva, 31 of which were new and named. Some miRN were only present in CHV-infected mosquitoes. They tested five miRN to see if they affect CHV infection, and found they do play a role in transmitting and establishing infection during feeding on a host. Inhibiting these mi decreased viral replication, suggesting they help CHV spread in the host. This is the first report of exogenous miRN in mosquito saliva.
Researchers have discovered that three proteins, Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59, play a crucial role in repairing damaged mitochondrial DNA in yeast cells. Mitochondria, the energy-producing structures within cells, have their own DNA that can be damaged, leading to inherited diseases and disorders. Most of these damages are caused by recombination events, but the process is not well understood. The study found that Rad51 and Rad59 are present in the mitochondria and bind to DNA, while Rad52 helps repair double-strand breaks. A new method was developed to introduce a single break in the mitochondrial DNA, allowing researchers to study repair in real-time. Without these proteins, deletions occur more often and Rad51 and Rad59 impair repair. This is the first study to show Rad51,52, and59's impact on mitochondrial DNA repair. A system was improved to introduce a single break per genome to identify proteins involved in repair. Mitochondrial base repair has been studied, showing conserved pathways exist. Homologous recombination, a repair process, is present in yeast, fruit flies, and mice. Rad51 and59 localize to the mitochondria. Identifying factors interacting with Rad51,52,59 will help understand mitochondrial repair pathways. Double-strand break repair in mitochondria is poorly understood, despite its importance to cell control and maintenance. Few proteins involved in recombination have been identified. Control of break induction allowed studying repair kinetics using genetic and molecular methods. Loss of proteins delays break processing and deletion.
Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a significant global health burden, particularly among disadvantaged populations, resulting from acute rheumatic fever (AR), a complication of Group A Streptococcal (GAS) infection. The role of social and environmental factors in GAS infection and progression to AR/RHD is not well understood. This systematic review aimed to determine the association between social determinants of health and GAS, AR, and RHD, and the effect of interventions targeting these. A literature search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase, including observational and experimental studies measuring crowding, characteristics, education, employment, income, nutrition, or socioeconomic status and relationship with GAS, AR or RHD. Findings were assessed against the Bradford criteria for evidence of causation. 1,164 publications were identified, 90 met criteria, comprising 91 studies, 49% were poor quality. Crowding was most assessed (14 with GAS, 36 AR/RHD) followed by socioeconomic (6, 36). Most studies reported positive association with risk of GAS, AR/RHD. Crow and socioeconomic met criteria for causation. Heterogeneity was substantial across all aspects. The literature lacks quality, mostly observational, not interventional. Crow a practical target for prevention.
Researchers studied the Pho/PhP bacterial signaling network, a two-component system found in many bacteria. They found that a single mutation in the sensor kinase PhQ, which abolishes its phosphatase activity, results in a striking change in the network's behavior. The mutant responds to stimuli in a bistable manner, unlike the wild-type, which has a graded response. Mutant cells have different morphologies in on and off states, and this state is inherited over generations. External conditions that repress signaling in the wild-type drive the mutant to the on state. Mathematical modeling suggests bistability depends on autoregulation of PhP and PhQ. The mutant's characteristics come at a fitness cost, with the on state having lower fitness in stationary cultures in rich medium. However, due to inheritance, a population of on cells can be epigenetically trapped in a low-fitness. The study demonstrates the versatility of the prototypical two-component architecture and highlights tradeoffs in the Pho/PhP system.
Researchers have identified a potential new target for treating a rare and deadly brain infection called primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri. This infection is considered rare but has a high mortality rate and no established treatment, making it devastating. To develop new treatments, scientists are repurposing existing drugs used for other diseases. Naegia fleri needs a building block called ergoster for its cell membranes, similar to fungi. Disrupting sterol synthesis with small molecules is a strategy against fungal and agricultural pathogens. The amoeba has an enzyme called ster 14-demethylase (C51) similar to fungal versions. This raises the possibility of using anti-fungal drugs for AM treatment. Researchers tested anti-fungal drugs called azoles on Naegia trophotes, identified the C51 substrate, and analyzed interactions between C51 and azoles. The studies validated C51 as a target and azoles as potential treatments for AM.
Researchers studied the role of interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4α) in the body's immune response to nematode infections. Nematodes are parasites that cause diseases in humans and animals. They trigger a type 2 immune response, which helps fight off the infection. IL-4α plays a key role in starting this response. But it's unclear if it's needed to keep the response going after it's started. Scientists used mice without IL-4α to see what happens. They found IL-α is needed to keep the type 2 response going and help the body get rid of the parasites. If IL-α was removed before the infection, the body couldn't fight off the parasites as well. This shows IL-α is important for keeping the type 2 response going, not just starting it. It's a new function for IL-α that's different from its role in starting the response.
Humans have a significant impact on the distribution of Bartonella bacteria, a genus that causes various infections in mammals, including humans. By studying how Bartonella has evolved and switched hosts in the past, researchers can understand current patterns and identify potential mechanisms for cross-species transmission. A large collection of Bartonella glA genotypes, including 67 new ones, was analyzed. The study found that Bartonella likely originated as an environmental bacterium that infected insects before mammals, and rodents and domestic animals serve as reservoirs or key hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. There is also evidence of exchange between phylogenetically distant domestic and wildlife, likely due to increased contact. To protect health, care should be taken to avoid contact between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife.

The study shows Bartonella is a system to examine human impacts on infectious disease spread within and between species, across landscapes and the globe. Phylogenetic inferences about origin should be cautious as influenced by data and taxa sampled. There may be missing links between inferred hosts not sampled. Barton is an ideal pathogen to focus on zoonotic potential and impacts on native hosts. The study constructed global phylogenies of Barton from 16sRNA and citrate synth (glA) to determine evolutionary history, patterns, host switching, and spillo into humans from commals into species. Some host specificity is due to ecological factors rather than immunological incompatibility. Given diversity of zoonotic strains, including divergent with clinical presentations, physicians should consider animal hosts and Barton genotypes when investigating suspected infection.
Researchers have found that a type of non-coding RNA called MALAT plays a key role in controlling cell growth and division. They discovered that MALAT levels change during different stages of the cell cycle, influencing the expression of genes involved in cell progression. In normal human skin cells, removing MALAT leads to DNA damage and activation of a protein called p53 and its target genes. The cell defects in MALAT-depleted cells are sensitive to p53 levels, indicating p53 is a major mediator of MALAT activity. MALAT-depleted cells also show reduced expression of an oncogenic transcription factor called BMYB, involved in G2 progression, due to altered splicing of BMY preRNA. In human cells, MALAT promotes proliferation by regulating expression and preRNA of cycle transcription factors. The study provides insights into MALAT's role in regulating cell growth.
Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in regulating growth, metamorphosis, and reproduction in insects. While its role in repressing larval metamosis is well understood, its action in promoting adult reproduction is not fully elucidated. Researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to mimic a J-deprived condition in migratory locusts and found that J stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in preparation for vitlogenesis. Two genes, Mc4 and Mc7, in the DNA replication pathway were expressed in the presence of J. Depletion of Mc or Mc7 inhibited novo synthesis and ploidy, reducing vitlogen mRNA and impairing oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. The study suggests J-receptor acts on Mc and Mc to regulate replication and ploidy for vitlogenesis and oocyte maturation.
Researchers conducted a study to determine the optimal duration of prednisone treatment for lepro patients with recent nerve function impairment (NFI). The study, called "Treatment Early Neurop in Lepy" (TENL), compared a 20-week and 32-week prednisone courses. 868 patients were included, 429 in the 20-week arm and 439 in the 32 arm. At 78 weeks, the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function did not differ between groups: 78.1% in the 20 arm and 77.5 in the 32 (p=0.821). No differences were found in secondary outcomes, except a higher adverse events in the longer arm. A 20-week predone course was as effective as 32 in improving and restoring NFI in lepro patients, making it the preferred initial treatment for neuropathy, with only a minority needing individualized treatment.
Researchers studied the vocalizations of male Rocky Mountain elk and European red deer to understand how sound production relates to anatomy and physiology. They created a computer model of the larynx and vocal tract based on elk anatomy and biomechanics to simulate sound production. The model can produce a range of frequencies, from low to high. Low-frequency calls require less vocal strain but high lung pressure and glottal flow, while high-pitched calls need more muscular effort and lung pressure. Glottal efficiency, the ratio of sound power to airflow, is higher in elk, suggesting an advantage in high-pitched signaling. This is due to lower airflow and acoustic radiation at higher frequencies. Both types are used by males during mating, serving as honest signals. Low-frequency calls relate to body size, high-pitched to muscular strength.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-through sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, a technique used to map transcription factor binding and chromatin modifications. Current methods discard reads that map to multiple locations on the genome, known as multi-reads, to focus on reads that map uniquely to one location, known as uni-reads. This can lead to missing up to 30% of usable data. The new approach allocates multi-read as fractional counts using a weighted scheme, increasing sequencing depth by 22-25% and 17% in STAT and GATA ChIP samples. Incorporating multi-reads identifies novel peaks not found with uni-read and improves detection in mappable regions. Analysis shows multi-read peaks have similar characteristics to uni-read, but mostly reside in segmental duplications. Validation of GATA multi-read peaks by real-time ChIP identifies new target genes. This study highlights the importance of multi-read in studying factor binding in repetitive regions with IP experiments.
Researchers estimated the economic benefits of reaching the 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) targets for four neglected tropical diseases: Chagas disease, African trypaniasis, lepro, and visceral leishias. They calculated how much economic loss individuals would be avoided due to productivity and out-of-pocket payments from these diseases if targets were met. The study found that achieving these targets would save $23.1 billion in 2011-202 and $35.9 billion in 202-203, corresponding to $10.7 and $16.6 billion, respectively. Out-of-pocket payments would also be reduced by $14 billion and $18 billion for the same periods. The benefits exceed investments made by governments and partners. Neglected diseases disproportionately affect poor households in low and middle-income countries, making these investments a good value for improving well-being and reducing inequity.
A long-held assumption in neuroscience is that highly selective neurons, which respond to a narrow range of sensory inputs, carry more information about external stimuli. However, research in the auditory cortex reveals a different story. Initially, neurons respond to a wide range of sounds, then become highly selective as the sound sustains. Despite this selectivity difference, a population of neurons conveys similar information about the sound across both epochs. The amount of information encoded depends on the total number of spikes in the population, not selectivity. Inhomogeneous Poisson spiking behavior explains this property. This challenges the prevailing theory that highly selective neurons are more informative. In the auditory cortex, selectivity increases as spiking evolves after sound onset. Neurons initially respond to many sounds, then settle to a few. Adaptation leads to a sparser representation and higher selectivity. This feature is shared among sensory systems. The theory posits unselective responses encode presence, selective responses encode identity. However, this approach has caveats. Our understanding of sensory processing is built on neurons responding to specific inputs. Highly selective neurons are thought to provide more information, but this may not be true.
Researchers have found that a protein called OX40 plays a crucial role in helping the immune system control a persistent viral infection. Unlike acute infections, where the immune system quickly clears the virus, chronic infections require the immune system to keep fighting the virus for a long time to prevent it from spreading. O40 is a co-stimulatory molecule that helps T cells, a type of immune cells, to stay active and fight the virus. In a study, mice infected with a virus called LCMV13, the researchers found that mice lacking O40 were unable to control the virus over time. They also found that O40 helps both CD4 and CD8 T cells, two types of T cells, and the production of antibodies to fight the virus. The study suggests that O40 is important for long-term survival of T cells and its role is more prominent in chronic infections. In contrast to acute infections, where O is not necessary, O is crucial in chronic infections. The study also found that O expression of another protein PD1, which limits T activity, is linked to O40 expression, suggesting that sustained O expression is due to ongoing recognition of the virus. The findings have implications for understanding T cell dysfunction in persistent infections in humans.
Researchers have discovered a remarkable example of convergent evolution in aquatic animals, where a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrates and invertebrates across three different phyla. This optimal method, called the "optimal wavelength" (OS), maximizes the force generated by the body and maximizes swimming speed. The OS is calculated by dividing the length of undulation along an animal's fin during swimming by the mean amplitude of undulations along the fin, resulting in a consistent value of around 20. This pattern of movement occurs in morphologically diverse appendages of aquatic animals, including cuttlefish, cartilaginous and bony fish, and vertebrates like tuna and sharks. They swim by undulating their fins while keeping their body relatively rigid, unlike the tail of a trout which moves crosswise to the body. The researchers hypothesize that the regulation of OS, elongation, and fination in these phyla may be due to common genetic networks that underlie convergent evolution, as seen in the case of electric organs. The OS and mean undulation amplitude can predict the number of undulations needed for a swimming animal to cruise at any velocity, linking physical principles to biological phenomena. This phenomenon unifies a vast diversity of swimming organisms, from invertebrates to vertebrates. The study questions why slower swimming forms of median paired fin animals emerge and thrive despite ancestral body/caud fin prevalence. Evidence supports this idea in convergently evolved anatomical specializations of bodyud fin that minimizes trunk movement during tail, resulting in pure thrust, seen in thunn swimmers like tuna and sharks.
Researchers have studied the role of condens, a class of evolutionarily conserved proteins, in neural stem cell divisions during cerebral cortex development. They found that two types of condens complexes, condens I and II, are essential for neural stem cell divisions and survival in mice. Depleting both condens causes severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, leading to DNA damage and p53-induced apoptosis. Depleting either condens I or II separately leads to slower loss of neural stem cells, but with distinct mitotic defects: condin II-depleted cells show chromosome missegregation, while condin I-depleted cells experience mitotic delays. Notably, neural cells depleted of condin II display hyperclustering of pericentricochatin and nucleoli, indicating condin II's role in establishing interphase architecture. These defects persist in postmitotic neurons. The study shows that condens I and II have overlapping and non-overlapping functions in neural stem cells, providing insight into balancing acts of the two condin complexes.
Scientists have studied the parasite Schistosoma mansoni, a type of flatworm that causes schistosomiasis in humans, to understand how it develops sexually. This parasite is unusual because it has two sexes, male and female, but only shows sex differences after infecting a vertebrate host. The researchers looked at the parasite's entire genetic material, called transcriptome, in males and females at different stages of development. They found 7,168 genes that are different between sexes at least one stage, and 4,065 with known functions. They also looked at how a type of epigenetic marker, H3me3, in males and females before and after sex differences appear. The study shows that sex differences in S. mansoni are due to different genetic and epetic regulators and how it interacts with vertebrate host. This could help find new targets to treat schosomiasis and understand how parasite develops in host.
Researchers have developed a new approach to handle disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts by assigning a confidence value to each annotation. This value represents the probability that the annotation is correct. They created two probabilistic models to perform this analysis and tested them on a large dataset of 10,000 sentences annotated by eight experts. Even when all annotators disagree, the approach increases the probability of choosing the correct annotation. The team also made a corpus of 10,000 sentences annotated on several dimensions and a subset of 1,000 further annotated by five experts. The approach is general and can benefit most annotation studies.

The researchers suggest a way to design and analyze annotation experiments. They created two probabilistic models and tested them on a new corpus of 10,000 sentences. Each sentence was annotated by three experts. Existing approaches can be improved with careful design and modeling. The study aims to quantify certainty in individual annotations for a group of annotators and retain the dataset for machine learning. The models are based on a corpus and validated with a second annotation cycle. Five new annotators annotated a subset of 1,000 sentences from the original 10,000. The goal was to generate a corpus for training computers to perform tasks at scale.
Researchers have developed a new way to produce antiviral antibodies to protect against hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a deadly disease caused by Andes virus (AND) and related viruses in South America. They used a DNA vaccine platform in geese to create antibodies that can be purified from egg yolks. Geese were vaccinated with a DNA vaccine encoding AND virus glycoproteins and developed high levels of neutralizing antibodies. The antibodies were tested in a hamster model of lethal HPS and showed 100% protection when administered post-exposure. This is a promising alternative to using convalescent plasma or mammalian antibodies, which are in short supply or reactogenic in humans.
Researchers have found that the Dmta enzyme plays a crucial role in maintaining normal DNA methylation patterns in the body's cells. Methylation is a process that helps control gene expression and prevent cancer. Dmta mutations have been linked to leukemia, a type of blood cancer. In a mouse model of lung cancer, deleting Dmt led to faster tumor growth, suggesting it might suppress cancer by stabilizing methylation patterns. The study used whole-genome sequencing to compare methylation patterns in Dmta wild-type and Dmt-deficient lung tumors. Results showed significant changes in methylation in lung cancer. Dmt wild-type tumors had large areas with low methylation, while Dmt-deficient had uniformly low methylation. Further analysis revealed Dmt maintains methylation of active chromosome domains and D-def tumors had moderate gene deregulation in these areas. The study defines features of cancer methylation and Dmt's role in maintaining methylation in cancer.
Researchers have discovered a unique patterns of neural activity in the premotor cortex of songbirds that support the generation of song sequences. They used multi-electrode recordings and calcium imaging to study the activity of neurons in the premotor area HVC of singing birds. The results show that neural activity is organized on a scale of 100 micrometers, with excitatory neurons firing at a specific phase of a 30 Hz rhythm. This indicates that premotor activity is inhomogeneous in time and space, and a mesoscopic pattern underlies the generation of neural sequences controlling song. 

The study found that the relationship between time and space in premotor area HVC is neither random nor globally organized, but clustered on a 100 micrometer scale. A 30 Hz rhythm was revealed in local field potentials and correlated with the timing of one neuron type, HX, and this rhythm is coherent with projection calcium activity. The results suggest a microcircuit where multiple pools of excitatory neurons drive interneuron populations. Inhibitory neurons patterned activity throughout song, whereas projection fire spars, with calcium events correlated between neighbors. This indicates a system where interplay of spatial patterns of excitation and inhibition form the basis of stereotyped sequences. 

The findings raise the possibility that clustering and 30 rhythmic alternation of excitatory and inhibitory cells may be a feature of cortical microcircuits for sequential behavior. The study suggests future models of song learning should consider spatial patterns of excitation and inhibition, not just topology of excitatory cells.
Researchers have identified 64 genes in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans that are essential for growth and development, but also extend lifespan when inactivated. These genes are highly conserved from yeast to humans and play a role in insulin, metabolic, translation, RNA, and chromatin pathways. Many of these genes extend lifespan as much as the strongest regulators of aging. Early inactivation of these genes causes growth arrest at larval stages, and some animals live longer than wild-type adults. The gene daf-16 is required for survival of arrested larvae, suggesting increased longevity is a response to gene inactivation. Insulin-signaling plays a role in regulation of aging at any stage of life. This study suggests that lifespan is regulated by both genetic and environmental factors in many species. Previous work has identified components of cellular processes that regulate lifespan. In C. elegans, loss-function in insulin/insulin growth factor-1/daf-2 pathway doubles lifespan. Regulation of DAF-2 occurs during adulthood. C. elegans lifespan extended when fed RNA targeting insulin/d-2 at any larval stage through adulthood.
Scientists have discovered a crucial step in the process of zebraf fish fin regeneration, where a specialized skin layer called the epidermis forms from the remaining tissue after an injury. They found a gene called lamin beta 1, which is essential for this process, and is induced in a specific skin cells after the fin is cut. This gene helps create a polarized skin layer, necessary for growth and bone formation. Without it, the fin cannot regenerate. The researchers also found that a growth factor called fgf20, which induces lamin 1, is important for epidermis formation. However, other factors may also play a role in this process. The epidermis in zeb fish and salamander limbs express various signaling pathways, including fgfs, wnts, activin, and retinoic acid. But how these define the epider's shape and function is unknown. The study identified lamin beta 1 as a key component in zeb fish regeneration, necessary for skin polarity, markers, receptors, and osteoblast alignment. Its induction is dependent on fgf signaling after injury and during regeneration.
Researchers compared different methods for accounting for relatedness in genome-wide association studies using family data. They tested linear mixed models (LMM) approaches, which have gained popularity in recent years, by applying them to a study of visceral leishmanias in 348 Brazilian families. The study included 362 individuals, 197 of whom were genotyped. Various LMM software packages were compared, including EMM, GenABEL, FASTMM, Mend, GMA, and MMM. The methods differed in details and user options, such as the number of SNPs used to estimate kinship. The study investigated sensitivity to these choices and success in controlling genome-wide error for real and simulated phenotypes. LMM results were compared to traditional family-based tests and alternative approaches in software MQL, ROADIPS, and MAST. Results showed strong concordance between L approaches, all controlling genome error except some when applied to longitudinal data with repeated measures. High correlation was found between LMM and alternative approaches, apart from transmission-based on SNPs with small or no effects. LMM performed well compared to competing approaches, with concordance in most applications. Choice of L implementation should not be based on type I error, but speed and ease of use.
Researchers have developed a new method to screen for compounds that can fight the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease. Currently, there is no effective treatment for the chronic stage of the disease, and existing medicines have toxic side effects. They tested 2000 compounds from a library and found three with high activity against the parasite and low toxicity to human cells: P1, NT, and CX. Each has a different way of stopping the parasite's growth inside the cell. CX kills the parasite, NT slows it down, and P1 stops it from dividing. These compounds also work against other related parasites, Leishmania and Leish major. Further testing showed two new compounds, P6 and CX2, are 100 times more effective than current medicines. This is a step towards developing new treatments for Chagas and leishiasis.
Researchers have developed a new, portable diagnostic tool for detecting Brugia parasites in mosquitoes, which cause lymphatic filariasis. Current methods rely on expensive and time-consuming DNA extraction and testing. The new tool, called "Backpack PCR," uses a simple, rapid DNA extraction method and a portable, battery-powered PCR platform with a strip-based detection. This makes it suitable for use in resource-limited areas where expensive equipment is not available. The team compared the new method to standard DNA extraction and found it effective. They also compared it to real-time PCR and conventional PCR with gel electrophoresis and found it to be sensitive and specific. By using a miniaturized PCR, they made the platform compact enough to fit in a backpack, allowing for point-of-collection use. This eliminates reliance on expensive equipment without compromising sensitivity or specificity, making it a cost-effective alternative to traditional methods requiring laboratory infrastructure. The "Backpack" system increases the feasibility of molecular monitoring in endemic areas and provides a framework for detecting Wuchereria bancrofti, responsible for 90% of the global burden. It can also be extended to other mosquito-borne pathogens like malaria, Zika, deng fever, and Chikunya.
Scientists have studied how a type of protein called elastomer, which can stretch and recoil like rubber, to understand how it forms its structure. Elastomers are made up of repeating parts called domains that give them elasticity and help them stick together. Researchers used a computer simulation to model to see how different arrangements of these domains affect the protein's shape and strength. They found that the size and number of these domains can greatly impact the protein's structure and how well it holds together. For example, proteins with more cross-linking elements and smaller elastic domains formed stronger structures. This study helps us understand how elastomers evolved and can be used to design new materials with specific properties.
Researchers have been studying the Ebola virus, a highly contagious and deadly pathogen, to understand how it replicates and spreads. The virus has a long genome compared to other similar viruses due to its 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) in its seven transcription units. These regions have not been assigned specific functions until now. The study found that the Ebola virus's 5-UTRs do not function as internal ribosomal entry sites, but regulate translation when placed upstream of a reporter gene. The 5-UT from the viral polymerase mRNA strongly suppresses translation compared to a control. The 5-UT has four upstream AUGs (uAUGs) and removing each enhances translation of the primary open reading frame (ORF), most for the polymerase. The uUG is sufficient to initiate translation, surrounded by a weak Koz sequence and suppresses ORF in a position-dependent manner. Under stress conditions, the uUG maintains translation of the OR. To test the role of uUG in replication, a recombinant Ebola was made with the uUG mutated to UCG. Mutating two nucleotides outside protein and regulatory sequences attenuated virus growth 10-100 times lower than wild-type in cells. The virus also showed decreased RNA synthesis and sensitivity to stress.
Researchers have developed a new method to map double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the human genome, which are breaks in the DNA that can lead to cancer and other diseases. They found that these breaks are not random, but occur in specific spots on the chromosomes, called domains. These domains are about 50-250 kilobases long and are protected from further breaks. About 30% of these domains have genes that are turned on or off together, and proteins PAR1 and HNPA2B1 bind to the ends of these domains. This suggests a new way genes are regulated by being turned on or off together in large areas of the chromosome, protected by breaks and protein binding sites. This could be important for understanding cancer and gene therapy. The study also found that PAR1 and HN2B1 have not been known to work together before, but H2B1 interacts with a protein that helps fix breaks in DNA. The new method can be used to study breaks in many types of human cells and may help understand fragile sites in chromosomes.
Researchers studied trypanosomat infections in bats in two areas with different levels of preservation in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. They captured bats in Reserva Ecológica Guçu (REG) and Estação Florestal Mata Atlântica (EFA) and analyzed 181 specimens for trypanosomat infections. 24% of the bats were infected, with Trypanosoma dionii being the most common parasite. The researchers also detected Crithidia mellae, a parasite typically found in insects, infecting a vertebrate for the first time in the Americas. Bats from the Atlantic Forest of Rio Janeiro harbor a great diversity of trypanids, maintaining tryosid diversity in the sylvatic environment.
Ticks are the most common arthrop vectors of human and animal diseases in Europe, and the Ixodes ricinus species can transmit a large number of bacteria, viruses, and parasites. They may be co-infected with several pathogens, with a high likelihood of co-transmission to humans or animals. A study evaluated the prevalence of 38 pathogens and symbionts, and co-infections, as well as interactions between pathogens and symbion. 267 Iodes ricinus females were collected in the Ardennes and analyzed for 37 pathogens by high-throughput real-time PCR, RT-PCR for Tick-borne encephalitis virus, and nested PCR for symbion. Results showed 45% were co-infected, carrying up to five pathogens. Adding symbion prevalence, all were infected with at least one microorganism, up to eight in one tick. Interactions between pathogens suggested a strong association between Borrelia garini and B afii, no interactions between symbion and pathogens. The study reveals high pathogen co-infection rates, raising questions about co-transmission to humans and animals, and consequences to health. High symbion coexistence with pathogens opens new avenues for their effects on pathogen transmission and vector competence.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand how hematopoietic stem cells decide to become either erythroid or myeloid cells. This decision is governed by a genetic switch involving two master genes, PU.1 and GATA-1. Prior to commitment, these genes are expressed at low levels, a "primed" state. The model shows that mutual antagonism and autoregulation between these genes make the system bistable, allowing for robust lineage determination. A new mechanism involving a cofactor regulated by one of the master genes is necessary for bistability and switch-like behavior. Suppressing the cofactor can lead to loss of cooperativity and a primed state. The PU.1-GATA switch interacts with another antagonistic pair, FOG-1, which reinforces the decision through feedback loops, making it irreversible. This switch is an example of a network that regulates both primed and committed states through cofactor recruitment. Perturbing feedback between regulators and targets suggests reprogramming strategies. The approach can aid lineage studies and search for determining genes.
Enterococcus faecalis, an opportunistic pathogen, has high resistance to lysozym, a key effector of the innate immune system, due to a complex network of transcription regulators and genes oat, pgA, dlt, and sigV. Researchers sought to identify genes modulating E. faalis resistance to lyso. Random transposon mutagenesis in a quadruple oat/pgA/dlt/sig mutant led to the identification of insertions in the enteroccal polyschar antigen (EPA) region, downstream of conserved epA-ep genes, proposed to encode a core machinery. The PA region was previously thought to be responsible for EPA decoration, but its role was unknown. This study shows EPA decoration contributes to resistance to antimicrobials and virulence in zebraf infection by conferring resistance phagocytosis. Deletion of pgA in L monocogen is associated with a 32-fold decrease in resistance. Disruption of genes encoding EPA decoration increases E fa resistance to lyzym. In-frame deletion in wild-type background has the same effect. The contribution of oat, pgA, d,lt, and sig to lyzym resistance was carried out using E faalis J2 as background, but this strain is avir in zraf infection, so OG1 was used instead. Mapping transon sites revealed 9 out of 16 insertions downstream conserved epAep region, encoding core apparatus to produce EPA. This region displays variability and is proposed to be responsible for EPA decoration. The quadruple mutant oat/pgA/dlt/sig shows high resistance to lyzym compared to Firmutes. This mutant was used for transon mutagenesis to identify additional genes in lyzym resistance.
Researchers have developed a new model called RER to analyze how genes are regulated in acute myeloid leukemia, a type of blood cancer. This model combines data from two sources: The Cancer Genome Atlas and Encyclopedia of DNA Elements. These sources provide information on genetic and epigenetic factors such as copy number variation, DNA methylation, transcription factors, and microRNA post-transcription regulation. The model first stage infers sample-specific activities of transcription factors and microRNAs, which are then used to infer interactions between these factors and genes. This approach overcomes a challenge of integrating data from different sources. In a study, the model was tested on acute myeloid leukemia data from The Cancer Atlas and related transcription factor data from Encyclopedia. It was verified by 10-fold cross-validation and shown to predict gene expression better than existing methods. The model also identified 18 regulators whose activities were consistent with genetic risk groups. One regulator, miR-548, was found to be involved in leukemia pathways and may play a role in cancer development. Survival analysis using the model identified regulators as a potential marker for cancer prognosis. The study provides a framework to integrate data and reveal regulatory programs at a global level.
Researchers studied the role of RNA interference (RNAi) in the fungus Colletum higginsum, a pathogen that infects various crops worldwide. They created mutants lacking genes for three key RNAi proteins: Dicer (D), Argonaute (AGO), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (R). Surprisingly, these mutants grew normally on regular and minimal media, but showed defects in conidiation and conidia morphology. The team analyzed RNA and small RNA populations in parental and mutant strains, finding greatest effects in Δcl, ΔclΔcl, and Δago strains. A previously unknown virus, Colletum higginsum non-segmented RNA virus 1 (ChV1), was repressed in these mutants. Phylogenetic analysis linked ChV to the Partitiviridae family, despite its non-segmented genome. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs with AGO showed abundant 5'U-containing siRNA. Higginsum parental and Δcl strains cured of ChV showed conid and spore defects were caused by ChV. RNAi involving DCL and AGO in C is proposed as antiviral mechanism.
Researchers have studied the role of a protein called MOF in the development of sperm cells in mice. MO is a histone acetyltransferase, which means it adds a chemical group to histones, the proteins that DNA wraps around to form chromatin. The team found that MO is involved in three waves of a protein called H2AX phosphorylation, which happens during meiosis, the process of making sperm. HAX marks unsynapsed chromosomes, which are chromosomes that haven't paired up yet. Without MO, HAX signals were only on the chromosome axes, not the whole chromatin, in some sperm cells. This caused problems with meiotic sex chromosome inactivation, a process that keeps unsapsed chromosomes separate. MO also helps fix breaks in DNA, called double-strand breaks, which can happen during meiosis. Without MO, these breaks were not fixed properly, and crossover, a process that swaps genetic material between chromosomes, didn't happen. The study shows MO is important for meiosis, the process of making sperm, and helps with HAX expansion and DNA repair.
Researchers studied how the human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1) affects the development of immune cells in the thymus. They used a special mice model called "Human Immune System" (HIS) Rag-2/-c/-, which has a weakened immune system. The mice were infected with HT-1 at an early stage when three main types of thymocytes were present. The virus was found in thymocytes of all infected mice and increased with time. In infected mice, alterations in T-cell development were seen, related to virus load. Mature CD4 and CD8 cells increased, while immature double-positive cells decreased. These cells also accumulated in spleen. Lymphocytes from thym and spleen were activated, shown by CD25 expression, related to Tax and increased NF-kB genes. Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphoma/thymoma were seen in infected mice months after infection. These results show the potential of HIS2/-c/- model to study leukogenic process by HT-1.
In Sudan, schistosomiasis remains a major public health concern, particularly Schistosoma haematium infection. A study in the Alab locality of White State, Sudan, from 2009-2011, aimed to reduce the disease. The total population was 482,902, with 78,615 primary school students as the target. Prevalence of S. haematium and S. mansoni at baseline was 28.5% and 0.4%, respectively. After 6-9 months post-treatment, S. haematium prevalence reduced to 13.5% (95%CI=0.331-0.462). Girls and rural residents showed higher reduction, while boys and urban showed less. Health education increased awareness and clean water supply at Alida village reduced infection. No change in S. mansoni prevalence between baseline and follow-up (95%CI=0.9336.891). The project reduced S haematium prevalence by 50% compared to baseline. Approximately 200,000 received praziquel therapy, education, or clean water.
Researchers have discovered that the matrix protein of the Nipah virus, a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus, plays a crucial role in viral budding by moving between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Unlike other paramyxiruses, which replicate in the cytoplasm, the matrix of Nip virus was found in the nucleus at early stages of infection before localizing to the plasma membrane. Mutations in the nuclear localization signals of the matrix protein impaired its trafficking and abolished viral budding. A conserved lysine residue in the matrix served dual functions: mediating nuclear import and regulating export. Overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced viral budding, while depletion of ubiquitin blocked it. The virus was sensitive to proteasome inhibitors, with an FDA-approved drug reducing viral titers by 100-fold.
Scientists have long struggled to understand how non-enveloped viruses, like the poliovirus, deliver their genetic material into cells. A new imaging technique allowed researchers to track the virus and its genome in live cells and measure its ability to infect. The study found that polirus releases its genome quickly and efficiently, without limiting its ability to infect cells. The virus binds to the cell surface and enters through a complex process involving clathrin, caveolin, flotillin, and microtubule-independent, but tyrosine and actin-dependent endocytosis. After entering the cell, the genome is released from tightly sealed vesicles within 100-200 nanometers of the plasma membrane. This resolves a long-standing debate on whether the virus directly breaks the membrane or relies on endocytosis to deliver its genome into the cell. The study used polirus as a model, a picavirus that causes poliomyelitis and is related to other human pathogens like rhiniruses, coackiruses, echiruses and enteriruses.
Dengue fever is a major health problem in Cambodia, especially for children. The National Dengue Control Program (NDC) uses education to prevent and control the disease, teaching communities and schools. Researchers studied data from 2003-2004 in eastern Cambodia to see how education is done and if it works. They found that community education through health centers and campaigns is not well-funded, irregular, and school education is limited in time and lacks follow-up activities. As a result, people don't follow it well.

Health education is key to inform and encourage people to prevent and control diseases like deng. However, in poor countries, education is complicated by economic, political, and infrastructure factors. In Cambodia, deng education through outreach and school programs is insufficient, underfunded. This doesn't mean there's no need for education. Local control and prevention with community involvement can reduce deng, but education must be well-resourced and translate to practice.

Two factors impact outreach: political commitment and resources. Researchers looked at community and school education for deng to address this. They found challenges facing deng control in Cambodia. No specific model was used for health activities or materials; strategy and content included various activities, information, and behaviors to control deng and mortality. Education was through radio, TV, billboards, banners, posters, and leaflets. Existing deng materials must be practical and relevant. Little training for health practitioners, so they lack skills and think education not part of work.
Researchers have discovered that filarial nematodes, parasites that cause chronic and debilitating diseases in humans and animals, release microRNAs (miRNAs) into the bloodstream of their hosts. These miRNAs are small RNA molecules that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression and can be used as biomarkers for disease diagnosis. The team analyzed plasma from dogs infected with Dirofilaria imis and Onchocerca volulus, two species of filarial nematodes, and found over 200 miRNA sequences of nematode origin. They developed assays to detect two specific miRNAs, mi-71 and mi-34, which were present in infected samples but not uninfected ones. However, the number of miRNAs did not correlate with the severity of the infection. This may be due to the difficulty in estimating the number of parasites present or miRNAs from unknown sources. The study suggests that parasite-derived miRNAs can be found in plasma or serum, even for species that do not live in the bloodstream. The team identified 245 and 261 candidate miRNAs in D. imis-infected dog plasma, 96 of which were present in both samples. They also found 200 miRNA sequences in D. imis-infected dog plasma and 21 in O. volulus-infected human serum. The mi-71 and mi-34 were detected in all D. imis-infected dog samples, but not in uninfected ones.
Scientists have studied how a type of enzyme called Src kinase, which plays a key role in cell signaling, changes from an inactive to active state. This change involves significant structural changes in the enzyme's shape. Researchers created a simplified model of the enzyme's active and inactive states and simulated how it changes shape over time. They mapped out the energy landscape of these changes and found two main paths to activation. The first path involves a coordinated movement of three parts of the enzyme: an alpha helix, activation loop, and beta strands. The second path is linked to a partial unfolding of a part of the enzyme. They also looked at how one part, the alpha helix and loop, changes in detail. A statistical model was tested to see if it could predict the enzyme's behavior during these changes. The study provides a framework for understanding how the enzyme's shape changes when it becomes active.
Researchers studied why some plant hybrids between different types of Arabidopsis plants don't survive. They found a gene called TT2, which is active in the mother plant, controls this. When TT2 is missing, the hybrids are more likely to survive. TT2 is a transcription factor, which means it helps turn other genes on or off. The team mapped TT2 to a specific spot in the plant's DNA and found that when it's missing, the hybrids are more likely to live. They also found that the endosperm, a part of the seed, is affected when TT2 is missing. This suggests that TT2 is important for the plant's development. The team thinks that TT2 could be the reason why some plants can't hybridize with others. They also found that TT2 is active in the mother plant, not the father, which is unusual. This means the mother's genes are important for the hybrid's survival.
Researchers studied the co-evolution of bacteria and their hosts in bats and rodents using Bartonella and Leptira as models. They analyzed genetic data from 51 Bartonella genotypes in 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella in 38 rodents, and 26 Leptira in 20 bats. The results showed significant coevolution between Bartonella and their bat hosts and rodent hosts. However, the relationship between Leptira and bats was not significant. Separate analysis of New and Old World data yielded the same results. Event-based cophyeny was used to reconstruct evolutionary histories of pathogens and hosts. Leptira bats had the most host switches, while Bartonella had the fewest. Bartonella in bats and rodents showed coevolution with minimal host switching, while Leptira bats lacked congruence with host and had many switches. Differences in disease transmission and host ecology may explain variable coevolution patterns. Understanding coevolution and host-switching between pathogens and hosts can predict spillo between mammal reservoirs and humans.
Researchers have developed a new framework to understand how animals like fish and eels move through the water using a "undulatory" motion. This motion involves a wave-like movement of the body that creates forward motion. The question is whether muscle contractions or the fluid around the animal cause this movement is key to understanding how animals swim. A forced oscillation framework was applied to a chain model of undulatory swimming to see how forcing leads to movement. The study found that muscle contractions trigger the first movements of the body, which then create forward motion. Surprisingly, simple patterns can create complex movements that lead to swimming. The frequency of muscle contractions relative to the natural movement of the body is important for the shape of the body during swimming. This approach also helps understand the best movement for fast swimming. Results from a chain model were confirmed by computer simulations. Previous research on the best stiffness for speed is explained. 

A chain model of undulatory swimming was used to see how movement emerges from forcing. The system is forced by muscles, fluid, or both. Deformations from muscles and fluid are not separated. The system is forced by muscles, fluid, or both. The forced oscillation framework was applied to undulatory to understand movement from muscle or fluid forcing. For muscle activation, the frequency relative to the natural of the oscillator is important for the body deformation. Quantitatively, how muscle work is used in deformation and dissipated into fluid is shown. A expression for swimming velocity is derived from the equations. Movement of undulatory swimmers starts from muscle activation. Two issues are in undulatory. First, muscle to deformation. Second, deformation to movement. The forced oscillation is presented, then used to generate motion. Examples of active and passive swimming are presented, including why typical motions involve lower modes. The pathway of power during swimming is discussed.
Researchers have found that genetic recombination between the parasite that causes sleeping sickness in humans, Trypanosoma brucei, and those found in animals can create new strains that can infect humans. This is similar to how the 2009 flu pandemic, which came from a mix of swine and human flu viruses. They tested if recombination between two subspecies of Tryosoma bruce, one that infects humans and one that doesn't, could create new strains. A single gene, S, is key to infectivity in humans, can be transferred to the non-infective subspecies through reproduction. They followed the transfer of this gene in genetically engineered parasites through tse flies and found it was easily transferred, creating new human-infect strains. These new strains didn't show reduced growth or transmissibility. The gene S is crucial for survival in humans, but found in only one copy in most strains. It's on chromosome IV in most, but some Ugandan strains have it on both. The gene's mobility explains the variability of the parasite in East Africa. New strains are being created by recombination with animal-infect parasites, posing a risk for future outbreaks.
Researchers studied how electrical connections between cells in the pancreas, called gap junctions, affect insulin production in people with Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM), a condition where the body can't produce enough insulin. Gap junctions help coordinate insulin release in response to high blood sugar levels and suppress release at low levels. They found that reduced gap junctions lead to increased insulin and calcium levels, a key for insulin release, in people with NDM caused by mutations in ATP-sensitive potassium channels. A computer model predicted that reducing gap junctions can recover insulin and calcium levels in people with these mutations. Experiments validated the model and showed that reducing gap junctions improved insulin and calcium levels in people with NDM. The study suggests that gap junctions play a role in worsening diabetes caused by mutations and that reducing them may help recover function. It also found that noise, or randomness in cell behavior, plays a role in recovering insulin and calcium levels when gap junctions are reduced. The study provides new understanding of how the pancreas works as a group of cells and how gap junctions contribute to diabetes. It also suggests potential new treatments for NDM and other forms of diabetes caused by genetic mutations.
Researchers have developed a framework to predict the behavior of complex gene networks by accounting for a phenomenon called retroactivity, which affects how a module's performance changes when connected to other modules. The framework uses three matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity, which can be calculated from measurable parameters like dissociation constants and promoter concentrations. Internal retroactivity measures the effect of intramolecular connections on a module's dynamics, while scaling and mixingactivity how intermodule connections change dynamics. By analyzing modules in isolation, the framework can predict how loading affects behavior of interconnected modules. The researchers applied this to network motifs like autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, toggle, and single motif. They also created a metric to measure a module's robustness to interconnection with other modules, useful for evaluating natural networks and designing synthetic systems to minimize retroactivity.
Researchers have studied the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the human X and Y chromosomes, a region that has evolved rapidly and is crucial for proper separation of X and Y chromosomes during male meiosis. They found that the PAR1 region has an exceptionally high crossover rate, 17 times higher than the genome average, but the mechanism behind this is unknown. A recent study in mice suggested that crossovers in PAR may be independent of the protein PRDM9, which localizes crossovers in autosomes. To investigate recombination in this region, researchers created a fine-scale map of crossovers using African-American pedigrees and analyzed recombination rates from linkage disequilibrium in human populations. They also identified PRDM binding sites in human cells using ChIP-seq. Contrary to mice, PRDM does not localize recombination peaks in human PAR. Recombination is more rapid and intense in PAR than autosomes and hotspot activities differ among human populations. They also found that PAR hotspot positions changed between humans and chimpanzees with no shared hotspots.
Scientists have discovered a new form of an enzyme called Δ-JMJD2 that plays a crucial role in the development of skeletal muscle tissue. This enzyme, a part of the histone demethylase family, helps remove chemical marks on histone proteins that silence genes. In muscle cells called myoblasts, specific genes are turned off by these marks, including the gene for the protein myogenic factor myogen (My). To start muscle development, the My gene must be turned on. However, how this happens was unclear. Researchers found that ΔMJD2, lacking the N-terminal demethyl domain, increases during myoblast to myotube transformation. Genome-wide analysis and siRNA knockdown showed ΔM2 is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression. Moreover, it promotes MyD-induced conversion of NIH3T3 cells into muscle cells. ChIP-chip analysis showed ΔM binds mainly to genes involved in transcriptional control and this is linked to activation. ΔM is recruited to the My promoter at the start of differentiation, promoting demethylation of H3me and H3. The study concludes ΔM induction is crucial for muscle development by removing repressive chromatin marks at the My promoter, promoting My expression and contributing to muscle-specific expression. Further, Δ acts as a coactivator for many genes during muscle differentiation and binds to the My promoter to regulate H9 methylation, allowing My expression and myotube differentiation.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) is in its final stages, with only 25 cases reported in 2016, but global eradication requires certification by the World Health Organization (WHO) of absence of transmission in all countries. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the GWEP when the number of cases is low and cost per case is high. Using data from the GW, we estimate the cost of implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages. We model cost-effectiveness from 1986-203 and compare to two scenarios: doing nothing (no intervention since 1986) and control (only surveillance and response 201-203). The GW cost an estimated $11.95 (4.70-12.49) per case averted in 198-203. The pre-cert and certification phases cost $0.004 and $0.001 per capita per year. The GW is more cost-effective than control by 203 and certainly cost-effective if willing to pay $0.10 for a year of life without risk of GWD. Even if costs are twice as high, the GW will be cost-effective relative to nothing.
Researchers studied the protein BB32 from the Lyme disease-causing bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which helps the bacteria evade the human immune system's complement system. They found that the carbox-terminal part of the protein, called BB32-C, binds to a key enzyme in the complement system called C1, preventing it from working properly. The team then looked at similar proteins from other Lyme disease-causing bacteria, B afii and B garii, and found that they also bind to C1, but not as well as BB32. They created a new protein that combined parts of BB32 and Bii, and found it worked like Bii's protein. To understand how BB32 works, they solved its 3D structure and found it has a unique shape that lets it bind to C1. They also found that BB32 only binds to the part of C that has the enzyme. This study helps us understand how Lyme disease bacteria evade the immune system and may lead to new treatments.
Researchers have discovered a new way that the fungus Candida albicans, a common human pathogen, changes from a harmless to disease-causing form. They found that a protein called F2 is regulated by two kinases, Cdc28 and C1, in a way that's different from its normal function in cell growth. When F2 is phosphorylated, it promotes genes that help the fungus cause disease, such as interacting with host cells and forming biofilms. This change happens before the fungus starts to grow hyphae, a long branching structure that helps it infect. The researchers found that F2 is phosphorylated at specific sites by C28 and C1, and that changing these sites to non-phosphorylatable alanine stops the transformation to hypha. They also found that F2 interacts with a chromatin modifier P3 in a phosphorylation-dependent way, showing how phosphorylation regulates its specificity. This study reveals a new way the fungus changes from harmless to disease-causing form.
Researchers have found that the enzyme thymidine kinase (TK) is essential for the growth and infectivity of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, a pathogen that causes sleeping sickness in humans and animals. TK is one of several enzymes that help make pyrim nucleides, the building blocks of DNA and RNA, from scratch. Unlike humans, Trypanosoma bruce lacks an enzyme called dCMP deamin (DD) that helps make dUMP, another pyrimide. Without DD, the parasite relies on TK to make dUMP. Surprisingly, researchers found that TK is crucial for making thym nucleides, even if they come from the salvage pathway or de novo. They also found that the parasite has an unknown enzyme that converts deoxypyrim nucleides to their corresponding nucleosides, leading to a buildup in TK-depleted cells. This discovery could lead to a new way to target the parasite with a single drug.
Scientists have long known that a specific sequence called the Shine-Dalgarn sequence is necessary for the ribosome to bind to messenger RNA (mRNA) and start translating it into a protein. However, many genes do not have this sequence, and it was unclear how the ribosome finds the start point to begin translation. Researchers searched through various prokary genomes and found that mRNAs without Shine-Darn sequences are less structured in the area where translation starts and have a minimum folding at the start codon. They created reporter genes in bacteria to test and found that RNA being unfolded is necessary for the ribosome to recognize the start cod in Shine-Darn-independent translation. They also found that start codons are in single-stranded regions, while internal codons are in structured areas of the mRNA. This suggests that the absence of secondary structure is necessary and sufficient for Shine-Darn-independent translation to occur. This provides a possible explanation for how the start site is recognized in the absence of a rib-binding site.
Researchers studied 874 patients with visceral leishmanias (VL) in Bihar, India, who received 20mg/kg liposomal amphotin B (Ambisome) as first-line treatment. They found that 24 (0.3%) developed post-kala dermal leishiasis (PKDL), a skin disorder that occurs in up to 10% of VL patients in India. PKDL symptoms appeared 1.2 years (0.8-2.2) after treatment, with macular lesions in 89% of cases. No risk factors for PKDL were identified, but time to developing PKDL was shorter with Ambis compared to a subset treated with sodium stibogluconate. In a large cohort of VL patients in Bihar treated with 20/kg Ambis, PKDL appears infrequent with no predictive factors.
Researchers studied the re-infestation of Triatoma infans, the main vector of Chagas disease, in three villages in northwest Argentina after a community-wide insecticide spraying in 1992. They used continuous and discrete-time models to analyze infestation levels and found a 6-month lag between detection and dispersal events. New bug populations established more frequently from May to November than November, coinciding with increased dispersal distance. The probability of new establishment increased with time since last infestation. These findings challenge current understanding of T. infans ecology and highlight gaps in knowledge. Experiments are needed to close these gaps.

The study used discrete and continuous Markov models for site transitions from uninfested to infested and vice versa, showing seasonality in bug establishment and dispersal. Three aspects of T. infans control were addressed: establishment rate of new populations by distance from existing, seasonality, and effect of insecticide and previous infestation. A continuous model estimated within-season changes and time-dependent effects of spraying, but requires assumptions about disperser sources. The contribution of each site to establishment was estimated by interpolating bugs between t and t+1.

Current Chagas control relies on screening donors and suppressing the vector, but resources are limited in rural areas. Understanding spatial and temporal insecticide application maximizes efficiency is unknown. This study shows individual site properties like distance, infestation history, and spraying contribute to establishment rate. Optimizing control timing requires understanding seasonality of dispersal intensity and distance, not just duration.
Researchers studied the effects of a virus called polyomavirus SV40 (SV40) on Syrian hamsters, a common animal model for studying this virus. They found that SV40 infects many tissues, including the liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain, with the kidney being the main site for long-term infection. The virus was also found in the liver, but to a lesser extent. The study showed that SV40 microRNA, a type of genetic material, is expressed in infected tissues and helps reduce virus levels in infected cells. However, it does not affect the virus's ability to cause cancer in hamsters. The researchers also found that SV40 has a broad range of tissues it can infect and replicate in, and that the kidney is the main site for long-term infection.
Researchers have conducted the most comprehensive genome-wide examination of positively selected genes in mammals to date, using high-coverage assemblies of eutherian mammals. The study found around 400 genes with significant evidence of positive selection in at least two species, and an additional 144 in specific lineages or clades. Identified genes were enriched in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but also in specific functions like complement immunity and taste. Several pathways were enriched with positively selected genes, suggesting co-evolution of interacting genes. A Bayesian analysis showed most positively selected genes switched between selection and non-selection, indicating positive is often episodic. Genes expressed in spleen, testes, liver, and breast were enriched, but not in brain. The study provides evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and insights into functional implications.
Staphylococcus aureus is a type of bacteria that can cause infections on the skin and mucous membranes of mammals. It often forms communities called biofilms that are hard to get rid of. Researchers found a new type of fiber that helps keep S. aureus biofilms together. This fiber is made of small peptides called phenol modulins (PSM). Without PS, S. aureus biofilms fall apart easily when exposed to enzymes or stress. Previous studies showed PS help break down biofilms, but this study shows soluble PS disperse bio while polymerized PS do not. This means PS aggregation into fibers changes their role in biofilms. 

S. aureus biofilms have polysaccharides and DNA that interact with proteins. Researchers found that under certain conditions, S. aureus makes amyloid fibers that keep biofilms together. These fibers are made of several PS. They look and act like amyloids in other bacteria like E. coli, B. subtilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Chemical and genetic analysis showed fibers are made of PS. Ordered PS into amyloid fibers stop bio disassembly as single PS do. This suggests PS modulate bio using amyloid aggregation. This is the first report of extracellular fibers in S. aureus. Results show amyloid can regulate PS activity in biofilms. S. aure PS can be found in biofilms as fibers, changing their activity and function.
Researchers have developed a new method to monitor the persistence of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, in infected individuals. The disease affects over 6 million people in more than 20 countries, mainly in Latin America. Current methods to check for the parasite in the blood have limitations, such as low levels of the parasite in the blood. A new antibody, called Ab3, was found to be strongly associated with the parasite presence of T. cruzi in the body. High levels of Ab3 were found in patients with the parasite, while low levels were found in patients who were treated and cleared of the parasite. Ab3 is a new biomarker that can help monitor the parasite in patients. It is thought that Ab3 is made by the immune system in response to parasites that are not detectable by blood tests. Measuring Ab3 could help monitor the status of infected patients.
Chikungunya virus (CHV) is an arthrogenic alphavirus that causes fever and severe joint and muscle pain, with chronic musculoskeletal pain persisting in some patients for months to years after infection. Researchers wanted to understand what causes chronic disease. They created a recombinant CHV that expresses Cre recombinase (CH-C), which replicated in myoblast and fibroblasts and induced arthritis in mice. Importantly, it also caused chronic disease with persistent RNA and myitis and synovitis similar to wild-type CHV. A reporter mice infected with CH-C showed a population of cells that persisted for at least 112 days. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry revealed these cells were myofib and dermal muscle fibbl. Treating with an antibody against Mra, a host receptor for CHV, reduced the number of cells and diminished levels of RNA, implicating them as reservoir of chronic RNA. Isolation and cytometry of cells from skin and ankle showed they harbor most persistent CHV RNA. This system identifies cells that survive CHV in vivo and are enriched with persistent CHV RNA, useful for studying pathogenesis in acute and chronic disease.
Researchers have been using dimension reduction methods to understand how the complex structure of brain activity leads to brain function. However, it's unclear how these results apply to recordings with many neurons or trials. To address this, scientists applied factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and network models that generate activity through balance of excitation and inhibition. They compared the scaling of two key dimension reduction outputs - shared dimension and variance - with neuron count. The results showed that networks with clustered connectivity differed and in vivo recordings matched the clustered network. Recordings of tens of neurons were enough to identify dominant variability that generalizes to larger parts of the network. These findings can help interpret dimension reduction in limited neurons and trials and relate to underlying structure.
Researchers have discovered that a molecule called 2-aminoacetophen (2-AA), produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, plays a crucial role in modulating the host's immune response to infection. Unlike other molecules that suppress the immune system, 2-AA actually increases the host's ability to cope with the pathogen, leading to a 90% survival rate in treated mice compared to 10% in non-treated mice. The molecule activates key immune pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear factor NF-κ, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but also dampens the immune response by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. Pretreatment with 2-AA leads to a transcriptional block of c-J N-terminal kinase and NFκ activation, while preserving extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 activation. This results in the formation of a complex that prevents NFκ activation. The molecule's ability to dampen inflammation while increasing survival and pathogen persistence is linked to its ability to signal bacteria to switch to a chronic infection mode. The study reveals a new immunomodulatory signal that promotes aspects of interking communication, suggesting it facilitates pathogen persistence while enabling host tolerance to infection.
Researchers have studied the L1-DT1 gene, a domesticated from a LINE-1 retroelement, in mammals. They found that L1T1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. L1T1 has evolved under positive selection in primate and mouse, and prosimian L1 has replenished itself with a recent L1 ORF from the prosian genome. This suggests L1 has been selected for novelty, possibly for genome defense. L1 loss is associated with L extinction in several megab lineages, but not in sigmodine rodents. The study highlights the role of retroelement domestication in mammalian biology and that domesticated genes can adopt different functions in lineages. The L1-D1 gene has been conserved since its birth, with a bipart double-ORF organization. It has been lost at least three times during placental evolution. The origin of L1 dates to 106 million years ago, making it more ancient than domesticated retrogenes syncin and F1. Human L1 plays a role in pluripotency, but L1 has been lost in some lineages and selected for in others. The study suggests L1 could have evolved for defense against L elements, then incorporated into plurotency in some line.
Researchers have discovered that a highly conserved bacterial protein called RNase Y is essential for the bacteria Vibrio cholera, a pathogen that causes cholera. This protein plays a crucial role in regulating stress, RNA processing, and ribosome quality. Unlike in E. coli, where RNase Y is not essential, its loss makes the bacteria more sensitive to stress. The study found that RNase Y is an endoribuclease in Vibrio cholera and crucial for virulence, stress, RNA processing, and ribosome control. It's part of a set of essential RNases in many pathogens. To understand its function, researchers analyzed RNA and ribosome profiles of Vibrio cholera partially depleted of RNase Y and other RN associated with 16 rRNA processing. Results show RNase is also crucial for 16 rRNA 3 maturation in Vibrio and its depletion impedes subunit assembly into 70 ribosomes. RNase's importance to Vibrio pathogenesis was demonstrated by loss of colonization, biofilm formation, reduced toxin production, and altered expression of virulence small RNAs. Notably, RNase genes from distant pathogens can complement E. coli strain under stress, showing conservation of RNase activity. This study provides first exploration of RNase physiological role in human pathogen, showing conserved function across species in cellular processes.
Researchers studied the structure of human transcription factor networks (TF) to understand how they respond to genetic and environmental changes. These networks are made up of nodes (transcription factors) and edges (regulatory interactions) between them. A key property of these networks is assortativity, which measures how nodes with similar numbers of edges connect. Four components form an assortativity signature, but little is known about its effect on network robustness. Theoretical work suggests increasing one component leads to increased robustness, but this is unclear in real-world networks. The study used DNase-seq data to measure assortativity in 41 human cell types and found a common signature that confers robustness. Each component's contribution to robustness was also determined. Theoretical models with increased assortativity show increased robustness to mutations and gene duplication. This is due to smaller subgraphs and longer paths, which dampen mutation effects. The study suggests considering assortativity in network design to advance understanding. Biological networks have multiple sources of robustness, including degree distribution and autoregulatory subgraphs. Assortativity provides an additional source and human TF share a common signature that confers robustness.
Researchers studied how populations of inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the brain's sensory cortex process information from sensory stimuli. They recorded the activity of up to 74 neurons at a time in an anesthetized rats using 128-electrode arrays. The study found that individual inhibitory neurons, identified by their unique spike patterns, could distinguish between different stimuli better than excitatory neurons in certain layers. Groups of inhibitory neurons together provided as much information as groups of the 20 most informative excitatory neurons, but with less redundancy. This suggests that inhibitory neurons play a key role in processing sensory information in the brain. Inhibitory neurons were more precise in their responses to stimuli and had less redundancy than excitatory neurons. The study suggests that inhibitory neurons dominate the flow of information to the cortex, efficiently processing sensory activity.
Scientists have been trying to create living cells that can perform new functions by reprogramming them like computers. They started with transcription factors, but regulatory RNAs have gained attention due to their ability to be programmed. However, circuits made with RNAs are limited. Researchers engineered a fundamental logic unit to add two bits of information in a living cell, encoding the result as fluorescence. The system uses post-transcription control with small RNAs and alloster transcription factors to sense signals. This shows RNAs can be key in synthetic biology and paves the way for more complex biocomputers using this circuit as a building block.
Scientists have been trying to understand how a protein called cytidine 5'-nucleotidase II (c-II) helps cancer cells grow and resist treatment. This protein breaks down a type of molecule called 6-hydroxypine nucleide 5-monophate. High levels of c-II are linked to poor treatment outcomes in cancer patients. Researchers looked for compounds that could stop c-II from working. They made a class of chemicals called ribonucleide phosphates with a stable phosphorus-carbon bond instead of a regular phosphoester bond. Six of these compounds were better at binding to c-II than its natural substrate, inosine 5-monophosphate. Studying purine and pyrimidine analogues and modifying the phosphon chain helped define rules for strong binding. Computer simulations showed three c-II residues, Phe 157, His 209, and Tyr 210, play a key role in binding. Experiments confirmed this by measuring c-II activity with the best phosphon analogues. These compounds stopped c-II at 2mM. This study shows the importance of a non-hydrolysable phosphon bond in new c-II inhibitors and hydrophobic stacking by three residues.
A recent study has found that milk and colostrum from sheep incubating scrapie, a type of transmissible spong encephalopathy, contain infectious prions. This is the first time prion infectivity has been detected in dairy products from affected ruminants. The research found that prion protein was present in the mammary glands of scrap-affected ewes, even before clinical symptoms appeared. It was also found in lactal ducts and mammary acini. The prion was only present in ewes with mammary ectopic lymph follicles, caused by Ma lentivirus infection. However, infectivity was also found in milk and colostrum from ewes with healthy mammary glands and those with lymphoproliferative mastitis. Bioassay showed that prion was present in cellular, cream, and caseinhey fractions of milk and colstrum. In a mouse model, the highest infectious titre was equivalent to 6g of brain from a terminally scrap-affected ewe. The study suggests that colstr and milk from ruminants with T could contribute to T transmission, either directly or through milk in animal feed. This raises concerns about risk to humans from ovine and T-susceptible dairy products.
During the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in Liberia, researchers analyzed data from 16,370 laboratory samples collected between April 2014 and March 2015. They found 10,536 individuals were tested, with 3,897 confirmed positive for the Ebola virus. The study showed differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases that tested negative for the virus. Young children and elderly and rural residents were at higher risk of death. The fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63% during the study. This data can help future investigations and understanding of the outbreak in Liberia.
Researchers have studied the catalytic mechanism of tyrosase, an enzyme that converts phenol to orthoquinone, with the help of a protein called "cadd". They found that a specific residue in the add protein, Tyr98, is converted to a quinone through the formation of a copper intermediate. Despite previous studies, the exact mechanism was unclear. High-resolution crystal structures revealed a new step: movement of copper triggers hydroxylation and rearrangement of copper ligands, placing the hydroxyl group in a position for electrophilic attack. UV and Raman spectroscopy confirmed the quin formation through intermediates. The researchers propose a mechanism where copper movement and proton state trigger intermediates, and the quin is separated from the enzyme.
Researchers have studied the early stages of ribosome production in eukaryotic cells, specifically the formation of the large ribosomal subunit. They focused on the first precursor to the large subunit, called the pre-60 particle, which contains 30 assembly factors (AFs) including RNA helicases. These helicases drive conformation rearrangements, but lack specificity in vitro and their roles are unknown. The Dbp helicase is essential for normal pre-60 accumulation in yeast and associates with a complex of four AFs: N1, N2, N8, and R3. Tand affinity purifications show N forms the backbone of the complex. N and N directly bind Dbp and is essential for Db insertion within pre- particles. In vivo cross-linking analysis maps N binding sites on 25 rRNA adjacent to helices of the first and last structure. This suggests N and Dbp function in formation of helices which creates the core of the subunit structure. N also crosslinks snoRNAs in decoding and peptid transfer center. Data suggest Dbp and play key roles in compaction of core 25 r and control sno-rRNA interactions.
Researchers have long known that adapting to a changing environment requires adjusting the rate of learning to match the rate of change. However, the brain mechanisms behind this process are not well understood. Catecholamines, such as norepinephrine and dopamine, are thought to play a role in this process due to their effects on brain activity in response to stimuli. A new study used scalp electrophysiology and computational modeling to examine the role of cateolamines in learning. The study found that the P component of the EEG, a measure of cateolamine release in the cortex, predicted learning rate and mediated the effect of unexpected outcomes on learning. This suggests that cateamines help incorporate new information into beliefs about the environment. The study also found that manipulating cateamine activity affected learning in response to unexpected changes, depending on individual's initial learning rate. These findings provide evidence for a role of cateamines in regulating learning in response to environmental change.
Researchers implemented a syndrom surveillance system called EPIC in two rural villages in Senegal to monitor infectious diseases diagnosed by Point-Of-Care (POC) laboratories. From 2010 to 2016, two POC laboratories were set up in the Salm region of Senegal, and EPIC was used to analyze data from the Tim hospital laboratory in Marseille, France. The goal was to see if EPIC could work with data from rural POC in Senegal. Over five years, 2,577 patient samples from 775 patients were tested in the Diel and Ndi POC, and 739 were positive for at least one pathogen. EPIC generated 443 alarms. In another village, Niak, 316 samples from 298 patients were tested, and 56 were positive. EPIC generated 14 alarms. EPIC was successful in using data from two POC in Senegal, but needs improvement.
Researchers studied how cells in blood vessels, called endothelial cells, respond to a chemical signal called histamine. They found that the way these cells respond depends on how they are arranged. When cells are alone or in a single layer, they react differently to histamine than when they are in a network with other cells. The researchers used a special tool called micropatter to create networks of cells and watched how they reacted to histamine. They saw that cells in networks had calcium waves, or oscillations, that were not seen in single cells or layers. This was due to how cells talk to each other through special connections called gap junctions. The more cells in the network, the less the oscillations happened. The researchers also found that these oscillations affect how cells move and change shape in response to histamine. The study shows that cells in blood vessels can sense and respond to chemicals based on how they are arranged, which is important for how they work in the body.
Researchers studied the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a major cause of lower respiratory disease in infants, to understand how the body's immune system responds to it. They used a technique called whole-fragment display libraries to identify areas on the virus's surface that trigger an immune response. The study found multiple sites on the virus's G protein that trigger an immune response, not just the central conserved cysteine domain. To see if these sites are important for protection, they made proteins without the central domain and tested them in rabbits and mice. Results showed these proteins triggered an immune response and bound to the virus, but didn't neutralize it as well as the full protein. Mice vaccinated with these proteins were protected from the virus, with lower viral loads in the nose and lungs. The study suggests multiple sites on the G protein outside the conserved domain contribute to protection against RSV.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the splicing component b2 (b2) in the specification of Drosophila neuropeideric neurons, specifically the Tv4 neurons in the ventral nerve cord. During embryonic development, Tv neurons receive a signal from their target cells, which triggers the activation of the FMa gene. A genetic screen identified b2 and Pr8, components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome, as involved in Tv specification. This study focused on the role of RNA processing in target-derived signaling and found that b2 and Pr8 control the expression of the FM neuropeptide in Tv neurons. Analysis of b2 revealed two mechanisms: proper axonal pathfinding to receive the BMP ligand and proper splicing of genes in the BMP pathway, thickins (tk) and Medea. These results show involvement of RNA in diversifying neuronal identity in the central nervous system.
Researchers have discovered a new way that the body controls the levels of certain proteins called F-box proteins, which are part of a group of enzymes called SCF ubiquitin ligases. These enzymes play a crucial role in many diseases, including cancer, and their misregulation can lead to problems. One way to control F-box levels is through a process called autocatalytic ubiqulation, where the SC complex breaks down the protein. However, a new study found another way to control F-box levels, specifically for a protein called Met30, which is separate from the SC complex. This new pathway requires a different part of the SC called Cdc/Cul, but not the main part Sk1. This pathway is important for keeping chromosomes stable and protecting against heavy metal stress. It also assigns a new function to a group of SC ubiquitin ligases that includes C53/C34, but is separate from Sk1.
Kines-3 motors, such as mammalian KIF1, drive the transport of synaptic vesicles and other membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells. In the absence of cargo, Kines motors are inactive to prevent motility and ATP hydrolysis. Current models suggest that Kines-3 motor KIF1 is monomeric in the inactive state and activation results from concentration-driven dimerization on the membrane. However, researchers found that both native and expressed KIF1 proteins are dimeric in the inactive state, contradicting this model. Instead, K1 motors are autoinhibited by two distinct mechanisms, suggesting a new model for activation of dimer K1 motors by cargo binding. Successive truncations result in moneric and dimer motors that undergo one-dimensional diffusion along microtub lattice, but only dimer motors undergo ATP-dependent processive motility. K1 may be uniquely suited for both diffuse and processive motility to drive long-distance transport in neuronal cells.
Researchers studied the regulation of seed metabolism in tomatoes by analyzing the metabolites of 76 different tomato lines grown in two seasons. They found 30 metabolite trait loci (QTL) and high variability in amino acid content, but seasonal fluctuations in sugars. Analysis showed that genetic background, not environment or tissue influenced metabolic polymorphism. Seeds had greater phenotypic plasticity than the M82 tomato cultivar. Heritability suggested different modes of inheritance for seed and fruit metabolites. Metabolic network analysis showed seed dependence on amino acids, sugars, and organic acids. Six highly regulated amino acids were identified: Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro, confirmed by QTL mapping. The study revealed redundancy in seed regulation, coordination with fruit metabolism, and centrality of amino acids in seed network. Integrating metabolic analysis with QTL mapping highlighted its value.
Vibrio cholera, a bacterial pathogen that colonizes the chitinous exoskeleton of zooplankton and the human gastrointestinal tract, uses a protein called N-acetylucosamine binding protein (Gbp) to attach to different surfaces. Researchers studied the structure of Gbp and found it has an unusual, elongated four-domain shape with two domains similar to chitin binding domains. They discovered that Gbp binds to GlcNA oligosacides and showed that domains 1 and 4 of Gbp interact with chitin in vitro, while domain 1 is crucial for mucin and intestinal colonization. Bacterial studies revealed domains 2 and 3 bind to Vibrio cholera surface. Mouse virulence assays showed only the first three domains of Gbp are required for colonization. This explains how Gbp provides structural and functional interactions between Vibrio, intestinal epithelium, and chinous exoskeleton.
Researchers studied how the immune system's response to tuberculosis (TB) and found that a specific type of immune cell, called HLA-DR+CD4 effector T cells, is resistant to suppression by another type of immune cell called regulatory T cells. This resistance allows the HLA-DR+ cells to contribute to inflammation and worsen the disease. The study found that these cells are more active in people with TB and are resistant to regulation by regulatory cells, which normally keep the immune response in check. The HLA+ cells also produce more Th1/Th17 cytokines, which can counterbalance regulatory cells and make them less effective. Blocking certain pathways, CCR and PD1, showed that HLA+ cells are resistant to suppression by regulatory cells. The study provides new insight into how HLA+ cells contribute to TB and may be a marker for disease monitoring and treatment response.
Researchers studied mice that lack a protein called PrP, which is linked to the cell membrane by a special anchor called GPI. These mice are susceptible to prion infection but accumulate a different form of prion, called PrSc, outside the cell. The scientists wanted to see if these mice could spread prions despite the unusual location of PrSc. They found that two types of prions, RML and ME, but not 22, spread in these mice and developed new properties. Surprisingly, the levels of a stable prion form, PrPres, in R and ME-infected mice were 25 times higher than in normal mice. When returned to normal mice, ME prions recovered their original properties, but R prions gave rise to a new strain, S, which stayed the same even after three passages in normal mice. This suggests that R and S prions are separated by a high energy barrier, which is broken in GPI mice.
In the fruit fly embryo, the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in patterning the dorsal-ventral axis during development. The pathway is mediated by the transcription factor Mad and opposed by the repressor Brinker. Researchers used a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation to study the transcriptional network underlying the differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm in response to BMP signaling. They identified multiple target genes, including positive and negative regulators of the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) signaling. Manipulation of EGF levels showed it negatively regulates embryonic BMP transcription. The BMP network has a self-regulating property, balancing its activity with the antagonistic EGF pathway for correct patterning. The study also found key roles for the Zelda and Zerkünt transcription factors in establishing the expression domain and widespread binding of insulator proteins to Mad and Brinker-bound regions. Analysis of embryos lacking the BE-32 insulator showed reduced transcription of a BMP target gene and fewer amios cells specified by BMP signaling. The findings suggest a model for Mad-dependent activation and its relevance to signal interpretation in vertebrates.
In Tunisia, cases of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major are increasing and spreading from the south to new areas in the center. To improve current knowledge on L major evolution and dynamics, researchers performed multi-locus microsatellite typing of isolates from Tunisian governorates where the disease is endemic (Gaf, Kairan, and Sidi Bouid). Analysis of results shows that over two decades, in same area, Leish parasites evolved generating genetically differentiated populations. Genetic patterns of 200-201 isolates from three governorates indicate L major did not spread from south to center Tunisia according geographical, suggesting human activities source the disease expansion. Genotype analysis suggests flows between governorates and districts, human activities, reservoir, and environmental changes explain disease progression. This study provides insights into evolution and spread L in Tunisia, improving understanding parasite between geographically and temporally distinct populations.

Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of anthelmint chemotherapy and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in reducing helmin infections among HIV-infected adults in Kenya. They found that deworming with albendazole and prazantel significantly reduced the odds of infection with any helmin species by 89%. However, access to safe flooring and latrines offered additional protection, reducing the odds by 34% and 59% respectively. For schistosiasis, treatment with prantel was protective. Among individuals not treated with albend or prant, safe flooring and latrine access reduced the odds of infection by 34 and 59%. There was no evidence of synergy or antagonism between anthint chemotherapy and W resources. The study suggests dewing is effective in reducing helmin infections among HIV-infected adults, with W offering minimal additional benefit except for flooring.
Scientists have discovered the structure of a protein called LlpW from a bacterium Pseudomonas putida that can kill certain plant pathogens. This protein, called a lectin-like bacteriocin, has two parts: a mannose-binding domain and a beta-hair extension. The mannose-binding domain is similar to those found in plant lectins and binds to sugar molecules. Mutations show that this part is crucial for killing bacteria. The other part, called N-domain, has a different structure and doesn't bind sugar, but determines which bacteria the protein kills. Experiments with engineered versions of this protein showed that the N-domain decides which bacteria to target. This protein is made of two parts that evolved to do different jobs: recognizing and being toxic to bacteria. 

Lectins are a family of proteins with two mannose-binding domains found in plants and some bacteria. This is the first time one found in a bacterium. It's part of a group of proteins involved in defense. The protein kills bacteria, but it's not clear what makes it specific to certain bacteria. Some plant lectins have sugar-binding sites and are involved in defense against insects, fungi, and viruses. They can even kill cancer cells and are found in mucus and epithelial cells, suggesting a protective role.
Researchers have made a groundbreaking discovery about the process of sporulation in Bacillus subtilis, a type of bacteria. During sporulation, the bacteria form a spore, or forespore, within a mother cell. The scientists found that a protein called σG, which regulates the foresore's development, relies on eight proteins from the SpoII operon and a protein SpoQ. These proteins are similar to those found in specialized secretion systems that help move molecules across cell membranes. One of these proteins, SpoIA, has an ATPase activity, which is necessary for σ's activity and spore formation. The researchers also discovered that SpoIA and SpoQ form a complex that spans the membrane surrounding the foresore. Without this complex, the foresore becomes misshapen and collapses. Importantly, maintaining the foresore's shape doesn't require σ's activity. This suggests that the SpoIA-SpoQ complex is a novel secretion apparatus that helps the mother cell care for the foresore, keeping it healthy and active during spore formation. The team found that SpoIA has similarities to ATPases in type II and IV secretion systems, and that its ATP motifs are necessary for σ activity and spore formation. They propose that the SpoIA-SpoQ complex is made from components of various secretion systems found in Gram-negative bacteria. The study shows that SpoIA, SpoQ, and ATP motifs in SpoIA are necessary for fores integrity. Without them, the fores becomes misshap and collapses.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants linked to bipolar disorder (BD), a highly heritable and disabling condition affecting 1% of the population. They analyzed data from 1,190 cases and 401 controls, and found no individual genome-wide significant associations, but showed a significant association between the power to detect effects from previous studies and replication (P=1.5×10−7). To rule out a false positive result, they analyzed replication rates in a large meta-analysis of height and found a linear relationship between power and replication. They discovered that SNPs near exons have a greater probability of replication, suggesting an enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. This indicates that common genetic variation near exons (±10kb) could be identified in larger studies, providing a framework for assessing replication when combining results from multiple studies.
Scientists have been trying to understand how cells grow and divide for a long time, especially in the context of cancer. Previous studies have used a method called knockdown to see how genes affect growth, but it has limitations like off-target effects and partial knockdown. Researchers used a new approach to assign a score to each gene based on its expression and growth across 60 cancer cell lines. They found genes that are essential in cancer have a positive score, while tumor suppressors have negative. Processes like cell cycle, DNA, and protein production are linked to cancer growth, while migration is not. Analysis of non-cancer cells shows differences in translation and splicing machinery. A comparison across species shows cancer is like microorganisms, nonancer is not. Combining cancer and nonancer signatures helps predict patient outcome and gene importance in cancer. These results show a difference between cancer and nonancer determinants, which could lead to new cancer drugs.
Cysticercosis (CE) can affect the heart and vena cava, but cases are rare. A study of 11 patients with cardiac and endovascular CE over 15 years (1995-2009) showed main symptoms were thoracic pain and dyspnea, although 2 were asymptomatic. Cysts were mostly in the right atrium and vena cava. 9 had disseminated CE. Echocardiography diagnosed, serology, electrocardiogram, X-ray, CT, MRI, and histology aided diagnosis and follow-up. 9 had surgery and long-term antiparas for 25 months. One died intraoperatively, 2 died 10 and 14 years later due to pulmonary embolism and failure. Patients with cardiac involvement had no complications after surgery and were cured. Those with vena involvement developed PE and complications. Cardio CE is associated with lethal complications. Manifestations vary by location. Isolated cardiac may be cured while endovascular is associated with severe complications.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus uses to evade the human immune system. This mechanism involves a protein called Tir, a mimic of the human Toll-like receptor, which is part of the innate immune system. When expressed in human cells, Tir blocks a key signaling pathway that leads to inflammation, reducing the body's response to infection. In a mouse model of skin infection, Staphlococcus aureus with Tir was less virulent, meaning it caused less damage, than the same bacteria without Tir. The protein was also linked to lower activity of immune cells called neutrophils and macrophages, which fight infection. Tir is located in a part of the Staphlococcus chromosome that gives it resistance to the antibiotic fusidic acid, but not the mec gene that makes it resistant to methicillin. Lower doses of fusidic acid increased Tir expression. Studies found no link between Tir and clinical presentation, but showed an advantage with a specific genetic element that carries Tir.
Researchers studied the development of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and mosquitoes (Anopheles gambia) to understand how their embryos form and grow. They looked at how genes are turned on and off at different times during development. They found that many genes have similar patterns of activity in both species, but some are different. One group of genes is active in the extraembryonic tissue called serosa in mosquitoes, but not in flies. This group is important for making the cuticle, the outer layer of the embryo. Another group of genes is active in flies, but not in mosquitoes, at a specific time called the maternal-zyotic transition. This is when the mother's genetic material is passed to the embryo. The researchers used a new way to group genes based on when and how long they are active to find these differences. They think this method can help find genes that make different species look different.
Researchers investigated the presence of Haemophilus ducreyi and Treponema pallidum subsp pertue, bacteria on the skin of asymptomatic children and household members in villages of Papua New Guinea. The study found that 21% of asymptomatic children had Haemophilus duyi DNA on their skin, and 1% had Treema pallidum sub pertue DNA. The bacteria were also found in 90% of flies and 33% of bed sheets sampled. This is the first time Haophil duyi DNA has been detected on the skin of asymptomatic children and Ha duyi and pertue DNA in flies and bed sheets. The study suggests that the ubiquity of Haophil du in the environment contributes to the spread of the organism.
Bioinformatics is a crucial knowledge base for many careers in biomedical research and healthcare, but there's no agreement on what it entails or how to teach it. The International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee's Curriculum Task Force aimed to create a framework for training and curricula of bioinformatics core competencies that apply to various users and programs. These competencies were developed from employer and program surveys, refined through a multi-year community engagement process. This report presents the current competencies and examples of their use in diverse training contexts, to help others apply and refine them.

A set of core competencies for bioinformatics training was created to assist educators by providing a framework for sharing experiences and best practices in education, despite divergent needs and expectations. The competencies were refined and cases illustrating applications in different bioinformatics and training programs globally are described. Use cases highlight diverse training needs, user types, programs, and settings to illustrate the competencies' value.

Bioinformatics users need a basic understanding of methods and strong interpretation of outputs. The ISCB Committee's Curriculum Force described potential refinement and application of core competencies for groups. Cases show the competencies provide a basis for educators to design, refine, and evaluate training, despite divergent goals and populations. The competencies are not a prescription for curricula or standards, but a basis for common experiences.
Researchers studied the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercalis, which infects over a billion people worldwide, to understand how its development is regulated. They compared it to the free-living nematode Caenorhabdis elegans, which has a similar developmentally arrested larval form called the dauer. The study found that genes involved in the dauer formation in C elegans are also present in S steralis, but with some differences. Genes in the cyclic GMP signaling pathway were upregulated in the developmentally arrested larva of Seralis, but not in Cans. In contrast, genes in the insulin/IG-1 signaling pathway were not as abundant in Seral as in Cans. The study also found seven genes in Seral encoding homologs of the Cans dauer TGF ligand, three of which were only expressed in the developmentally lar. Genes involved in dachronic acid biosynthesis were not upregulated in the development lar. The results suggest that while dauer genes are present in Seral and may play a role in development, there are differences between the two species. Understanding the mechanisms of development may lead to new treatment strategies.
Researchers studied the effects of two bacterial toxins, Cytothal distending toxin (CDT) and colibactin, on cells. These toxins are produced by pathogenic bacteria and can cause cancer. They infected mice and human cells in a lab to see how these toxins affect the cell's nucleus. The results showed that CD and colibin caused the formation of deep invaginations in the nucleus, which are called nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). The core of the NR had ribosomes, proteins that help make mRNA, and parts of the complex that break down mRNA. These areas are active in translation and have high levels of ploidy, and involve MAP and calcium signaling. Data showed that these particles are dynamic and protect the cell until the toxin is gone. The toxins create a gateway for mRNA to be transported and translated in the nucleus. This is new insight into NR formation, a feature of many cancers, not just from DNA damage but also from bacterial toxins.
Researchers used three-dimensional computed tomography (3D) to evaluate the deformation of the upper jawbone (maxilla) in patients with leprosy, a disease that can cause facial deformities. Previous studies have shown that lepro can cause not only nose deformity but also shrinkage of the maxilla, but this has only been visually observed, not measured. The study reconstructed 3D images of the maxilla in 10 patients with lepro and 5 without the disease and measured the length of the front part of the maxilla. The results showed that 3 patients with severe lepro had significant shrinkage of the maxilla, consistent with previous observations of ancient skeletal remains. The study also calculated the exact amount of bone loss, which can help in reconstructive surgery. The use of 3D images made it easier to evaluate the deformity from any angle. The study found that the nasal and upper jawbone were deformed in 4 out of 10 patients. Previous studies have described similar deformities in ancient lepro skeletons, but this is the first time they have been measured. The method can be a tool for reconstructive surgery of max defects caused by lepro. However, the study had a small sample size and more research is needed.
Researchers investigated how the brain represents sounds in the presence of background noise, a major challenge for the auditory system. They found that neurons in the auditory pathway adapt to sound statistics, such as mean and contrast, to create noise-invariant representations. This adaptation increases from the ear to midbrain to cortex. The team tested this by recording responses in ferrets and comparing with a model of the auditory nerve. They found that populations in the periphery are affected by noise, but those in the cortex are not. Adaptation to statistics correlates with noise tolerance, so those that adapt most to statistics are most noise-toler. This suggests adaptation is a key to noise-invariant representations in the brain.

The team measured neural responses to complex sounds in noise, recording from midbrain and cortex and simulating periphery. They found a progressive increase in noise tolerance. Neuron-level and population changes are correlated, suggesting adaptation drives noise-toler representations. As the pathway progresses, responses become independent of noise. They measured how coding in auditory centers is affected by noise, finding a progressive increase in adaptation to altered statistics. By the cortex, populations represent in a noiseoler fashion, responding to common features.

Adaptation to statistics grows along the pathway, populations shift from low-level to mean-contrast information. This is a step towards context-invariant representations seen in higher areas.
Researchers studied how the yeast protein-protein interaction network, or interactome, changes in response to heat shock, a type of cellular stress. They used Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a well-studied organism, since its interactome and stress response are well-characterized. The team calculated changes in interaction weights of the interactome from mRNA levels upon heat shock and found a significant decrease in overlaps and connections of modules. The interactome diameter increased 4.9-fold in heat. Key proteins of the heat response became centers of heat-induced communities and provided residual connections after shock. The changes resembled a "stratus-culus" transition, from a globally connected to multifocal structure. The study showed heat induces partial disintegration of the interact's global organization. This may occur in other stresses and complex systems, such as proteins, social networks, and ecosystems, which decrease intermodular links, form compact modules, and disintegrate globally. The work provides a system-level adaptation mechanism to environmental changes.
Amiodarone, a medication, has been widely used to treat ventricular arrhythmias in patients with Chagas disease, a chronic condition caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, prevalent in Latin America. Researchers conducted a systematic review and individual patient meta-analysis to assess amarone's effect on patients with Chagas cardiomy, a complication of the disease. They searched databases up to January 2018 and included 9 studies, 3 before-after studies, 5 case series, and 1 randomized trial, with a total of 38 patients allowing individual patient data analysis. Amiodone reduced ventricular tachardia episodes by 99.9%, ventricular beats by 93.1%, and ventricular couplets by 79%. Studies without individual data showed similar reductions in ventricular beats, tachardia, and couplets. Amone was associated with corne microdepos 61.1%, gastrointestinal events 16.1, bradycard 12.7, dermatological 10.6, and drug discontinuation 7.6. The quality of evidence was moderate to low. Amone is effective in reducing arrhythmias but lacks evidence for hard endpoints sudden death, hospitalization. The findings support amone use, but balancing benefits and harms are crucial for individual decision-making.
Researchers studied the seasonal patterns of deng fever in rural Ecuador from 2009-2016 using data from two hospitals. They found that deng fever rates varied throughout the year, with peaks in mid-March. Cases were more likely to be diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and less on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays did not affect deng diagnoses, except for an increase on the day after Christmas. School schedules did not impact deng diagnoses in school-aged children. Climate factors, such as total precipitation, temperature, and days, affected deng diagnoses. This study is one of the first to report long-term deng seasonality in Ecuador and one of few from rural patients. The results can inform local disease prevention, public health planning, and global models of d fever trends.
Researchers have discovered a new way to activate the innate immune system, the body's first line of defense against infections, without triggering autoimmunity or chronic inflammation. They found that expressing a specific part of a virus, called Rd, in the absence of other viral proteins, can activate the immune system to fight off infections. This was tested in mice, which showed a dramatic increase in antiviral genes and resistance to lethal viral challenge. The mechanism was found to work through a protein called MDA and is independent of the adaptive immune system. Human cells also showed similar results, with the Rd inducing an antiral network and blocking HIV-1 infection. Importantly, the mice remained healthy with normal longevity. The study provides a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiral protection.
Researchers tested the independent-action hypothesis (IAH) for a plant virus, Tobacco etch virus (TEV), which states that each virion has a probability of infection and virions act independently during the infection process. They found that the number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose and followed a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary foci containing both genotypes were found at a low frequency (<2%). The probability of a genotype infecting the inoculated leaf systemically was near 1, but in rare cases, genotypes could be trapped in the inoculated leaf by other genotypes. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection could be predicted using the independent model. Independent action appears to hold for TE, and Ne is dose-dependent for this RNA virus. The number of virions causing systemic infection can be small and approaches 1 at low doses. Dose dependency in TE suggests that Ne estimates for different viruses are not meaningful unless dose effects are considered.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how genes are turned on and off in different parts of the body. Most previous studies looked at one type of cell or tissue at a time, but this new method looks at many types at once. They used it to study 2,000 genes in four tissues and found it was more powerful than other methods. It found that 27% of genes are regulated the same way in all four tissues, which increased the number of genes found by 5 times compared to looking at one tissue at a time. This new method can help understand how genes work together to control expression and can be applied to many systems, including humans. 

The new method uses a computer algorithm called Evolutionary Stochastic Search to find the best combination of genetic variants that affect gene expression. It's better than other methods at finding secondary genetic effects and can look at many genetic variants at once. Traditional methods look at one variant at a time, this new method looks at many. It also finds genetic effects across tissues, not just one. This helps understand how genes work together to control expression and can be applied to many systems, including humans.
Researchers have created a mathematical model to understand how cells die through a process called extrinsic apoptosis, which is triggered by external signals like tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TRAIL. This process involves a "variable-delay, snap-action" switch that determines whether a cell lives or dies. The model was trained with data from experiments and accurately reproduces the behavior of cells exposed to TRAIL. Analysis shows that the delay before cell death is determined by caspase-8 activity and reactions downstream of the TR receptor. The sudden activation of effector casases is achieved by membrane permeabilization and relocation of proteins like Smac. The interactions among Bcl-2 family, Smac, and XIAP, and pore assembly are critical for snap control.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Listeria monocytogen infects the placenta during pregnancy. The placenta protects the fetus from the mother's immune system and other pathogens, but L monocytogen has a way to breach this barrier. A protein called Internalin P (InP) helps the bacterium infect the placenta. The study found that InP binds to a protein called afadin, which is involved in cell-cell junctions. This interaction helps the bacterium cross the placental barrier. The researchers created a crystal structure of InP and found it has a unique feature that allows it to bind to afadin. They also found that cells expressing InP have less force on their substrate, similar to cells without afadin. Bacteria without InP can't form actin protrusions, a step in crossing the placental barrier. A similar effect was seen in bacteria with a mutation in InP that disrupts its interaction with af. However, removing af from host cells didn't help the bacterium cross. The study suggests InP targets afadin to help monocogen cross the placental barrier, contributing to infection.
Researchers have used mass spectrometry to study the proteome of Treponema pallidum s. pallum, the bacterium that causes syphilis. Little is known about the T. pallum proteome, so this study aimed to bring insights into its pathogenic and expression profiles during infection. They used mass spectrom techniques on T. pallum DAL-1 strain isolated from rabbits, detecting 603 peptides corresponding to 557 unique proteins, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the T. pallum proteome to date, providing valuable insights into in vivo protein expression and paving the way for understanding the pathogenicity of this enigmatic organism.
Protein Kinase A (PK) is a key receptor for the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in eukaryotes. AMP binds to two tandem AMP-binding domains (CBD-A and B) within the regulatory subunit of PK (R), unleashing the activity of the catalytic subunit (C). Researchers investigated the dynamics of CBD-B, a "gate" domain that modulates control exerted by CBD-A, using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) on a two-domain construct RI(91-379) in apo, c2, and C-bound forms. Comparative NMR analyses led to a double conformation selection model where each CBD samples active and inactive states independently of adjacent CBD within a degenerate free landscape. This degener is critical for CBD's sensitivity to interactions and high affinity for AMP. Binding AMP eliminates degener, stabilizing active conformation within CBD and inter-C contacts, which require AMP and W260, mediated by CBD-B, capping AMP to CBD-A. Inter-C interface is dispensable for intra-C conformation selection but indispensable for PK activation, occluding C-sub sites within CBD-A. Structurally homolog c-bound CBDs exhibit differences in dynamics, supporting conservation of structure does not imply dynamics.
Researchers studied the role of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (IS15) in macrophages during vaccinia virus infection. IS15 is a protein induced by interferon, a key player in antiviral immunity. They compared the proteomes of IS15- and IS+ bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMD) after vaccinia virus (V) infection. Results showed altered mitochondrial and oxidative phosphorylation pathways in IS- MD treated with interferon. Mitochondrial respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were higher in IS+ MD than IS- MD following interferon treatment, indicating IS-dependent mechanisms. IS depletion led to macrophage polarization change. IS- macrophages showed a pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern, but blocked nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase activation. Following interferon treatment, NO release was higher in IS+ macroages than IS- macroages, concomitant with decreased viral titers. IS- macroages were permissive for VV replication following interferon treatment. The study demonstrates IS governs mitochondrial functionality, specifically oxidative phosphorylation and mitagy, broadening its antiral role.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism that regulates the HIV-1 protein Vpu, which plays a crucial role in the virus's life cycle. Vpu has two functions: degrading the CD4 receptor and enhancing viral particle release. It binds CD4 and recruits the βTr subunit of the SCβCP ubiquitin ligase complex through its phosphorylated DS52XX56 motif. However, V escapes degradation by inhibiting the degradation of βTr targets like β-caten and Iκα. The study found V's inhibitory function on Em1 and Cdc25, βTr substrates in cell cycle progression. A novel phosphorylation site in V was underscored, especially in cells in early mitosis, V undergoes phosphorylation of serine 61, adjacent to βTr-binding. This triggers V degradation by βTr-independent process. Mutation V61 in HIV-1 extends its half-life and increases release from HeLa cells. The S61 determinant is conserved in HIV-1 isolates. Results show differential phosphorylation determines V's fate as adaptor or substrate of ubiquitin ligases. Conservation of V degradation, despite negative effect on release, suggests role in HIV fitness.
Researchers studied how the development of the wing in fruit flies (Drosophila) is coordinated with the rest of the body to ensure it remains robust against changes in environment and physiology. They proposed two hypotheses: patterning in the wing is tightly coordinated with whole-body development over time, or it aligns at specific milestones. To test this, they created a staging system to track patterning in the wing discs of third instar larvae based on key genes. They found that pattering aligns with whole development at two milestones: moul and pupation, but not at the wandering stage in between. This suggests that moul and pupation are key events in development, while wandering is not. The study also showed that pattering in the wing is more flexible than thought, responding to changes in temperature and physiology. The findings indicate that patter remains robust against environmental and physiological changes by aligning at milestones. This work provides insight into how individual tissue development is coordinated with the body as a whole.
In highly polarized cells, such as fungal hyphae, endosomes play a crucial role in both endocytosis and long-distance transport of various cargo, including mRNA and protein complexes. However, the connection between these processes is not well understood. Researchers found that the ESCRT regulator Did2 coordinates endosomal transport in fungal hypha of Ustago may. Without Did, endosomes are defective, long-distance transport is impaired, and shuttling of early endosomes is abnormal. The late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease P1 exhibit increased shuttling on these aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Molecular motors fail to attach, explaining disturbed processive movement. The endosomal RNP linker Up1 is absent on endosomes, resulting in defects in long-distance mRNA transport. The ESC regulator Did2 coordinates endosomal maturation and provides correct identity for efficient endosomal long transport. Endosomal maturation and fusion with vacuoles depend on functional ESC machinery for vacolar sorting. Without Did, late endosomal Rab and cargo vacu protease shuttle on early endosomes. A link between ESC complex and endosomal transport was discovered, but it's indirect, affecting mRNA loading on endosomes. Endosomal maturation is essential for endytic recycling and polar growth in cells like neurons and fungal hypha. ESC components are present early on long trafficking. Did is needed for endocytic functions and long transport.
Researchers studied two types of riboswitches, which are molecules that regulate gene expression in bacteria by binding to adenine, a component of DNA. They found that two types of aden ribwitches, one from Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulificus, differ in how they control gene expression. The Bacillus subtil ribwitch controls gene expression by binding to adenine during transcription, while Vibrio ribwitch can bind to adenine after transcription is complete and still regulate translation. The study shows that the rate of transcription is crucial for Bacillus ribwitch to work efficiently, supporting its co-transcription regulation. In contrast, Vibrio ribwitch can regulate without transcription-translation coupling. This suggests that the type of regulation, transcription or translation, affects ribwitch mechanisms.
Researchers have discovered a pattern of transcription initiation in bacteria Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholera that relies on a short RNA primer, called "primer-dependent initiation" (PDI). This process is more common in stationary phase of growth in E. coli, but its impact on the bacteria's physiology and occurrence in other bacteria was unknown. The study found that PDI regulates biofilm formation in E. coli and also occurs in V. cholera, a pathogenic bacterium. High-throughput sequencing of RNA 5' ends (5 RNA-seq) showed PDI in V. cholera is similar to E. coli. P is detected in stationary phase, not exponential, and preferentially at promoters with T-1+1 and G-1+ sites. RNA analysis indicates P from these sites produces transcripts from position -1. In E. coli, P is a regulatory mechanism for biofilm growth. In V. cholera, the pattern is similar to E. coli, with P detected in stationary, not exponential, and preferential at T-1+ and G+ sites. The study suggests PDI may be widespread in Gammaproteacteria and occurs through a growth-dependent process generating 5'-UA-3 and 5'-GG- oligonucleotides.
Researchers investigated how parental genome imbalance affects the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis, a plant species. Imprinted genes are genes that are turned on or off depending on whether they come from the mother or father. Previous studies in mammals and plants showed that extra copies of the mother's genome slow growth, while extra copies of the father's genome speed it up. This led to the "parental conflict" theory, which proposes that imprinted genes are controlled by opposing regulators. However, this theory was never directly tested. The study looked at four imprinted genes in Arabopsis: FERTIZATIONDEPENDENT SE2 (F2), FLOWERING WINGEN (WA), MEDE (MEA), and PES (HE1). They found that extra copies of the mother's genome slowed down F2 and sped up P1 in opposite ways. Also, extra copies of the mother's genome made F2 and ME inactive. F2 controls histone methylation, which turns off ME and P1, but changes in ME and P1 couldn't be explained by changes in F2. This shows that parental genome imbalance affects imprinted genes in ways not controlled by known regulators. The complex network of imprinted genes and silenced in response to imbalance doesn't fit simple models from the conflict theory.
Researchers have long been fascinated by the rhythmic patterns in brain activity, known as oscillations, which appear in recordings of electrical and magnetic signals from the brain. Instead of studying how these rhythms emerge or if they're necessary for brain function, this study focuses on what they reveal about brain connectivity. By creating "virtual" brains" with similar dynamics to real brain recordings, researchers found that these networks share features with each other and real brains. Using mathematical techniques, they reverse-engineered networks that mimic brain activity, including spikes and waves, which appear as frequency bands on a non-oscillatory background. Reconstructed networks display similar features, such as structural patterns and dynamics. Diseased brains, like those with epilepsy and schizophrenia, were also recreated, showing altered oscillatory activity. These networks showed changes in connectivity and dynamics. Complexity, a measure of network organization, was found to be a good indicator of brain health, with diseased brains displaying lower complexity. The study suggests that brain rhythms convey information about functional connectivity, not anatomy, and has implications for understanding brain health and disease.
Researchers analyzed the genetic makeup of over 1,300 Hispanic individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) to understand the genetic diversity within this population. They used 60,000 genetic markers to identify patterns of ancestry and found that Hispanics have a mix of Caucasian, African, and Native American origins. Further analysis showed that samples from Mexico and South America were distinct from those from Central and South America. The researchers grouped the individuals into four categories: Dominican/Cuban, Mexican, Central/South American, and Puerto Rican, which matched their self-identification. They also looked at genes linked to triglycerides, a type of fat in the blood, and found significant associations in two genes, LPL and TR1, which were previously found in Caucasians but not in Hispanics. This study highlights the importance of considering genetic diversity and subgroups in studies of Hispanic populations in the US.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the Elong complex, a group of proteins involved in DNA replication and repair, in maintaining gene silencing and genome stability. They found that Elong interacts with PCNA, a protein that helps assemble nucleosomes during DNA replication, and repair. Without Elong, cells lose silencing of certain genes and are more sensitive to DNA damaging agents. Deletion of Elong's catalytic subunit, El3, or other subunits of the complex, or mutations that disrupt Elong formation, also result in loss of silencing and increased sensitivity to DNA damage. El3 is required for cell progression in the presence of DNA inhibitor hydroxyurea. Analysis shows that El3 mutant exacerbates sensitivity to damaging agent methanesulfate in cells lacking histone chaperone As1 and H lysine acetylase R109. El3 interacts with PCNA in vivo and in vitro. These results reveal Elong's novel role in silencing and genome stability, linked to replication and repair pathways.
Researchers have developed a new method to improve the process of manually curating biomedical knowledge from publications, called triage, which involves retrieving relevant articles from databases like PubMed. The current query-based method often yields unsatisfactory results and is difficult to generate optimal queries. To address this, they proposed a machine-assisted triage method using deep learning. They trained a model on curated publications from UniProt/Swiss-Prot and NHRIEB GWAS Catalog and used it to classify and rank new publications for curation. The method outperformed current query-based methods in efficiency and enriched content, achieving 1.81 and 2.99 times higher precision for UniProt/Siss-Prot and GW Catalog respectively, without compromising recall. It retrieved many relevant publications the query method could not. This method makes the triage process more efficient, allowing curators to focus on challenging tasks to improve knowledge bases.
Researchers studied how genetic mutations in the KCNJ2 gene, which causes a condition called short QT syndrome type 3 (SQT3), lead to atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat. They used computer models of the human atria, the upper chambers of the heart, to understand how these mutations affect the heart's electrical signals. They found that two specific mutations, D172 and E299, shortened the time it takes for the heart to recover between beats, making it more prone to irregular rhythms. The models showed that these mutations reduced the speed of electrical signals and made it harder for the heart to recover, increasing the risk of irregular rhythms. The researchers also found that blocking certain channels in the heart cells could help prevent these irregular rhythms. They suggest that blocking two types of channels, IK and IKr, could be effective in treating QT3-linked atrial fibrillation. This study provides new insights into how genetic mutations cause irregular heart rhythms and how to treat them.
Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) have been shown to protect mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite that causes Chagas disease, from cardiac damage by modulating the immune response to the parasite. In a study, ASC were injected into mice 3 days after infection and tracked using bioluminescence, showing they remained in the abdominal cavity for up to 9 days and mostly migrated to abdominal subcutaneous fat, an early parasite reservoir. This resulted in a significant reduction in parasitemia, followed by decrease in cardiac inflammation and fibrosis at 30 days. Analysis of cytokine release from heart cells exposed to T cruzi antigens showed an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated mice, while splenocytes produced a pro-inflammatory response, important for parasite control in placebo and ASC groups. However, splenocytes from ASC released higher levels of IL-10 at 60 days. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed right ventricular dilation prevented in ASC mice. Injection of ASC after T cruz infection prevented remodeling through modulation of immune response, promoting parasite control and heart protection from damage.
Researchers have created new versions of a compound called Retro-2 that targets a specific pathway used by Leishmania parasites to infect cells. These parasites live in special compartments called parasitophagous vacuoles (LPVs) within mammalian cells. The previous studies showed that Retro-2 reduced LP sizes and numbers during Leish infections. The new versions, called DHZ36 and DHZ36.1, were tested for their ability to control Leish infections. Results showed that DHZ36 and DHZ36.1 were more effective than Retro-2 in reducing LP development and killing Leish parasites in macrophages. They also reversed Leish suppression of IL-6 release by infected cells. Unlike Retro-2, DHZ36 and DHZ.1 can kill Leish parasites in lab cultures. This is a desirable trait for a drug to treat Leish infections. These findings support previous studies on the structure-activity relationship of Retro-2.
Researchers have developed a method to predict which genes are sensitive to regulation by the nucleosome, a protein complex that helps pack DNA into chromosomes. They found that the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1 (AML-1) transcription factor, which regulates immune gene expression, is sensitive to nucleosome regulation within the Ly49 gene family. This was confirmed in a cell line that naturally expresses Ly49, where nucleosomes were depleted at AML-1 binding sites in expressed Ly49 compared to silent Ly genes. The study suggests nucleosome contributes to Ly gene expression and proposes a method to predict nucleosome sensitivity to aid in understanding its role in gene regulation. On a genome-wide scale, many transcription factors display nucleosome coverage and lack 10 bp periodicity, suggesting they may be sensitive to nucleosome. This was confirmed in a cell where expressed Ly genes showed preferential nucleosome depletion at AML-1 sites compared to inactive genes. Further study is needed to determine if AML-1 is universally sensitive to nucleosome or if this is specific to Ly regulation. In a cell that naturally expresses Ly, AML-1 sites are depleted of nucleosomes in promoter/enhancer regions of expressed Ly genes compared to unexpressed genes, implicating nucleosome in Ly regulation.
Researchers have discovered a crucial step in the process that controls cell growth and division, called the cell cycle. They found that a protein called CDK4 needs to be phosphorylated, or modified, at a specific spot called T172 to be active. This is different from other proteins called CD1 and CD2, which are always active. CD4's activity is controlled by a protein called CD7, but it's not the only one responsible for its activation. When CD7 is blocked, CD4's activity is reduced, but it's not completely dependent on it. Another protein, p21, is involved in this process. When CD7 is blocked, p's binding to CD4 increases and its phosphorylation at spot S130, which is controlled by CD4 and CD2, is affected. This creates a feedback loop that helps CD4 stay active and the cell move forward in the cycle.
Researchers have identified a protein called DUET/M1 that plays a crucial role in meiosis, a process that produces haploid cells essential for sexual reproduction in plants. Meiosis is triggered by transcription factors that activate a cascade of early, middle, and late genes, but these factors are not conserved and mechanisms ensuring proper meiotic expression in multicellular eukaryotes are poorly understood. DUET/M1, a PH finger protein, is essential for Arabidopsis male meiosis and functions as a transcription regulator. It binds to H3me2 in vitro and this interaction is critical for function during meiosis. DUET is also required for microtubule organization during me II, independently of its function I. The protein shows stage-specific expression confined to diplot. Two genes, T1 and J, are critical for cell transitions and spindle in meiosis, and are targets of DU, with T1 being direct. DU regulates microtub organization and cell transitions during me and activates meiotic gene T1. Expression showed reduced a subset of meiotic genes in du mutant. Results reveal DU as transcription regulator during me in plants and suggest meiotic under stagewise control in plants like yeast.
Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by fragile X premutation CG repeats. Previous studies have shown that fragile X CG repeats can cause neurodegeneration and that CG-binding proteins α and hnRNP A/B1 can modulate CG-mediated neuronal toxicity. Researchers explored the role of α in CG-mediated neurode using a proteomic approach and identified over 100 proteins interacting with α. Notably, R62, the Drosophila ortholog of p RNA helicase, can modulate CG-mediated neurode. They found that CG repeats decrease R62 transcription, leading to nuclear accumulation of Hsp transcript and other stress-related mRNAs. This suggests that abnormal accumulation of these mRN, likely due to impaired export, contributes to FAS pathogenesis.

The study focused on R62, the Dophila orth of p RNA helic, which interacts with α and modulates CG neurode. Biochemically, fragile XCG repeats decrease R62 transcription, leading to H70 accumulation in the nucleus. Expression of XCG repeats reduced viability of heterozygous R62 flies, supporting a strong interaction between R62 and CG-mediated cell death. The researchers investigated R62 in CG neurode and found nuclear accumulation of specific mRN caused by XCG repeats, indicating impaired export could contribute to FAS.

Through proteomic, genetic, and microarray analyses, the study shows accumulation of mRN by XCG repeats contributes to FAS and may be due to impaired export due to decreased R62. Altered H70 and delay is similar to R62/p mutation. XCG repeats likely produce deficits in export of transcripts by R62, such as H70, interfering with neurons' ability to respond to stress.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a type of bacteria, forms complex communities called biofilms on surfaces. These biofilms are held together by an extracellular matrix, a mixture of polysacchar, nucleic acids, and proteins. Researchers studied how this matrix forms and its components during bio development. They focused on the polyschar synthesis locus (Psl polyschar), a key component of the matrix. At early stages, P is anchored on the cell surface in a helical pattern, promoting cell-cell interactions and matrix assembly. This holds bacteria in the biofilm on the surface. When P dissociates from the surface, the matrix and bio structure are disrupted. During bio maturation, P accumulates on the periphery of 3D microcolonies, creating a P matrix-free cavity in the microcol center. Dead cells and extracellular DNA are concentrated in the P-free area. Deleting genes controlling cell death and autolysis affects matrix and microcol formation. Data show how P aerugin builds a matrix and a cavity for cell dispersal. Visualization reveals P as a key matrix component, opening avenues for bio-related complications treatment.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a type of cancer with a poor prognosis, and new treatments are needed to improve outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) are promising tools to identify new treatments for PDAC. To be effective, these preclinical models must recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific sensitivities. A study assessed the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and PDX from PD and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 'trios' of primary tum, PDX, and PDO. A pipeline scored concordance between PD models and paired tumours for genomic events, mutations, structural variations, and copy variations. Tumour comparisons showed single-gene concord across major PD driver genes, but poor agreement across mutational load. Genome and chromosome analysis of structural (SV) events highlighted concordance across chromosomes with clustered events. Ploidy presented a challenge when assessing copy changes, but ploidy-correct copy states showed agreement between donor pairs. The study found that PDX and PDO can serve as transplantable systems for probing PD properties, but may be selective across genomic complexity levels.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study in 19,091 breast cancer cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent to identify genetic factors contributing to breast cancer. They analyzed 690,947 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, then evaluated 5,365 SNPs in 3,972 and 3,852, and 94 in 5,203 and 5,138, and finally 22 in 17,423 subjects. The study found a strong association between SNP rs9482 near the TGF-activated kinase 2 gene on chromosome 6q25.1 and breast cancer risk, with a P-value of 3.8×10-12 in combined analysis. Adjusted odds ratios were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for A/A and AA genotypes compared to GG. Two other SNPs, rs3951 in the ESR gene and rs710 at 11q24.3, showed consistent association in each stage. This study provides evidence for a new breast susceptibility locus represented by rs9482 and two possible loci in ESR and 11.24.
Researchers studied a group of 230 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from HIV-positive patients in South Africa to understand how genetic diversity affects the outcome of cryptococcal meningitis. They found high levels of genetic diversity in the region, with 50 different sequence types identified, and 72% of isolates belonging to seven high-frequency types. Analysis showed that patients' cryptococcal genotypes were not clustered geographically, suggesting reactivation of latent infection rather than recent acquisition. The study found a link between genetic lineage and clinical outcome, with patients infected with VNB lineage having worse survival rates. This was true even after adjusting for known prognostic indicators and treatment. Fungal genotype was also linked to phenotype, with VN lineage showing increased lacc activity and CSF survival. The study shows Cryptoccus neoans is a phenotypically heterogeneous pathogen, with lineage playing a role in cryptococcal virulence during human infection. Understanding genetic diversity in Africa will help investigate how diversity is structured across environments and assess risks of different ecotypes to infection.
Researchers have identified a key component of a signaling pathway in the fungus Candida albicans, a common human pathogen, that regulates its white phenotype. The pathway, called the pherom response, helps the fungus adapt to its environment. The researchers used a library of over 100 transcription factors and mutations to find the last missing piece of the puzzle, a protein called Tec1. With Tec1, the pathway is now fully understood, providing insight into how new signaling pathways evolve. The pathway parts of the pher response in C. albicans came from different ancestral programs in the fungus, including mating, filamentation, and biofilm formation. This evolution of the pher response may be a model for how signaling pathways develop. The pathway is young and hasn't had time to change much, so it's a good example of how new pathways start. Tec1 activates genes in the pher response and other processes like cell adhesion and biofilm formation. The white and opaque pathways in C. alb are different, but share some components with the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The opaque pathway in C. alb shares components with the yeast haploid pher response.
Scientists have long wondered why the genetic makeup of bacteria varies so much, with some having less than 20% and others more than 70% of a type of molecule called GC. They thought it was due to differences in how bacteria mutate, or change their DNA. To test this, researchers looked at patterns of genetic variation in 149 species of bacteria. They found that in most bacteria with a lot of GC, there were more changes from AT to GC, but not the other way around. This was true across many different types of bacteria, not just a few. They checked if this was due to bias in mutation, but that wouldn't make sense since GC-rich bacteria would lose GC, which can't happen. They also checked if it was due to how genes are made, but that didn't fit. They think it's because there's selection for more GC in many bacteria. Since GC is linked to overall genetic makeup, they think there's selection for that too.
Researchers have developed a new method to map the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infections (STH) in Kenya, using data from 106,370 individuals surveyed between 1974 and 2009. They combined ecological and climatic factors from high-resolution satellite data with survey locations to predict the probability of infection exceeding 20% across the country for 1989 and 2009. Maps for each species were integrated to estimate combined STH prevalence, adjusting for associations between species. Population data was combined with models to estimate the population at risk and requiring treatment in 2009. Results show high endemicity below 20% in most areas, with areas ≥20% around Lake Victoria and coast. Comparison of 198 and 2009 distributions show STH prevalence decreased over time. The model estimated 2.8 million school-age children live in districts warranting mass treatment. Bayesian-time models can estimate combined STH prevalence and suggest a quarter of Kenya's school children live in high-prevalence areas warranting treatment. Control reducing infection, models can refine decision-making in helth.
Researchers studied how the immune system fights Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), a bacterium that causes tuberculosis. They found that a type of immune cell called innate lymphocytes, specifically invariant NKT cells, play a key role in controlling the infection. NKT cells recognize infected macrophages, which are cells that eat bacteria, and produce a protein called interferon-γ. This protein helps stop the bacteria from growing. The study showed that even a small number of NKT cells can stop the bacteria from multiplying. To see if NKT cells help in real life, the researchers transferred them into mice infected with Mtb. The mice that got N cells had fewer bacteria in their lungs than those that didn't. This is the first time N cells have been shown to protect against Mtb in a living animal. N cells can kill bacteria without needing a specific trigger, called α-galactosceramide. The study suggests N cells are important in fighting Mtb and could be a target for new treatments.
Researchers have studied how a protein called Bacillus subtilis spore coat transglutase (Tgl) helps form strong bonds between proteins in the coat that surrounds bacterial spores. Unlike other similar proteins, T is produced in an active form and doesn't need additional help to work. To understand how its activity is controlled, they looked at how it interacts with its substrates, the proteins it forms bonds with. They found that substrates already assembled on the spore before T is produced guide T to the sp's surface, and specific parts of T recognize these substrates are crucial for this. The first step of the bonding process, where T meets substrates and forms an intermediate, is also where T decides where to go. This suggests T helps "spot"link" pre-assembled complexes on the sp's surface. In experiments, T was shown to be part of cross-linked products. The study suggests that T's dependency on substrates controls when and where it works, forming bonds between pre-assembled proteins on the sp's surface.
Opisthorchis vivini, a foodborne trematode species, causes biliary diseases and cholangiocarcinoma in Laos. An estimated 2.5 million people are infected, but epidemiological studies are scarce and spatial distribution unknown. A study aimed to map distribution, identify risk factors, and predict prevalence in Champas province, Laos. A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey was conducted in 51 villages in 2007. Data on demographics, socioeconomic status, water, sanitation, and behavior were combined with remotely sensed environmental data into a geographical information system. Bayesian statistical models identified age, Lao ethnic group, educational attainment, occupation, and unsafe water source as risk factors. History of praziquel treatment, access to sanitation, and distance to freshwater were protective. Spatial patterns were governed by environmental factors, with two risk profiles: low in mountains and high in Mekong corridor. The study provides the first map of infection in Champas province, important for targeting control efforts. Infection is associated with exposure to fish, behavior, and transmission sustained by lack of sanitation.
In Dar es Sala, Tanzania, a city with an extensive network of drains, most of which are clogged with waste and prone to flooding, the presence of Anopheles and Cule mosquito larvae is common, contributing to the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and malaria. However, the importance of drains as larval habitats was unknown. Researchers analyzed data from the Urban Malaria Control Program (UMCP) and a special survey in 2006 to categorize habitats focusing on drains. Logistic regression was used to evaluate factors impacting the presence of mosquito larvae. Spatial variation in proportion of habitats with larvae was assessed through Moran's indicator of association. More than 70% of larval habitats in Dar Sala were human-made. Aquatic habitats associated with agriculture had the highest Anophe presence and second highest Cule presence. However, majority of habitats were drains (42%) and 43% (1,364/3,149) of culicine and 33% (320/976) of anopheline were drains. Compared to flowing water, odds of Anophe and Cx larvae were 8.8 and 6.3 (p<0.001) times larger in stagnant water. There was association between vegetation and mosquito presence (p<0.001). Proportion with larvae was spatially correlated. Restoring and maintaining Dar Sala drains could eliminate over 40% of larval habitats treated by UMCP. Human-made habitats for both filasis and malaria underscore need synergy between control efforts.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection leads to changes in lipid metabolism in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected cells, creating a cholesterol-rich environment that favors viral replication. Researchers found that DENV inhibits the phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), an enzyme that regulates cholesterol levels in the ER. In infected cells, HCR activity was higher, associated with inactivation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK activation by metformin reduced HCR activity, suggesting AMPK inactivation mediates increased HCR activity. AMPK phosphorylation was reduced in DENV-infected cells at 12 and 24 hours post-infection. HCR and cholesterol co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E, indicating a role in DENV replicative complex formation. Metform and lovastatin, an HCR inhibitor, altered co-localization and replicative complex formation, suggesting active HCR is required for complex formation. Metform showed dose-dependent antiviral effect in D-infected cells, while compound C, an AMPK inhibitor, increased viral copies and infected cells.
Scientists have studied how transfer RNA (tRNA) moves through the ribosome, a complex molecular machine that builds proteins. They used computer simulations to track the movement of all atoms in the ribosome, a 2.1 million of them, over 1.3 microseconds. This allowed them to identify groups of residues that move together, like a rigid body, during the process. These movements are crucial for the ribosome's function. By analyzing how fast these groups move, they connected kinetic measurements, or rates, to the energy landscape of the ribosome. This energy landscape is like a map of all possible states the rib can be in. The study found that the energy barriers, or hurdles, for RNA to move through the rib are high. This was done for a specific way RNA movement, but the method can be used for any process with many steps and states. 

The ribosome is thought to work like a "ratchet", where random movements lead to big changes. Scientists used simulations to see if RNA movement is a mix of big and small changes. They found groups of residues that move together, like a body, and others that move separately. The rib is made of two parts, the 30S and 50S. The 30S part rotates and the 50 part moves the RNA. These movements are essential for protein building. The study provides a way to understand how RNA moves through the rib and can be applied to other processes.
Researchers studied the genetic makeup of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) to better understand its causes and potential treatments. They analyzed tissue samples from 84 patients with sporadic MTC and 36 normal thyroid tissues from the same patients. They found 101 mutations in 18 genes in the MTC samples, with the most common being in the RET proto-oncogene, occurring in 47 cases. Other common mutations were in genes encoding Harvey sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, serine/threon kinase 11, v-Hardyuckerman feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, mut homolog 1, Kiest ratcoma viral oncogene hom, and MET-oncogene. They also looked for anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement by immunohistochemistry and breakap fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and found 2 of 98 cases positive for ALK. To identify the genomic breakpoint and 5 fusion partner of AL, they used customized cancer sequencing and found Glutaminefructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GF1)-ALK and echodermic microtub-associated protein 4 (E4)-ALK fusions. Additional analysis confirmed the GF1-ALK fusion, indicating an intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. A metastatic M case with E4ALK showed response to AL inhibitor crizotin. The study found several mutations in MTC and first identified AL fusions in M, suggesting E4ALK may be a driver and target for AL inhibitors, and GFALK a candidate for molecular therapy.
Asymptomatic Leishmanias in Kala Endemic Areas of Malda, West Bengal, India: A Challenge to Visceral Leishias (VL) Elimination Initiative

A study in eight villages in Malda district, West Bengal, India, found that asymptomatic Leishias may drive the epidemic and pose a challenge to the goal of VL elimination. The role of asymptomatic carriers in disease transmission, prognosis, and individual rate of transformation to symptomatic Visc Leishias (VL) and Post-Kalaazar D Leishiasis (PKDL) needs to be evaluated. Out of 289 total population, 260 were screened, 185 had antileman antibody, 96 with a history of VL/PK and 89 without history. 79 were classified as asymptomatic Leishias, 10 as active VL with a ratio 7.9:1. Among asymptomatic cases, 2 were lost to follow-up, moved to other places. Among asymptomatic infected, disease progression 8/77 (10.39%) and seroconversion 62/77 (80.52%) were noted, 7 (9.09%) remained ser-positive after three years. Progression to disease among asymptomatic individuals occurred up to three years after baseline. If no VL/PK cases for two years, does not mean area free Leishias, symptomatic VL/PK may appear after three, if asymptomatic cases. Asympt infected need attention for VL program initiated by adjoining countries.
Researchers used a technique called Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze genetic rearrangements in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. These rearrangements can lead to diseases and cancer. They found that the presence of a repetitive element called Ty on a non-essential chromosome arm of the yeast genome led to increased instability and formation of translocations. Most of these translocations were between six specific regions on four chromosomes, even though there were 254 potential targets in the genome. The majority were formed by a type of recombination called RAD-dependent. However, some were formed by a different type of recombination that didn't require certain proteins involved in normal recombination. They also found that a defect in a process called acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 led to increased rearrangements and aneuploidy. The technique MLPA is useful for rapid analysis of rearrangements and can help understand pathways that prevent or cause them.
Researchers have developed a new method called Semi-Definite-based Underestimation (SD) to improve protein docking, which is the process of associating two proteins. Docking is driven by energy funnels, areas where interactions are favorable near the native state. SD minimizes functions with funnel-shaped basins, but applying it to rotational and translational space (SE(3) is challenging due to its geometry. A strategy was introduced to separate variables for side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance, and angular orientations. Removing the center-to-center distance improved efficiency, as the five-dimensional space has a well-behaved surface for underestimation. The algorithm explores energy surfaces of complexes corresponding to local minima, similar to macromolecular association through collisions. Results show the energy landscape is a funnel in a broad neighborhood of the native and SD generates predictions with less than 5Å RMSD and a 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods. The application of SD to protein-protein docking validates the funnel assumption of the energy landscape. However, direct application in SE(3 fails to yield underestimators, as favorable distances occur when proteins are in contact but not overlap. The method discovers broad funnels, generates quality predictions, and substantial gain compared to Monte Carlo.
