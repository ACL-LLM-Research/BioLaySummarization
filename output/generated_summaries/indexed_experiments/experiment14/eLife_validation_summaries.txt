Researchers have discovered a new role for the Notch signaling pathway in reprogramming cells in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. This pathway is surprising because Notch is known for maintaining undifferentiated stem cells in the germline. The team found that Notch promotes reprogramming by activating genes silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). They identified the histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial Notch target facilitating reprogramming. This finding has implications for development and diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.

In C. elegans, the Notch pathway is essential for maintaining a pool of undifferentiated stem cells. The researchers found an unexpected role of Notch in promoting cell reprogramming. To understand this, they combined genetics and tissue-specific profiling. They identified genes activated by increased Notch signaling and found an antagonistic relationship between Notch and PR2. The C. elegans PR2 consists of MES-2, -3, and -6. Levels of these transcripts were not altered by Notch signaling.

When analyzing genes with higher germline expression, the proportion of Not-activated genes was striking. In C. elegans, genes are largely silenced by PR2. The team found genes regulated by Not, including those maintaining gerine stem cells. They also found genes activated by Not were repressed by the fate-stabilizing chromatin regulator PR2. Not and PR2 have an antagonistic effect on cell-fate decisions and co-regulate common target ut-1.
Researchers have found that a protein called SK2 plays a crucial role in defending against a type of bacteria called Klebsiella pneumoniae, which can cause respiratory, blood, and bladder infections. They discovered that mice without SK2 had 100 times more bacteria in their lungs compared to mice with SK2. SK2, and that SK2 expression in immune cells helped control the infection. Neutrophils, a type of immune cell, in SK2- mice were infected and degranulated normally in response to Klei pneumonia, but could not produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) when exposed to the bacteria. ROS is important for fighting off the infection. The researchers found that SK2 is needed for neutils to produce ROS, and that without it, the bacteria grew more in the lungs. They also found that SK2 is involved in signaling pathways that lead to ROS production, and that without it, the neutils couldn't fight the bacteria as well. This study shows that SK2 is important for host defense against Klei pneumonia in the lungs.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how a type of malaria parasite, Plasmod vivax, is transmitted from person to person. This parasite stays dormant in the liver for weeks or months before causing new infections. The model shows that most people have few or no parasites in their liver, but some have many. Those with more parasites are more likely to get sick again and spread the disease. The model predicts that treating people with a certain drug, primaquine, can reduce the spread of the disease by targeting those with many parasites. 

Malaria parasites have three reservoirs: in the blood, mosquitoes, and the liver. Relapses, or new infections, come from the liver parasites. Current models don't account for the liver reservoir, but this one does. It helps estimate the effectiveness of treatments that target the liver parasites. Most malaria models don't include the liver reservoir, but some do for Plas viv. This model shows that many patterns of relapses can be explained by parasites activating and dying at a constant rate. It's integrated into existing models to account for Plas relapses.
When Amazonian forests are disturbed by selective logging, more than 90 tons of carbon (C) is released into the atmosphere each year. However, this carbon loss is balanced by the forest's regrowth. Researchers used a network of 133 forest plots across Amazonia to study how climate, soil, and initial biomass affect carbon recovery after logging. They found that forests in the Guiana Shield and west recover more carbon (21 Mg/ha) in 10 years than in the south (12 Mg/ha) due to high environmental stress. Surviving trees play a key role in regrowth and a map of post-disturbance recovery in Amazonia was created.

The study focused on selective logging, a common human disturbance in tropical forests. Data from 13 long-term sites in Amazon and Guiana were used. Sites met criteria: located in tropical forests, above 100mm rainfall, above 1ha, at least one pre-logging census, and at least two post-logging cens. One type of disturbance, selective logging, was studied due to its economic implications for forest management. The study gives clues on Amazon's response to large losses from other disturbances.

Maps of climate, conditions, and soil density were used to upscale results to Amazon and create predictive maps of changes over 10 years. A 40% loss, common after logging in Amazon, was assumed. Climate change draws attention to human impacts on carbon cycles, particularly 2.1 Pg/yr of loss from disturbances in tropical forests. Selective logging causes 1.1 Pg/yr loss.
Researchers have identified two distinct types of stem cells in the adult mouse brain's lateral ventricle subzone (SVZ): neuro-initiating cells (NICs) and neural stem cells (NSCs). NICs are highly mitotic and short-lived, forming neurospheres that can differentiate into multiple cell types, while pre-NSCs are quiescent and long-lived, expressing stem cell markers. NICs are GlastEGhighPlexBhighCD−/lowO/PS-AM/Ter/CD− cells, making up 3.2% of SVZ cells, and can form neuropheres in 36% of the time. In contrast, pre-NS lack neurosphere formation ability and are quies in vivo, but express stem markers and are long-lived. NICs are depleted by temozomide, while pre-NS survive and repopulate SVZ. Conditional deletion of Bmi-1 protein depletes both NIC and pre-NS, but pre-NS are more dependent on B-1 for Cdk2 (16ink4) repression. This study distinguishes quies NSCs from NICs, enabling their study in vivo.
Scientists have discovered that Piezo1, a mechanically activated ion channel, plays a crucial role in sensing forces in various cells and tissues. Using cryo-electron microscopy, researchers found that Pie1 has a bowl-shaped structure that can induce membrane curvature, suggesting it may influence the distribution and function of other Pie1 channels. To study this, researchers used cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp to examine membrane patches from cells with low and high levels of Pie1 expression. The results, combined with simulations of Pie1 spatial distribution, show that both low and high densities cause substantial overlap. Pie1 density has no effect on pressure sensitivity or open probability without membrane tension. This suggests Pie channels, at physiologically relevant densities, behave as independent mechanotrans. This property allows cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire membrane.

Researchers used electrophys data and simulations to show Pie1 channels, at physiologically relevant, function as independent mechanotrans. This enables cells to transduce forces with spatial homogeneity across the membrane. This is significant as Pie channels have no intrinsic tendency to spatially concentrate and functionally modulate each other's sensitivity, ideal for cells to transduce forces homogeneously.

Cells are exposed to mechanical forces and have evolved mechanisms to detect them. Rapid force sensing occurs in milliseconds through force-gated ion channels converting mechanical into electro signals. Pie1 is a mechanically gated cation channel sensing membrane tension with high sensitivity. The study aimed to quantify Pie spatial and functional interactions across channel orders of densities. Electrophys measured channel number, function, single current, probability, and pressure. The goal was to characterize Pie's inherent ability to localize and modulate each other's function. Cell-attached-clamp electrophys was used, with limitations: spatial resolution limited by pipette size.
Researchers investigated how the effect of volatility, or uncertainty, on decision-making in perception. They used a novel manipulation to add noise to specific areas of the brain's visual cortex and recorded from neurons in macaque monkeys. The results showed that increased noise led to faster decisions and higher confidence, but minimal impact on accuracy. This was in line with a model that explains decision-making as accumulation of evidence to a threshold. The model predicts that increased noise should lead to faster, less accurate, but more confident decisions.

The study used a well-studied motion task and verified the effect by recording from neurons in the macaque's visual cortex. A framework based on evidence accumulation accounted for the joint effect of volatility on decision time and confidence. The manipulation increased the variance of momentary evidence, or volatility, speed and confidence. Controlling signal and noise in evidence is difficult, so they changed the statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus to mimic noise. This was verified by recording from direction-selective neurons in the macaque's MT and MST areas, known to represent momentary evidence in similar tasks.

The relationship between volatility and decision speed was tested with a random motion task. Three humans completed 663 trials and one macaque 1417. Each trial started with fixation on a spot for 0.5s, then two targets appeared. The manipulation was used to test the influence on accuracy, reaction time, and confidence in monkeys and humans.
Researchers have discovered that two proteins, CAMII and calcineurin, play a crucial role in regulating the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of worm, through the FOX transcription factor DAF-16. The insulin signaling pathway typically keeps the worm's lifespan short by inactivating DAF-16, but calcineurin, a phosphatase, also limits the worm's lifespan. However, its mechanism was unknown. The study found that Caenorhabditis's calcinein, TAX-6B-1, and Ca+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, UNC-43, regulate DAF-16. UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates D-16, promoting its nuclear localization, while TAX-6-B1 removes the phosphoryl group, inactivating D-16. Mammalian FOX3 is also regulated by CAMII and calcineurin. The study suggests that CAMII (UNC-43) and calcine (TAX-6-1) extend or shorten the worm's lifespan by phosphorylating or dephosphylating D-16's serine 286. Their opposing effects on D-16 raised the possibility that they would cancel each other out. However, insulin signaling dominates when there's a conflict between the two pathways. Multiple pathways, including insulin/IGF-1, gerline, and dietary restriction, regulate aging in Caenorhabdis.
Researchers studied how fruit flies groom their bodies using a series of movements. They found that the nervous system organizes these movements into a hierarchy, where earlier movements suppress later ones. This means that cleaning one part of the body reduces the drive to clean the next part, allowing the sequence to progress. They created a model that shows how this hierarchy works and found that it successfully reproduces the grooming sequence. This is the first example of a motor sequence generated by a hierarchy for human actions.

Fruit flies have different cleaning programs for each body part that progress in series. By targeting specific neurons, researchers controlled each program and found they are organized in a hierarchy. They created a model that shows how suppression mediates the selection of cleaning programs. The ability to select behaviors through hierarchy may have provided infrastructure for actions in sequence.

The study looked at the organization of neural control in an innate behavior common to many animals - grooming. Animals have mechanisms to select the best option and suppress others. A key finding is that hierarchical suppression leads to a sequence. Identifying the circuit for each module and how they interact will reveal how behavior is encoded in the system through suppression.

The researchers used genetically activated subsets of neurons to control each cleaning program and found they are organized in a hierarchy. They created a model that demonstrates how suppression can mediate the selection of programs. This is the first example of a motor sequence generated by a hierarchy for actions. The model shows how the hierarchy works and successfully reproduces the grooming sequence.

Researchers have discovered a protein called Sol that plays a crucial role in the process of meiosis, a type of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells. Meiosis is essential for creating gametes, or sex cells, which are necessary for reproduction. During meiosis, chromosomes, which carry genetic information, must be divided and separated accurately. Sol helps ensure this process by coordinating several key events. It protects a protein called cohesin, which holds sister chromosomes together, turns off the spindle assembly checkpoint, a system that prevents errors, and promotes the formation of kinetochore-microtubules, which attach chromosomes to the spindle. Sol also limits stretching of chromosomes.

 Sol's ability to protect cohes depends on interaction with a protein called PP2. It silences the spindle checkpoint by binding to another protein Mad2. However, its effect on chromosome stretching and kinetore-microtule formation is independent of PP and mediated by other proteins. Sol's multiple interactions link essential processes for accurate chromosome segregation.

Experiments showed Sol helps turn off the spindle checkpoint by binding PP and Mad2. It moderates chromosome stretching by recruiting a protein and promotes kinetore-microule formation by downregulating Aurora kinase. Meiosis is a complex process dependent on many biochemical events. Depletion of Sol in oocytes has pleiotropic consequences during meiosis, including inefficient checkpoint silencing, increased stretching, and altered kinore-microtule attachments. Sol silences the checkpoint by binding Mad using a common motif. Delayed bivalent orientation, increased stretching, and Aurora activity were accompanied by increased lateral and decreased kinore-microtules. Sol deficiency delayed APC/CC20 activation, suggesting required to shut the checkpoint.

A single protein regulates cohesion, traction, spindle checkpoint, and Aurora kinases. Different mutations alter some but not others, proving pleiotropy in SolΔ oocytes not due to secondary effects. Sol defective PP binding fails to protect cohes, found in yeast. Deficiency caused changes chromosome and microtule dynamics.
Scientists have long known that the brain's connections, or synapses, can change and adapt based on experience. This happens through a process called synaptic plasticity, where the structure and function of synapses are altered. Research has shown that local translation, or making proteins from RNA, plays a key role in this process. A new study investigated whether local stimulation also triggers the transport of RNAs from the nucleus to synapses. Researchers used imaging to track RNA and translation in sensory neurons and found that RNAs were delivered throughout the neuron's branches, but translation occurred only at sites of contact and stimulation. They found that a specific signaling pathway, netrin-1/DCC, was involved in local translation at synapses. The study suggests that spatial regulation of gene expression in neurons is mainly through translation, not by delivering RNAs from the nucleus to synapses. This means the entire neuron's branches are ready to respond to local cues. The study also found that netrin-1, a protein, is released during synapse formation and plasticity, triggers translation at synaptic but not non-synaptic sites. Further research is needed to confirm this mechanism.
Scientists have been trying to understand how cells come together to form complex patterns and shapes during development, but current methods have limitations. Researchers used a new technique called CRISPR interference to silence specific genes in human pluripotent stem cells, which can become any cell type of cell. They found that knocking down two genes, ROCK1 and CDH1, caused the cells to self-organize into different patterns while keeping their ability to become any cell type. This was done by creating mixed populations of cells with and without the CRPR system and then silencing the genes. The result was a wave of gene expression changes that stabilized as the cells self-organized. This method allows scientists to study how cells interact and form patterns, which is important for understanding development. 

The study used an inducible CRPR system in pluripotent stem cells to silence proteins that regulate adhesion and tension. They created mixed populations with and without CRPR and then silenced genes. The result was a pattern formation of cells while keeping pluripotency. This was done to see if mechanical manipulation of pluripotent cells results in controlled self-organization into patterns. However, current methods can't selectively target specific cells or how heterotypic interactions affect multicellular organization. This study shows silencing genes in subpopulations provides a way to control emergence of cell phenotypes and multicellular patterns. Mosaic was used to see how creation of asymmetries in a population leads to multicellular pattern formation. Induction of KD of ROCK or CD1 resulted in 'bottom-up' formation of plurip colonies while preserving pluripotency. This study identifies a way to direct heterotyp populations to multic organization in plurotent cells and creates models for mechanistic study of patterning and formation.
Researchers have long known that the more items we try to hold in our visual working memory, the less accurately we can recall them. A new theory proposes that this is because our brain tries to minimize the cost of holding these items in memory. The theory suggests that our brain weighs the benefits of holding an item against the cost of processing it. A model based on this idea predicts that the number of items we can hold in memory decreases with the number of items we try to hold. The model also predicts that the more items we try to hold, the more likely we are to make mistakes. This is consistent with previous findings. The model accounts for how well we do in tasks where we have to recall items from memory after a delay. It also shows that we may not always need to hold all items in memory, sometimes it's better to hold some or none. This idea challenges the idea that our limitations in memory come from physical constraints, but rather from how we choose to use our resources. 

The theory may apply to other areas of cognition, like attention. It suggests that attention is a trade-off between performance and the cost of processing. This idea has been suggested before, but the theory provides a way to test it. The model was tested on data from experiments where people had to recall items from memory after a delay. It accounted for how well we do with few parameters. It also shows that the more items we try to hold, the more we invest in each one. This translates to a prediction that brain activity increases with the number of items. This can be tested with brain imaging studies. The theory also makes predictions about how incentives affect memory, as they change the cost function.
Researchers have discovered that a protein from the Irish potato pathogen Phytophthora infest, called PRD54, interferes with a plant's natural defense mechanism to fight off diseases. This mechanism, called autophagy, helps plants get rid of damaged or infected cells and recycle nutrients. PRD54 binds to a protein called ATG8, which stimulates the formation of autagosomes, and removes another protein called J2 from AT8 complexes. J2 is important for plant defense against pathogens. By removing J2, PRD54 makes it harder for the plant to fight off the disease. This is the first time a pathogen has been shown to use autagy for its own benefit, not just to harm the plant. The study found that PRD54 competes with J2 and removes it from autosomes, making the plant more susceptible to disease.
Researchers have developed a new way to study how human cardiac fibroblasts, a type of cell that plays a key role in heart tissue repair, respond to changes in their environment. They used a device that applies both mechanical strain and oxygen changes to mimic conditions found in the heart after a heart attack. This allowed them to see how different combinations of these changes trigger fibroblast responses. They found that a combination of low oxygen and reduced contractility caused the cells to release inflammatory and fibrotic signals, while individual changes only triggered cell growth and collagen production. This study provides a new way to understand how heart tissue adapts to injury and may lead to new treatments.
Researchers have discovered that the DOM complex, a chromatin regulator in fruit flies, is made up of two different forms: DOM-A and DOM-B. These forms work together to control gene expression, but in different ways. DOM-B adds a type of histone called H2 to the genome in an energy-dependent manner, similar to a yeast complex called SWR. DOM-A, on the other hand, functions as an independent histone acetylase, similar to a yeast complex called Nu4, targeting a specific spot on histone 4. This is an example of how evolution can lead to similar functions through different paths. In yeast and humans, these complexes come from gene duplication and separation, while flies create diversity through alternative splicing of a single gene. The study found that knocking down either DOM-A, DOM, or H2, or T60 affects transcription, showing their importance in gene regulation. DOM-A has a similar structure to Nu4, but lacks the ATPase domain, raising the possibility it could be a central subunit of a Nu4-like complex in flies. Surprisingly, its ATP activity is not needed for histone acylation by DOM-A. This principle might be conserved across animals. The study shows how alternative splicing creates diversity in chromatin regulators. H2 is found at active promoters and enhancers, regulating initiation and elongation. In yeast, it's introduced by SWR complex, a multi-subunit remodeler with IN80 ATPase.
Scientists have long known that a protein called β-caten (Ctnb1) in muscle cells is crucial for the development of nerve-mus junctions, where nerve cells connect with muscles. However, it was unclear how muscle cells send signals back to nerve cells to help form these connections. Researchers used a genetic approach to study the role of tn1 in muscle cells and found that its ability to turn on genes is necessary for nerveus junction formation. They also found that its ability to stick to other cells is not important. They looked for proteins that tn1 sends signals to nerve cells and identified Slit2, a protein that repels nerve growth. When they expressed Sl2 in muscle cells, it improved nerve junctions in mice with tn1 mutation. They also showed that Sl2 on beads can induce nerve growth on spinal cord cells. These results suggest Sl2 is a signal from muscle to nerve to help form nerveus junction.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how forces are transmitted between cells in clusters of epithelial cells, which are a type of cell that make up tissues like skin and organs. They found that forces between cells are not constant, but change over time and depend on the cell's position in the cluster. The team also discovered that these forces are connected to a protein called E-cadher, which is important for cell-cell adhesion. When cells divide or move, the forces change and are adjusted to keep the tissue stable. The study shows how forces are transmitted between cells and how cells adapt to changes, which is important for understanding how tissues grow and develop. The method can be used to study how forces in other types of cells and tissues.

The researchers used a new way to measure forces between cells and found that they fluctuate over time, even when cells are not dividing. They looked at Eadher, a protein that helps cells stick together, and found that forces are connected to its location. They also found that forces can be blocked by the cell's connection to the matrix and actin, a protein that helps cells move. The study shows that forces are short-ranged, meaning they don't travel far between cells, but can be adjusted by the cell's connection to the matrix and actin. This is important for understanding how tissues grow and change shape.

The team used a special microscope to see where Ead in cells and measured forces between cells. They found that forces are shortanged, meaning they don't travel far between cells, but can be adjusted by the cell's connection to the matrix and actin. This is important for understanding how tissues grow and change. The study can be used to study other types of cells and tissues.
Researchers have made a significant discovery about the structure of a protein called huntingtin, which is linked to a genetic disorder called Huntington's disease. This disease is caused by an expansion of a part of the protein called polyglutamine. To understand how this expansion affects the protein's function, scientists studied its structure using various techniques like circular dichroism, single-particle microscopy, and mass spectrometry. They found that huntingtin is made of five parts and has a spherical shape with a central cavity. The expansion of polyglamine changes the protein's shape, making it more α-helical and affecting how its parts interact with each other. This discovery explains how the expansion of polyamine at the beginning of the protein causes the disease.

To confirm this, researchers looked at purified versions of the protein with different lengths of polyamine tracts. They found that the expansion affects the protein's basic features, suggesting it may change shape when interacting with other molecules. To see if the protein's shape changes, they used single-particle microscopy on versions with 23 and 78-residue polyamine tracts. These were purified using a special method called crosslink. The results show that the protein's shape can be changed by the polyamine tract, solving the mystery of how it affects its function.

The study found that as the polyamine length increases, the protein becomes more αelical. This is shown in a graph of measurements of the protein with different polyamine lengths. The results provide a clear answer to how the polyamine at the start of the protein affects its structure and function.
Ferritinophagy, the process of breaking down and recycling ferritin, a protein that stores iron in cells, is crucial for regulating iron levels in the body. However, how ferritinagy is controlled and the role of a protein called NCO4 in this process is not well understood. Researchers studied the interaction between N4 and ferritin and found that a specific part of N4 binds to ferritin, allowing it to be delivered to lysosomes, where it's broken down. N4 levels are controlled by two systems: autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteome. When iron levels are high, N4 is broken down, allowing ferritin to accumulate and store iron. When iron is low, N4 levels increase, promoting ferragy. A protein called HER2 helps break down N under high iron conditions, reducing N levels and allowing ferritin to capture iron. In zebraf and human cells, N plays a key role in red blood cell development. This study reveals how N4 and ferritin interact and how iron affects N-mediated ferragy in cells.
Researchers have long known that the lateral prefrontal cortex (LP) plays a crucial role in higher-level thinking, but its internal organization has remained unclear. One idea is that the LP is organized in a hierarchy, with areas closer to the front of the brain processing more abstract information and enabling flexible thinking. However, evidence for this theory has been limited. A new study used MRI to scan the brain and found a gradient of abstraction in the LP, with areas closer to the front processing more abstract information. Dynamic modeling showed asymmetrical interactions between areas of the LP, indicating hierarchical processing. Contrary to expectations, the middle area of the LP was found to be the most connected to other areas, suggesting it's at the top of the hierarchy. The study also found that demands on the brain's control system strengthened connections to the middle LP, consistent with its role in integrating information for decision-making. Furthermore, the strength of these dynamics was related to higher-level cognitive ability. The results suggest the LP is organized in a hierarchy with the middle area synthesizing abstract and concrete information for behavior.

The study confirmed the front-to-back axis of the LP operates by examining gradients of stimulus specificity and control. It also modeled interactions among LP sub-regions to see how demands elicit asymmetrical influences of hierarchical processing. The orientation of the middle LP in connectivity and top-down influences from front to middle during control were related to higher-level ability. The organization of LP is tied to cognitive capacity. The study suggests top-down control within LP is important for higher function. Stronger hierarchical projections from middle to other LP regions were related to higher ability, suggesting a beneficial effect of a hierarchy with middle at the top.

The study examined interactions within LP by varying demands on domain and control. Collectively, demands engaged LP for a comprehensive account of function. It found progressively front areas processed abstract levels of control with Feature, Contextual, and Temporal eliciting front activations. Dynamic modeling showed hierarchical asymmetries strongest in middle. Demands elicited top-down from front to middle and bottom from back to middle. Analyses of connectivity and modulations suggest middle forms a nexus where information converges to action.
Researchers have discovered a gene called TBCD1 that plays a crucial role in the development of the brain's outer layer in mice. This gene is specific to humans and great apes, and its role in brain development was not well understood until now. They found that when T1 is expressed in the brain of mice, it causes the generation of a type of cell called outer radial glia, which is abundant in great apes. This type of cell is important for brain expansion and folding, which is linked to higher intelligence. Down-regulation of T1 in human brain slices reduced the generation of these cells. When T was expressed in mice, it caused the brain to fold, similar to what is seen in great apes. The study suggests that T is a key gene for brain expansion and folding, and that brain development can be controlled by genes duplicated during human evolution.
Researchers have found that a key protein called NPR1 plays a crucial role in a plant's immune system, helping it to fight off pathogens. NPR's activity is controlled by a process called ubiquitination, where it gets tagged with small protein molecules called ubiquitin. This tagging is thought to help NPR reach its target genes and turn them on. However, NPR is also broken down by the proteasome, a process that can be costly to the plant. Scientists wondered if ubiquitination happens before NPR is broken down. They found that NPR gets tagged with ubiquitin first by an enzyme called CRL, which helps it reach its target genes. Later, another enzyme UBE adds more ubiquitin to NPR, marking it for breakdown by the proteome. However, two other enzymes called UBP7 can remove ubiquitin from NPR, keeping it active longer. The study shows that NPR's activity is controlled by a balance of these enzymes, not just its breakdown. Without UBE, NPR can't turn on its target genes as well, showing CRL's role in NPR's activity.
Researchers have identified the precursors of a type of small RNA molecule called 24 nucleotide interfering RNA (24 siRNA) that guides DNA methylation and silencing in Arabidopsis thalian plants. These 24 siRNAs are crucial for silencing transposons and a subset of genes, and their biogenesis requires RNA polymerase IV (Pol) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (R2) and Dicer-like 3 (D3). However, the precursors of these siRNAs were previously undefined. The study found that Pol and R2-dependent RNAs (PR RNAs) accumulate in Dicer 3 mutants and are diced into 24RNAs by Dicer 3 in vitro. PR RNAs are mostly 26-45 nucleotides long and initiate with a purine adjacent to pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol transcripts in vitro. R2 terminal transfer activity, demonstrated in vitro, may account for non-templated nucleotides at PR RNA 3 termini. The 24 siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5 or 3 ends of PR RN, suggesting a model whereby siRN are generated from either end PR duplexes by single dicing events.

The study found that PR RNAs are dependent on both Pol and R2, and can overlap at a given locus, but represent individual Pol-R2 transcription units. Data indicate that double-stranded PR RN that accumulate in Dicer mutants are immediate precursors siRN, based on ability Dicer to cut precursors into 24RN in vitro. Results are consistent with previous findings that Pol and R2 are essential for biogenesis 24 siRN and physically associate in Arabidopsis and maize.
Researchers studied how the development of brain networks in mice and humans to understand how they become able to process complex information. They used high-tech tools to record brain activity in mice from birth to 2 weeks old. They found that brain activity was quiet and disorganized at first, but then suddenly became synchronized and precise at 1-2 weeks old. This transition was similar in humans, suggesting it's an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. They think this quiet period is necessary for brain networks to work together.

The study found that before 1 week, brain cells and connections were not working together, but after 1-2 weeks, they were synchronized and oscillating in space and time. This is important for many functions like attention, memory, and learning. How brain develops from simple to complex is not well understood, but this study shows a key step in the process. Brain's ability to process information comes from precise coordination of cells and connections.

The quiet period was marked by decrease in activity, then increase in synchronized oscillations and precise signals. This shift from local to organized, spatial and temporal activity. Researchers think disappearance of immature patterns signals emergence of advanced network properties. During this time, brain's connections and layers are changing, and synapses are forming.

Brain's ability to process information comes from precise coordination of cells and connections. This study shows a key step in how brain develops from simple to complex. Brain's ability to process information comes from precise coordination of cells and connections.
Researchers have been trying to understand how the malaria parasite Plasium falciparum, which causes malaria, spreads and how it can be controlled. A key part of this is understanding is how the parasite's genes change and adapt to the human immune system. The parasite has many copies of a gene called var, which helps it hide from the immune system by changing its surface proteins. This makes it hard to develop a vaccine or treatment. A new model was created to study how these genes change and how they interact with the human immune system. The model shows that even when the parasite has many copies of the gene, the immune system can still select for certain versions that are good at hiding. This means that even if transmission is high, the parasite will still have some versions that are good at evading the immune. This was tested with real data and found to be true. 

The parasite's complexity makes it hard to control, but also gives a chance to understand it better. The model can be tested to see if it's right. The model looks at how the parasite's genes change and how they compete with each other in the human body. It shows that the parasite can have different versions that are good at hiding from the immune, even with many copies of the gene. This is because the immune selects for versions that are good at hiding. This means that even if transmission is high, the parasite will still have versions that are good at evading the immune. This was tested with real data and found to be true.
Researchers have found that a protein called OI from the bacteria Shigella flexner disrupts the interaction between two other proteins, UBC and TRAF6, by changing a single amino acid in UBC from glutamine to glutamate. This change, called deidation, prevents the UBC/TR6 complex from working properly, which in turn silences the NF-κ inflammatory response. The researchers wanted to understand how deid affects the U/TR6 interaction and found that it does so in three ways: it creates a new intramolecular saltbridge in UBC that competes with a critical intermolecular bridge in the native complex, disrupts the transient interactions necessary for the complex to form, and repels the negatively charged glutamate from the negatively charged surface of TR6, preventing interaction. This shows how a post-translational modification can change the shape and stability of a complex to prevent protein-protein association.
Researchers studied the role of two types of interneurons in the auditory cortex, somostatin-positive (S+) and parvalbum-positive (Pb+) neurons, by manipulating their activation and inactivation in awake mice. They found that inactivating S+ neurons increased response gain, while inactivating P+ neurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer, suggesting these neurons support different functions. However, activating S+ and P+ neurons showed no differences. This challenges the common assumption that activation and inactivation would produce consistent insights into neurons' roles. A simple model showed that small changes in parameters, such as spontaneous activity or light strength, determined whether activation or inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions about neurons' functions.

The study used single-unit recordings in the auditory cortex of mice and optogenetically manipulated S and P neurons while recording responses to tones. They found that inactivating S neurons increased response, while inactivating P neurons weakened and decreased information, implying these neurons support separate functions. However, activating S and P neurons showed no differences. The researchers tested this assumption by manipulating the two main cortical interneuron families, S and P, while recording neural responses in awake mice.

To evaluate interneuron suppression of auditory responses, they applied the same framework to 59 units from S mice and 57 from P mice whose responses were tuned and suppressed by interurons. They excluded units suppressed by more than 80% and included narrow-spiking and broad-spiking units. The stimulus preferences of interurons are important for output. For example, in cortex, P+ cells are activated by broad tones, while S neurons respond to narrower tones.

In optogenetically manipulating interurons, comparing neuron FTC in light-on versus light conditions would reveal change in neuron fit model, and transformation multiplicative, additive, or combination.
Researchers used a technique called transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to study how brain activity in the frontopetal network affects working memory performance. This network is a group of brain regions that works together to help us remember and process information. They found that when they stimulated this network with tACS, people performed better on a working memory task when it was hard. They also used fMRI to see what was happening in the brain while people were doing the task. The results showed that when tACS was done at the right time, it increased activity in the parietal region, which is part of the frontetal network, and this was linked to better performance. The study also found that how tACS affected connections between brain regions in the network depended on the phase of stimulation. When t was in sync with brain activity, it helped flow between regions, but when out of sync it hindered it. This shows that large-scale brain synchronization is important for working memory and can be influenced by external stimulation.
Scientists have long known that the polarity of an embryo, or its orientation, is determined by maternal factors present in the egg in in invertebrates and amphibians and fish. However, in amni vertebrates, such as birds and mammals, the embryo remains plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. Researchers wanted to know how polarity is determined in these embryos. In the chick embryo, a factor called cV1, similar to a mammalian growth factor, is expressed before gastrulation. A search for upstream regulators of c1 in normal and manipulated embryos found a transcription factor called Pit2 as a candidate. The study shows Pit2 is essential for axis formation and regulates c1 expression by binding to nearby genes. Pit2, c1, and Nodal are also key in left-right asymmetry, suggesting the same polarity mechanism has been co-opted for different functions during evolution.

A screen for new genes involved in early polarity identified Pit2 as a direct regulator of c1 in normal development and twinning. In vertebrates, polarity is established by maternal determinants in the egg, generating differences between cells that form from the egg. Higher vertebrates retain regulative development until late, suggesting maternal determinants not essential. The study implicates Pit2 as the earliest gene to regulate axis and twinning.

Pit2 is expressed in the same area as c1 in whole and bisected embryos, and before c1. Results implicate Pit2 as upstream of c1: it's a transcription factor, expressed in same domain as c1, and before c.
Fruit flies use their sense of smell to navigate and find food, mates, but how do they process changing smells in the air? Researchers studied how fruit flies respond to smells that get stronger or weaker over time. They found that a type of neuron in the fly's brain, called a projection neuron, signals how fast the smell is changing, not just how strong it is. This helps the fly detect when a smell starts or gets stronger. The researchers created a simple model to show how this works and tested it with different smells. The model showed that the neuron's signal depends on how fast the smell is changing, not just how strong it is. This helps the fly detect a smell before it moves away from it. The fly's brain gets this information from two types of neurons: sensory and projection. Sensory neurons detect smells and send signals to projection neurons, which send to the brain. Projection neurons signal how fast the smell is changing, not just how strong. This helps the fly detect when a smell starts or gets stronger. The researchers tested this with different smells and found it works. This helps the fly detect a smell before it moves away. The fly's brain gets this information from two types of neurons: sensory and projection. Sensory detect smells and send signals to projection, which send to brain. Projection signal how fast smell is changing, not how strong. This helps detect when smell starts or gets stronger.
In plants, seed development begins with the fusion of egg and sperm cells to form an embryo and endosperm, surrounded by a maternal seed coat. Before fertilization, the seed coat's development is blocked by epigenetic regulators from the Polycomb Group (Pc) family. Researchers found that fertilization triggers auxin production in the endosperm, which is likely exported to the maternal tissues, driving seed coat development and removing Pc function. They also discovered that the MADS transcription factor AGL62 regulates auxin transport from endperm to integuments, leading to seed abortion. AGL mutants have impaired auxin transport, resulting in early seed abortion and failure to develop a coat. The study suggests AGL and auxin are involved in both endperm and seed development pathways. Evidence supports this hypothesis: aux accumulates in integuments after fertilization, impaired biosynthesis but not signaling in endperm causes coat defects, ovules producing aux ectopically in central cell initiate coat without fertilization, and ag62 failure correlates with coat development.
Scientists have long known that the interaction between a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria) and its host is crucial for the phage's ability to infect and replicate. However, the details of how this interaction are not well understood. The receptor binding protein (RBP) of the phage plays a key role in this process. Researchers used a new method called ORACLE (Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Library) to create a large library of phage variants with single amino acid substitutions at every position in the RBP of the T7 phage. They then tested these variants on multiple hosts to see how they affected the phage's ability to infect. The results showed that some substitutions made the ph more effective on certain hosts, while others made it less effective on others. The researchers also found that some substitutions made the ph resistant to certain hosts, while others eliminated its ability to infect them. To demonstrate the potential of this method, they engineered a highly effective T7 phage against a common urinary tract pathogen. The study provides a framework for understanding the relationship between sequence and function in phage-bacterial systems.
Individuals with congenital amusia, a lifelong condition characterized by unreliable pitch processing, tend to rely on other dimensions such as duration when perceiving speech. Researchers investigated the neural basis of this strategy using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 15 individuals with amus and 15 controls. Participants read sentences where a comma indicated a grammatical boundary, then heard two spoken sentences differing in pitch and/or duration and selected the best match for the written. Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amia group between left frontal language regions and right pitch-related areas, reflecting between-group differences in cue weights. These differences were not present during a control task.

The study found individuals with amia, who rely less on pitch than controls to process language, exhibited decreased connectivity between frontal and right pitch regions. In the task, participants matched spoken sentences with visually presented based on pitch, duration, or both dimensions. Results indicate the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked to connectivity between frontal and percept regions, suggesting a compensatory mechanism.

Functional connectivity in amusic and nonusic may differ during speech in pitch-related tasks. To determine the reliability of auditory dimensions in perception, fMRI was used to scan individuals with amia and controls. Results are consistent with right auditory areas not connected to frontal as during tonal tasks, but less integrated with left regions when processing language. No differences in activation during speech are consistent with reports amics and controls not differing in pitch representations. Pitch regions within auditory cortex are similar in amia and controls, and brain encoding pitch in speech and musical stimuli unimpaired in amia.

The study suggests amics neglect pitch because they learned their memory is unreliable, down-weighting pitch reflected in decreased connectivity between auditory and areas integrating regions.
Researchers have discovered a new cancer in Tasmanian devils called Devil Tum 2 (D2) that can spread from one animal to another. This is different from a similar cancer, Devilum 1 (D1), which is already widespread in the species. Unlike D1, D2 cancer cells express a protein that helps the immune system recognize them, called major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. This suggests that losing MHC is not necessary for a cancer to become contagious. However, the most common MHC I in D2 cells are shared among devils, making them less recognizable to the immune system. This is similar to how D1 emerged, which also lost MHC I. The study found that D2 cells express both classical and non-classical MHC I molecules, unlike D1 which lost M I. The most common M I in D2 is shared with devils and the wider population. M I varies among D2 tumors, suggesting some may lose I and spread more easily. This shows D2 expresses M I, unlike D1 and contagious cancer in dogs. Further study is needed to understand the immune response to D2 and its role in cancer evolution. D1 cells are currently M I negative, but may have lost I after becoming contagious and initial spread among those with shared I. The similarity of M I between D2 and devils may be due to shared range and genetic pool of the cancer's origin. The frequency of this allele in the population may impact D2's ability to spread.
Researchers have long known that the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG) plays a crucial role in both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the underlying neural mechanisms are not well understood. A new study used optogenetic mapping in mice to reveal that parallel circuits in the superficial SG process different types of information. The thalamus and subiculum, sources of spatial information, selectively recruit low-rase (LR) pyramidal cells in SG, while neighboring regular-spiking (RS) cells are controlled by clastral and cingulate inputs, sources of non-spatial information. This is due to precise subaminar and dendritic arbor within SG layer 1, which allows parallel processing. Thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable LR neurons to compute speed of rotation, despite receiving direction inputs that don't explicitly encode speed.

The study found that anterioralam and subulum preferentially control LR neurons, while clastr and culate control RS cells. Synaptic dynamics of thamic inputs allow robust encoding of angular speed by LR cells, even though inputs only contain direction, not speed. Layer 3 of SG contains two types of pyramidal neurons: LR and RS. The distinct morphology and properties of LR make them suited to integrate direction from thalam and spatial from hippocamp via subulum. Integration of types of directional and distance is key function of retrosial as whole.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant risk factor for developing dementia, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a condition characterized by the accumulation of tau protein aggregates in the brain. However, the mechanisms that promote the spread of tau aggregates after TBI are not fully understood, partly due to the lack of suitable animal models. Researchers tested the role of seizures in spreading tauopathy by introducing a "tauopathy" zebraf, genetically engineered to express a fluorescent biosensor that reports tau accumulation when seeded by intraventricular brain injections. Subjecting zraf larvae to a novel TBI paradigm produced TBI features, including cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and tau inclusions. Application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued T-induced tauopathy and cell death, suggesting a role for seizure activity in prion seeding and spreading of tau following TBI.

Zebraf larvae, fostered by innovations, offer a complement to rodent models of T and cellular models of tauopathy, allowing researchers to reveal postumatic seizures as a drable mechanistic link T and prion progression of tauopathy. A burst of neural activity occurs during T, and zraf exposed to T exhibit a higher propensity for spontaneous seizures. TBI induces Tau aggregates in Tau biosensor, and postumatic correlate strongly with spreading pathology following T. Manipulating seizure activity mitigated aggregation, revealing a role endocyt in prion spread of seeds in vivo T. Results implicate seizures and endocyt in spread of Tau, offering therapeutic targets.
Researchers have long studied how different parts of the brain communicate with each other, known as functional connectivity. They've used "connectivity fingerprints" to describe brain activity patterns in individuals. This study looked at how the arrangement of brain regions relates to connectivity measures. It found that the shape and location of brain regions strongly affect connectivity, and that the arrangement of regions is linked to behavior and lifestyle. In some cases, differences in brain arrangement are mistaken for changes in connectivity. Understanding this is key to interpreting brain imaging data and traits.

The study focused on two aspects: interactions between populations (coupling) and the arrangement of regions (topography). It aimed to see how these affect connectivity measures and relate to behavior across individuals. Misalignment of brain regions is a significant issue in studies. Recent advances have improved alignment across individuals.

The brain's large-scale networks have been studied using resting functional MRI. Fluctuations in regions show correlations, revealing patterns of connectivity. Our results show network matrices contain unique information not reflected in region arrangement. The brain's organization is key to interpreting findings. The implication is that commonly used "connectivity" reflects location variability, not strength.
Scientists have long believed that a specific group of proteins, called the TFIID complex, plays a crucial role in controlling which genes are turned on or off in different cell types of cells. A key component of this complex, called TBP, was thought to be replaced by another protein, TBP2, in muscle cells to allow for muscle-specific gene expression. However, new research shows that TBP, not TBP2, is essential for muscle gene expression in skeletal muscle cells. The study found that T2 is not present in muscle cells derived from muscle stem cells or primary muscle cells, and mice lacking T2 have normal muscle regeneration ability. This suggests that T2 is not necessary for muscle gene expression in muscle stem cells, which are responsible for muscle development and growth in adults. The researchers compared the expression of T and T2 genes in muscle stem cells from normal mice and a cell line and found that T is present in both. They also found that mice lacking T have normal muscle regeneration ability and muscle stem cells from these mice differentiate into muscle cells as well as those from normal mice. The study suggests that the TID complex is present in muscle cells and drives gene expression during muscle development into muscle cells. To test this, the researchers looked at T subunits of the complex in muscle cells and found no defects in muscle development without T2. Importantly, they found same number of stem cells in muscles of normal and mice 12 days after injury, indicating ability to proliferate, self-renew, and differentiate during muscle regeneration without T2.
Researchers used a technique called optogenetics to stimulate the brains of non-human primates, specifically macaques, to study how it affects the excitability of neural circuits and neuroplasticity. They used a large-scale optogen interface to simultaneously stimulate excitatory neurons and record electrocortic activity across two areas of the brain, primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M) cortex. They tracked two measures of network connectivity, the response to stimulation and baseline between pairs of electrodes, which were strongly correlated before stimulation. Within minutes, stimulation in S or M significantly strengthened the functional connectivity between these areas. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous changes across the network, reflecting correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent with Hebbian plasticity models. This work extends Hebb plastic models to large circuits, with implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation.

The study found a robust relationship between stimulus-evoked and changes in baseline connectivity across the network, explained by a Hebb model of large stimulation-induced plasticity. They also investigated how stimulation impacts between and within areas, testing whether stimulation-ev activity drives large network plasticity in a Hebb manner. The goal was to investigate large functional reorganization following stimulation, informing future neurohab strategies. The study used a large optogen interface enabling simultaneous stimulation of populations and large μ-electrocortic activity across S and M. They established two measures of functional providing complementary views of plasticity. Hebb rules have explained synaptic plasticity, so they explored if large stimulation changes are consistent with Hebb plastic. The strongest test of Hebb is comparing correlations induced by stimulation with changes in network observed. Artifact-free signals allowed this test. Despite differences, both support a role for Hebb in sensorotor cortical plastic.
Researchers studied a rare case of a rhesus macaque monkey born without primary visual cortex (V1) to understand how the brain compensates for damage to this area. The monkey's behavior was normal, but it struggled with visual tasks. MRI scans showed that areas outside of V1 were intact and normal. When shown visual stimuli, the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvin were activated, but V5 activation was sparse and patchy. Functional analysis revealed a network of dorsal areas, including V5/MT, correlated with V1, even without it. Despite strong subcortical responses, there was little evidence of strengthened subort input to V/MT for residual vision or blindsight.

Visual structures outside the large V lesion in the monkey were intact, suggesting a role in residual function, consistent with an intact network of extrastate visual areas. Connectivity between subort regions and V/MT was weak, but microstructure intact. Enlarged ventricles within the lesion may have affected anesthesia pattern. Figure 6 showed no V/MT activation to checkerboard or moving stimuli, so analysis was performed. Weakened tract between V/MT and subort nuclei indicated little strengthening of connections underlies residual vision. Residual vision can manifest in different ways, including face information, as in patient TN (Bur et al, 2013). For motion, monkey showed activation in V/ in ST of hemispheres, possibly subthreshold and difficult to detect. Without strong V/ responses, a network of areas showed similar BOLD response to V. Retinal information may reach dorsal areas via LG and pul, but lack of activation makes difficult.
The innate immune system's ability to recognize foreign double-stranded (ds) DNA in the cell is crucial for defense against pathogens. However, how it distinguishes between foreign and host DNA in the nucleus is not well understood. Researchers used biochemical and single-molecule techniques to study the immune sensor IF16 and found that it scans long stretches of exposed dsDNA to form supramolecular platforms. They also discovered that nucleosomes block IF16 from targeting host DNA by interfering with its one-dimensional movement. This unique scanning mechanism allows IF16 to distinguish between friend and foe and assemble on foreign DNA efficiently.

 IF16 is a key immune sensor that detects dsDNA and assembles signaling platforms in the nucleus and cytoplasm. It plays a role in defense against several pathogens, including herpes virus. Researchers observed a unifying mechanism that explains IF16's foreign-dsensing pathways. They used time-resolved and single-molecule assays to show IF16 scans dsDNA to form clusters, and chromatin inhibits IF16 from targeting hostDNA. In vivo, this scanning allows limited IF16 molecules to target large pathogens.

IF16 is composed of three domains with unstructured linkers, one pyrin and two ds-binding domains. The researchers propose one-dimensional assembly regulates IF16 immune responses. Chromatin has been thought to allow IF16 to distinguish host from DNA in the nucleus.
Scientists have developed a new technique called spatially targeted microproteomics (ST) to study protein deposits in the brain that are linked to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. This method, called STOMP, uses a special microscope to shine light on specific areas of the brain tissue and attach a tag to the proteins in those areas. The tag is then removed and sent to a machine that breaks it down the proteins into tiny pieces to identify what they are made of. In a test, ST was used to study amyloid plaques in mice and human brains with Alzheimer's disease, confirming known proteins and finding new ones. This technique can be used on many types of samples, including cells, tissues, and biopsies.

ST is different from other methods because it doesn't need to genetically modify the tissue or use harsh chemicals to fix it. It uses a special light to attach the tag to proteins, not just to image them. This allows for better resolution, about 0.67 micrometers in two dimensions and 1.48 micrometers in depth. The amount of tissue needed for analysis can vary, depending on factors like how the tissue is fixed and how sensitive the machine is.

ST was tested on amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's mice and human brains, confirming known proteins and finding new ones. Gel electrophoresis showed a different pattern of proteins compared to when amyloid plaques were specifically targeted. The predominant protein tagged was Aβ, not visible in non-targeted experiment due to low abundance. This technique has potential to advance research on neurodegenerative diseases and cell biology by studying small features hard to purify.

ST uses two-photon laser microscopy to photochemically link affinity ligands to proteins in pathological deposits. The ligand used is a peptide with a benzyl group that forms coval bonds with C and N groups upon excitation. This is the first application of two-photon to affinity labeling, offering better resolution than current methods like LCM.
Researchers have discovered that the Frizz3 gene plays a crucial role in the development of axons in certain cranial and spinal motor neurons. When the Frizz gene is disrupted, axons in the seventh and twelfth cranial nerves, the phrenic nerve, and dorsal nerves in the front and back limbs stall at a specific point. Unlike other axon-guidance mutants, these axons do not reroute to alternative paths. Motor neurons with stalled axons die two days before the normal developmental cell death, which coincides with muscle innervation in vivo. This suggests that neurons with long axons are programmed to die if their axons do not reach targets on time.

In the limb, Frizz absence leads to a specific stalling defect among long motor axons, distinct from other ax-guidance mutants. Cranial and spinal motor neurons die after axons stall, supporting the idea that axons receive survival signals from targets. Researchers investigated the cause of axon deficiency in Frizz mice: defective neuron differentiation, excessive death, or growth/guidance. Since most Frizz axons do not follow erroneous paths, aberrant pathfinding is unlikely.

A model suggests survival factors produced by targets along axon trajectory, as in vitro experiments with spinal cord and floor plate tissue. A wave of premature neuron death is observed in Frizz, but not controls. A subset of motor neurons exhibit ax growth and death in Frizz embryos. Controlling ax growth may be Frizz function in motor neurons. Frizz and Cels brains have identical ax defects, and Frizz Cels Vangl spinal commiss axons exhibit rostral defect.
Researchers studied the role of transposable elements (TEs) in gene regulation in mouse embryonic and trophlast stem cells. Transposable elements are repeated DNA sequences that can jump from one location to another in the genome and are thought to have helped establish gene networks in the early embryo. However, it was unclear if they play a significant role in gene regulation. The team tested a set of long repeat families as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophlast stem cells. Epigen and transcript data showed that many TEs helped establish tissue-specific gene programs. Genetic editing of T confirmed a subset of these relationships. However, a wider survey via CRISPR of RL13 elements in embryonic cells revealed only a minority play significant roles in regulation. Results suggest a subset T are important for gene in early development and highlight the importance of functional experiments evaluating regulatory T roles.

The team found that other T play minor or no role in regulation, despite strong evidence at chromatin composition and conformation. To test a single experiment the roles of multiple enhancers in ESCs, they performed CRPR interference at RL13 elements. Data aligned with chrom accessibility suggest T may support specific expression of subset genes in development. However, correlations may emerge without causal links T and expression. To test a role of enhancers in regulation, they performed CRPR genetic excision of selected T. To validate small effect of enhancers on expression, they performed genetic experiments. Two RL13 elements displayed 2-fold H3ac levels upon CRPR but little effect neighboring expression.

The team tested regulatory of specific families in ESC and TSC using genetic and epetic approaches and compared with predictions from analyses epomic and transcript data. Identified T that drive expression lineage genes. Extensive work necessary evaluate proportion act redundant with other elements.
Scientists have studied how a complex trait called C4 photosynthesis evolved in plants, which allows them to make food from sunlight more efficiently. This trait appeared independently in at least 60 different plant lineages, but how it happened is unclear. Researchers looked at 18 lineages with C3, C, and intermediate C-C photosynthesis and created a 16-dimensional map of their characteristics. They developed a new method to predict how C4 photosynthesis evolved and found that different lineages took different paths to get it. The order in which C photosynthesis appeared is flexible and driven by factors other than photosynthesis. This flexibility helped the complex trait to evolve in multiple lineages.

A new method was created to predict evolutionary paths from limited data. It was used to study C photosynthesis, one of the most complex traits to appear in lineages. C photosynthesis can't be fully studied experimentally, so it's a good for modeling complex trait evolution on a landscape. Different types of C photosynthesis evolved due to alternative histories and non-photosynthetic pressures. Early events determined downstream phenotypes of C-types by restricting lineages to independent paths.

Multiple pathways generate C photosynthesis and may be key to convergent evolution of complex traits. This can help engineer C photosynthesis in C species. Cellular alterations are acquired early in C photosynthesis in several genera. These early traits didn't change the order of original 16 traits, suggesting they are robust.
Researchers studied a protein called SpoIVA, which is involved in the formation of a bacterial spore, a protective structure that helps the bacteria survive harsh conditions. SpoIVA breaks down ATP, a molecule that provides energy, to form a polymer, a long chain of molecules. This process is different from GTP, another molecule that typically acts as a switch. SpoIVA evolved from a protein that breaks GTP, but the reason for this change is unclear. To understand this, the researchers modified the part of Spo that binds to molecules, making it act like a GTPase. However, it still didn't form a necessary intermediate step for polymerization. Adding ATP, but not GTP, didn't help either. This suggests that the type of molecule, not just the energy released, is important for Spo's function. The researchers also found that during spore formation, there's more ATP than GTP, which may have driven the change in Spo's preference. They tested this by making Spo work with different molecules and found that it needs ATP, not GTP, to change shape and form polymers. This shows that the type of molecule can influence a protein's function.
Scientists have long known that leptin plays a crucial role in regulating energy balance and has neurotrophic effects during critical periods of development. However, its role in development is not yet fully understood. To uncover the importance of leptin in early life, researchers restored leptin signaling in mice lacking the leptin receptor gene at four or ten weeks of age. They found that some defects previously thought irreversible due to neonatal leptin deficiency, such as poor development of arcuate nucleus projections, were recovered by leptin reactivation in adulthood. However, leptin deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity through suppression of energy expenditure. Lept reactivation in adulthood also led to persistent reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cart, and Prlh expression and defects in reproductive and growth systems. The study revealed that early leptin defects cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems.
Arabidopsis plants have a complex immune system that helps them fight off bacterial infections. A key part of this system is the FLS receptor, which recognizes a bacterial flagellin protein called flg22. When fl22 binds to FLS, it activates the cytoplasmic kinase B1, or B1, which triggers an immune response. But scientists didn't know how a group of proteins called heterotrimer G, composed of XL2, A1, and G1/2, fit into this process. They found that before fl22 binds, XL2 interacts with FLS and B1, and together with A1 and G1/2, they keep B1 from being broken down by the proteasome. This allows the immune response to work properly. After fl22 binds, XL2 leaves A1 and is phosphorylated by B1. The phosphorylated XL2 boosts the production of reactive oxygen species, likely by modulating the NAD oxidase Rho. The study shows that these proteins are directly connected to the FLS receptor and regulate the immune response before and after fl22 binds.

The researchers found that XL2, A1, and G1/2 modulate fl22-triggered immunity by connecting to the FLS-B1 complex. Before fl22, they slow down the breakdown of B1 by the proteasome. After22, XL2 leaves A1 and is phosphorylated by B. Introducing a copy of B1 restored fl22 responses and resistance in XL and A mutants, showing the G proteins keep the FLS-B1 complex working. The proteins interact with FLS-B1 during signaling and the findings match defects in fl22 responses and Rho phosphorylation in G mutants.
Researchers have studied the internal biological clock of the plant Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant, to understand how it regulates its daily rhythms. They found that each cell in the plant has its own internal clock, but these clocks are not perfectly synchronized. In fact, they found two waves of activity, one going down and one up, in the root of the plant. The researchers also discovered that cells in the root communicate with each other, especially at the tip of the root. A simple model showed that this communication and differences in clock speed between cells can create the observed patterns. The study reveals the structure of the plant's clock and suggests it's different from the human clock, which has a central control center. Instead, Arabid's clock has multiple points of control.

The researchers measured the strength of communication between cells and found it's strong in the root. A model showed that the observed differences in clock speed and communication can create the waves of gene expression. The study shows the robustness and structure of the plant's circadian system. However, the results suggest the plant's clock is more complex than previously thought, as the model doesn't explain short oscillations in the root or wave of gene expression from the root. The study supports a decentralized model of clock in plants, where each cell has its own control.

The researchers used a reporter gene to track the clock's dynamics across the plant at single cell level over several days. They found coherent waves of gene expression suggesting the plant's signal is coupled. To measure communication, they calculated a parameter and estimated strength based on mammalian cells. Results show desynchronization of cells with different periods causes damping at the plant level, not noise or low numbers of molecules. Two waves of expression, up and down, in the root, with variable periods, cause desynchronization.
Researchers studied how the brain processes speech in noisy environments where multiple speakers are talking at the same time. They found that some people with normal hearing have trouble understanding speech in these situations, even though their hearing tests show no problems. The team used a combination of behavioral and physiological tests to identify markers that predict how well someone can understand speech in noise. They found that nearly 80% of the variation in speech understanding can be explained by three factors: how the brain processes sound, how hard someone tries to listen, and frequency modulation cues measured in the ear. These markers could help design new tests for hearing disorders that don't show up in clinical tests. 

The study involved over 100,000 people with normal hearing who had trouble understanding speech in noise. They used behavioral tests to measure how well they could understand speech in noise and physiological tests to see how brain processes sound and how hard they try to listen. They found that people with steeper pupil functions had more trouble with speech in noise, and a significant correlation between pupil change and speech threshold. The team wanted to find objective markers for complaints of poor communication in people with normal hearing. They found strong association between psychophysical tests for frequency modulation and speech-noise intelligibility due to early auditory processing. The correlation between low frequency encoding and intelligibility might be due to fast processing fidelity and speech.
Scientists have long struggled to visualize the tiny blood vessels in the retina, a part of the central nervous system, due to the imperfections in the eye's optics that blur microscopic capillaries and blood cells. To overcome this, researchers used a technique called adaptive optics to noninvasively measure single-cell flow in the C57/BL6 mouse, a widely used research animal. They measured flow in four orders of magnitude, from 0.0001 to 0.55 microliters per minute, across vessel diameters from 3.2 to 45.8 micrometers, without surgery or dye. This was achieved with ultrafast imaging and automated analysis of millions of cell speeds.

Previous studies using adaptive optics enabled nonin measurement of single-cell velocity, but not in full range of vessel sizes in mammalian retinal circulation. This was due to automation needed for measurements in larger vessels with thousands of cells per second. This study reports single velocity and flow in smallest to largest vessels in mouse retina, enabled by ALO imaging with ultrafast camera nonvas image cells without contrast. Pairing this with automated workflow, high-throughput measurement of thousands cells per second was achieved.

Quantification of blood flow will be applicable to clinical approaches using same instrumentation. This study innovates strategies and algorithms to image cells nonvas in smallest to largest mouse retinal circulation, diameters 3.2 to 45.8 micrometers, without exogenous agents. Label-free imaging improved contrast single cells in retina compared to dye techniques, especially high flow conditions. This method may serve understanding microcirculation in CNS and systemic health.
Scientists have long been trying to understand how plants decide between two types of symbiotic relationships: arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing nodule symbiosis. These relationships are crucial for plant growth and survival, but the mechanisms behind them are not well understood. Researchers have found that a receptor-like kinase called Symbiosis Receptor Kin (SYK) plays a key role in both, but how it discriminates between the two types is unclear. They discovered that ectopic expression of three receptor-like genes, Nod Factor Receptor 1 (N1), N5, and SYK, triggers spontaneous nodule formation and nodule-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Overexpression of N1 or N5 with endogenous SYK in the legume Lotus japonicus revealed that SYK initiates signaling independently of N1 or N5 and a set of genes required for calcium-spiking in both symbiosis. However, SYK but not N overexpression triggered AM-related genes, indicating SYK plays a key role in deciding between AM or nodule symbiosis development.
Researchers have developed a new software called DeepKit to help scientists estimate the position of an animal's body parts from images or videos quickly and accurately. This is important for studying behavior in various fields like neuroscience and ecology. Current methods have limitations in speed and reliability. DeepKit uses a new model called StackedNet and a fast algorithm to detect key points with high precision, improving speed by 2 times with no loss in accuracy. It can be used in various settings, including groups of animals interacting. This makes advanced tools more accessible for measuring behavior and applicable across sciences.

The software, DeepKit, is built on state-of-the-art individual estimation using convolutional neural networks for fast inference without losing accuracy or generalization. The new model, StackedNet, offers improvements over previous models. The code, documentation, and examples are available at https://github.com/graving/deeposekit under an open-source license. The goal is to achieve fast estimation like Pereira et al (2019) while keeping predictive power of models like DeepCut (Math et al). This could lead to larger, more reliable datasets revolutionizing understanding of behavior, brain, and environment.

Deep learning-based methods can achieve human-level accuracy in any scenario by annotating data and training a CNN to estimate body parts directly from images. However, fast and real-time inference is challenging due to processing large data or downsampling, increasing error (Math and Warren 2018). Stacked model can run at 30-110 Hz depending on resolution. Unlike computer vision methods, deep-learning can achieve high accuracy by annotating data and training a CNN to estimate body parts directly from images.
When immune cells, such as macrophages, are exposed to stress or infection, they trigger the formation of protein complexes called inflamomes that cause inflammation and a type of cell death called pyroptosis. Researchers have identified a trigger for this process in immune cells that is the disruption of glycol flux, a process by which cells break down glucose for energy. This disruption leads to a drop in a molecule called NAD and an increase in reactive oxygen species, which can be fixed by adding products that restore NAD. This signal is also important for the body's response to the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimur, which disrupts glucose metabolism in host cells. The study reveals a network by which immune cells sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens.

The pathogen tyim impairs NAD production, leading to mitochondrial changes that activate NLR inflamome. Disruption of glycol flux is a relevant trigger for NLR inflamome activation through redox changes, linking metabolism to inflammation initiation. Immune cells sense metabolic production and flux through glycol, activating NLR to initiate responses. Inhibitors of glycol enzymes and tyim limit glycol through distinct mechanisms, resulting in NLR inflamome formation and pyptosis. NAD consumption increased upon pyruate treatment, indicating productive metabolism downstream glycol in infected macrophages. Glycol perturbation is a mechanism by which immune cells sense homeostasis during tyim infection and induce pro-inflammatory via NLR inflome and pypt death.

Blocking immune cells sense metabolic perturbation as danger, resulting inflamome, caspase activation, and cytokine secretion. Results using inhibitors suggest disrupting gly flux serves trigger inflammation and death in macroages. Disturbance gly flux by intracellular pathogen tyim. Supplementation of glycol product pyruate resulted in reductions caspase activation, IL-β secretion, and death by GB-N2. Pyruate had no effect inflam signaling by NLR activators and nigerin, indicating pyru does not impair NLR signaling nonspecific
Researchers have discovered a new function of the PALB2 protein, a tumor suppressor linked to various cancers, including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. PAL2 binds to DNA and plays a crucial role in homologous-directed repair (HDR) and interacts with chromatin proteins. A specific DNA-binding site of PAL2 was identified, which reduces RAD51 formation and HDR efficiency by 50% in cells. PAL2's N-terminal DNA-binding domain (NDB) stimulates RAD51 recombinase and surprisingly, possesses strand exchange activity without RAD51. Moreover, NDB stimulates inverse exchange and uses RNA as a substrate. The study reveals PAL2's versatile interaction with DNA and its critical role in chromosome repair.

 PAL2 is a scaffold protein that links BRCA1 and BR2 during HDR and interacts with many chromatin proteins. However, a truncation with preserved BR1 and BR2 binding but without DB does not support BR2 and RAD recruitment to DSBs. Mutations of four amino acids reduce RAD51 formation and HDR efficiency in a cell system. PAL2-DB itself stimulates RAD exchange reactions. PAL2DB supports forward and inverse exchange without RAD51 and uses RNA as substrate. The data highlight PAL's novel activity and importance in chromosome maintenance.

 PAL2 interaction with DNA is critical for BR2 and RAD recruitment to DSB and efficient repair. Cells complemented with PAL2-AAAA display a defect in HR post-IR. The mutant fails to repair a subset DSB due to defective binding. PAL2 interaction with DNA is essential for efficient repair. PAL2DB stimulates RAD-mediated exchange in vitro. Breast cancer proteins 1 and 2 (BR1-2) regulate non-mutagenic pathway repair and are guardians of chromosomal integrity. They initiate RAD51 homologous recombination (HR) and restart stalled replication. PAL2 truncation of 500 amino acids between BR1 and BR2 binding and DB does not support BR2 RAD51 formation during damage.
Researchers have discovered that a bacterial protein called Mre, found in the bacterium Caulobacter cresus, forms filaments that are arranged in an antiparallel, or opposite, fashion. This is different from all other known actin proteins, which form filaments in a parallel fashion. The team used crystallography and electron microscopy to study the structure of Mre filaments and found that they consist of pairs of protoaments that run in opposite directions. This arrangement allows each subunit to interact with the membrane and membrane components of the cell. The non-polar nature of M filaments explains how they assemble and disassemble at both ends.

 The researchers also found that the mechanism of M filament formation is similar to other actin proteins, with a typical domain closure upon polymerization. They studied the interaction of M with antimicrobial agents, A22MP, and found they bind to the nucleotide, preventing hydrolysis and destabilizing the filaments. This suggests a new mechanism for how these agents inhibit M function.

 The antipar arrangement of protoaments is essential for M's role in cell shape maintenance, as shown by in vivo experiments. The team also found that M binds tightly to membranes, which constrains its filament architecture to be straight or slightly bent, rather than helical. The structure of different nucleotide and polymer states of M reveal conformation changes accompanying antipar filament formation.
Researchers studied the difference in petal number between two plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta. Arabidopsis has a fixed number of four petals, while Cardamine has variable petal number. They found that a gene called APETALA1 (AP1) is responsible for this difference. AP1 is a regulator of flower development and controls petal number. In Arabidopsis, AP1 masks the effect of other genes that control petal number, making it robust. In Cardamine, AP1 fails to do this, leading to variable petal. The researchers also found that changes in AP1 regulatory regions contribute to this difference. Despite genetic variation in Cardamine, petal number remains fixed at four in some plants. They showed that AP1 is important in Arabid flower development, initiating and specifying organs. They identified AP as a major gene in the transition from robust to variable petal. However, AP polymorphisms do not contribute to within-species variation in Cardamine petal. Instead, decanalization of pet in Arabid reflects robust genetic variation. They changed Arabid petal to variable by complementing AP mutants with Card AP locus. Flowers mimicked variable pet found in Card. This suggests hidden variability in regulatory network controlling pet in Arabid. Floral organs with pet identity show no variation if outside second whor. AP ectopically expressed in third whor of mutants in Card, associated with invariant petals. Endogenous AP in whor two of Card floral meristem associated with variable pet number.
Researchers have found that a problem with how insulin is made in the body can lead to type 2 diabetes. Insulin is a hormone that helps control sugar levels in the blood. It's made in the pancreas, an organ in the belly. The process of making insulin starts with a protein called proinsulin, which folds into a special shape. This shape is important for insulin to work right. But in some people with type 2 diabetes, proins doesn't fold right. It forms wrong bonds with other proins, making it hard for insulin to work. This problem starts early in the disease, even before symptoms appear.

 Studies in mice and humans show that proins with wrong bonds are more common in people with type 2 diabetes. In mice that are obese and can't make leptin, a hormone that helps control hunger, proins bonds are even more common. Leptin is a hormone that helps control hunger and fullness. Mice that can't make lept are more likely to get type 2. In people with type 2, proins with wrong bonds are found in the pancreas, where insulin is made.

Researchers looked at pancreas from people with type 2 and found pro with wrong bonds. They also looked at mice that are likely to get type 2 and found pro with bonds. They also looked at mice that can't make lept and found pro with bonds. All showed that pro with bonds are early in type 2 and make it harder for insulin to work.
Scientists have long known that a protein called SUVH plays a crucial role in forming a type of chromatin called heterochromatin, which helps silence genes from being expressed. SUVH recognizes a specific mark on histone H3 called H3K9me3, but how it targets chromosomal regions without this mark was unclear. Researchers found that SUVH has a special region called CD that binds to nucleic acids, including RNA and DNA, and this binding is important for its function in heterochatin assembly. SUVH's CD has higher affinity for RNA than DNA and can bind nucleic independently of H3me recognition. In living cells, SUV bound major satellite RNAs and knocking down these RNAs lowered SUV retention on centrom. Mutational studies showed both nucleic-binding and Hme-binding of SUVH CD crucial for perentric heterochatin assembly. These results suggest chrom-bound RN contribute to SUVH's specificity.

SUVH's nucleic-binding integrates with its Hme recognition to establish and maintain perentric heterochatin like Hme formation, HP accumulation, and repressive status. SUV bound major RNA in a manner dependent on nucleic activity and knocking down major RN lowered SUV retention on heterochrom. Data suggest chrom-bound RN contribute to targeting and retention SUV at regions. In addition to Hme, SUV's RNA activity contributes stable association Hme-rich regions. Knocking major transcripts further supports RNA binding SUV contributes stability chrom. Intriguingly, SUV-YA interacted partially with major RN, not fitting model SUV's RNA andme activities cooperatively function in chrom targeting. However, SUV-YA loosely bound chrom, suggesting may interact RN without stable binding. SUV's N-terminal contributed HP and chrom-binding to Hme formation. Collectively, SUV's different activities other than methylase cooperatively regulate perentric heterochatin assembly.
Researchers have discovered that cells in the entorinal cortex, a part of the brain involved in navigation and spatial awareness, can be activated by attention without physical movement. In an experiment, monkeys were trained to focus on a small dot moving on a screen while keeping their eyes still, and 20% of 141 neurons in the entorinal cortex showed spatially structured fields. This is different from the hippocampus, where similar representations were not found. The study suggests that entinal cortex cells don't rely on physical movement to function. 

In the past, it was thought that cells in the entinal cortex were only activated by physical movement, but this study shows they can also be activated by attention. The researchers tested this by recording from single cells in the entinal cortex of monkeys performing a task that required attention. The monkeys were trained to focus on a small dot moving on a screen while keeping their eyes still, and the activity of 141 neurons in the entinal cortex was recorded. The monkeys performed the task with high accuracy, with most errors due to eye movements outside the target. 

The study found that the entinal cortex can represent not only the location of the eyes but also the focus of attention. The results show that cells in the entinal cortex can be activated by attention without physical movement, in the absence of physical movement.
Researchers have developed a standardized task to measure decision-making in mice that produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. They trained 140 mice in seven countries and collected 5 million choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed varied across mice, but once trained, there were no differences in behavior across labs. Mice relied on visual stimuli, past successes, failures, and prior probability to guide choices. This shows complex behavior can be reproduced across labs, establishing a standard for rodent behavior and providing tools to study decision-making in mice. The study suggests a path to achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through open-science approaches.

The researchers developed identical equipment and protocols to study mouse behavior across labs. Mice learned the task in all labs and performed comparably after learning. They relied on visual, past, successes, and prior probability to guide choices. To facilitate reproducibility, they share hardware, software, and protocols. It's recognized that data and techniques should be available to the community (Bdo et al, 2019; Charles et al). Results from a large cohort of mice demonstrate reproducible methods and results across labs. Mice learned at different paces, but performed comparably, with no differences.

Physiological studies use mice to access genetic, imaging, and tools (Carini and Church, 201; Glick et 2014; O'Connor 2009). The International Laboratory aims to explore the neural basis of behavior in multiple labs. This allows comparing results, knowing differences are unlikely due to behavior. Resources will catalyze new adaptations and accelerate neural correlates of decision-making studies.
Scientists have created a detailed map of the genes and cells in the intestine of a type of flatworm called Schmidtea mediterrane, also known as a planarian. This flatworm can regrow its organs, including its gut. The researchers used a technique called laser-capture microsection (LCM) and RNA sequencing to identify hundreds of genes that are active in the intestine. They found that many of these genes are similar to those found in other animals, including humans, including those involved in digestion, nutrient storage, and immunity. This suggests that the planarian's digestive system is similar to that of other animals.

The researchers also found that certain genes are active in specific parts of the intestine, particularly in a type of cell called goblet cells. Goblet cells are important for producing mucus, a substance that helps with digestion. They identified two genes, gli-1 and RE2, that control goblet cell growth and maintenance. Without these genes, goblet cells don't form properly and the planarians can't digest food as well.

The study provides a foundation for understanding how the intestine works and how it regenerates. It also sets the stage for further research on goblet cells, which are important for digestion. The researchers found that goblet cells are crucial for the planarians' ability to eat and survive, but not for regenerating other parts of the body. The study shows that the planarian's intestine is similar to other animals, including humans, and provides a resource for studying digestive system and regeneration.
Scientists have discovered a new way that some weakly electric fish perceive their environment. These fish, called mormyrids, can detect subtle changes in electric signals sent by other fish. They do this by using two types of receptors: spiking and oscillating. Spiking receptors respond to individual fish signals, while oscillating receptors respond to groups of fish. When oscillating receptors receive a signal, they reset their timing, creating synchrony among the receptors. This synchrony encodes the timing and location of the signal, but not the signal's shape. This is different from how humans perceive sound or light, where we can detect both timing and shape. The researchers found that oscillating receptors are sensitive to specific frequencies only found in signals from groups of conspecifics, or fish of the same species. This is linked to increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. The study suggests that different perceptual abilities correspond to different receptor types. The researchers believe these mechanisms are adaptations for different social environments. This is the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony.
Researchers have determined the three-dimensional structure of the bacteriophage BPP-1 at 3.5 Å resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. BPP-1 infects and kills Bordetella species, which cause whooping cough in humans and other mammals. The virus has a T=7 icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 670 Å. The researchers found that the major capsid protein (MCP) has a jellyroll fold, while the major capsid protein (MCP) has an HK-like Johnson fold. However, the topology of the Johnson fold in B-1 MCP is non-circularly permuted compared to the known topology of the fold in other viruses. This is the first time the Johnson fold has been seen in a non-circular permuted form. The researchers also found that β-sheet and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chain in B-1, unlike coval interprotein linkages in HK97. The termini of both CP and MCP are positioned for D-based phage engineering.

The structure of B-1 will help bioengineering efforts, reveal non-coval molecular interactions of bacteri capsid formation and clarify evolutionary relationships of B- MCP and CP with other viruses. The researchers used single-particle cryEM to determine the 3D structure of B- at 3.5 resolution and derived an atomic model. The Johnson fold has been seen in other viruses, such as ϕ174, bacteriophage PR1 and adenovirus, but not in a non-circular permuted form. B- CP forms an auxiliary protein to stabilize the capsid made by other proteins. The researchers found that B and HK represent the only feasible topologies of the Johnson fold.
Researchers studied how the deng virus (DENV) adapts to different environments by growing it in human and mosquito cells. They used a technique called ultra-deep sequencing to look at the effects of single nucleotide changes in the virus population. This allowed them to see how beneficial and harmful mutations affect the virus's fitness. The study found that many harmful mutations balance out the effect of rare beneficial mutations that help the virus adapt to its host. Beneficial mutations often occur in parts of the virus that don't have a fixed structure and are in specific areas of the genome. These mutations may help the virus adapt to specific hosts. The study also found that constraints on the virus's evolution are similar to those seen in other deng and Zika viruses. This suggests that similar forces shape long-term evolution of these viruses.

The study looked at the cost of harmful mutations across the deng genome and how negative selection affects diversity in virus populations. They want to know how specific and structural features shape these patterns and contribute to fitness. The study showed that adaptation relies on beneficial mutations in specific areas of the genome and regions that are flexible. They used a technique called CirSeq to track the fitness of virus in human and mosquito cells. This revealed the influence of positive and negative selection on the virus's evolution in these environments. Many beneficial mutations were found in specific areas of the genome, suggesting adaptation relies on hotspots of selection. The study mapped these hotspots on the 3D structure of a deng protein, which forms the outer layer of the virus.
Researchers used a technique called single-particle tracking to study how a protein called KRas12 moves and behaves on the surface of cells. KR12 is a type of protein that helps cells grow and divide. The study found that KR12 moves in three different ways on the cell surface. It stays still in some areas, moves slowly in others, and quickly in others. The areas where KR12 stays still are called nanodomains and are about 70 nanometers across. The areas where it moves slowly are about 200 nanometers across. The rest of the surface allows KR12 to move quickly. KR12 is also removed from the surface and put back on, like a recycling process called internalization. The study showed that KR12 behaves the same way at different levels of expression. This means that the way KR12 moves and is not affected by how much of it is present. The study helps understand how KR12 is organized on the surface and how it affects cell signaling.
Researchers have long sought to understand how Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling patterns the dorsal-ventral axis in embryos of vertebrates and invertebrates. The prevailing view in vertebrates is that BMP gradient formation occurs through a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists, often with ligand shuttling to generate peak levels. However, a new study in zebraf sheds light on this mechanism. By precisely quantifying BMP activity in wild-type and mutant embryos and combining data with a mathematical model, researchers tested hypotheses for gradient formation. Their analysis ruled out shutling and transcription-formed mechanisms, instead supporting a source-sink model, where a restricted antagonist acts as a sink to drive BMP dorsally and form the gradient. Measuring Bmp diffusion supports this model, suggesting a new mechanism to shape BMP gradients during development.

A quantitative method was established to measure BMP signaling in zraf embryos, integrated with mathematical modeling to inform model selection. The model provided key parameters to identify the mechanism forming the BMP gradient. The hypothesis that BMP gradient largely reflects bmp expression was tested, but not supported. Through quantification and modeling, a new view emerged that antagonists and ligand use to establish BMP patterning the DV axis in zraf.

BMPs act as morphogens in development, including patterning the embryonic axis, neural tube, and Drosila wing. BMP systems are established by extracellular regulators. In vertebrates, the mechanism unclear how ligands and antagon shape the gradient is unclear. Proposed mechanisms include an inverse of antagonists shaping the gradient, and antagon generating peak levels by shuttling ligand.
Researchers have identified a new protein called MFSD, a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, which plays a crucial role in the breakdown and recycling of cellular waste in lysosomes. Lysosomes are tiny compartments within cells where proteins and other cellular waste are broken down and recycled. MF1 is not previously uncharacterized and its function was unknown. Scientists found that MF1 is not glycosylated, meaning it doesn't have a sugar molecule attached, and has a specific sequence of amino acids that helps it get to lysosomes. Mice without MF1 developed severe liver disease and spleen problems. Researchers isolated lysosomes from these mice and found a protein called GLMP is essential for MF1 to work properly. GL and MF1 physically interact, meaning they stick together. Without GL, MF1 levels in lysosomes are low and vice versa. Mice without GL developed same problems as MF1 mice. This suggests MF1 and GL form a tightly connected protein complex in lysosomal membrane.

MF1 is not a transporter for tested amino acids under certain conditions. Researchers looked at what happens when MF1 is missing in mice. Lysosomes from normal and MF1 mice were isolated and compared. MF1 is in lysosomes under normal conditions, not glycosylated, and found in all mouse tissues. Its transport to lysosomes is through a specific sequence of amino acids. To study MF function, MF mice were created without MF1. Lys from MF mice and normal mice were compared. GL was found essential for MF1 in lysosomes. GL is glycosyl protein with unknown function. Without MF1, GL levels are low and vice versa.
Scientists have made a major breakthrough in understanding how a type of motor protein called kines moves along microtubules, which is essential for many vital processes in eukaryotes. They created detailed models of kines in different states, including when it's attached to a microtub and when it's not, using a powerful imaging technique called cryoEM. By comparing these models with existing structures of kines when it's not attached to a microub, they figured out a step-by-step process of how k moves along microtules. 

When k is attached to a microub, a specific part of the protein called the 'chpin' triggers a change in the shape of the k, releasing a molecule called AD. When k binds to a new molecule called ATP, the shape changes back, allowing it to move along the microub. This process is similar to how another type of motor called myosin moves. The two heads of k work together to move along microules in a coordinated way.

This discovery helps explain how k's behavior on microules, and how it can change its grip on microules by changing its shape. Some parts of k have been found that separate its movement from its grip on micro, but the reason was unclear. The researchers solved high-resolution images of k attached to microules in two states, with and existing structures of k when it's not attached. They found that when k binds to ATP, its shape changes, allowing it to move along micro. They also found two new ways k can attach to micro, but its heads can move.
Researchers have identified a new quality control pathway for misfolded proteins in the outer membrane of mitochondria, which is crucial for maintaining the function of these cellular powerhouses. Mitochondria are responsible for producing energy for the cell, but can be damaged by misfolded proteins, leading to dysfunction. A study in yeast found two temperature-sensitive proteins, sam-2Hs and sen-1Hs, which are degraded by the ubiquitin-proteome system. The proteins are marked for destruction by specific enzymes, Ubr1 and San1, and require heat shock proteins Hsp70 and Hsp40 for degradation. A complex Cdc-N4-U1 and adaptor Ubx are also involved in the process. This pathway is distinct from other cellular quality control mechanisms, involving both cytosolic and mitochondrial factors.
Scientists have long known that a protein called extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) plays a crucial role in controlling cell growth and division in the outer layer of the skin called the epidermis. However, it was unclear how ER activity is triggered and spread throughout the tissue. Researchers used a special tool called a FRET biosensor to visualize ER activity in living mice and found that it occurs in bursts, starting from a few cells and spreading outwards in a radius of about 50 micrometers over 30 minutes. They called this phenomenon "Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity" or SP. The frequency of these bursts correlated with the rate of cell division in the epidermis. When stimulated with a chemical called 12-O-tetradecanoyphol 13-acetate, SP increased in a way that depends on growth factor receptors and their ligands. When the skin is wounded, ER activation spreads as a wave along the edge, suggesting it can be superimposed. The researchers also found that SPs are associated with cell cycle progression, specifically in the G2 phase. This study provides new insights into how cell proliferation and ER activity are synchronized in a living tissue.
Scientists have studied the internal biological clock of cyanobacteria, a type of bacteria, to understand how it responds to daily light and dark cycles. They found that the clock's phase follows a simple rule: it adjusts to the length of the day and night. This means that if the day is longer or shorter, the clock adjusts accordingly. The researchers created a mathematical model to explain this behavior, which can be used to predict the clock's behavior in different environments. This model can help design experiments to understand the clock's molecular mechanisms.

The clock's core is made of three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which can be recreated in a lab dish. This allowed scientists to test if the clock's ability to adjust to day and night is due to the proteins or other factors in the cell. They simulated day and night conditions in the lab and found that the proteins alone can adjust to the clock's phase. This suggests that the clock's ability to adjust to day and night is intrinsic to the proteins.

The study used cyanobacteria because its clock can be recreated with purified proteins and has been well-studied in lab conditions. The researchers simulated day and night by giving the proteins pulses of nucleotides on a 24-hour cycle, mimicking the cell's metabolism during day and night. The lab system showed similar scaling of clock phase with day length, indicating the proteins' ability to adapt to day and night is intrinsic. The model can predict the clock's behavior in different environments with minimal data and may be applicable to other organisms.
Researchers have found that a protein called Meis plays a crucial role in the development of the nervous system that supplies the heart. This system, called the sympathetic nervous system, helps control heart rate and rhythm. When Meis is missing, the heart rhythm becomes irregular and conduction, or the heart's ability to send electrical signals, is impaired. This makes the heart more susceptible to sudden death.

 Studies in mice showed that Meis is essential for the growth and survival of sympathetic neurons, the cells that make up the sympathetic system. Without Me, these cells die early in development. The protein also helps regulate the movement of molecules within these cells, called endosomes, which are important for communication between cells. Without Me, this process is disrupted.

Further research found that Meis regulates genes involved in endosome formation and transport. In mice without Me, this process is severely impaired. The study suggests Me interacts with other signaling pathways that help neurons develop and mature.

Me's role in heart regulation was tested by inactivating it in mice. This led to irregular heart rhythm and conduction, making the heart more prone to sudden death. The protein acts independently of other factors that control early neuron development, but is involved in later stages. The study aimed to see if Me is involved in heart regulation through sympathetic neuron development and how it could lead to unexplained sudden death.

Results showed Me loss in sympathetic neurons leads to imbalanced heart regulation and increased susceptibility to sudden death. Inactivating Me in peripheral neurons impaired endosome traffic and target innervation. This complements a previous study showing Me's role in heart cell division after heart attack. However, Me in heart cells was not affected by its inactivation or overexpression. The Me family is involved in heart development.
Researchers have studied how bacteria form communities on surfaces, called biofilms, and found that mechanical instability and surface energy play a key roles in their shape and structure. They used Vibrio cholera, a type of bacteria, as a model and combined measurements, computer simulations, and experiments to show that wrinkles and delamination, a type of mechanical instability, drive the formation of biofilms. They also found that surface energy between different parts of the biofilm, called interfaces, drives the creation and destruction of new and existing interfaces. This process, called mechanomorphogenesis, is connected to the growth of the biofilm and shapes its overall shape. The researchers suggest that this process is not unique to bacteria and could be used to understand how tissues in higher organisms grow and develop. They propose that biofilms are a good model to study how mechanical forces shape development and could be used to engineer new treatments for problems related to biofilms. 

The study found that biofilms can wrinkle and delaminate as they grow due to compressive stress and that builds up. They suggest changing the distribution of stress could change the bio's shape. They tested this by growing two Vibrio cholera biofilms on the same plate and allowing them to collide. They also found that another type of bacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, forms similar wrinkles and delamination due to the same mechanical instability. This shows how regulation of cell physiology can be connected to mechanical instability to create different bio shapes. Theoretical work on biofilms has considered mechanical instability, but this study connects it to surface properties and morphology. The findings suggest new genes or compounds that alter bio shape by changing mechanics could be discovered to address bio-related problems.
Researchers have been trying to understand how severe seizures lead to the formation of abnormal brain networks that cause epilepsy. They found that a protein called neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRS) plays a role in this process. NRS is a transcription factor that influences how neurons develop and function. In this study, they found that seizures increase NRS levels in the hippocampus, a part of the brain, but surprisingly, only a small number of NRS target genes are repressed. When NRS binding to DNA was blocked, these repressed genes were rescued. The genes that were repressed by NRS had a unique property that made them sensitive to changes in NRS levels. These genes are involved in ion channels, receptors, and other important for neuronal function, suggesting they may contribute to epilepsy. 

The researchers looked at hundreds of genes in the hippocampus and found only a few were repressed by NRS in the context of seizures. This was because they had moderate binding to NRS, making them sensitive to changes in NRS levels. A subset of NRS target genes in the hippocampus were repressed by seizure-induced increase in NRS and rescued when NRS binding was blocked. These genes included ion channels, receptors, calcium molecules, and transcription factors that govern neuronal plasticity, suggesting they might contribute to epilepsy. 

The study found that NRS contributes to epilepsy by regulating genes that influence neuronal function. Hundreds of hippocampal genes are potential NRS targets, but only a few are repressed by the factor in seizures. The basis of selective regulation is moderate binding to NRS, making them sensitive to fluctuations. N-regulated genes in the hippocampus included ion channels, receptors, and transcription factors that govern function, suggesting they might contribute to epilepsy pathogenesis.
In the mammalian olfactory system, sensory information is processed in parallel by two types of cells: mitral and tuft cells. These cells receive signals from olfactory sensory neurons and send them to the brain. But how they process this information differently is not well understood. Researchers investigated how mitral and tuft cells work together in mice and found that differences in how they receive signals from other cells, called granule cells, make them respond differently to smells. This allows them to detect odors in different concentrations, which may be important for processing smells.

The olfactory system is like other senses, such as vision, uses parallel pathways to process information. But how this creates selectivity in these pathways is unclear. In the olfactory bulb, two types of projection neurons, mitral and tuft cells, receive signals from olfactory neurons and send to the brain. Similar to the visual system, selectivity in one type emerges from connections to other cells. In the olfactory system, mitral and tuft cells have different connections to olfactory neurons and tuft cells, which makes them respond differently to odors. This is similar to the visual system, where selectivity in ganglion cells comes from connections to bipolar and amacrine cells.

The combination of how mitral and tuft cells receive signals from granule cells makes them better at detecting odors than alone. This is unlikely to happen with one type of cell. The olfactory and visual systems may share processing mechanisms. In the retina, selectivity in ganglion cells comes from connections to bipolar and amacrine cells. In the olfactory, differences in mit and tuft responses come from connections to olfactory and tuft cells. The combination of how mit and tu cells receive signals from granule cells makes them better at detecting odors than alone. This is unlikely to happen with one type of cell.
Researchers studied how a type of protein called the M2 muscarinic receptor, which is a model for a group of proteins called G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCs). They wanted to understand how this protein works when it's alone and when it's part of a group with other proteins. They found that when the protein is alone, it behaves in a certain way, but when it's part of a group, it can behave differently. They used a special tool to measure how the protein's shape changes when it interacts with other molecules. They also used computer simulations to see how the protein's shape changes at the atomic level. They found that when the protein is alone, it behaves in one way, but when it's part of a group, it can behave in different ways depending on the other proteins it's with. This is important because it helps us understand how these proteins work in the body, like in the heart.
Researchers have discovered a new role for an enzyme called SET2 in how cells respond to DNA damage. SET2 is responsible for adding a chemical tag to histone H3, a protein that helps organize chromatin, the material that makes up chromosomes. This tag, called H3me3, is important for cells to fix double-strand breaks in DNA, breaks that can cause cancer. Without SET2, cells can't fix these breaks as well, and can't activate a protein called p53, that helps prevent cancer. P53 is often mutated in a type of cancer called clear cell carcinoma.

 Studies showed that SET2 is necessary for cells to fix breaks by homologous recombination, a way cells repair DNA. Without SET2, cells can't form RAD51 filaments, important for this process. Cells without SET2 also can't activate ATM, a protein that helps fix DNA damage. Cells without SET2 showed impaired damage signaling, but didn't activate p53, leading to decreased survival.

SET2 is found in several cancers, including clear cell carcinoma. This study provides new understanding of how chromatin, the material that makes up chromosomes, responds to damage. Unlike other histone modifications that help DNA repair, SET2 doesn't increase H3me at damage sites or recruit to breaks. This is a new role for an enzyme in preparing chromatin for damage response.

Clear cell carcinoma is a cancer with many genetic changes, including mutations in SET2. This study links these events, showing how altered chromatin affects genome integrity. Further studies are needed to understand how SET2 impacts DNA repair.
Researchers have identified a new genetic mutation in the Ras1 gene, called Ras1Ana, which leads to the production of autoantibodies and the accumulation of a specific type of T cell in the immune system. This type of T cell, known as CD44 Helios PD-1 CD4, is dependent on the presence of B cells. The mutation does not affect the development of T cells in the thymus, but causes an overexpression of CD44 on naïve T cells and T cells in a cell-autonomous manner. The researchers found that CD44 is a reporter of mTOR kinase signaling and that is elevated in Ras1Ana naïve CD4 T cells. They also found that mTOR activity is essential for the dysregulation of Ras1Ana T cells. The study reveals a new role of Ras1 in the regulation of peripheral CD4 T cells, distinct from its known function in thymic selection. The mutation increases tonic mTOR signaling in naïve CD4 T cells, leading to increased CD44 expression and accumulation of Helios CD44 CD4 cells and autoantib. Reducing mTOR function in RasAna mice normalizes CD expression on naïve CD T and abolishes accumulation of effector cells and autoib.
Researchers have found that a protein called Arida plays a crucial role in maintaining the identity of a type of cell in the pancreas called acinar cells. Acinar cells are responsible for producing digestive enzymes that help break down food in the gut. When Arida is lost, acinar cells can change into a different type of cell called mucinous, which is a precursor to a type of pancreatic cancer called pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This change happens quickly and cannot be reversed even when Arida is restored. However, if Arida is lost during the development of the pancreas, acinar cells remain acinar. This suggests that Arida acts as a barrier to the change of acinar cells into mucinous in the presence of a mutation in the Kras gene, which is a common in many cancers. The study also found that Arida regulates the expression of genes that keep acinar cells acinar. When Arida is lost, these genes are not expressed, leading to the change of acinar into mucinous. The study suggests that Arida is a critical in preventing the change of acinar into mucinous in the presence of Kras mutation, a key step in the development of pancreatic cancer.
Researchers studied how social isolation affects the brain's response to stress in mice. They found that social isolation has different effects on the brain cells that respond to stress in males and females. When female mice were isolated from their littermates for 24 hours, these brain cells became less responsive and took longer to react to stress. This was not seen in males. However, when both males and females were subjected to physical stress, such as swimming, their brain cells reacted similarly. The study suggests that social isolation, not physical stress, has sex-specific effects on brain cells that respond to stress. 

The researchers looked at brain slices of mice and found that social isolation changed the properties of these cells in females, but not males. They tested if males would react to physical stress like females and found they did. However, prior social isolation blocked the effect of stress in females. The study shows that females and males react differently to some stressors, but not others. Social isolation has a specific effect on brain cells in females, but not males. Both males and females react similarly to physical stress, but social isolation blocks its effect in females.
Scientists have long studied hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen in the blood, to understand how it adapts to different body sizes in mammals. They thought its ability to bind oxygen was the key to this adaptation. However, a new research suggests that both its ability to bind oxygen and how it changes shape also play a role in delivering oxygen to tissues. The study found that hemoglobin's ability to bind oxygen and change shape are connected in a way that allows it to fine-tune oxygen delivery to meet different tissues' needs. This discovery reveals how hemoglobin adapts to body size in mammals.

The study looked at how hemoglobin's ability to bind oxygen and change shape in different mammals. They found that its ability to bind oxygen is connected to its shape in a way that allows it to adjust oxygen delivery to meet different tissues' needs. Hemoglobin in small animals with high metabolism has lower ability to bind oxygen than in large animals, showing it adapts to oxygen delivery. The study also looked at human hemoglobin and found that animals with higher metabolism have higher ability to bind oxygen.

The research supports the idea that hemoglobin's ability to bind and shape change have evolved to meet different tissues' oxygen needs. It shows that hemoglobin in small animals with high metabolism has lower ability to bind oxygen than in large animals, showing it adapts to oxygen delivery. The study also found that human hemoglobin's ability to bind is connected to its shape in a way that allows to fine-tune oxygen delivery to meet tissues' needs.
Researchers studied how Plasmodium sporozoites, the parasites that cause malaria, move and interact with blood vessels in the skin after being injected by a mosquito. They used a special microscope to watch the parasites in real-time and found that they have two types of movement: fast and slow. When far from blood vessels, they move quickly and freely, but when near blood vessels, their movement is slower and more controlled. The parasites use their shape to fit into small blood capillaries. Experiments with mutated parasites showed that their ability to move and stick to vessels is key to getting into the blood.

The study found that Plasium sporites move at about 5 micrometers per second, which is very slow. They watched the parasites over two hours after injection and saw changes in their movement over time. The parasites near blood vessels move slower and spend more time with them, but can't enter the blood. Mutated parasites that can't move well or stick to vessels can't get into the blood.

Moving is crucial for the parasites to infect. Previous studies saw parasites in the skin, but not how they move over time. This study watched them for two minutes and found two types of movement: fast and slow. The fast is when far from blood and slow near blood. The parasites use their shape to fit into small blood vessels. Experiments with mutated parasites showed that moving and sticking to vessels is key to getting into the blood.

The study found that Plasium sporites move at 5 micrometers per second, which is slow. They watched the parasites two hours after injection and saw changes in movement over time. The near blood move slower and spend with them, but can't the blood. Mutated that can't move or stick can't the blood.
Researchers studied how cells adapt to lose a crucial component that helps them polarize, or organize, their internal structures. They removed the BEM1 gene from yeast cells and let them evolve for 1,000 generations. At first, the cells grew faster, but then their growth slowed down. By the end, they were 90% as fit as healthy as cells with B1. The team sequenced their genomes and found a common path of mutations that improved polarization. Each mutation inactivated proteins that hindered polarization. This shows cells can recover from big disruptions and adapt by turning off genes, leading to changes in important cell functions.

 The study looked at how yeast cells adapt to losing a key part that helps them polarize. They followed a predictable path of evolution that could be explained by interactions between mutated genes, leading to faster and more accurate polarization. Yeast lost 88 genes over 100 million years ago and gained new functions by adapting existing genes or creating new ones. The experiment created a set of rapid polarization mechanisms. B1 cells often had multiple polarity sites, suggesting a feedback that ensures one site is weaker. Three mutations re-established efficient polarization.

 The team deleted B1 because it's a relatively new component in polarization and had a different role in ancient fungi. Deleting it could reveal alternative, ancient modules. B1 is an important polarity gene. Results show multiple regulation allows cells to polarize quickly and adapt to strong disruptions. Under pressure, large mutations that inactivate proteins favor evolutionary paths that remove modules over those that alter properties.
Researchers studied how people make decisions that involve commitment, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. They found that the brain's medial prefrontal cortex plays a key role in integrating value over time when deciding to accept or reject a prospect. The rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmFC) signals value when accepting or rejecting a prospect into the future. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encodes value when rejecting or accepting a prospect. ACC signals reflect two biases: deferring to later and weighing losses more than gains, paradoxically maximizing reward in the task. These findings provide new insights into pressures that shape economic decisions and value computation in the medialfrontal cortex.

Previous studies examined neural mechanisms of economic behavior by offering independent choices or gambles. This study devised a task where decisions involved committing to an asset with financial consequences. The aim was to understand how commitments are made in humans and their neural implementation in the prefrontal cortex. Commitments often follow deliberation, with acceptance or rejection deferred to later. However, it's unknown if value coding depends on stimuli accepted or rejected when choosing between two options. It's also unknown how encoding in prefrontal cortex depends on economic commitment or not.

The study investigated mechanisms of commitment, acceptance, rejection, and deferral using a multi-altern choice task with financial ramifications. Participants chose between accepting or deferring a prospect in half the blocks. The dorsal cing cortex (ACC) encoded value when prospect excluded, while rmFC encoded during deferral. Joint consideration of data and ACC allowed pinpointing two pressures: deferring later and weighing unfavourable options.
Researchers studied the role of paraspeck bodies in controlling gene expression in pituitary cells. Parasck are nuclear bodies that form around long non-coding RNA and RNA-binding proteins. Their function is not fully understood, but they may control gene expression by retaining mRNA in the nucleus. The study found that parasck components, including proteins and RNA, display a circadian pattern in pituit cells. Inserting a specific sequence (IRu) at the end of a gene led to rhythmic retention of the mRNA, which was lost when parasck were disrupted. Using a microscope, IRu drove circadian expression of a protein. This shows that parasck control gene expression at a post-transcription level due to their circadian pattern.

Parasck components, NON and SFP, display circadian pattern in pit cells and a cell line. Some genes lost rhythmic pattern when parasck were disrupted, suggesting parasck play a role in circadian expression. Post-transcriptional regulation plays a major role in mRNA oscillations, and parasck may retain RNAs in nucleus for rhythmic expression. Researchers used a cell line to see if parasck could retain mRNA in nucleus for rhythmic gene expression. They found parasck were rhythmically expressed in the cell. Some RNA-binding proteins, like HNPC, display circadian pattern in tissues, including pitary.

The study inserted IRu at the end of a gene and found rhythmic retention of mRNA, which was lost when parasck were disrupted. Using a microscope, IRu drove circadian of protein. This shows parasck control gene expression at postcription due to circadian.
Scientists have long known that presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) play a crucial role in converting electrical signals into chemical signals in the brain. However, the proteins that control their function in the active zone where signals are formed are not well understood. Researchers have discovered that Munc13, a protein essential for exocytosis, also controls VGCC function, dictating their behavior during various forms of activity. They found that M13 interacts with VGs through a pair of basic residues in its C2 domain. Removing M13 or replacing it with a mutant M13C2 altered VG's response to high-frequency bursts and calcium influx from single stimuli. This study shows a new form of synaptic modulation and highlights M13's impact on information transfer at nerve terminals by controlling vesicle priming and exocytosis.

The presence of M13 has a significant influence on VG function, revealing a new mechanism for sculpting synaptic efficacy. The dependence of exocyt on Ca+ influx and control of VG on fast scales implies that synaptic can be controlled by VG-protein interactions. Many presynaptic proteins interact with VGs, but this study shows M13 interacts with VG in a way controlling calcium use on millisecond scales at terminals. A critical site was pinpointed to basic residues in M13's C2 domain, orthogonal to membrane-interacting loops.

M13 enhances Ca+ influx and modulates VG properties across stimulation conditions, with implications for understanding transmission control. Data suggest this is mediated by direct VG-M13 interaction, though other interactions may influence VGs. To test significance, M13-VG interaction, the impact of removing M13 on action-driven influx was examined. Expression of shRNA targeting major M13 isoforms led to 94% depletion, blocking exytosis. VG failed to reactivate in 1.2mM extracellular Ca in M13-K cells, but not in M-K/AA rescue, suggesting increased exyt during 2 ISI pulses in M-K/AA is direct lack M-VG effect, not secondary exyt. This site in M13 C domain mediates VG reactivation in terminals.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the intricate shapes of plant cells, particularly those with puzzle-like forms found in the epidermis, the outermost layer of plant tissues. While these shapes are striking, their purpose has remained unclear. Researchers propose that these shapes help reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall of the epidermis when the tissue grows isotropically, or in one direction. They tested this idea using data from various plant species and simulations. The results suggest that stress is a key driver of cell shape development.

In plants, cells are like balloons under pressure, with turg pressure reaching up to 10 bar in some leaves and 50 in specialized cells like stomata. When cells grow in one direction, like stems and roots, they can elongate easily. However, when growing in two directions, like broad leaves and fruit, they can't. Puzzle-shaped cells in the epider of these organs may be the solution to this problem. The researchers analyzed stress in a model of Arabidopsis thalian cotyledon epidermis and found that cells with lobes and indentations reduce stress. This fits with their prediction that puzzle shapes allow cells to grow in isotropic tissues but not elongated organs.

The team proposes a new function for these shapes: an adaptation to mechanical forces acting on cells in the epider. Cells regulate their shape to prevent stress from becoming too large. They tested this with mutants where growth direction was perturbed and found support for their hypothesis. Using simulations, they showed a mechanism that reproduces the development of epider cell shape.
Scientists have long known that human genes contain multiple introns, or non-coding regions, and exons, coding regions that need to be properly connected by the spliceosome, a complex that removes introns and joins exons together. However, how this process works is not fully understood. Researchers studied how single pre-mRNA molecules interact with fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes in human nuclear extracts to investigate how intron and exon interactions promote pre-splice assembly. They found that a subunit bound to the 5' splice site of an intron works with another sub bound to the 5' site of the next intr to increase the rate and efficiency of sub recruitment to the 3' site of the upstream intr. This synergy of 5' sites across introns and exons is important for correct and efficient splicing of multi-in preRNAs.

The study suggests an ordered pre-splice assembly pathway in humans, where association of requires prior binding, unlike yeast. In multi-in preRNAs, exons have 5' sites upstream and downstream, or both can bind and recruit to the 3 site. The two could act independently or together. Researchers developed methods to observe dynamics of splice subcomplexes and splicing individual preRNA in human extract, revealing that binding to 5 sites is unaffected by presence of sites downstream or upstream.

Prelices can form multi-in preRNAs through two pathways. Intron can be recognized via intron interactions leading to active spliceosome, or via exon where exons are first defined, then intron interactions lead to assembly. Models assume once functional prelice forms, interactions with bound downstream 5 provide no additional binding or stabilization of subsequent steps. However, the mechanisms contributing accuracy were unclear. The study shows a major contributor to exon inclusion is collaboration between flanking 5 sites, increasing rate of recruitment during prelice formation.
Scientists have discovered a new way that proteins in cells use to help each other fold into the right shape. This process, called ubiquitin-dependent folding, happens on the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), a part of the cell where proteins are made. They found that the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6 needs this help to fold, and it gets it by being tagged with a small protein called ubiquitin on a specific spot. If it folds correctly, the ubiquitin is removed and LRP is sent out of the ER. If it doesn't, it's tagged with more ubiquitin and sent to be destroyed. This system also helps other proteins like CF and anthrax toxin, which are involved in human diseases. 

When LRP6 is made, it gets tagged with ubiquitin on a specific spot. This helps it interact with a protein that acts like a chaper, giving it time to fold. If it folds right, it's sent out of the ER, helped by being palmitoylated. If not, it's tagged with more ubiquitin and sent to be destroyed. This system also helps other proteins like CF and anthrax toxin, which are involved in human diseases.
Sex differences in learning and decision-making processes may contribute to individual vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders, such as addiction, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities. Researchers have proposed that value-based decision-making processes are influenced by sex, but overall performance on decision tasks often shows minimal differences between sexes. A new study used computational tools to uncover latent variables that define decision-making approaches in mice, even with similar performance. Male and female mice had similar accuracy, but achieved this via different patterns of exploration. Male mice made more exploratory choices, getting stuck in exploration once started, while females explored less but learned quickly. These results suggest sex influences decision-making during learning and exploration, not during stable choices. Exploration is altered in people with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing mechanisms as a translational avenue for sex-modulated vulnerability.

A study trained male and female mice on a classic explore-exploit task, a restless two-armed bandit. Males showed higher exploration levels than females throughout. Computational tools characterized sex differences in latent variables to understand sex in a key process: balancing exploration and exploitation. In an uncertain world, balance rewarding options and exploring alternatives. Results revealed sex differences in exploration, paralleled by learning rates. How exploration-exploit, reward, and outcomes interact to influence choices is unclear.

A combination of modeling characterized sex differences in explore-exploit. Males and females had similar performance but used different strategies to learn the environment. Post-hoc win-lose analyses found females displayed more win-st behaviors, repeating behaviors that produced reward on previous trials.
Researchers have been trying to understand how proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and sent to the proteasome for degradation. This process, called ER-associated degradation (ERAD), involves proteins being ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and broken down by the proteasome. A key player in this process is the cytosolic ATPase Cdc48, which pulls on ubiquinated substrates. However, how hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments are moved from the phospholip bilayer into the cytos, along with hydrophil and folded ER luminal parts, was unclear.

Using a reconstuted system with purified proteins from Saccharces cerevisiae, researchers found that the ubiquitin ligase Do10 (Te-4/MARCH in animals) is a retrolocase that facilitates protein extraction. The substrate's TM segment interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Do10 and passively moves into the aqueous phase. Luminal segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state, and unfolding occurs on the lum side of the membrane by cytoplasm C48 action. This reveals how a membrane retroase cooperates with C48 in protein extraction.

The study allowed researchers to investigate protein extraction without relying on downstream reactions like proteomal degradation. They show Do10 is a membrane retroase and how it cooperates with C48 in extraction of proteins with luminal domains. It's unclear if lum domains are moved in a folded state, if unfolding occurs prior to retrolocation, or if it's directly coupled to retrolocation. To address this, they investigated ER mediated by Do10 from S cerevisiae. Do10 is a 150Da protein with 14 TM segments.
Researchers have found that the protein Hedgehog (H) plays a crucial role in guiding development and maintaining tissue health in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Abnormal H production, distribution, and responses are common causes of developmental defects and cancer. To understand how H works, scientists studied its interaction with a protein called Ci in fruit flies. They found that H can induce changes in cells by preventing Ci from being processed into a repressor, a protein that turns off gene expression, or by activating full-length Ci, which turns on gene expression. They created versions of Ci that can't be processed and found that H can still signal normally, even without regulation. This suggests H can act as a morphogen, a substance that guides development, in the absence of Ci processing. The study also showed that two other proteins, Cos2 and PKA, have separate roles in addition to their known functions in processing Ci, and can activate Ci in the absence of H.
Researchers have identified a group of neurons in the spinal cord called calretinin (CR) interneurons that play a key role in processing pain signals. These neurons form a network that can amplify pain signals and relay them to other parts of the brain. To study this, scientists used a technique called optogenetics to selectively activate CR interneurons in the spinal cord. They found that activating these neurons led to increased pain behavior in mice, which was sensitive to morphine and caused by nerve injury. Inhibiting these neurons reduced pain sensitivity. This suggests that CR interneurons are important for generating and amplifying pain and could be a target for pain relief.

The study confirms that CRneurons form a network in the spinal cord that contributes to pain and can amplify signals without input from the body. They are connected in a way that allows them to alter information before it reaches the brain. This is seen in the pain responses caused by activating these neurons. The research focused on characterizing these circuits and their role in pain by activating them with optogen. Future work should look at how they respond to signals from the body.

Other research has identified different types of neurons in the spinal cord involved in pain. Historically, most research on spinal circuits focused on inhibition. Current models place CRneurons in a circuit that signals through other neurons to initiate pain. This study's findings are consistent with this, as activating CRneurons excited other neurons in the spinal. This extends our understanding of excitatory neurons in pain processing, giving them a bigger role in linking low-level touch to pain.

The study used a technique to selectively activate CRneurons in the spinal cord. This led to increased pain behavior in mice, which was sensitive to morphine and caused by injury. Inhibiting these neurons reduced pain sensitivity. This suggests CRne are important for generating and amplifying pain and could be a target for pain relief.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called RAB23 in the development of the skull and face. R23 is a gene that, when mutated, causes a condition called Carpenter syndrome, characterized by extra fingers and skull problems. To understand how R23 works, the researchers created mice without the gene and studied their development. The mice had extra fingers and skull problems, similar to humans with Carpenter syndrome. They found that R23 helps control the growth of bone cells in the skull by regulating two important signaling pathways: FGF-pK/2 and H-GL1. FGF-p/2 is involved in bone growth and development, while H-1 is involved in the formation of the skull. R23 also regulates a protein called GL1, which is important for the stem cells in the skull. When R23 is missing, GL1 is overactive, leading to too much bone growth and fusion of the skull. The researchers found that blocking the F-p/2 pathway corrected the problems in the mice, showing R23's role in regulating bone growth.
Scientists have long wondered how cells "remember" past events, such as environmental changes or developmental cues, to control gene expression. A key player in this process is the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), which maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants by modifying chromatin at its targets. However, it's unclear if this inheritance is a long-term memory of gene states (cis) or dictated by concentrations of diffusible factors (trans). Researchers monitored expression of two Arabidopsis Polycomb target FLOW LOCUS C (FLC) in the same plants, showing one can be repressed while the other is active, and this mixed state is inherited through cell divisions as plants develop. This demonstrates epigen memory of FL expression is stored in cis, not trans.

To study this, scientists used the epigenetic process of vernalization in Arabidopsis. Vernal is the acceleration of flowering after prolonged cold exposure, mediated by cold-induced epigen repression of the Poly target and floral repressor FL. This has been observed in imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation. Imprinting involves DNA methylation, X-chromosome inactivation chromosome-wide changes in chrom structure and positioning. It's unclear if Poly-repressed chromatin at a gene can store epigen memory.

Epigen memory can be stored in concentrations of diffible factors or locally in chromatin environment of genes. Researchers developed an assay to visualize mitotic heritability of FL states at single-cell level, returning to cis vs trans epigen at FL. They crossed FL-merry to FL-Venus to generate hybrids carrying single copy each. In trans memory, only heritable states are ON/ON and OFF/OFF, epigen stored as diffible signal. FL repression requires PR2 but is independent DNA methylation, making a system for studying cis storage of Poly at single. Vernal plants FL is bistable, with cells repressed increasing with duration cold exposure.
BiP, a type of heat shock protein, plays a crucial role in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by helping to fold proteins correctly and prevent misfolding. However, the structure and function of Bi oligomers, which are groups of Bi molecules, are not well understood. Researchers used a technique called site proteolysis and crosslinking to study the structure of Bi oligomers formed by ER Bi. They found that Bi oligomers consist of adjacent Bi molecules engaging the interdomain linker, a part of the protein, in the substrate binding site of another, which reduces the chaper function of Bi. This suggests that Biomers are a relatively inactive form of the chaper that can be quickly activated when needed.

The amount of Biomers and unfolded proteins in the ER are related, with more Biomers forming when there are more unfolded proteins. However, this relationship breaks down when calcium levels in the ER are low. Low calcium causes Bi to formomers and reduces its ability to bind to substrates. This suggests that Biomers are a way to buffer the ER against fluctuations in unfolded proteins. The affinity of Bi for substrates is driven by protein-protein non-equilibrium mechanisms, which could explain why Bi favors itself as a client over other proteins when calcium is low.

The study suggests that Biomers are a storage form of the chaper that can be quickly activated when needed. This is consistent with the idea that Biomers are a way to buffer the ER against rapid changes in unfolded proteins. The relationship between unfolded proteins and Biomers breaks down when calcium is low, which is a strong inducer of the unfolded protein response and promotes Biomerization. The study provides a picture of how Bi production of unfolded proteins draws on the pool of inactive Biomers to service its clients.
Scientists have used a powerful microscope technique called cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of a plant virus called Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV) at a resolution of 3.9 angstroms. This virus is a type of flexible virus that affects plants and has a long, thin shape with many copies of a protein called coat protein (CP) protecting a single-stranded RNA. The study found that the shape of the CP is similar to that of a protein called nucleoprotein (NP) from a group of animal viruses called phleboviruses, which have an envelope and single-stranded RNA. The main difference between the two is a small part at the end of the protein, which determines how they assemble into different shapes. This similarity suggests that there was a transfer of genetic material between plant and animal viruses.

The study also found a surprising similarity between the CP of flexible viruses and NP of phleviruses, which have an envelope and segmented RNA. The NP of phviruses are with RNA in a loose structure called ribonucleoprotein inside an envelope with glycoproteins. Flexible viruses are a big problem in agriculture, infecting plants and causing damage. They are non-enveloped and rod-shaped with many copies of CP in a helical fashion protecting single-stranded RNA. High-resolution structures of flexible viruses are mostly from the family Potexirus, including this study and previous ones of PapMV and BaMV. It's not clear if other families of flexible viruses have the same shape.

The study modeled the CP of PepMV and its interaction with RNA and found it resembles NP of phlevir. Both bind and protect the viral RNA.
Researchers have developed a new method, called Site, to accurately locate the binding sites of antibodies on the surface of cells. This is important for understanding how the immune system works and for developing new treatments like vaccines and medicines. Current methods are time-consuming and not suitable for many types of cells. The new method uses a technique called topological averaging to measure the distance between the antibody and the cell surface with nanometer precision. This is useful for studying how antibodies bind to proteins on the surface of cells, which can vary in shape and size. The method was tested on bacteria and showed accurate results that match previous studies. It can be applied to other types of cells as well. The location of the binding site is crucial for understanding how the immune system works and developing new treatments.
Researchers have found that the body's ability to adapt to low oxygen levels, or hypoxia, is influenced by how peripheral tissues, such as the skin, respond to the lack of oxygen. They discovered that the skin plays a key role in regulating blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature in response to low oxygen levels. This is the first time scientists have shown that a peripheral tissue, like the skin, can directly affect the body's cardiovascular response to low oxygen.

The study focused on the skin, which has a large blood vessel bed, to understand how it responds to hypia. They found that a protein called HIF-1 in skin cells is essential for the body's response to low oxygen. Without H-1, mice showed a decrease in skin temperature and changes in blood pressure. The researchers used a 10% oxygen challenge, a moderate level of hypia, to study the body's response. Mice without H-1 showed changes in blood pressure and temperature compared to normal mice.

The study found that H-1 and another protein, H-2, in skin cells affect the body's immediate and long-term response to low oxygen. Low oxygen increases sympathetic tone in the skin, making blood vessels constrict, or narrow. The researchers proposed a model of how the body responds to low oxygen, involving H- and nitric oxide in the skin. They suggest that low oxygen leads to an increase in H- and nitric oxide, widening blood vessels and increasing blood flow, followed by a decrease in H and arginase, reducing blood flow.

This research shows that peripheral tissues, like the skin, play a crucial role in the body's adaptation to low oxygen levels. The study provides new insights into how the body regulates blood pressure, heart rate, and temperature in response to low oxygen.
Researchers have developed a new method to map the connections between individual neurons in the brain with high precision. They used a technique called optogenetics, which involves using light to activate specific neurons. By focusing the light on the cell's body and nearby dendrites, they were able to make the neuron fire and measure its connections. This is a big step forward in understanding how neurons talk to each other and how the brain works.

Optogenetic methods, like using a protein called channelrhodinodopsin (ChR), have improved the ability to map brain circuits. However, previous methods had limitations, such as activating nearby fibers or axons, which can respond to light. This made it hard to selectively target single neurons.

The new method combines two-photon light activation with channelrhodinodin restricted to the cell body and nearby dendrites. This allowed researchers to determine if a neuron is connected to others with patch-clamp recordings. This is a tool that measures electrical signals between cells.

Understanding how neurons connect is key to understanding brain function and behavior. The brain's circuits are made up of many types of neurons that work together. To understand how they work, we need to know how they talk to each other. This new method can map connections with single-cell resolution, which is a big step forward in understanding brain function.

The researchers used channelrhodinodin, a protein that responds to light, to activate neurons. They focused light on the cell's body and nearby dendrites to make it fire. This allowed them to measure connections with high precision. The method can be used to study how neurons talk to each other and how the brain works. It's a step forward in understanding brain function and behavior.

The new method can be used to study brain circuits and how they work. It can help understand how neurons talk to each other and how the brain responds. This is a big step in understanding brain function and behavior. The method can be used to study brain and how it works.
Researchers have been trying to figure out how two important proteins, Sox2 and Oct4, interact with DNA to control gene expression in cells. Previous studies suggested they assemble in a specific order, but new analysis shows this isn't the case. Instead, they interact in a way called negative reciprocity, where Sox2 increases Oct4's binding but decreases Sox2's. This is different from what was thought and shows complexity in how proteins interact with DNA. Single-molecule methods, like those used by Chen et al, provide new ways to detect this interaction. The study found that Sox and Oct sometimes help and sometimes hinder each other across the genome, which was unexpected. This means we need to know more about how proteins interact across the genome to understand single-molecule data. The analysis suggests energy might be involved in Sox and Oct's action on DNA, which has never been seen before in living cells. Single-molecule methods can help unravel this mechanism. The study has implications for understanding how proteins interact with DNA and how to interpret single-molecule data. The variation in cooperativity across the genome is significant, suggesting single-molecule data provides more information than expected. A single number, -0.22, indicates Sox and Oct exhibit both positive and negative cooperativity across loci in vivo. This could be due to energy expenditure or mixed cooperativity, with Sox and Oct helping each other at some loci and hindering at others.
Researchers have discovered that fruit flies can detect and avoid bacterial toxins called lipopolysaccharides (LPS) before they cause infection. These toxins are important signals for the immune system to recognize infection, but it's unclear if animals can sense them before infection. The study found that fruit flies display strong aversive responses to L and that gustatory neurons expressing Gr66 bitter receptors mediate avoidance of L in feeding and egg-laying assays. The expression of the chemosensory channel TR1 in these cells is necessary and sufficient for L avoidance. L stimulates fruit neurons in a TR1-dependent manner and activates exogenous TR1 channels in human cells. This shows that flies detect bacterial toxins via a gustatory pathway through TR1 activation, a conserved mechanism.

The study found that flies avoid L during feeding and oviposition and that TR1 expression in bitter-sensing neurons is necessary for L avoidance. Data indicate a TR1 mechanism of L may prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Flies preferred control food over contaminated with E. coli, but TR1- mutants did not. TR1 mediates acute responses to L in mice and avoidance of bitter compounds in flies. Researchers tested if TR1 mediates gustatory of L in flies. Blocking transmission in neurons by tetanus toxin abolished L avoidance, indicating flies detect L through gustatory. Data demonstrate flies possess a gustatory mechanism for L detection and avoidance. Avoiding L-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may prevent Gram infections, compensating for lack of immunity in animals. The sensory mechanism exploits TR1 suggests a principle where channels play a role in L detection by neurons in flies and mammals, regardless of modality.
Researchers have identified a protein called Zfp335 that plays a crucial role in the development of a type of immune cell called T cells. These cells are important for fighting off infections and diseases, but the process of how they mature is not fully understood. Mice with a mutation in the Zfp gene, called Zfpbl, have a problem with producing these cells. The issue starts in the thymus, an organ where T cells are made, and continues after they leave the thym. The problem is not due to how the cells are selected or how many are made, but how they mature. Zfp binds to specific parts of DNA and controls genes related to energy, cell function, and regulation. Restoring one of these genes, An2, helps fix the problem. This shows Zfp is a key regulator of T cell maturation.

 Scientists studied mice with a mutation in the Zfp gene, called Zbl, and found a problem with T cells. They looked at how Zfp works and found it binds to specific genes. Some of these genes are involved in energy, cell function, and regulation. Restoring one of these genes, An2, helps fix the problem. This shows Zfp is a key regulator of T maturation.
Scientists have long assumed that the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) in a cell directly correlates with the amount of protein produced. However, this is not always the case. Two factors, codon usage and mRNA structure, can explain some of the discrepancy. Researchers have discovered a new factor, mRNA:RNA avoidance, which increases translational efficiency. They found that prokaryotes have a strong preference for avoiding mRNA:RNA interactions, which have a greater impact on protein abundance than structure or cod usage. By creating variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different interaction potential, they showed FP levels correlate with avoidance. This means taking mRNA:RNA interactions into account can precisely control protein levels.

A study of 97 species found reduced interaction between native RNAs compared to controls. Variant GFP mRNAs with different interaction potential were created to demonstrate expression can be predicted and controlled. Results show strong selection for avoidance of mRNA:RNA across proaryotes. A property called "intrinsic avoidance" measures this, but may miss cases with extreme G content differences. Using shuffled RN as controls, interactions are underrepresented in 73% of proary (p<0.05). This establishes selection minimizes mRNA:RNA interactions. However, with thousands of interacting species, complete avoidance is unlikely. A trade-off between avoidance and expression is expected.

Avoidance is as good an explanation as cod usage and structure for protein variation. Results show interactions impact protein levels. Taking into account will enable design constructs with controlled levels. A meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data found correlation between mRNA and avoidance. mRNAs with low values produce fewer proteins than those with high.
In a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), researchers have found that the loss of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) is not a sudden event, but rather a dynamic process of continuous denervation and reinnervation. Using in vivo imaging of single axons and NMJs over a three-month period, they observed that motor units are dismantled asynchronously in SOD1G37 mice. Prior to complete axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous axonal sprouting, resulting in synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first NMJ, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible.

This study reveals a previously unsuspected dynamism at the NM in an animal model of ALS, highlighting a temporal window between branch-specific dismantling and global axon degeneration that could be therapeutically exploited. However, rescue of neuronal loss in S1 mice does not necessarily improve NM denervation, suggesting local-specific events may play a role in NM denervation in ALS. Local alterations of synaptic and molecular function occur early at NM. The researchers used longitudinal in vivo imaging of motor axonal arbors and NM to assess the course and dynamics of changes during ALS progression, predicting a MU-dependent mechanism would result in synchronous degeneration of the MU, while local neuus changes would result in asynchronous loss of NM within a MU.

In ALS, NM denervation occurs before significant axonal or cell loss, but whether it arises from branch degeneration or manifestation of globally diseased neuron is unclear. Researchers used repeated in vivo imaging to directly assess the time and dynamics of structural changes during ALS progression. NM denervation is a key event in ALS patients and animal models, observed prior symptom onset.
Researchers have been studying the effects of tamoxifen, a medication used to treat breast cancer, to understand why it causes side effects like hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. To do this, they looked at mice treated with tamifen and found changes in temperature, bone, and movement. Single-cell RNA sequencing showed tamifen changed gene expression in the hypothalamus and preoptic area (hypothalamus-PO) of the brain. These changes were dependent on estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), as removing ER in the hypothalam-PO blocked or reversed tamifen gene changes. ER-deficient mice did not have tamifen changes in temperature, bone, or movement. This study provides insight into tamifen's effects on the hypothalam-PO and that ER mediates several physiological effects of tamifen in mice.

The researchers also found that ER in the hypothalam-PO is necessary for tamifen changes in gene expression and effects on thermoregulation, bone, and movement. This suggests tamifen modulates ER signaling in the nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of health. Since ER mediates many aspects of physiology, they asked if loss of ER would affect physiological responses to tamifen in mice. They measured temperature, movement, and bone in ER-deficient mice and wild-type mice. Tamifen increased heat loss, decreased movement, and increased bone density in ER-deficient mice, but not wild-type mice. This study shows utility of mice as a model to study tamifen's effects and reveals widespread effects on hypothalam-PO and implicates ER signaling as a major mediator of tamifen on thermg, movement, and homeostasis.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called IS15 in fighting off a bacterial infection caused by Listeria monocytogenes, a type of bacteria that can cause food poisoning. IS15 is a protein that is produced in response to viral infections, but its role in bacterial infections was not well understood. The study found that IS15 is produced in high amounts in cells when they are infected with Lister, and surprisingly, this happens without the help of a type of protein called interferon, which is usually needed to fight off viruses. Instead, IS15 is triggered by a different pathway in the cell that senses the presence of bacterial DNA. This pathway involves proteins called STING, TBK, IRF, and IR7. The researchers also found that IS15 helps fight off Lister infection in lab dishes and in animals. They used a technique to identify which proteins IS15 attaches to and found that it attaches to proteins in the ER and Golgi, which are involved in sending signals to the rest of the body. This leads to increased production of proteins that help fight off infection. The study shows IS15 is a new player in the body's defense against Lister infection and highlights its importance in the immune system.
Scientists have developed a new software called DeepRET to analyze data from a technique called single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer (smRET), which helps study the structure and movement of molecules. This technique produces a lot of data, but there wasn't a good way to quickly and accurately analyze it until now. DeepRET is a computer program that uses deep learning, a type of artificial intelligence, to look at microscope images and turn them into useful information about molecule behavior. It's easy to use and fast, requiring only a simple step to adjust the quality of the data. It's more accurate than 95% of the time compared to human analysis and takes much less time. This software can help scientists study how molecules move and change, which is important for understanding biology.

DeepRET is a free and can be used by anyone, even those without programming skills, on Windows or Mac. It's better than other methods because it can learn from raw data and doesn't need a lot of preparation or rules, making it reproducible. It's also faster than humans for big datasets and comes close to human accuracy. The software was tested with real data and shown to be good, and can be used in many labs to study molecules. It's a big step forward for single-molecule studies to be used more in biology.
Researchers have found that a protein called SCML2 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by working with a complex called Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). SC2 is a mammalian version of a protein found in fruit flies called SCM, which is part of the Polycomb group that associates with PR1. The study shows that SC2A, an SC2 isoform tightly bound to chromatin, contributes to PR1 localization and repression of certain Polycomb target genes. SC2 binds PR1 via its S domain and interacts with RNAs through a novel region called R. Targeting SC2 to chrom involves the action of MB domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PR1 through S domain. Deletion of R reduces SC2 at target genes and overexpression of mutant SC2 lacking R causes PR recruitment defects.

 SC2 appears to enforce repression at a subset of genes independent of PR1, via unknown mechanisms. Identifying SC2 as a Polycomb protein that binds and represses Poly targets sheds light on interplay between RN and epigenetic regulation and combinator factors that drive specificity in different contexts. Results show RNA plays role in SC2 function, required for localization to chromatin. In flies, interaction SCM and PR relies on C-terminal S domain, similar mechanism conserved in humans.

Data support a model where R contributes SC2 localization to chrom, interacts PR, and creates chrom environment refractory to transcription. SCM is Poly protein binds at least target in flies. A novel R in SC2 contributes chrom localization with recognition methylines by MB domain, RNA activity required to recruit or stabilize SC2 chrom. SC2 retained target through interaction PR, contributes stabilizing PR. Experiments conclude SC2 recruited through process requires RNA activity and presence mutant SC2R not chrom-bound causes release BMI, presumably PR from chrom. SC binds through R required genome-wide targeting and recruitment PR, identified RNAs bound SC in vivo
Scientists have long known that a protein called SecM can stop the production of certain proteins in bacteria called E. coli by blocking the ribosomes, which are the factories where proteins are made. But the exact mechanism of how this happens was unclear. Researchers used a powerful microscope technique called cryo-EM to look at the ribosomes with Sec bound to them and found two different ways Sec can stop protein production. One way is by blocking the part of the ribosome that forms the peptide bond between amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. The other way is by keeping the amino acid attached to the ribosome too long, preventing it from moving to the next step. This shows how Sec can control protein production by changing the shape of the ribosome.
Researchers used a new technology called Adaptive Optics Scanning Ophthalmoscope to image the cone cells in the center of the eye, called the fovea, in 28 eyes of 16 people. They measured the density of these cells and other metrics in units of visual angle and linear retinal units. The study found that the fove cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fove, but not in proportion to eye length. Myopes, or people with nearsightedness, have a higher angular density of cones around the fove compared to emmetropes, or people with normal vision, offering better visual acuity. Reports of deficits in best-corrected fove vision in myopes compared to emropes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during my progression.

The study aimed to investigate how the length of the eye affects cone density at the fove center. Two types of cone densities were discussed. Studies found that myopes have higher fove photoreceptor sampling with potential for better performance on tasks compared to emrop. The simplest explanation for visual deficits in myopes increased separation cones caused by ret stretching would be ruled out. Adaptive optics offers high-quality images of the fove photore mosaic ever recorded in vivo. Despite advances, previous studies investigating packing and length not made measurements at the fove center, the most region for vision but difficult to image due to small photore size.

The study found that if the enlargement of the retinal image matched the stretching of cone, eyes of different lengths would sample the field similarly. In large studies, myopes attain good acuity with correction.
Researchers have identified the genetic factors that contribute to the duration of pneumocococcal carriage in the nasopharynx, a prerequisite for invasive disease in infants, especially in low-income settings. They developed a model to calculate carriage duration from longitudinal swab data and combined it with whole genome sequence data. The study found that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the variation, while host traits like age and previous carriage accounted for less than 5%. The researchers partitioned heritability into lineage and locus effects and found that serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%), and other locus (7%) were the largest sources of variation. A genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences associated with decreased carriage, independent of serotype, potentially disrupting the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumoccal competition and resistance.

The study aimed to understand genetic determinants of pneumoccal carriage beyond serotype. By combining longitudinal data and genome data, they quantified and mapped genetic contribution to carriage. Analysis showed that variants other than serotype affect duration, consistent with recent work. The study identified alleles in a natural population and candidates for loci fulfilling this role, suggesting pneumcal variants alter carriage linked to antibiotic resistance. The pneumoc genome explains most variability (63%), with ser and erythromycin resistance (19%) and prophage (7%) contributing. A table summarizes sources associated with variation in carriage. The study estimated transmission pairs share duration and showed differences between and within serotypes. Prophage effect on duration has implications for pneumoc genome diversification through frequent loss during carriage.

The study suggests pneumoc genetics is a factor in determining duration in this population. Environmental conditions like host status may change heritability. A lower bound can be calculated by fitting a linear model to SNPs.
Researchers have been trying to figure out how many β-subunits (KCNE) are paired with each α-sub (KCQ) in the slow rectifier current (IK) channel in the heart. This channel is important for stabilizing the heart rhythm and making sure it doesn't beat too fast or too slow. Studies have shown either 2 or 4 β-subunits for every 1 α-sub, but it's not clear. To solve this, scientists linked KCNE to 1, 2, or 4 KCQ subunits and tested them in cells. They found that linking 2 or 4 KCQ subunits to KCNE made the channel open slower and less conductive, but adding more KCNE fixed this. They also used a special amino acid to link KCNE and found that linking 2 or 4 KCQ to KC took longer than linking 1 KCQ. This shows that there's no limit to how many β-sub can be in the channel, up to 4.

The slow rectifier current (IK) in the heart is made by the α-sub KCQ and β-subunit KCN. This channel is crucial for repolarizing the heart after a beat and shortening the action potential at fast heart rates. The α-sub KCQ is found in many places, including the heart and inner ear, and when paired with β KCN, it has unique properties. In the heart, KCQ and KCN make the slow rect current (IK) which stabilizes repolar and shortens the action potential at high heart rates. However, if the stoichiometry can be changed, it could alter the channel's properties and affect repolar. Other β-subunits like KC2-5 can also be in cardiomyocytes, but it's unclear how many are paired with KCQ.

To solve this, scientists made channels with KC linked to 1, 2, or 4 KCQ and tested them in cells. They used whole-cell and single-channel recordings and a special amino acid to link. They found that linking 2 or 4 KC to KC made the channel slower and less conductive, but adding KC fixed this. They also found that linking 2 or 4 KC to KC took longer than linking 1 KC, showing no limit to how many β-sub can be in the channel, up to 4.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called interleukin-1 beta (Ilb) plays a crucial role in the regeneration of a zebraf fish's fin. When the fin is injured, Ilb is released by epithelial cells, which are a type of skin cell, and triggers an inflammatory response. This response is necessary for regeneration, but if it lasts too long, it can cause damage. Macrophages, a type of immune cell, help resolve the inflammation and allow regenerative cells to survive. The study found that Ilb is essential for normal fin regeneration by turning on genes that help repair the tissue. However, too much Ilb and inflammation can hinder regeneration. The research shows that a balance of Ilb and inflammation, controlled by macrophages, is key to successful regeneration.
Researchers studied how proteins move in the cytoplasm of three types of bacteria: Escheria coli, Lactoccus lactis, and Haloaxii. They found that proteins with a positive charge on their surface move much slower than those with a negative charge. This is because they interact with ribosomes, the cell's protein-making factories, which slows them down. This effect is stronger in E. coli than in L. lactis and H. volcanii due to less electrostatic screening. In E. coli, positive proteins diffuse up to 100 times slower than negative ones, while in L. lact and H. volcan, the difference is smaller. The interaction with ribosomes also affects protein synthesis, slowing it down the assembly or activity of the ribosomes. Many ribosomal proteins in E. coli have a positive charge, which would make them diffuse slower. The researchers analyzed the proteomes of these bacteria and four endosymbiotic bacteria to understand how proteins diffuse in the cytoplasm. They need to know the charge and abundance of all proteins in the proteome and how ribosomes affect protein diffusion. Many biological processes depend on molecules finding each other by diffusion, especially in prokaryotes without active transport.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the ability of certain animals, such as planarians, to regenerate lost body parts. These creatures can regrow entire body parts, including heads, brains, and even parts of their digestive system. However, the mechanisms behind this process are not well understood. Researchers have identified a protein, called S-follatin, that plays a crucial role in regeneration. Soll inhibits a signaling pathway called Activin, which is involved in tissue growth and development. When tissue is lost, Soll is expressed at higher levels and blocks Activin signaling, allowing regeneration to occur. This process is specific to injuries involving missing tissue, not normal tissue turnover. Two other proteins, S-activ-1 and Sactiv-2, are required for Soll to function. The study suggests that Soll inhibits Activin to trigger regeneration after injuries with missing tissue loss. This is a key mechanism for regeneration across the animal kingdom. 

In planarians, injuries with varying tissue loss trigger distinct responses. Researchers found Soll required for regeneration and cellular responses to missing tissue. Follatin inhibition of Activ signaling is necessary for regeneration to occur. Soll expression is controlled by the extent of tissue loss following injury. A gene encoding a T-β inhibitor, follatin, is required for regeneration and specific responses to injury. Data suggest inhibition of Activ by S is required for regenerative response after major injury. Soll is wound-induced and persists at high levels after major injury. T-β plays a role in many forms of regeneration, but uncovering missing signals in planarians and how they interact with Activ will inform regenerative mechanisms. All animals face injury and require regenerative mechanisms. Planarians are exceptional in regenerative potential. Distinct programs for simple and missing tissue injuries exist. In substantial injuries, planarians mount mitotic and apoptotic responses and wound gene expression. Wound-induced S allows regenerative to be initiated as consequence of tissue. S is the first required for regeneration responses in planarians. Not all missing responses are abolished by S inhibition. Neoblast migration to amputation occurred normally in S RNA animals, despite absence of proliferative response.
Researchers have found that tumors with a deficiency in a key DNA repair system called mismatch repair (MMR) have a unique genetic signature that makes them more susceptible to damage from breaks in their DNA. These breaks, called double-strand breaks, occur when the DNA is split into two strands. MMR-deficient tumors have a distinct genetic fingerprint that is different from other tumors, but similar to the genetic variation found in normal cells. This suggests that a significant amount of genetic variation in humans comes from errors that MMR can't fix. The team also identified a set of repeated mutations, called indels, that can be used to detect a condition called microsatellite instability (MSI). They developed a new test that is more accurate and specific than current methods to detect MSI in endometrial tumors with MMR deficiency. Additionally, they found that M-deficient tumors are more sensitive to drugs that cause double-strand breaks, making them a potential target for treatment.
Scientists have developed a new tool called "Magnets" to control biological processes in cells without harming them. Magnets are small modules made from a protein called Vivid, which can be activated by light. They can be used to turn on or off specific processes in cells, like recruiting proteins to certain parts of the cell or making connections between them. However, the original Magns had some limitations: they needed to be combined in pairs and worked best at low temperatures.

To fix this, researchers created a new version called "eMagnets" that don't need to be combined and work at normal temperatures. They tested these new Magns by using them to recruit proteins to parts of the cell, make connections between them, and restore a process that helps move lipids around the cell. The new Magns worked well and can be used to control processes in small parts of the cell or the whole cell.

Magnets are made from two parts, nMag and pMag, which are small and can be attached to many proteins. The new Magns are more stable and work faster than the originals. They were tested in several ways, including recruiting proteins to parts of the cell, making connections and restoring a process that helps move lipids. The goal was to make a pair that works with just one copy of each, which would be ideal for controlling small parts of the cell. To do this, they made a test to see how well the Magns work together, using a protein visible on the outer membrane of the cell. They then changed the parts of the Magn to make them work better, using a 3D image of the Vivid protein.

The new Magns have advantages over others: they work fast and have low background, making them good for controlling small parts of the cell.
Researchers have discovered a new link between stalled ribosomes and neurodegeneration in the brain. Ribosomes are the cellular machines that build proteins from amino acids. When they stall, or get stuck, it can cause brain cells to die. But the signals that trigger this process were unknown. Scientists studied mice with a genetic mutation that causes ribosomes to stall. They found that a protein called GC2 is activated, which triggers a stress response in the brain. This response, called the integrated stress response, helps the brain cells survive. The researchers also found that this response is crucial for certain brain cells to survive when ribosomes stall. Without it, these cells die. The study suggests that ribosome stalling and protein building are connected in a way that affects brain cell survival during stress.
Over the past century, adult height has changed unevenly across the world's countries, with no indication of convergence. The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19 cm for men and 20 cm for women a century ago, and remained the same for women, increasing for men later despite changes in country rankings. The largest gains in height occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (17.5-22.7) and 16.5 (13.3-19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in height in some sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia countries. The tallest men were born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, averaging 182.5 cm, while the shortest were born in Guatemala in 1896, 140.3 (135.8-144.8). The tallest women were in Norway, Iceland, USA, and American Samoa, averaging over 158 cm, while the shortest were in El Salvador, Peru, Bangladesh, Korea, and Japan. Men in Sweden, Norway, and USA surpassed 171 cm, 18 cm taller than in Laos. Men born in 199 surpassed 181 in Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, and Denmark, with Dutch men at 182.5, the tallest on the planet. The gap with the shortest countries, Timor-Leste, Yemen, and Laos, men only 160 tall, increased 4 cm on the global in 189 birth.
Opioids cause breathing problems by affecting two small areas in the brain, called the brainstem. This is a major concern because opioid overdose rates in the US have quadrupled between 1999 and 2017, leading to 130 deaths per day. To find a solution, researchers looked at how opioids affect breathing in mice. They found that two areas in the brainstem are key to breathing, and that a specific cells in one of these areas, called the preBöt Complex, are sensitive to opioids. These cells, called Opr1 glutamateric neurons, are responsible for the breathing rhythm. Removing just 70-140 of these cells is enough to stop opioid-induced breathing problems. Researchers think opioids work by silencing these cells, removing them from the network. They also found that these cells are not needed for pain relief, making them a target for new treatments that prevent breathing problems while keeping pain relief.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called sodium taurochotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) acts as a receptor for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its satellite virus, hepatitis D (HDV). HBV and HDV infections are major health problems worldwide, and people infected with HDV have more severe disease. The viruses enter cells through HB envelope proteins, specifically the pre-S domain of the large protein, but the receptor was unknown. Using a technique called near distance-crossing and affinity, the researchers found that pre-S interacts with NT, a protein mainly found in the liver. Silencing NT stopped HB and HDV infection, while adding NT made liver cells susceptible to the viruses. Replacing amino acids 157-165 of monkey NT with human made it work for both viruses. This shows NT is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV.
Sepsis leads to lasting changes in the phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off infections. When people experience sepsis, their body's immune system goes into overdrive, producing a massive amount of cytokines, which can lead to a state of immunoparalysis, where the immune system is weakened and unable to fight off infections. Those who survive seps can be left with long-term damage to their immune system, making them more susceptible to future infections. Research has shown that seps affects memory CD8 cells, but how much they recover is unknown. A study found that memory CD8 cells from septic patients proliferate more than those from healthy individuals. Using a mouse model, researchers induced seps and found that memory CD cells proliferate, leading to changes in the composition and localization of the CD8 cell compartment. Memory cells from septic survivors have altered transcription and chromatin, indicating lasting changes. These changes lead to altered function and reduced capacity to fight off infections. The study shows seps leads to long-term changes in CD8 cells, affecting their ability to respond to future infections. 

In the study, researchers found that seps leads to a change in the composition of memory CD8 cells in survivors. This is due to increased proliferation in the lymphopen environment after seps, seen in both patients and mice, where central memory cells have higher proliferative capacity than effector cells. This bias towards central cells alters localization of memory cells. The number of memory CD8 cells in blood was quantified, showing loss and recovery of cells in hosts, similar to previous reports of homeostatic proliferation following seps-induced lymphopenia. Pre-existing cells numerically recover with time after seps, potentially due to increased response to seps-induced lymphic environment. The data show preferential proliferation by central cells alters composition and localization of pre-existing cells after seps. Pre-existing differences in biology of central and effector cells are the mechanism by which central cells become over-present in populations after seps.
Scientists have long known that a type of genetic material called LINE-1 (L1) can jump around in the human genome and cause mutations. To prevent this, cells have developed ways to control L1. One of these ways is through the APOB3 (3) family of enzymes, which change cytosine to uridine in single-stranded DNA. APO3A3 is the most effective at stopping L1 in lab tests, but how it works was unclear. Researchers used lab and animal tests to show that A3 stops L1 by changing transiently exposed single-stranded DNA during L integration. This explains how A3 works to stop L. 

In lab tests, L from cells with A3 and uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (U) showed A3 changed cytos to uridine in single-stranded DNA. This shows A3 stops L by changing exposed single-stranded DNA during L integration. Previous studies showed A3 stopped L in cells, but didn't find changes in L with A. This was a mystery. A new lab test, called L Element Amplification Protocol (LEAP), recreated the first step of L integration to see how A3 stops L. Degradation of changed L intermediates reduced L in cells and could hide A changes in L. This could explain why previous studies didn't find A changes in L.
Researchers have found that a protein called Rem2 plays a crucial role in how the brain's visual circuits adapt to changing sensory experiences. This protein, called Rem2, helps regulate the excitability of neurons, which is the ability of neurons to fire electrical signals. Without Rem2, the brain's ability to adapt to new visual experiences is impaired, specifically during a critical period when the brain is most malleable. This is called ocular dominance plasticity, when one eye is covered and the other eye is not, and the brain learns to favor the uncovered eye. In mice without Rem2, this process fails to happen. At the cellular level, Rem2 regulates the excitability of a type of neuron called layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Without Rem2, these neurons fire more frequently than usual. This suggests Rem2 is key in maintaining proper brain function in response to changing experiences. The protein senses changes in response to neuronal activity to preserve circuit function. Further study of Rem-dependent mechanisms will reveal how neural circuitry adapts to changing experiences.
Researchers have been studying how magnetic fields affect biological molecules and cells, following reports of magnetism in living systems. One study found a protein that acts like a compass to guide animal orientation (Qin 2016), while others showed magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel and tugging it with a magnetic field (Stanley 2015, Wheeler 2016). However, these claims conflict with basic physics laws, with discrepancies of 5-10 orders of magnitude. If true, they must have different causes. The paramagnetic nature of protein limits its utility for magnetically sensitive cells.

The forces or torques and temperatures produced are too small to affect molecular orientation or membrane channels. If true, rely on a different mechanism. Proposed magnetogen routes, based on pulling or heating ferritin with fields, have no chance of success. A study designed a system to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the membrane, with a protein fused to ferritin (201). Results suggest neural activity can be modulated by static fields, but evidence is scant. Ferritin is a large protein with 24 subunits, 12 nm in diameter.

There's interest in magnetic effects on cells. Magnetosensation, how organisms sense Earth's field for navigation, is unresolved. Magnetogen, making cells responsive to fields for control, is a dream. Magnetos in animals may rely on magnetite, coupling a crystal to channel (Kvink 200). Another suggests magnetic acts on single molecules in reactions (Ritz 201).
Scientists have long sought to understand how stem cells switch between states of self-renewal, differentiation, and quiescence, which is crucial for stem cell-based therapeutics. Fruit fly neural progenitor cells, called neuroblasts, have been a model for studying self-renew and differentiation, but quies remained poorly understood. Researchers found that when neurobl enter quies, the factor Prosper is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus, followed by a unique molecular profile lacking progenitor and differentiation markers. A low level of Prosper precedes entry into quies, even when timing is advanced or delayed by changing identity factors. Loss of Prosper prevents quies, while a pulse of low Prosper drives proliferating neurobl into quies. The team proposes that Prosper levels distinguish progen states: absent for selfnew, low for quies, and high for differentiation.

In this study, the researchers show that Prosper is transiently detected in neurobl prior to quies. They found that loss of Prosper prevents quies, while a pulse low Prosper drives proliferating neuro into quies. Fruit neurobl have served as a model for conserved pathways regulating cell proliferation and quies. The team found that nearly all quies neurobl reactivated and expressed progenitor markers. A low Prosper can advance the timing of qu. They conclude that low Prosper is sufficient to induce neuro quies.

A correlation was found between Prosper timing and neuro entry quies. The researchers asked if Prosper is required for entry and loss can delay qu. They quantified the number of Ed+bl in Prosper mutants. A pulse of Prosper matched timing qu: earlier in mutants, later in. They conclude that low Prosper marks entry quies, suggesting a relationship.
Scientists have developed a new method to study how the HIV-1 virus disassembles its outer shell, called the capsid, in real-time. They used single-molecule microscopy to observe hundreds of individual HIV capsids after removing the virus's protective membrane. This allowed them to see how different molecules bind to the caps affect the disassembly process.

The first step in disassembly is opening a defect in the lattice, which is the rate-limiting step. This is followed by a rapid collapse of the caps. A molecule called PF74 accelerates the opening but stabilizes the remaining lattice. On the other hand, binding to a molecule to a conserved arginine in the lattice delays disassembly but doesn't prevent it.

The researchers found that different stages of disassembly can be controlled by the interplay between caps-binding molecules. This determines the overall disassembly kinetics. They observed that caps-binding molecules have different effects on initiation and continuation of disassembly. The HIV caps is structurally heterogeneous, with various shapes and defects like gaps in the lattice.

A new assay was developed to follow single-molecule disassembly of hundreds of HIVids in one experiment. This type of analysis resolves intermediates in the pathway that are averaged in traditional measurements. By observing individual caps, they can be classified according to disassembly behaviors. Main characteristics of HIV-1 disassembly and interactions with caps-binding were observed: the majority of caps contain defects and disassemble immediately after membrane removal. In absence of binders, disassembly is an all-or-nothing that proceeds after first defect created.
Researchers studied the role of the JNK signaling pathway in breast cancer development. They found that loss of JNK signaling in mouse breast cells led to cancer and accelerated tumor formation in a mouse model of breast cancer. This was associated with widespread neoplas and genomic instability. The study suggests that JNK defects are "driver mutations" that promote tumor initiation, not just growth of established tumors. The J pathway may be suppressed in many breast cancers, but its significance is unclear. The study aimed to test the role of JNK in breast development, expecting it to promote growth due to its activation of AP1 transcription factor. Instead, J loss of J signaling caused cancer and accelerated tumor development. The findings indicate that J plays a key role in early stages of cancer by promoting neoplas in the mammary gland. This likely explains the effect of mutational inactivation of J signaling to promote development.
Researchers have identified a crucial enzyme called peptidylglyc α-amating monxygenase (PAM) that plays a key role in the formation of cilia in different types of cells. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that help with movement and sensing the environment. In Chlamdomonas, a single-celled organism, and planaria, a type of flatworm, and mice, P is necessary for the assembly of motile cilia, which are cilia that move. Without P, these cells failed to form cilia beyond a certain point and had abnormal cell structures. In planaria, P reduction led to fewer cilia on the surface and cilia without a membrane. In mice, P-deficient embryos had abnormal cilia on nerve cells. The study shows P's role in cogenesis, the process of forming cilia, and how it's conserved across different species. P is involved in early steps of cogenesis, including trafficking proteins to the ciliary compartment from the Golgi apparatus. The research suggests P's amidation and membrane roles contribute to cogenesis.
Myosin III (My3) and the actin-bundling protein Espin play crucial roles in the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells. Defects in these proteins cause hereditary hearing impairments. My3 interacts with Espin through its tail homology motif (TH), but how My3 acts through Espin to regulate actin assembly and stabilization is unclear. Researchers discovered My3 TH contains two sequences that strongly bind Espin's ankyrin repeats, revealing a new My3-mediated crossing mechanism of Espin. The My3-Espin structure shows how My3 binds and releases Esp's auto-inhibition. My3 also promotes Esp's actin bundling activity.

My3 can release Esp's auto-inhibition and increase its actin-promoted bundles, according to previous research. Mya and Myb co-localize with Espin at stereilia tips. Co-expression of My3 and Espin stimulates stereilia elongation in cultured hair cells. A key function of My3-Espin is forming thicker actin fibers in structures like stereilia. The TH mediates My3's binding to Esp and transports it to actin-based structures like filopodia and stereilia. Once localized, Esp promotes actin elongation. However, the My-Espin interaction's molecular basis is unclear.

My's motor domain binds actin filaments, and the full My-Espin complex may have higher bundling activity than the My-AR-Espin complex. This study reveals a direct My binding regulation mechanism of actin crosser Esp. Genetic findings point Esp's roles in stere development and maintenance, promoting actin bundles in stereilia. Researchers found Mya and Myb have similar sequences in TH, each binding Espin with high affinity.
Voltage-gated calcium channels play a crucial role in controlling the functions of excitable cells, such as transmitting signals in neurons and contracting heart and skeletal muscles. These channels activate at different voltages and with distinct kinetics to accomplish their diverse functions. To understand how they sense voltage, researchers combined modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, energies, and kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the eukotic calcium channel Ca1.1. Both SDs displayed features of the sliding helix model, but differed in ion-pair formation of outer charges. Stabilizing the activated state enhanced voltage dependence, while stabilizing resting slowed kinetics. This mechanism explains how ionair formation in SDs realize characteristic properties of voltageated cation channels.

Calcium channels translate depolarization into calcium influx, contributing to cellular excitability and linking electrical activity to functions like heart muscle contraction, neurotransmitter secretion, and gene regulation. With voltageated sodium channels, they form a structurally related superfamily with four symmetry. Advanced models of Ca1.1 VSD states fill a gap in understanding voltageensing in eukotic channels. Tested interactions showed predicted effects on gating by mutagen and electrophys analysis. Alterations recognized experimentally were reproduced by computer. Structures of lowest states Ca1 VSD display helix features.

Researchers built a new model to study mechanisms of specific Ca1 gating using Rosetta software. They built a homology of human eukotic Ca1 based on cry-EM of Ca1 (Wu et al, 2016; Wu et al 2015). However, resting states of eotic Ca and Na channels remained inaccessible. Experimental and modeling support the helix model of voltage action (Call et al 201; Yarovarovoy et 2012).
Researchers studied the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the adult brain's ability to change and adapt, a process known as plasticity. They found that an optimal level of MMP activity is crucial for plasticity to occur in both healthy and stroke-affected brains. In healthy brains, MMPs help facilitate changes, but after a stroke, they can promote the spread of damage and hinder recovery. The study examined the effects of MMP inhibition on plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected mice. In healthy mice, a 7-day MMP-inhibition prevented plasticity, while treatment with MMP-inhib once after stroke rescued lost plasticity. The data suggest that precise regulation of MMPactivity is essential for plasticity in the adult brain, offering new opportunities for recovery after stroke treatment. A single treatment after stroke rescued plastic in both paradigms, but two treatments diminished plastic-promoting effect. The study highlights MMP's critical role in adult plasticity and that MMPactivity must be within a narrow window for plastic to occur.
Biologists have long known that AMPA receptors, a type of glutamate-gated ion channel, play a crucial role in transmitting signals at excitatory synapses in vertebrates. These receptors consist of four subunits that assemble as dimers. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have revealed full-length structures of AMP receptors, alone and in combination with auxiliary subunits. These structures show that dimers may move laterally during activation, opening the extracellular layer along the twofold symmetry axis. Researchers used bifunctional methaniosulfate cross-linkers to study AMP receptors in presence and absence of auxiliary sub Stazin. Their data indicate that extracellular AMP receptors can get trapped in stable, opened conformations, especially after long glutamate exposure. In contrast, Staz limits conformation flexibility. Under synaptic conditions, where glutamate and auxiliary proteins dominate, extracellular AMP likely stay compact.

 Studies suggest that extracellular domains of AMP receptors unlikely undergo large rearrangements during transmission, instead working in a compact conformation unless exposed to glutamate in pathological conditions. The presence of auxiliary subunits, such as Staz, may affect conformation flexibility. Cryo-EM structures of AMP with sub have been acquired in resting, active, and desensitized states. However, the dynamics of rapid signaling are unclear. AMP are tetrameric lig-gated channels, consisting of three layers from distinct domains. Two extracellular layers form amino-terminal and ligand domains, AT and L, respectively. These dimer in resting and active receptors. Assuming bis-TS cross-link reflects structural rearrangements, AMP at synapses exposed to brief glut and sub, unlikely undergo conformation changes.
Researchers have long struggled to isolate individual immune cells from the intestines of mice infected with a type of parasitic worm called helminth due to the strong immune response it triggers. This response causes mucus production, tissue changes, and immune cell infiltration, making it hard to get a clear picture of what's happening. To overcome this, scientists optimized a digestion method to isolate millions of immune cells from the infected duodenum, a part of the small intestine. They used a high-dimensional flow cytometry to analyze these cells and confirmed their findings with a microscope. This allowed them to identify key features of the immune response to helmin throughout the infection and could lead to new discoveries that were previously impossible.

To test the method, they used a 23-color flow cytometry panel to look at surface and inside markers of immune cells known to be involved in helmin infections. The cells isolated and analyzed showed hallmarks of both innate and adaptive immune responses to helmin. Confocal microscopy confirmed these changes and showed differences between infected and uninfected samples. Importantly, these changes were only seen in specific areas, highlighting the need for good cell isolation techniques to study helmin directly.

The strong immune response to helmin causes mucus production, epithelial changes, immune cell infiltration, and tissue remodeling, making it hard to isolate cells. The new method allowed accurate representation of intestinal responses and could lead to new discoveries.
Scientists have long known that the proteasome, a complex enzyme responsible for breaking down proteins, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes from metabolism to immune responses. However, the mechanisms regulating its activity are not fully understood. Researchers used a combination of experiments and modeling to develop a detailed model of proteome dynamics. They found that the proteome's activity changes over time due to interactions between substrates and products, and regulatory sites. The model predicted and confirmed that the rate-limiting step is transporting substrates into the proteome. Efficiency varies between standard and immune proteomes, affecting total degradation and cleavage usage.

The study built on previous understanding of proteome structure and function, and existing models of proteome dynamics. It combined experimental and computational analyses to shed light on mechanisms. A lack of detailed analysis of proteome functions and complexity of peptide hydrolysis hindered previous studies. The researchers used short peptides with single proteome-catalyzed cleavage to follow kinetics in real-time. They observed proteome dynamics over time using purified proteome and homogen, where proteomes are surrounded by regulatory molecules. The model describes core proteome features reflecting proteome dynamics in complex scenarios.

Polyubiquitin tagging and peptide-hydrolysis regulate protein-life affecting majority of cellular processes. Despite efforts, mechanisms of proteomal action, particularly differences in substrate proteysis between proteome isoforms are not understood. The proteome is dynamic, catalytic activity changing over time influenced by substrates and regulatory sites.
In the fruit fly Drosila, recycling of neurotransmitters is crucial for sustained synaptic transmission. Histamine, a key neurotransmitter, is rapidly taken up by glial cells and converted to carcinine, which is then delivered back to photoreceptors and hydrolyzed to histamine and β-alanine. However, it was unclear how β-alanine is returned to glial cells. Researchers identified a new βanine transporter, Bala, which is required for retinal cells to recycle βanine. Without Bala, β-al levels and β-al accumulation in the retina were lower, and visual transmission and photaxis behavior were impaired. This suggests that retinal cells play a critical role in neurotransmission and that a Bala-dependent βanine pathway is necessary for histamine homeostasis and neurotransmission.

 Studies suggest that Bala functions in retinal cells to recycle βanine. Disrupting histamine and carcinine synthesis abolishes photoreceptor transmission. Transport of β-al is less important as it's present in higher concentrations in Drosila. βanine is essential for maintaining histamine homeostasis and photore synaptic transmission. Retinal pigment cells, which reduce light intensity, are formed in retinal cells of Dila compound eye. High βanine levels in retinal cells suggest cells may store and transport βanine. To address this, researchers sought a βanine transporter for Dila transmission. Efficient βanine recycling compensates for β loss in hist to carcin conversion. Mutations in Bala disrupted β storage and transport in retina, reducing photore activity and behavior. This suggests conserved function in βanine trafficking in mammals and Dila.
Scientists have been trying to understand how oxidants, or reactive molecules that can damage cells, affect aging for a long time. They thought that an increase in oxidants caused aging, but a new research shows that's not the case. Instead, a drop in a molecule called NAD, which helps keep cells balanced, triggers a chain of events that leads to aging. This happens early in life and affects most proteins in the cell, making it hard for the cell to function. Researchers used yeast, a simple organism, to study aging and found that it undergoes a sudden loss of balance, or redox, before dying. Almost 80% of proteins in the cell are oxidized, or damaged, before cell death. They also found that caloric restriction, a way to extend lifespan, increases NAD levels and delays this process. The study suggests that aging is a stress that uses up the cell's ability to handle oxidants, and that some oxidation might even help slow aging. The same pattern of NAD decrease and oxidation was seen in yeast grown in different conditions, suggesting it's not unique to yeast. The research used yeast to study aging and found that it undergoes same pattern of NAD decrease, oxidation, but delayed, when grown in different conditions. They monitored 300 proteins and found that 80% are oxidized before cell death. The study aims to find which proteins' oxidation contributes to aging and if there's a link between oxidation and lifespan.
Scientists have discovered how a key enzyme called D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacyase (DTD) removes incorrectly attached amino acids from transfer RNAs (tRNAs) in cells. This process, called proofreading, is crucial for cell survival as it ensures only the correct amino acids are used to build proteins. Researchers studied DTD from the parasite Plasmodium falcum and found it uses a unique mechanism to recognize and remove D-amino acids. The enzyme captures the chiral center of the D-amino-tRNA with a special dipeptide, Gly-Pro, and no protein residues are involved in the reaction. This allows DTD to act on multiple D-am acids. The study explains how the cellular pool of L-amino-tRNAs escapes this proof step and provides insights into the fundamental process of enantioselection, which enforces homirality in proteins.
Researchers have studied how the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel opens and closes. CFTR is a chloride channel that helps move ions in and out of cells and is mutated in cystic fibrosis patients. The channel opens when two parts of the protein, called nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), bind together and close when they break apart. Normally, this happens with the help of a molecule called ATP. But in some CF patients, the channel opens without ATP and is helped by a drug called ivacaftor. Scientists wanted to know how this happens. They looked at how parts of the channel move when it opens and closes. They found that the channel opens when the NBDs bind together, even without ATP. This means the parts of the channel move together in a special way that helps it open. This helps explain why some things like phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs affect the channel's activity. It also helps understand how CF and drug work.

The channel's shape doesn't change much when it opens or closes, but ATP helps it stay open. It's like a "molecular glue" that helps the channel stay open. The channel's shape is the same when it's open or closed, but ATP helps it stay open. The channel's shape is the same when it's open or closed, but ATP helps it stay open.

Researchers have discovered a new force that helps transmembrane proteins assemble in lipid bilayers. This force, called the "pre-transition" or "orderobic" effect, occurs when proteins with hydrophobic thickness equal to the disordered phase embed in an ordered bilayer, creating a microscopic order-disorder interface. The stiffness of this interface is finite, and when two proteins approach each other, assembly reduces the interfacial energy. This phenomenon is similar to the hydrophobic effect, but is mediated by proximity to the order-disorder transition and the protein's hydrophobic mismatch. The strength and range of forces from this effect are larger than those from membrane elasticity.

The study used large-scale molecular simulations to show that a protein with hydrophobic thickness equal to the disordered phase in an ordered bil stabilizes an order-dis interface. When two proteins approach each other, assembly reduces the interfacial energy. The effect depends on the protein's hydroobic mismatch with the membrane and its proximity to the order-dis phase transition. For example, a protein with hydroobic thickness of 2.6nm favors the disordered phase, while a larger protein can melt the ordered phase and form an order-dis interface.

This phenomenon may be testable by single-molecule techniques. Biological membranes and transmem proteins are more complex, with multiple components allowing multiple order-dis transitions. A dual orderobic effect also exists, where a protein in the disordered phase can nucleate an ordered region and order-dis interface. Interfaces between ordered and dis regions provide a force for assembly, due to the hydroobic thickness of the ordered phase being larger than the disordered.
Researchers have been using fluorescent indicators to study neural activity in the brain, but the relationship between these signals and electrical impulses, or action potentials (APs), is not well understood. APs can be detected when a single neuron fills the microscope's view, but indicators are used to image populations of neurons, resulting in fewer photons per neuron and compromised detection. To investigate this, scientists studied AP-fluorescence transfer in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex of mice expressing GCMP6 or GC6f. They found that under optimal conditions, most APs were detected, but under typical imaging conditions, only a minority of 1 and 2 AP events were detected (less than 10% and 20% respectively). This highlights the limits of detection under realistic imaging conditions.

To understand AP-calc fluorescence, researchers identified isolated APs and summed them over 250ms. They found that only a minority of APs were used to construct curves. Previous studies have established that APs can be detected with GC6 under near-optimal conditions. The team tested spike models detecting AP under optimal and less-than-optimal conditions. Their results provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity and fluorescence, aiding interpretation of existing and future imaging datasets.

Fluorescent indicators are used to investigate neural dynamics, but the relationship between fluorescence and action potentials (AP) remains unclear. Most AP can be detected when the soma fills the microscope’s field of view, but indicators are used to image populations, necessitating a large field of view, generating fewer photons per neuron and compromising detection.
Researchers have discovered a unique biological valve in the female genitalia of a cave-dwelling insect, Neotla, that allows it to receive multiple seminal packages from males. This valve is made up of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in- and out canals. Females have a penis-like intromitt organ to anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule, which is formed by seminal injection. It's not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition. The valve has two slots for insemination, allowing Neotla to mate while one slot is occupied. In conjunction with the penis, this valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal in nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation and multiple injections. The evolution of this valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of introment organ in Neotla.

 Studies show that females of Neotla use a mechanism to control the direction of seminal flow. This biological valve allows to receive two packages (nutrition) from the same or different males within a short span. In particular, the valve receives a seminal while the first is consumed. With the valve, Neotla and possibly Sensib and Afrog can use one of two slots for insemination, leaving other empty. This enables females to receive additional package from same or males using empty slot. The presence of sperhe plate with valve to control flow may refine understanding of causes and consequences of reversed selection in genus. Female-female competition for males (sex reversal) receive seminal is considered most factor driving evolution of female penis.
Scientists have studied how a protein called Munc-1 helps assemble a group of proteins called SNAREs, which are essential for releasing neurotransmitters in the brain. They used a tool called optical tweezers to observe four stages of SNARE assembly and found that different parts of the SNs have different functions. The N-terminal and C-terminal domains are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, while the middle domain regulates assembly and fusion. M-1 initiates SN assembly and stabilizes the complex. Without M-1, SNs don't assemble properly and can't release neurotransmitters. Researchers found that M-1 holds the SNs together even when they're unfolded, allowing them to reassemble. They also found that M-1 regulates all stages of SN assembly and propose a model for its role in membrane fusion.
Researchers have investigated how integrin adhesomes, the protein complexes that help cells stick to their surroundings, assemble quickly and correctly at adhesion sites. They found that integrin adhesomes are already pre-assembled in the cytosol, the cell's liquid, as multi-protein building blocks that can rapidly form adhesion sites. These blocks are released from stationary adhesion sites, keeping the cytos pool of building blocks uniform. The study suggests that integrin adh is extensively preassembled in the cyol, forming multi-protein blocks for cell-matrix adhesion. The blocks are confined in size and correspond to functional layers of adhesion, including anchoring, regulation, and actin regulation. Symmetric exchange between adhesion sites and cyol ensures blocks enter and exit without being altered.
Researchers have discovered a new way to measure a person's level of arousal using brain activity. They found that a specific pattern in brain waves, called the 1/f slope, can tell if a person is awake, asleep, or under anesthesia. This is different from previous thinking that arousal was only linked to synchronized brain waves. The 1/f slope is a non-oscillatory, meaning it doesn't follow a regular pattern, and is found in all states of reduced arousal, including sleep and anesthesia. 

 Studies using intracran and scalp recordings in four datasets showed that 1/f slope can distinguish wakefulness from propof anesthesia, NREM, and REM sleep. It can even tell the difference between wake and REM sleep based on brain state alone. This is a new electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including sleep and anesthesia in humans. 

Previous research showed that 1/f can track arousal in humans under propof and sleep. The researchers hypothesized that 1 slope would be more negative in sleep and anesthesia compared to wakefulness. They also predicted it could distinguish wake from N and REM sleep. They found that 1 slope differs between wake and propof anesthesia, and examined if it generalized to other forms of decreased arousal, like sleep. They analyzed two datasets during a full night of sleep and found 1 can track arousal in anesthesia and sleep, including REM and NREM. The 1 slope mirrored changes in excitability over slow waves, providing a link to population synchrony during oscillations.

The non-oscill, aperiod part of power can be approximated by 1 decay from 30 to 45 Hz and differentiates wake from all states of reduced level, namely REM, N sleep, and propof anesthesia. 1 dynamics are observed in various tasks. Collectively, results from four studies provide advances: 1 slope tracks arousal in prop and sleep in humans with precision and on timescales from sub-epochs to full recordings. It provides evidence that 1 from 30 to 45 correlates all stages of arousal.
Scientists have discovered that tiny extensions of chloroplasts, called stromules, play a crucial role in the plant's immune response to infection. These extensions connect with the nucleus and help move chloroplasts to the nucleus during an immune response. Researchers found that microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (AF) are involved in this process. MTs help stabilize stromules and increase their length, while AFs provide anchor points for stromules to attach to. The direction of stromules from chloroplasts matches the direction of chloroplast movement, suggesting a connection between the two. Chloroplast movement was observed even without immune induction, indicating a general function of stromules in plant cells. The study shows MTs and AFs help cluster chloroplasts near the nucleus during an immune response. A model proposes that stromules extend along MTs, attach to AF points, and guide chloroplast to the nucleus during immunity.
Scientists have developed a new method to predict how amino acids in proteins interact with each other across protein interfaces. They used this method to study 50 ribosomes and 28 other protein complexes with known structures and found that the predicted interactions were almost always correct when there were enough aligned sequences. This method was then used to predict interactions for 36 protein complexes with unknown structures and models were made for four of them: the tripart ATP-independent periplasm (TR) transporter, tripart efflux system, pyruvate form lyase-activating enzyme, and methine ABC transporter.

The study found that amino acid pairs that covary across protein interfaces are almost always in contact in 3D structure when there are enough aligned sequences. They also found that covary pairs occur frequently between interacting proteins but rarely between non-interacting pairs, making it useful for predicting protein interactions. This method was applied to a large set of complexes with known structures and found that cov pairs are almost always in contact when there are enough aligned.

The researchers used a pseudo-likelihood method to predict interactions across protein interfaces for 36 evolutionarily conserved complexes with unknown structures and presented models for four complexes constrained by data. They found that residue-residue covariance occurs frequently between physically interacting pairs but rarely between non-interacting, making it useful for predicting protein interactions. This study contributes to determining structures of biologically important complexes.

The method was tested on 36 complexes with unknown structures and found strongly co-evolving pairs had at least one prediction with GREIN score greater or equal 0.85.
Researchers studied how people categorize visual scenes by looking at multiple locations in the scene. They used a special task where participants' eye movements were tracked while they categorized images. The results showed that people use an active strategy to gather information, using what they already know about the scene and the structure of patterns. This strategy was improved when an optimal algorithm was used to guide their eye movements. By combining this algorithm with a model of how the brain processes information, the researchers found that most of the improvement came from biases and inaccuracies in eye movements and selecting locations. The process of choosing where to look was 70% efficient in the task. The study suggests people move their eyes to gather information about categories by integrating from multiple locations.

 The research extends previous work on active sensing to tasks with non-spatial features, like categories. It's the first to analyze information gathering under eye movements by matching a model to participants' performance. This allowed separating eye movement from perception and decision processes, and identifying sources of inefficiency in sensing. The approach can be applied to different perceptual tasks.

 To study eye movements, the researchers estimated efficiency on a fixation-by-fixation basis in a categorization task. This is different from search, where one location has all information and movements are simple. Participants' movements were more efficient than strategies using a subset of active sensing and 70% as optimal with their own biases and inaccuracies. Inspired by this, an experiment with controlled patterns was designed to quantify information at each location.
Scientists have long been trying to understand how large molecules, such as viruses and proteins, can pass through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in the cell's nucleus. The NPC is like a gatekeeper that controls what enters and leaves the nucleus, but it's not clear what makes it allow large molecules to pass through. Researchers studied how 30 different large cargo particles, ranging from 17 to 36 nanometers in size, with varying numbers of nuclear localization sequences (NLS) that help them enter the nucleus. They found that the amount of time it takes for these particles to enter the nucleus increases with size and can be explained by a simple two-parameter model that relates to the energy needed for transport. This study sheds light on what makes large molecules enter the nucleus and could help understand how other big molecules, like pre-ribosomal subunits and RNA complexes, are exported out of the cell.
Researchers have long known that the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 plays a crucial role in activating helper T cells, but its function after activation has been unclear. To investigate this, scientists created mice where CD28 was removed from helper T cells after priming. They found that continued CD28 expression is necessary for helper cells to fight off infection. Specifically, CD28 is required for the expansion of a type of helper cell called Th1 and the maintenance of another type called follicular helper during viral infection. It also helps clear the bacteria Citrobacterium from the gut. This study shows CD28 is necessary for helper cell response to infection, revealing a new function distinct from its role in priming.
Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacteria that causes stomach infections, has a unique helical shape that allows it to efficiently colonize the stomach. However, the mechanisms behind this shape are not fully understood. Researchers studied how Helicobacter pylori maintains its shape while growing and found that its cell wall growth is enhanced at both the curved and straight parts of the helix. They used special probes to track growth and found that two proteins, Mre and C, are involved in this process. M is more abundant at the curved part of the helix, while C is more at the straight part. When these proteins are altered, the bacteria lose their helical shape. The researchers propose that M and C promote growth at curved and straight parts of the helix, respectively, and this is necessary for maintaining the shape.

To understand how Helobacter pyl grows while keeping its shape, researchers used special microscopy to track growth. They found growth is enhanced at curved and straight parts of the helix. They also looked at where proteins M and C are located in the cell. M is more at curved part of hel, while C is at straight part. To maintain curved shape, Helob pyl uses both M and C. M promotes growth at curved part, while C promotes at straight. This allows Helob pyl to keep its shape even when growing.

In other bacteria, like E coli, M is at curved while C is at straight. Both M and C help growth and are necessary for Helob pyl's helical shape. Researchers also found that Helob pyl has more curved shape than other bacteria like cresus and cholera and uses different mechanisms to achieve this.
Researchers have discovered a new role for a protein called Cdc48 in regulating the process of mitochondrial fusion, which is crucial for the health of cells. Mitochondria are the energy-producing structures within cells. C48 works with two other proteins, Ubp12 and U2, to control the amount of ubiquitin on a protein called Fzo. Ubiquitin is a molecule that attaches to other proteins to mark them for destruction or modification. U12 and U2 have opposite effects on F1: U12 promotes fusion while U2 inhibits it. C48 helps U12 break down U2, allowing U2 to remove ubiquitin from F1 and prevent fusion. This creates a balance between fusion and no fusion. The study found that C48 ensures the right amount of ubiquitin on F1 to allow fusion but not too much, which would target it for destruction. This is a new cascade of events involving C48, U12, and U2 that fine-tunes the activity of F1.
Researchers used fMRI to study how the brain's ventral occip-temporal cortex (VOT) responds to sounds in people who are blind and those who can see. They found that the OT area of the brain processes sound categories in a similar way to how it processes visual information in the sighted individuals. However, the blind group showed a stronger and more stable response to sound categories. The study suggests that the brain's OT can develop categorical responses to sounds even without visual experience, and that these responses are similar to those found in the visual system. 

The researchers used a technique called representational analysis to understand how the brain represents sounds in the OT. They found that the membership of a sound in a category is the main factor that determines how it is represented in the brain, not its acoustic features. This is different from how the temporal cortex processes sound, which is based on lower-level acoustic attributes. 

The study showed that OT in both blind and sighted people encodes the membership of sounds from different categories using a similar topography, representational format, and connectivity. However, the representation of sounds in OT is different from the organization of visual information in sight people. This might be because OT processes visual attributes in sight and acoustic in blind due to cross-modal plasticity. Studies have shown that the occipital cortex in blind can represent acoustic features, such as frequencies.
Scientists have discovered a fungus called Entomophthora muscae that manipulates the behavior of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, in the laboratory. This fungus makes the flies climb upward, extend their proboscis, fix in place, and raise their wings, creating a path for spores to launch from their abdomens. The fungus invades the fly's nervous system, suggesting a direct way it could induce behavioral changes. The researchers believe this system will help understand how the fungus manipulates host behavior. 

To study the fungus, they isolated a strain infecting wild Dophila and established methods to infect D melanaster in the lab. Lab-infected flies showed morund behaviors of E mus infection before death. The team found E mus invades the nervous system, granting direct access to host neurons, which may be key to behavioral manipulation. However, they consider other ways E mus could alter behavior before concluding this. They imagine four ways E mus achieves manipulation: 

To test if E mus infects outside Drosidae, they exposed flies to E mus-infected melanaster using a modified protocol. Flies died and sporulated, indicating they were killed by the fungus. To understand how E progresses in melan at the molecular level, they measured changes in host and fungus over 5 days. Early infected flies are indistinguishable from uninfected, complicating the study. This helped elucidate the basis of manipulation, but progress is limited by lack of genetic tools in fungus or host and neuro tools in host. Intriguingly, similar behaviors are induced in dipter by distantly related Zygomete fungi within Entom mus species.
Researchers have mapped the locations of 30 RNA degradation factors in yeast cells to understand how they process and break down RNA. They used a technique called PAR-CL to identify where these factors bind to different types of RNA. The results show that some factors prefer certain types of RNA, like mRNAs with non-optimal codons, which are degraded quickly. Others bind intact mRNAs, suggesting decapping is a rate-limiting step. The nuclear surveillance machinery targets aberrant RNAs and snoRNAs. The study provides a resource for future research on eukotic RNA pathways and metabolism.
Researchers have discovered a new type of chromatin, called "kairo," that plays a crucial role in the rapid production of camalexin, a potent defense compound in Arabidopsis plants. Camalex is induced by bacterial and fungal infections, but the process of how it's activated was unknown. By analyzing epigenetic data and chromatin mapping, they found that camalex biosynthesis genes are marked with two opposing modifications: trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3me3) and acetylation of histone lysine 18 (H3ac). These modifications form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin, kairo. Mutants with reduced H3me or Hac showed that both modifications are necessary for the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at early in the stress response. The study suggests kairo maintains the proper timing of camalex induction upon pathogen signal.
Researchers have discovered that a specific type of cell in the brain, called astrocytes, can act as stem cells and produce new neurons in the adult brain. These cells, found in a region called the subventricular zone (SV), express a protein called EZ2. This protein is part of a group called Polycomb, which helps control how genes are turned on or off. Without EZ2, these cells can't produce new neurons, but they can still multiply. The protein represses a gene called Olig, which is needed for neurons to form. EZ also stops other genes from being turned on that aren't meant to be in this type of cell. In the human brain, these cells also express EZ, and are linked to new neurons being made after birth. This protein is important for regenerative medicine and cancer research.
Scientists have long known that viruses play a crucial role in shaping microbial communities and ecosystems, but studying their interactions with certain microorganisms has been challenging due to difficulties in growing them in the lab. A team of researchers used a technique called single-cell genomics to study viruses infecting a type of bacteria called uncultivated SUP bacteria found in a specific area of the ocean where oxygen levels are low. They found that about one-third of these bacteria are infected with viruses and that the frequency of infection increases where oxygen levels are lowest. They also discovered new types of viruses that can infect SUP bacteria and that can help them survive in low-oxygen conditions. Analysis of both the bacteria and viruses in the area showed that the viruses have been present for years and are specific to this region. The researchers also found that the viruses have genes that allow them to alter the bacteria's energy production, suggesting a close relationship between the two.
Researchers have identified a protein called TTC26/DY13 that plays a crucial role in the process of intraflagellar transport (IFT), which is essential for the assembly and maintenance of cilia/flagella. IFT is a highly conserved mechanism involving over 20 proteins, but the functions of individual proteins were unclear. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches, scientists found that TTC26/DY13 is an IFT complex protein in mammalian cells and Chlamdomonas reinhardtii. Knocking down TTC26Y13 in zebraf embryos or mutating TTC26Y13 in C reinhardt resulted in short cilia with motility defects. Surprisingly, IFT assembly and speed were normal in dy13 mutant flagella, unlike other IFT complex mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analysis showed specific proteins involved in motility were depleted in dy13 mutant. This suggests different IFT proteins are responsible for different subsets of cargo, explaining the complexity of IFT machinery.

TTC26Y13 is not required for ciliogenesis or IFT particle movement, but plays a role in transporting specific motility proteins into cilia. In contrast, IFT56 is conserved in most ciliated organisms, suggesting a conserved role in IFT. Further analysis is needed to clarify TTC26Y13's role in cilia length. Knocking down I56 in zraf embryos and C reinhardt dy13 cells showed motility defects. Unlike other I proteins, TTC26 is not required for assembly or movement, but transports specific motility proteins into cilia.
Lymphatic endothelial cells play a crucial role in the spread of melanoma, a type of skin cancer, to other parts of the body. When melanoma cells interact with lymphatic cells, they become more likely to invade and spread to distant organs. Researchers studied how this process by growing melanoma cells with lymphatic cells in a lab dish and in mice. They found that melanoma cells that were growing quickly became invasive and spread more easily to other parts of body. This was due to a protein called matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14) and Notch and β-integrin, which were activated when melanoma cells interacted with lymphatic cells. These proteins are important for melanoma cells to grow and spread. The researchers also found that MP14 and Notch were needed for melanoma to spread in mice. This study shows how lymphatic cells can help melanoma spread by changing the way melanoma cells grow and become invasive. This could help find new ways to stop melanoma from spreading.
Researchers have discovered a new role for microRNA-9 (miR-9) in the development of brain cells called neurons. mi-9 is one of the most abundant microRNAs in the brain and has been studied in neural stem cells, but its role in neuron growth and connections was unknown. To study this, scientists created a special mice that could turn off mi-9 in specific brain cells at specific times. They found that mi-9 controls growth of neuron branches called dendrites and how they connect with other cells. The team also found that mi-9 works by turning off a gene called REST, which is a brake on neuron growth. Without mi-9, dendrites grow abnormally and connections between cells don't work well. This study shows mi-9 is important in neuron development after they are born and helps them grow and connect with other cells.
Researchers have long known that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often struggle with social interactions and eye contact, but the reasons behind these difficulties are not well understood. A new study used brain imaging and eye-tracking methods to investigate how brain organization in young children with ASD differs from those without the disorder. The study found that children with ASD had weaker connections between brain areas involved in social thinking and visual processing, such as the "default mode network" and visual areas. This was especially true for a subgroup of children with pronounced social difficulties, who showed weaker connections between the default network and the occipital-temporal cortex. Weaker connections were also linked to more severe social and communication problems, but only in this subgroup. The study suggests that early brain differences in social-visual connections may be a key feature of this subgroup and important for future development and treatment.
In fruit flies, like Drosophila, blood cells have different jobs to keep the body healthy. This is because of a balance between growing and changing into different types of cells, which happens in special organs called hematopoietic. In Dophila, these organs make two types of blood cells: plasmatocytes and crystal. Plasocytes are like a type of cell in vertebrates called macrophages, which eat up bad stuff. Crystal cells are different, but their numbers increase during larval development. Researchers wanted to know how this happens. They found that new crystal cells come from plmatocytes through a process called transdifferentiation, which needs a protein called Notch. This happens in clusters of cells called sessile, which are important for this process. This discovery helps understand how blood cells are made and controlled in Doph and similar to vertebrates.
Scientists have long wondered how cells can tolerate the negative effects of aneuploidy, a condition where a cell has an abnormal number of chromosomes, until new beneficial traits evolve. Laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to anupidy, but surprisingly, researchers found that anup is common in wild yeast isolates, which have lower-than-expected expression of many genes. They created diploid panels with two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes to show that gene dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are higher in expression in wild populations but show elevated rates of amplification, suggesting copy variation is buffered at these genes. Aneupidy provides a clear advantage to strain YPS9 by amplifying a gene that escapes compensation. The study presents a model where compensation buffers amplification through anup to provide a natural, likely, transient route to rapid evolution.

Chromosomal amplification is common in non-laboratory yeast, which are tolerant of anup and display dosage at the transcript level for specific amplified genes. Strikingly, genes subject to compensation are buffered against copy variation and show elevated amplification in isolates. New mutations or adaptation could reduce expression at amplified or strains actively downregulate in proportion to gene, known as compensation. Researchers generated anup-eup pairs for three wild strains to distinguish between possibilities. Results show up to 40% amplified in anup strains have lower-than-expected expression, due to heritable polymorphisms downregulate amplified, some selected during adaptation.
Scientists have discovered a new type of light-sensing cells in a type of flatworm called Marig crozier. These cells are not in the eyes, but around the brain, and have hundreds of tiny hair-like structures called cilia inside. They found that these cells use a protein called xenin, a type of opsin, to sense light. Opsins are proteins that help animals see, but xenin is different from others. It was thought to be part of a group called G-coupled opsins, but now it's clear it diverged from them a long time ago. The researchers studied xenin in Marig cro and found it's in ciliary cells in the larva and extra cells around the brain in adults. They showed that xenin drives light sensing by coupling to a protein called Gi. This is similar to how other light-sensing cells in jawed vertebrates, like humans, work. They also found that xenin is in cells that form cilia inside their own membrane, like human rod cells do. This is a new type of lightensing cell that challenges our understanding of how light sensing evolved in animals.
Scientists have long known that spatial and temporal cues play a crucial role in specifying the diversity of neurons in the brain, but how these cues are integrated in neural progenitor cells has remained a mystery. Fruit flies, or Drosophila, are a good model to study this because their neural stem cells, called neuroblasts, are individually identifiable and have known spatial and temporal factors. Researchers tested whether these factors act independently or sequentially in neuroasts. They used a technique called TargetID to identify the binding sites of the temporal factor Hunch in two neuroasts, NB-6 and NB-4, which make different types of neurons. The results showed that Hunch targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent model. Moreover, each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin, which correlated with H-bound loci in each neuro. Importantly, the spatial factor Gsbax, expressed in NB-6 but not NB-4, had binding sites correlated with openatin in NB-6 but not NB-4. The study supports a model where early spatial factors like G establish neuro-specific chromatin, leading to temporal factor binding and production of different neurons in each lineage.
Scientists have long been trying to understand how a type of receptor called the P2X receptor works. This receptor opens a pore in the cell membrane in response to a molecule called ATP, but the exact mechanism was unclear. Researchers used a new tool called photo-switch tweezers to measure the distance between parts of the receptor during activation. They combined this with computer simulations to create detailed models of the open and closed states of the receptor. The results show that the pore expands less than expected and the inner and outer parts of the receptor come closer together through a bending motion. This provides new insight into how P2 receptors work and a new way to study other membrane proteins.

 Researchers used photo-switch tweez to study the P2 receptor, a type of ion channel that opens in response to ATP. They measured the distance between parts of the receptor during activation and combined with computer simulations to create detailed models of the open and closed states. The results show the pore expands less than expected and the inner and outer parts of the receptor come together through a bending motion. This provides new understanding of P2 receptors and a way to study other membrane proteins.

Cell division, or cytokinesis, is the process by which one cell splits into two, is powered by the constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring. It's long been assumed that all cells divide using the same molecular mechanism, but new evidence shows that cytokinesis regulation in individual cells has more variation than realized. In the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, each blastom has distinct fate, specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and drug, we identified cell-type variation in cytokinesis requirement for forminK-1-dependent filament-actin (F-act) cytoskeleton in one cell (P), this variation is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in another (EMS) variation is extrinsically regulated, dependent on Src-1 signaling and contact with neighbor cell P. Both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinesis in individual types and protect against division when contractile ring weakened.

We used thermogenetics, drug, and embryo dissection to probe mechanisms cell-type variation in cytokinesis among blastom within four-cell C elegans. Found cell-type differences in functional and temporal window formin-1 activity, not myosin-I activity during cytokinesis. Similar in one embryo, formin-1 ts embryos showed cell variation temporal requirement among blastom. Our analysis one-cell C elegans, cytokinesis failed 100% with formin-1 inactivation by thermal shift at any time before mid-constriction. We used fastacting temperature-sensitive alleles in two proteins contractile constriction one embryo: myos-II and diaphan formin. Identified cell-type variation four embryos molecular formin-1, not myos-II. Our data show both-intrinsic extrinsic mechanisms contribute cytokinesis promote robust when contractile weakened specific within four Cans. Each cell has unique identity and scored constriction during cytokinesis.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the flagellum, a whip-like structure on some bacteria, in releasing a molecule that triggers an immune response in the host. This molecule, called lipopolysaccharide, is found in the flagellar sheath, a membrane surrounding the flagellum. The study used a symbiosis between a bacterium Vibrio fischer and the Hawaiian bobtail squid to investigate the function of the flagellar sheath. They found that rotation of the sheathed flagum in both Vibrio fischer and its pathogenic relative Vibrio cholera releases lipyscharide. This challenges the idea that the sheath helps bacteria evade the host's immune response. Instead, it seems the sheath triggers an immune response. This finding has implications for understanding bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella and raises questions about the function of the flagellar sheath.

The researchers used the squid-bacterium symbiosis to study the effect of the flagellar sheath on host recognition. They found that rotation of the sheathed flagum in Vibrio fischer and its pathogenic relative Vib cholera releases lipyside. The flag sheath has been difficult to study, as there are no mutations that result in loss of sheath in sheathed flagella. The role of sheath, even in relation to motility, is poorly characterized. This new observation furthers understanding of the enigmatic sheath and its contribution to virulence.

Further work will build on these discoveries and clarify mechanisms of signaling during squid-bacter symbiosis. This includes characterizing composition of lipyside released by Vibrio during flag rotation, identifying squid receptors that recognize Vib lipide, and role of flagellin in host response. Reports of flag-mediated immunity have been limited to responses to protein flagin.
Researchers have discovered a process called chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in plants, where chromosomes break apart and reassemble in new ways. This can happen when two plants with different centromeres, which are like the center of the chromosome, mate. The broken chromosomes form a new, smaller version of the plant's genome, called a haploid. This can happen because of errors during cell division, called mitosis, which can lead to cancer. But it can also create new combinations of genes, which can be beneficial. The study used Arabidopsis plants, a type of plant, and found that this process happens when they mate with different centromes. The broken chromosomes form in a micronucleus, a small cell within a cell. Analysis showed that the breaks are fixed by a process called non-homous end joining (NHE) or fork repair. When NHE is blocked, more haploids are formed. This suggests that NHE plays a role in fixing the breaks. The study also found that the rearranged chromosomes can be stable, meaning they can be passed on to next generation. This provides a way to study how complex rearrangements happen, which are linked to human disorders.
Epstein-Barr Virus Ensures Cell Survival by Modulating Apoptosis at Early and Late After Infection

Epstein-Barr virus (EB) is linked to several human cancers, including lymphoma. The virus expresses proteins that promote cell growth and prevent apoptosis, or cell death. One of these proteins, LMP1, is critical for the survival of EB-immortalized cells. However, during early infection, EB causes rapid cell growth with low levels of L1 and little apoptosis. Researchers sought to understand how cells survive without L1/NF after infection. They used a technique called BH profiling to study the regulation of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, and found a change from normal cells to infected cells. This change is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on a protein called EB3.

EB3 regulates the BH profile of infected cells and suppresses apoptosis by moving a protein called M-1 to the mitochondria and increasing the transcription of another protein, B-1. Transcription of B-1 is also regulated by another EB protein, EB2, and L1-induced NF. The study found that human blood cells depend on a protein called B-2 for survival, while EB upregulates additional proteins to suppress apoptosis. EB-infected cells are less primed for apoptosis due to the combined effects of M-1 and B-2, with additional protection by-1 in immortal cells.

The viral protein L1 is thought to be responsible for apoptosis in latently infected cells, but the initial growth is driven by EB transcription factors in the absence of L1 or NF activity. The mechanism of EB3 enhancing M-1 function may provide insight into apoptosis during cell maturation and lymphoma. The phase of EB infection where EBAs are expressed with little L is known as latency II.
Plants produce special chemicals, called metabolites, to protect themselves from changing environments. These chemicals vary between and within species, but we don't fully understand how they arise and spread. Researchers studied 797 natural Arabidopsis thaliana plants to see how genetics, geography, environment, and population size influence these chemicals. They found that all three factors combine to create unique chemicals and their distribution. This suggests that genes controlling these chemicals have many versions, which can appear independently within the same species. This changes our understanding of how species adapt to their environments.

 Arabidopsis is a good model to study because its chemical pathway is known, including key genes for variation. Many studies focused on loss-of-function variants, but this study looked at gain-of-function variants. The high diversity of these genes raises questions how they pass through species boundaries. Brassica, a related plant, has similar variation creating same chemicals found in Arabid.

Understanding how genetics, environment, and population shape a trait in a species is key to evolution. This study used a family of chemicals, glucosinolates, in Arabid seeds to see how genetics, geography, and demography shape variation across Europe. The intersection of pressure, demography, and complexity creates metabolic variation in plants. To understand how genetics, demography, and environment shape metabolism, Arabid glucosolate pathway was used as a model.
Apoptotic caspases, long thought to be tumor suppressors, can also promote tumor growth under certain conditions. In Drosila, a well-studied neoplastic tumor model, oncogenic mutations in the proto-oncogene Ras (RasV12) keep cells in an 'ead-like state and turn caspases from suppressors into promotors. Instead of killing cells, casases generate intra- and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS recruit and activate macrophage-like cells, which signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK amplifies casase activity, creating a feedback loop. Interfering with the loop reduces neoplastic behavior and improves survival.

Research showed oncogenic Ras suppresses apoptotic casp activity, keeping Ras12 cells in 'ead-like. Casases induce apoptosis in few cells, but promote ROS for malignant growth and invasion. This extends previous models of E and JNK's switch from anti-tumor to pro-tumor roles by oncogenic and casases as essential components. Apoptotic casases are usually tumor suppressors, but under oncogenic conditions, like Ras12 in scri mutant cells, can be tumor-promoting.

Oncogenic Ras switches pro-apopt cas to tumor-prom and maintains Ras12 cells in 'ead-like. Inhibiting cas blocks growth and invasion. Tumor function of casases depends on intra and extracellular ROS for neop behavior of Ras12 clones. ROS activate hemocytes, J signaling and hyperplasia, similar to 'ead Ai model. E and J have proliferation and growth functions in this model, prompting investigation of ROS and cas for growth of Ras clones.
Researchers have found that people's perception of time during social interactions is influenced by their social skills and personality. When people who are good at interacting with others seem to experience time passing faster than those who are not. This effect is stronger in people who are less skilled at social interactions. The study suggests that oxytocin, a hormone involved in social behavior, plays a role in how we perceive time during social interactions. Oxytoc levels are lower in people with autism, a condition characterized by social difficulties. Administering oxyin to people with autism-like traits improved their social skills. Conversely, blocking oxyin in people who are good at social interactions reduced their ability to perceive time passing faster during interactions. These findings indicate that time is not always objective, but can be influenced by our personality and social skills. They also suggest oxyin is involved in how we perceive time during social interactions, supporting its role in social cognition.
Researchers studied how mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus affect its ability to bind to human cells. The virus uses a protein called Spike to attach to a receptor called ACE2 on the surface of cells. Mutations in the Spike protein can change how well it binds to ACE. Some of these mutations make the virus more contagious, while others help it evade the immune system. The study looked at five common mutations in the Spike protein and two in ACE. They found that most increased the virus's ability to bind to cells, except for one that made it weaker. The study suggests that some mutations make the virus more contagious, while others help it avoid the immune system.
Scientists have created a detailed map of how genes interact with each other in a type of cell called a metazoan cell. This map helps us understand how genes work together to create traits and how changes in genes affect development and disease. They used a technique called RNA interference and single-cell imaging to study 21 traits in fruit fly cells. The map includes 136 genes involved in important processes like signaling, DNA, cell division, and protein control. The researchers found that a key gene called Ras interacts with a complex that helps change DNA structure, an interaction also found in human cancer cells. This study provides a new way to understand how genes work together and how changes in genes affect traits.

The researchers used a combination of techniques to study how genes interact in fruit fly cells. They used RNA interference to turn off genes one at a time, then looked at how cells changed, and used computer models to understand how genes interact. They found 136 genes involved in key processes like signaling, DNA, cell division, and protein control. They also found that Ras, a gene involved in signaling, interacts with a complex that changes DNA structure. This interaction is also found in human cancer cells. The study shows a new way to understand how genes work together and how changes in genes affect traits.

The map is the largest of its kind, showing how genes interact in a cell. It helps understand how genes create traits and how changes affect development and disease. The study also found a link between Ras and a complex that changes DNA structure, an interaction also found in human cancer. This provides a new way to understand how genes work and how changes in genes affect traits.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the phenomenon of heterosty, a widespread adaptation that promotes outbreeding in plants, but its genetic and evolutionary origins remain poorly understood. In the Primula primrose, hetery is controlled by the S-loc supergene, which determines the arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between two morphs. However, the identities of the component genes were unknown. Researchers have now identified the Primula CYP50 gene, a putative brassinoster-degrading enzyme, as the locus that determines style dimorphism. CYP50 is present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, specifically expressed in S-m styles, and its loss leads to long styles. The gene arose by duplication in the Primaceae lineage and shows accelerated molecular evolution. The study provides a mechanistic explanation for Prim style dimorphism and sheds light on the evolution of the Sloc as a model for complex plant supergene.

The researchers found that CYP50 represents the locus in the Prim hetery super, whose expression in S styles causes brassoster degradation, limiting cell expansion and elongation. Evolutionarily, C50 arose via lineage-specific duplication and gain of style-specific expression. The proposed duplication and gain of style expression in the ancestor of Prim likely represents dominant-short mutation. C50 is an example of causal locus in super underlying adaptive polymorphism that opens understanding the origin of Prim Sloc as iconic complex.

The study sequenced transcriptomes of distantly related species and found C50 presence-absence polym strictly cosegregates with morph in heterous across Prim phylogeny, and is absent in all cases derived homy. With V results, strongly supports that C50 is the locus of hetery super that determines style polymorphism. Heter in Prim is controlled by Sloc super comprising tightly linked genes determining length, height, pollen, and intra-morph incompatibility.
Researchers have discovered that a specific group of neurons in the brain, called kisspein neurons, play a crucial role in puberty and fertility. These neurons, located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, release two types of peptides: kisspein and neurokinin B, which stimulate the release of gonadotrop-releasing hormone (GnRH). To understand how this process works, scientists used optogenetics, electrophysiology, pharmacology, and molecular biology to study mice. They found that high-frequency stimulation of kissin neurons causes the release of excitatory neurokin B and inhibitory dynorphin peptides, which synchronize the firing of kissin neurons. This synchronized activity excites GRH neurons through a mechanism involving glutamateric input to preoptic kiss neurons from kissin neurons. The researchers propose that kissin neurons drive episodic secretion of GRH through differential release of peptides and amino acids to coordinate reproductive function.

 Studies have shown that nerve fibers expressing kissin co-expressing kissin and neurokin B are in the median eminence of mice and rats. Activation of kiss neurons with optogen stimulation generates LH release in vivo, thought to be kissin-mediated depolarization of GR terminals. The study found high-frequency activation of kiss neurons induces N-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential, modulated by co-released dynin, and synchronization of kiss neurons. Activation of kiss neurons releases glutamate that excites rostral kiss neurons. Combination of synchronization and excitation of rostral neurons results in robust excitation of GRH.

Kissin neurons communicate with rostral neurons via glutamate, stimulating burst-firing of rostral neurons. Activation of rostral releases kissin robustly excites GR via G54 signaling, stimulating release of GR at preovulatory surge. Kissin, G54, neurokin B, Tac3, and GRH are required for normal fertility.
Researchers have long known that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) helps keep stem cells in a state called pluripotency, where they can become any cell type of cell. But how it does this happen is unclear. A new study found that BMP keeps plurip cells from differentiating by blocking the expression of a protein called Cdh, which is involved in early stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. Without Cdh, plurip cells can't differentiate, and blocking it rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. BMP also primes plurip cells for mesodermal differentiation, making them less likely to become neural cells. The study shows that differentiation is not just about external cues, but also internal signals that control how cells respond to those cues. A key pluripency signal, BMP, feeds into this mechanism by maintaining Cdh, which interferes with neural and mesermal differentiation. The study identifies loss of Cdh as a key event in early neural differentiation and proposes BMP controls differentiation by keeping Cdh. This strategy is used in development to coordinate tissue formation by changing cell adhesion and transcription. BMP also imposes a posterior identity on undifferentiated cells, making them more likely to become mesermal and less neural. The ability of BMP to protect pluripency and promote mesermal is explained by maintaining Cdh, which blocks neural and mesermal differentiation.
Researchers have discovered a protein called C120 that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of tiny structures called centrioles in cells. Centrioles are found in the center of cells and help form cilia, which are tiny hair-like extensions that help cells sense their environment. The researchers found that when C120 is missing, centri become abnormal and cilia don't form properly. This leads to problems with cell signaling and movement. The study shows that C120 helps keep centri in check by preventing them from maturing too quickly. Without C120, centri become overactive and cilia don't work right. This can lead to diseases like Jeune Thoracic Dystrophy and Joub syndrome.
In the developing retina, neurons and glial cells called Müller cells (MCs) play a crucial role in the formation of neural circuits, but little is known about how they communicate. Researchers investigated neuron-glia in the developing retina and found that retinal waves induce calcium signals in MCs. During cholinergic waves, MC signals were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine antagonists, while glutamaterg waves were blocked by ionotropic glutamate antagonists, indicating MCs respond to the neurotransmitter used in retinal waves. Using a glutamate sensor, the decline in MC signals was caused by a reduction in glutamate reaching MC. These studies show neurons and MC interact during a critical retinal maturation period enabled by neurotransmitter release from retinal synapses.

 Researchers used whole-cell recordings of retinal ganglion cells and two-photon imaging of glutamate sensors in MC to investigate neurotransmitters during retinal waves. They found retinal waves induce calcium signals in a large proportion of MC, demonstrating activity in both neuronal and glial networks at this age. The mechanism of interaction between neurons and MC is similar to previous findings in cortex and hippocampus, where cholin stimulation leads to astrocyte signals via musinic acetylcholine and IP3. Whether activity guides MC development is unclear. Physiological results show MC express multiple receptors, allowing control activity to be sustained as synchronization shifts from cholin to glutamg signaling. The proportion of MC responding decreased from P9 to P11, despite retinal waves. MC express glutamate and cholin receptors, signals at different ages could be evoked by neurotrans released retinal. Researchers explored which transmitters modulate neuron-MC at different ages.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the time of death, known as postmortem interval (PM), by studying the changes in microbial communities on a decomposing body. This method could be more accurate than existing techniques like forensic entomology, which can be off by days or months. In a mouse model, they found that microbial communities changed dramatically and predictably over 48 days, allowing for an estimate of PM within 3 days. This study provides insights into the microbial ecology of decomposition and the potential to use microbes as a tool for estimating PM.

The researchers tested the idea that microbes can be used as a "clock" to estimate PM by rigorously examining changes in communities over time. They sampled three external and one internal sites on 40 mouse corpses over 48 days, expanding on previous work that found consistent changes in skin and mouth bacteria over 5 days. Unlike previous studies, they didn't just fit data to all points, but provided a proof-of-principle that microbial ecology can be developed into a forensic tool for PM estimation.

In a lab experiment, they characterized microbial changes on mouse corpses decomposing in soil over 48. They used DNA sequencing to identify bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes in each sample.
Scientists have long known that animals with backbones, called bilaterians, share a set of genes that control their development. These genes, called Hox, help define the front-to-back axis of the body. Hox proteins work with other proteins called TALE to do this. But not all animals have H and TALE, so how did these interactions start? Researchers looked at single-celled and multi-celled organisms and found that H and TALE came from a common ancestor. They also found that H-T networks changed and added new parts that made Hox work differently in different body plans. This study shows how Hox families evolved to create a big patterning system in animals.

Hox genes are important for front-to-back body parts in all bilians. They help make body parts in the right place during development. Since they're so important, H genes likely helped make bilians look different during evolution. H networks rely on complex interactions, but came from a simple way that other home genes use. This study shows how H-T system was made step-by-step during animal evolution.

Some animals, like cnidarians, have H genes, but others like sponges and placozoans don't. This raises a question: how did H get its patter functions? In bilians, H works with P and Me proteins, also in other animals.
Researchers used super-resolution microscopy to study the movement of AMPA receptors, a type of neurotransmitter receptor, at the synapses, the connections between brain cells. They found that most of these receptors are stuck in small areas within the synapses, called nanodomains, for at least 15 minutes, and don't move around much. This is different from what was previously thought, where receptors were thought to be free to move in and out of the synapses. The researchers used tiny fluorescent probes, about 4 nanometers in size, attached to the receptors to track their movement. They observed 126 synapses and found that 90% of the receptors were in nanodomains, while 10% were outside the synapses. This was consistent with three different methods: using small probes, live neurons, and fixed neurons with regular fluorescent dyes. The researchers also found one nanomain per synapse, but some synapses had multiple nanodomains. The size of the probes affected the movement, with small probes showing mostly in synapses and large probes mostly outside. This suggests that large probes are too big for receptors to enter synapses.
Scientists have long sought to understand how neurons respond to a lack of oxygen, or hypoxia, which can lead to brain damage and death. A key part of this response is an increase in voltage-gated sodium current, or INa, but the mechanism behind this increase was unknown. Researchers found that hypia activates a pathway called SUMylation, which adds a small molecule called SUM1 to sodium channels, specifically Na1.2, in rat cerebellar granule neurons. This SUMylation increases INa by shifting the channels' sensitivity to voltage, allowing depolarizing steps to evoke larger sodium currents. The study suggests that the SUM pathway and Na1.2 are potential targets for interventions to protect against brain damage from hypia. The researchers tested this by mutating Na.2 channels, applying a deSUMylating enzyme, and blocking sodium channels with a toxin, all of which prevented SUMylation and IN increase. They also found that hypia SUMylation of Na.2 occurs quickly, within 40 seconds, and is not dependent on sodium flux. Under normal conditions, SUM1 and a deSUMylating enzyme, SEN1, control IN. The study implies that SUMylation of Na.2 channels at the plasma membrane underlies the increase in IN in response to hypia. The findings suggest that Na.2 and SUM enzymes may be valuable targets to reduce damage from acute hypia to neurons.
Researchers have developed a model to understand how temperature affects the spread of Ross River virus, a mosquito-borne disease found in Australia and the Pacific Islands, and potentially emerging worldwide. They found that the virus transmission peaks at moderate temperatures around 26.4°C and declines at high and low temperatures 17.0 and 31.5°C. This means the disease is likely to be present year-round in tropical areas but seasonal in temperate regions, leading to a seasonal peak in human cases. Climate change is expected to increase transmission in temperate areas where most people live, but decrease in tropical areas where temperatures are already near the optimal.

The study highlights the importance of understanding temperature's role in disease dynamics and predicting climate change. As the climate warms, it's crucial to know how temperature affects mosquito-borne diseases, especially new ones spreading globally. The researchers used data from two mosquito species to create a temperature-dependent model for Ross River virus transmission. The results show a general pattern of optimal transmission at intermediate temperatures, driven by mosquito lifespan, but uncertain upper and lower limits vary by vector-pathogen systems.

The biggest impact of temperature on disease is seen in temperate regions where temperature varies rapidly. If temperatures are above or below the optimal, temperature's effect may be masked in models that assume linear responses. Upper limits of mosquito-borne transmission, a concern for climate change, are determined by vector traits like lifespan and thermal performance, not rate-based traits like biting or pathogen development.
Researchers have long studied beta oscillations in the motor cortex, but the connection between these brain waves and movement is not fully understood. To investigate this, scientists recorded brain activity from macaques while they performed a task that required them to bring their beta oscillations to a certain state and then move their arm. The results showed that when beta power decreased, movement started faster, and when it increased, movement was slower. This suggests that beta oscillations are linked to neural patterns that slow down movement.

A similar shift in brain activity was seen during natural reaching tasks, indicating that beta is a common signature of spiking patterns in different contexts. This study ties together previous findings on beta's behavioral correlates with how the motor cortex encodes movement through population-level activity.

Increasing and decreasing motor beta power with neurofeedback precedes slower and faster movement times, supporting the hypothesis that beta is linked to patterns that slow new movements (Gilbertson et al, 2005). Results add to findings of elevated power before and after trained movements (Donoghue et al,199; Mur and Fetz,199; Sanes Donue,199). The effect of neuro-induced beta matches a movement-slow role of beta during natural movements (Gilbert et al,200), but unit responses during beta were different across tasks.

The motor population activity shifts from a threshold when subjects produce beta in the task or naturally produce in the task. Mechanisms of beta used to reconcile discrepancies in reported correlates of activity. Units showed different activity during neuro-induced beta compared to natural oscillations, but population analyses show beta promotes a movement-slow state in both tasks, matching behavior.
Researchers have found that a protein called TRAF2 plays a crucial role in regulating the immune system's response to inflammation and cell death in the skin. Without TR2, mice die at birth, so its role in adult tissues is not well understood. The function of TR2's RING, a part of the protein, is disputed. Some say it can't work as an enzyme, while others claim it needs a helper called sphingosine-1, made by an enzyme sphingos kinase 1, to function. Deleting TR2 in skin cells, but not sph1, disrupts tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling and causes skin inflammation like psoriasis. This inflammation is driven by TN, cell death, and the immune system, and could be a model for psoriasis. TR2 has specific functions that don't overlap with sph1.

In cells, TR2 absence delays TN-activated NF and MAP, and makes cells more sensitive to TN. Without TR in skin, ps-like inflammation and hyperplasia occurs. Unlike other inflammatory skin conditions, deleting TN and NF genes reverses this. Our results show TR protects skin cells from death and downregulates responses, and intrinsic skin defects can initiate psoriasis. TR2 keratinocytes don't need bacteria to produce TN, and TN sets a cycle of inflammation. Deleting TN with TR breaks this cycle and prevents apoptosis and ps-like onset. Keratinocytes from wild-type, TR2KO, and sph1- mice were tested, and TN signaling was delayed in TR2, but not sph1. TR2, but not sph1, were sensitive to TN-induced death and had reduced cIPL and caspase. Without TN, TR2 keratin still produce inflammatory via non-canonical NF that causes ps-like in mice but slower. These cytokines recruit immune cells, neutrophils and IF cells.
Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are tiny sacs that store and release neurotransmitters at synapses. When they release their contents, their membranes are quickly taken back in by the cell through a process called endocytosis and recycled to form new, ready-to-use SVs. Researchers have long thought that a protein called clathrin plays a key role in this process. However, a new study found that clrin is not as important as previously thought. Instead, two other proteins, dynamin 1 and 3, are not needed for endocyt to happen. In fact, without them, endoc happens more often. The study also found that clrin is not needed for new SVs to form from the recycled membranes. This suggests a new way for SVs to be made that doesn't need clrin or dyn 1 and 3, and happens during intense activity.

SVs store and release neurotransmitters at synapses. After release, their membranes are taken back in by endocyt and made into new SV. Clrin was thought to be key in this process, but the study found it's not as important as thought. Dyn 1 and 3 are not needed for endoc, and without them, it happens more often. Clrin is not needed for new SV to form from recycled membranes. This suggests a new way for SV to be made that doesn't need cl or dyn 1 and 3, and happens during intense activity.
Researchers have been searching for a reliable way to measure the effects of glucocorticoids, a type of medication used to treat a variety of conditions, but no biomarker has been found. A new study aimed to identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucortic action. Ten people with primary adrenal insufficiency, a rare disorder, were studied during glucortic exposure and withdrawal in a randomized, single-blind trial. No serious side effects were reported. Blood, fat tissue, and plasma samples were analyzed using multiomic analysis. A transcript profile from two tissues and multiomic cluster was found to predict glucortic exposure. MicroRNA (mi-122p) correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucortic exposure was identified and replicated in independent studies. Results provide basis for discovery of biomarkers to measure glucortic effects, allowing individualize therapy and shed light on disease related to unphysiological glucortic exposure, such as cardiovascular disease and obesity.

A clinical study identified genes, microRNAs, and metabolites differently expressed during gluc exposure and withdrawal in subjects with Addison's disease. Multiomic data showed coherence and analysis identified transcript and metabolites correlated. Association between mi-122p and gluc exposure was replicated in three studies. A clinical setting was chosen for biomarker discovery due to absent or low endogenous gluc production in Addison disease. A multiomic strategy combined gene expression in blood, adipose tissue, and circulating microRNAs and metabolites to identify biomarkers. Strongest biomarkers were replicated in groups with different gluc exposure.

A transcript profile was found under gluc regulation in blood and adipose, validated by published data. MicroRNA mi-122p correlated with transcript and metabolome, suggesting first role in gluc action. Two subjects did not show mi-122p response, one man and one woman, both experienced fatigue during withdrawal.
Amino acids play a crucial role in activating the mTORC1 complex, a key regulator of cell growth and metabolism. To understand how this process, researchers used live imaging to track the movement of mTOR1, a component of the complex, in response to amino acids. They found that mTOR1 quickly moves to lysosomes, the cell's recycling centers, within 2 minutes of amino addition and peaks within 5 minutes. This movement is linked to the appearance of amino in lysosomes and is sustained compared to amino stimulation. Two proteins, Sestr2 and vacuolar ATPase, are negative regulators of mTOR1 activity in this system. Phosphorylation of m1's targets is delayed compared to its movement to lysosomes, suggesting m1 passes through the lys surface before targeting its substrates.

 Researchers used a fluorescent analogue of amino, leucine, to image m1 movement in response to the compound. Leuc is a key activator of m1 and has been shown to accumulate in lysosomes and activate m1 on its own. They tested a series of leuc analogues for m1 activation and found lysosomes are crucial for activation but the process may be more complex than thought. They expressed m1 subunits with GFP to follow localization in live cells and used a leuc analogue with a fluorescent moiety to continuously accumulate in lysosomes. This provided a dynamic view of m1 response to amino.

The study supports that amino activate m1 in the cell and multiple types may be involved. For example, leuc is sensed by Sestr1/2 while arginine entering lysosomes via SLC38 is also important for m1 activation.
Scientists have discovered that adding a specific sugar molecule called Lewis X (Le) to a protein antigen called Ovalbumin (OVA) changes how it is processed inside immune cells called dendritic cells. This affects how the immune system responds to the antigen, making it more likely to trigger a certain types of immune cells called CD4 and CD8 T cells. Normally, high amounts of antigen and signals from the immune system called TLR are needed for CD8 cells to be triggered, but adding Le to VA reduces the amount needed by 100 times and eliminates the need for TLR signals. The study found that a receptor called M1 (M1) on dendritic cells is key to this process, as mice without M1 had fewer CD8 cells. The antigen was stored in special compartments inside cells for a long time before being processed, but still triggered CD8 cells without needing special transporters or Cathein-S. This shows that adding sugars to antigens can change how they are processed and how strong the immune response is, which could be useful for making better vaccines.
Researchers have discovered that the bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis uses its quorum sensing system to regulate hundreds of genes, including those involved in cell-to-cell communication. They found that the Type VI secretion system (TSS) is activated by quorum sensing in B. thailandensis and is necessary to restrict the growth of quorum mutants. When grown together in a colony, quorum mutants are outcompeted by wild-type B. thailand, but in broth, quorum mutants have an advantage due to a metabolic cost associated with quorum gene activation. The fitness of wild-type over quorum mutant in agar growth depends on an intact TSS apparatus. Quorum sensing activates TSS growth inhibition, which serves to police quorum mutants. This is a novel role for TSS in intraspecies control.

 Studies show that QS of TSS-mediated toxicity and immunity allows competent B. thensis to police quorum mutants. During planktonic growth in broth, TSS does not function due to limited contact, quorum mutants have a fitness over wild-type. A mechanism is described by which wild populations mitigate the cost of quorum regulation by hindering growth of mutants via cell-dependent toxin and immunity proteins. This is a form of microbial policing, where QS-competent outcompete populations of signal non-operators in absence of T cell growth system.

Policing of deviants in Myxoccus and Pseudomonas has been reported. A novel mechanism is described for limiting quorum growth in groups. Functions have been ascribed to T. thensis TSS-mediated killing is against Proteobacteria other than thensis, important for interspecies competition. A control demonstrates TSS-mediated does not occur in liquid cocultures. Results are of at least biological replicates.
Researchers studied how the connection between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex develops in the brain of newborn mice. They found that the hippocampus sends signals to the prefrontal cortex, causing it to oscillate at a specific frequency. This connection is important for learning and memory. The researchers used a technique to turn on and off specific neurons in the hippocampus to see how it affects the prefrontal cortex. They found that a specific part of the hippocampus, the intermediate/ventral, sends strong signals to the prefront cortex, causing it to oscillate. This is different from another part of the hippocampus, the dorsal, which sends weaker signals. The researchers also found that the prefront cortex is connected to the intermediate/vent part of the hippocampus through direct connections between neurons. When they turned on the neurons in the intermediate/vent part of the hippoc, it caused the prefront to oscillate. This shows that the hippocampus, specifically the intermediate/vent part, drives the connection between the two brain areas. This is important for understanding how the brain develops and how we learn and remember.

Researchers have discovered a new way that RNA polymerase II, an enzyme crucial for making RNA, is modified early in mammalian cells. This modification, called methylation, marks specific lysine residues on RNA polymerase II's C-terminal domain. Methylation of lysine-7 (K7) and di-methylation of lysine-7 (Kme2) occur during the earliest stages of transcription, before phosphorylation of serine-5 and serine-7. In contrast, acetylation of lysine-7 (Kac) is associated with productive elongation, ser-2 phosphorylation, and mRNA expression.

RNA polymerase II binds to promoters in a hypophosphorylated state, then becomes phosphorylated at ser-5 and ser-7, marking early stages of transcription. Productive elongation is characterized by increase phosphorylation of ser-2 throughout gene bodies. Researchers created antibodies to detect CTD-Kme and C-Kme and found these modifications precede or accompany phosphorylation of ser-5 and ser- upstream of ser-2. Biochemical and genome-wide approaches showed C-K methylation present at promoters of productively transcribed genes, but earliest stages of transcription.

Mutation of C-K residues is compatible with viability of mouse fibroblasts, suggesting ser phosphorylation and RNAI localization independent of presence or absence K residues. Acetylation of C-K residues associated with inducible expression. Detection of Kme and K2 increased with number K residues in mammalian C cell lines, flanked different amino acids. Mono and diethylation of C-K residues detected in hypophosphory (faster-migr) forms RNAI, suggesting methylation associated early stages transcription.

Results suggest productive transcription at genes with RNAI recruitment promoters modulated level C-K modifications, methylation associated less transcription, K acylation highest expressed genes.
Skeletal muscle cells, also known as satellite cells, play a crucial role in muscle repair and regeneration. When muscle is injured, these cells exit their quiescent state, proliferate, and self-renew to replenish the population. To understand how they maintain quiescence, researchers studied gene expression changes in satellite cells after injury. They found transcripts encoding RNA-binding proteins, including Tristetrolin, were significantly changed. Tristrol promotes decay of MyD mRNA, which encodes a transcription factor for myogenic commitment, by binding to its 3' untranslated region. Upon activation, p38/β MAPK phosphorylates and inactivates Tristrol, stabilizing MyD mRNA. Knocking down Tristrol in satellite cells preciously activates them, enabling MyD accumulation and fusion into myofibers. Regulation by Tristrol is a critical post-transcription mechanism controlling satellite homeostasis.

MyD upregulates its own transcription, injury triggering a feed-forward loop driving commitment to myoblasts. Researchers propose Tr may also downregulate MyD and other transcripts in myoblasts during quies population formation or reacquisition following injury. Muscle regeneration requires cells to exit quies but also renew quies population upon completion. They propose Tr suppresses transcripts for exit quies as a mechanism. Upon injury, pαβ MAP is activated, phosphorylating Tr.

Tristrol is present in quies cells, rapidly inhibited by pαβ MAP within minutes of activation, and reduces MyD half-life. Losing Tr from muscle preciously activates cells, promoting MyD expression and aberrant cycle. pαβ-dependent phosphorylation of Tr suggests Tr role in quies. Tr inactivating MyD is consistent with hypothesis suppressing proogenic targets.
Infants with a defect in the interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10) develop a severe inflammatory bowel disease early in life. Researchers wanted to know if IL-10 regulates the function of a type of immune cell called macrophage in the gut during infancy and if macroage-intrinsic IL-10 signaling is necessary to prevent colitis. They found that IL-10 deficient mice did not show signs of colitis in the first two weeks of life, but developed inflammation and macrophage dysfunction in the third week of life, when they started weaning and their gut bacteria changed. IL-10 did not directly affect the type of bacteria in the gut. However, depleting macrophages prevented colitis in IL-10 deficient mice, while lacking IL-10 on macrophages made them more prone to colitis. The study shows that IL-10 regulates macroage function in early life to prevent colitis in mice.
Researchers have identified a protein called SIM-1 in the nematode worm Caenorhabitis elegans that plays a crucial role in the production of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). These siRNAs are involved in regulating transposons and germline genes, which are essential for the worm's development and reproduction. The researchers found that SIM-1 acts as a bridge between the piRNA pathway and the mutator complex, which produces siRNAs from pi-targeted mRNAs. SIM-1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci near P-granules and Mutator foci, which are sites of pi-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. This suggests that multiple perinuclear condates are involved in organizing the pi pathway and promoting regulation by the mut complex.

The study shows that SIM-1 is required for the step between pi pathway and mut complex. It may function similarly to a protein in Drosophila that coordinates Ago and Aubine during piRNA biogenesis. SIM- localizes to cytoplasmic foci near P-gran and Mut, implicating distinct peruclear condates in regulation by the pi pathway and mut complex. This work identifies SIM- as a factor that mediates production of siRN by mut complex and suggests a role for peruclear condates to promote regulation by pi and mut.

In C elegans, a RNA amplification pathway dependent on mut includes an RNA-dependent polymer that synthesizes secondary siRN from pi-target mRN to trigger heritable silencing. Several proteins localize or near P-gran, including GL-1-2-3-4, DDX-19, L-14, and VB-1. One of these could serve a function to DE-12, shuttling pi-target mRN into SIM- and Mut foci.
Researchers studied the behavior of Purkin neurons in zebraf larvae, which are crucial for cerebellar function, to determine if they exhibit bistability in awake animals. They recorded intracellularly from Purkin neurons in unanhetized larval zraf and found bistability, with tonic firing at depolarized and bursting at hyperpolar membrane potentials. Purkin neurons could switch between states spontaneously or with current injection. Activation of AMP receptors by climbing fibers was sufficient to trigger bursts, while GABA and NMDA receptors were not required. Recording Purkin membrane potential and motor spikes showed initiation correlated with increased EPs and depolarization. Bistability was observed after Purkin specification and persisted until late larval stages.

The researchers also found two types of glutamateric excitation in Purkin neurons: strong from climbing fibers and weak from parallel fibers, mediated by AMP receptors. They demonstrated bistability in Purkin neurons of zraf larvae, which has been reported in vitro in mammals and under anesthesia in rodents. They recorded Purkin neurons from larval zraf from 4 to 19 days post-fertilization to study intracellular dynamics in the context of fictive motor output. Bist may be a property of developing network and not present in mature cerebellum.

The study shows zraf Purkin exhibit bist in vivo dependent on AMP-mediated inputs. Based on cerebell conservation, bist may be conserved from fish to mammals. Purkin can be in tonic or bursting mode and toggle between states. Intracellular recordings confirmed spikes were sodium-dependent, broad were calcium-mediated, and large events were EPs.
Researchers have discovered how the actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process by which cells take in substances from their surroundings. They found that a branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endytic pits against membrane tension. Around 200 Arp/3 complexes are required for robust internalization. A new counting method showed ~200 Arp/3 complexes assemble at clrin endocytic sites in human cells. Simulations predicted actin self-organizes into a branched array with ends towards the base of the pit. Actin filaments bend between the coat and base of the pit. Energy stored in bent filaments contributes to endytic internalization. Elevated tension directs filaments towards the base, increasing actin nucleation and force production.

The researchers used a multiscale model combining continuum mechanics and filament simulations to study actin polymerization and endytic internalization. They found a minimal actin network of act, Arp/3, and capping protein with attachments can generate force to internalize pits against mammalian membrane tension. The model showed a branched actin is sufficient for sustained internalization against physiological tension. Actin self-organization and bending allow the network to adapt to changing loads. The study found ~200 Ar/3 molecules accumulate at clrin endytic sites over time. Incorporating this into the model, simulations showed actin self-organizes around the pit and generates force.
Researchers have discovered a new insights into the process of macropocytosis, a mechanism that allows cells to take in large amounts of extracellular liquid into vesicles. They found that macropocytic cups in Dictyostelium, a type of amoeba, are organized around patches of intense PIP3 and active Ras signaling molecules. These patches are associated with a ring of active SCAR at the periphery, which drives the formation of the macinocytic cup. The ring of SCAR is thought to be recruited by the patch and drives a ring of actin to extend the walls of the macinocytic cup.

Using 3D light microscopy, researchers mapped the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators such as SC and WASP with respect to signaling molecules P3 and Ras. This led to a new hypothesis that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP, which recruit a ring of actinators to the periphery.

Macropomes develop from cup-shaped projections of the plasma membrane, driven by actin polymerization. They contain a central patch of activated Ras and P3 throughout their life. In Dictyostelium, this patch is associated with a ring of active SC at the edge. The ring of SC is thought to be recruited by the patch and drives a ring of actin to extend the walls of the macinocytic cup.

Researchers also found that macinocytic cups can form by splitting from existing ones. The actin in new macinomes is associated with signaling molecules, such as Ras. Circular ruffles can persist on the surface for periods before closing or regressing into the body. Closure can be abrupt, involving inward collapse of the rim.
Scientists have long known that a protein complex called cohesin plays a crucial role in holding together newly replicated sister chromatids until they separate during cell division. A separate complex called S2/S4 is responsible for loading cohes onto DNA and determining its location across the genome. Proper cohes loading is essential for cell division, and defects can lead to chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcription, causing developmental issues in multicellular organisms. Researchers have now determined the structure of S4 bound to a fragment of S2 and found that S4 determines cohes localization through a conserved patch on its surface. This shows S4 targets cohes loading to a specific genomic location, separate from its role in establishing sisterid cohesion across the genome.

 Studies in yeast demonstrate that a conserved patch on S4 surface is required to recruit S2 to centromeres and pericentere. The findings reveal the role of S4 in determining cohes localization and establish a basis for S2 recruitment to centrom. The structure of S4 bound to S2 shows that S4 is a TPR array that envelops an extended S2 peptide. TPR stands for tetratricopeptide repeat, a type of protein structure that recognizes and binds to other proteins. This interaction between S4 and S2 is crucial for cohes loading to centrom and pericere.

Experiments in yeast show that perturbation of conserved patch on S4 eliminates centrom localization of S2 in mitotic cells and reduces association of cohes subunit S1 with centrom and pericere, but not chromosome arms. This pattern of S2 localization is also seen in cells progressing through S phase, the stage where cohes loading is initiated. The pathway that targets cohes to centrom requires S4 residues, some of which are invariant across eukaryotes, suggesting S4-dependent cohes targeting is a feature of co loading control.
Being born late in the active season can have significant effects on growth, fattening, winter survival, and reproduction in hibernators. A study on garden dormice (Eliomys quinus) found differences in growth, fattening, energetic responses, winter survival and fecundity between early-born (EB) and late-born (LB) juveniles. LB juveniles grew and gained mass twice as fast as EB individuals. Torpor use was low during growth, first weeks of mass gain, but increased pre-hibern fattening. LB showed higher tor use, reached similar sizes but lower fat than EB before hibern. Finally, LB showed similar hibernation patterns but higher proportion breeders following year EB dormice.

The study hypothesized that LB dormice grow and fatten higher due to higher tor use, reach preibern levels size but lower fat, leading differences hibern patterns mass over compared EB. LB and food availability ad-lib vs intermittently fast on growth preibern fatt, use energy strategies daily tor, size fat prior hibern, overwinter patterns mass, and fecity spring female dormice. This aligns with findings common dormice two litters year, no winter differences EB LB detected (Bieber et al, 2012). Preibern reserves LB sufficient fuel shorter hibern due five-week delay start.

Extensive tor use incompatible growth supports preibern fatt late preservation reserves previously deposited prior hibern, especially EB higher reserves prior hibern compared LB. LB delayed onset hibern five weeks. This case gardenice grow twice fast EB, lower prior hibern (Stfel et,201). One strategy lower energy minimize challenges tor daily (Ruf et,199).
Scientists have long known that a type of enzyme called ADAR plays a crucial role in editing genes in animals, including humans, by changing adenosine to inosine in RNA and binding to regulatory elements in RNAs. However, the loss of ADAR affects neuronal function in all animals studied to date, including the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. Researchers wanted to identify critical AD targets in C. elegans, so they analyzed the effects of ADR-2, the A-to editing enzyme in C. elegans, on the neural transcriptome. They used software SAIL to identify 736 A-to editing events across the neural transcript and intersected it with ADR-2 associated gene changes, revealing edited mRNA cle-41, whose expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring cle-41 in ADR deficient cells rescued the chemotaxis defect, providing evidence that phenotypes of AD mutants can be caused by altered gene expression. This is the first study to link a phenotype with loss of C eleg AD enzymes to editing regulation of a specific gene.
Influenza A virus (IAV) uses a strategy called host shutoff to repress cellular mRNA translation and allow efficient translation of viral mRNAs. Researchers used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to explore how IAV induces shutoff. They found that viral mRNAs are preferentially translated, while cellular protein synthesis declines due to viral takeover of the mRNA pool. The study also showed variability in levels of cellular reduction, revealing short mRNAs are less affected by IAV. mRNAs refractory to IAV are enriched in maintenance processes like oxidative phosphorylation. Continuous phosphorylation is important for viral propagation. The study advances understanding of IAV-induced shutoff and suggests a mechanism for translation of genes with housekeeping functions.

The analysis showed viral translation efficiencies within host range, indicating viral mRN are preferentially translated during IAV. Co-opting of machinery does not play dominant role in gene shutoff. Instead, sh stems from viral dominance over mRNA. At 8 hours post-infection, viral mRN take 53% of translation activity, while 57% mRNAs are viral. The results are consistent with NS not required for sh of host protein production. To access host machinery, viruses use sh mechanisms that eliminate competition from transcripts. Sh could be achieved by two mechanisms: coing machinery to force viralRN better than host. Poliovirus employs this strategy. At 8 hours, viral mRN take 58% of activity, 57% mRN are viral. The findings show reduction in mRNA is main cause sh during infection. Analysis concurs PA endonuc activity dominant in sh during IAV.
Scientists have long known that gradients of signaling proteins are crucial for the development of tissues and organs. However, how these gradients are formed has been a mystery. Researchers studied the distribution of a protein called FGF in fruit flies, which guides the formation of air sacs in the wing. They found that FGF moves from its source to the air sac through tiny tubes called cytonemes that extend from the sac to the wing disc. The number of these tubes decreases with distance from the source, creating a specific gradient of F. F acts as a signal in the air sac, activating genes at different levels depending on its concentration. Two genes, Pointed and Cut, work together to regulate the number of cyton tubes, creating regions with more or fewer tubes. This mechanism shows how proteins can self-generate precise gradients through feedback regulation of cyton dispersion.
Scientists have long understood the structure of α-helical coiled coils, a common protein fold that can be described with parametric equations, allowing for precise manipulation. However, researchers have discovered a new type of fiber by inserting two or six residues into the hept repeat of a parallel trimeric coiled coil. This insertion strains the coil, causing the formation of short strands that move 120 degrees around the trimer axis, resulting in an α/β coiled structure retaining one backbone bond from the parent coil. This novel structure is possible within Ramachand space with minor mutations to known folds.

α-hel coiled coils are found in various structures and functions, first described in atomic detail in 1953. Their parametric equations make them a focus of design efforts. Despite understanding, insertions of 2 and 6 residues, causing strain on α-hical geometry, were unclear. Researchers found they break α-hices to form β strands, a triangular superstructure called β-layer. Removing α-hical residues, a minimal αβ coiled with single bond remains is possible. This structure consists of hexads, three in β and three α regions of Ramand plot.

β-layers occur in coiled, forming fibers with alternating α and β structure, a new fold. The first β-layer is a 6-residue hex, after hept position, biased towards c, like T and T structures. Alternating α and β-layers, αβ coiled is a novel fiber based on superstructure.
Scientists have been trying to understand the role of a protein called epsin in a process called endocytosis, where cells take in substances from outside their environment. Endocytosis is crucial for cell function and survival. Epsin is a protein that helps in this process, but its exact function was unclear. Researchers created mice without eps to study its role. Without eps, cells had trouble dividing and couldn't take in substances properly. They found that eps helps the actin, a protein that gives shape to cells, and clath, a protein that helps take in substances, work together. Without eps, clath and actin didn't work well together, leading to shallow pits that couldn't become deep enough to take in substances. Eps also interacts with other proteins that help vesicles fuse with membranes, but its main role is in early stages of clath formation.
A study in Uganda investigated the risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren aged 5-17 years in urban areas. The researchers conducted a case-control study among 555 cases and 111 controls, where asthma was diagnosed by clinicians. The main risk factors for asthma were:

* Tertiary education for fathers (adjusted OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.71-3.16) and mothers (1.85, 1.38-2.48)
* Area of residence at birth: children born in small towns or cities had a higher risk compared to those born in rural areas (2.16, 1.60-2.92) and (2.79,1.79-4.35)
 Father and mother's history of asthma
Children's own allergic conditions and atopy
Cooking with gas/electricity

The study found a strong association between asthma and a rural-city gradient, higher socio-economic status, and urbanicity. Children born in towns and cities had a higher risk of asthma, especially if they had other risk factors such as parental history of allergic disease, own atopy, and higher socio-economic status. This study provides a basis for future research on environmental and lifestyle factors increasing asthma risk in urban areas of low-middle income countries.
Researchers have discovered that two specific proteins, connexins 41.8 and 39.4, play a crucial role in forming patterns on the bodies of zebraf fish. These proteins are part of gap junctions, which allow cells to communicate with each other. Mutations in one of these proteins, connex 41.8, cause spotted patterns to appear on the fish. A new mutation, leot3, leads to a complete loss of pattern, suggesting it has a negative effect on another component of gap junctions. The researchers found this component to be connex 39.4. Without it, the fish cannot form patterns, but their fins are not affected. Experiments showed that connex 41.8 and 39.4 form heteromeric gap junctions, meaning they work together in some cells but not others. This interaction between melanoph and xanthoph cells instructs patterning of iridoph cells. Fish without connex 41.8 and 39.4, melanoph and xanth cells cluster together, but irid cells expand. This suggests connex 41.8 and 39.4 promote homotyp interactions between melanoph and xanth, and instruct patterning of irid.
Insects use their sense of smell, or olfaction, to detect a wide range of behaviorally important molecules. Different animal groups, or phyla, have distinct families of genes involved in olfaction. Insects, specifically, use olfactory receptors (OR) or ionotropic receptors (IR) and sometimes gustatory receptors (GR) to detect volatile molecules. While IRs are found in olfactory organs across Protostomia, OR have been thought to be an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle. Researchers investigated the olfactory system of three insects: the wingless bristail Lepachilis signata (Archaeognatha), the firebrat Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma), and the neopter leaf Phyllium sifium (phasoda). They found that OR and the olfactory coreceptor (Or) are likely lacking in Lepachilis, Thermobia have three Orco candidates, and Phium has a fully developed OR/Or system. This suggests OR did not arise as an adaptation to terrestrial, but evolved later in insect evolution, with Or being present before ORs.

The study focused on neopter insects, a group that includes butterflies, beetles, and flies. The identity of receptors involved in olfaction in ancient insects is unknown. The data suggests Orco evolved after the brail split from its common ancestor with other insects. However, an olfactory system using OR and Or evolved after emergence of wings. Insects use OR and Or as heteromers, composed of one ligand-specific OR and Or. This allows them to detect volatile chemicals.

The study selected insects at crucial positions on the phylogenetic tree with olfactory adapted to terrestrial conditions. These species provide a model to study early evolution of the olfactory system. To identify receptors involved in detection, researchers used several approaches. Neopter insects recognize stimuli by OR family. OR are multitransmembrane proteins unrelated to vertebrate olfactory, displaying distinct topology.
Malaria, a life-threatening disease caused by Plasmodium falciparum parasite, has decreased globally over the past decade, but still poses a major challenge for elimination efforts. One way to combat this is mass administration of antimalarial drugs (DA) to entire populations. However, success depends on adequate participation. Researchers studied four villages in Myanmar where DA was implemented and found that neighborhoods with low DA adherence had 2.85 times the odds of malaria episodes post-DA compared to those with high adherence, suggesting a herd effect. High mosquito rates, living with someone with malaria, or having asymptomatic infection also predicted episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence in villages with high overall participation may hinder elimination.

The study aimed to examine herd effect and impact of non-adherence to DA on P. falcum malaria. There was a group effect from DA, evident from three lines of evidence: clinical episodes decreased among all for longer than prophylactic effect of antimal drugs. The study included four villages along Myanmar-Thailand border in Kayin State, Myanmar. Villages selected based on falc malaria prevalence using ultrasensitive PCR and part of DA study. falc episode, adjusting individual DA and other predictors, having episode. This is first documentation of herd effect by DA for falc malaria. Clinical episodes postDA corresponded to increase in village mosquito biting rates.

The study found that individuals from neighborhoods with low DA had 2.85 times the odds of malaria postDA compared to those with high adherence, regardless of individual participation. High mosquito rates, living with someone with malaria, or asymptomatic infection also predicted episodes. Spatial clustering of nonherence in villages with high participation may frustrate elimination efforts.
Scientists have long believed that the diversity of body shapes and forms in animals, known as morphology, is largely due to differences in how genes are turned on and off in different parts of the body. This can be achieved by changes in the DNA sequences that control gene expression, called cis-regulatory elements, or by altering the proteins that bind to these elements, called transcription factors (TFs). However, the importance of the latter has been hard to assess because previous studies of TF binding specificity have used different methods in different species. To address this, researchers determined the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila (fruit fly) TFs and compared them to humans and mice. They found that TF specificities are highly conserved between fruit flies and mammals, and for matching TFs, the similarity extends to the level of subtle nucleotide preferences. This suggests that evolution of TF specificities contributes to emergence of new types of cells.

A striking level of conservation of TF specificity was observed, with flies having almost as complex a repertoire of binding motifs as humans. Conservation extended to modes of binding and subtle preferences, suggesting TF specificities are not subject to substantial drift. Researchers used a method called HT-LEX to determine TF specificities in Dophila melanogaster. They found that TFs with divergent specificities have different roles in cell types, suggesting evolution of specificities contributes to emergence of novel cells.

Drosila has many genes orthologs to human genes with conserved DB protein sequences, even though species diverged 600 million years ago. Researchers found that ortholog TFs have identical DNA profiles, flanking sequences, and modes of binding.
Researchers have developed a new way to grow both heart and lung tissue from human stem cells at the same time. This is important because the heart and lung talk to each other during development and need to work together properly. They used a type of stem cell called induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) that can become many different types of cells. They added special signals to the cells to make them become heart and lung cells at the same time. The cells grew in 3D shape and formed a small heart and lung together. When they stopped adding the signal, the heart and lung separated and started to work on their own. This is a new way to study how heart and lung work together during development in the womb.
Scientists have long believed that the rate at which an organism's DNA changes, or mutates, is a slow and unchanging trait. However, a new research shows that this is not always the case. In certain situations, such as when an organism is under stress, the mutation rate can increase rapidly. This is known as hypermutation. A study on the bacteria Escheria coli found that when exposed to high levels of ethanol, the mutation rate increased to help the bacteria adapt to the stress. However, once the bacteria adapted, the mutation rate decreased. The researchers found that the main reason for this change in mutation rate was the death of cells that were not able to survive the stress. This study sheds new light on how organisms balance between being able to change and being stable. It also helps explain why some bacteria become resistant to antibiotics and cancer cells become resistant to chemotherapy. The study used a model of bacteria exposed to high levels of ethanol to understand the dynamics of hypermutation. The researchers found that multiple mutations interacted to help the bacteria adapt to the stress. They also found that hypermutation states are temporary and decrease once the bacteria are adapted. The study identified cellular death as the main driver of the change in mutation rate.
Researchers have discovered a key player in how plants respond to low energy conditions, a protein called bZIP63, which is regulated by a kinase called SnRK1. This kinase is part of a group of enzymes that help animals and plants adjust to changing conditions. Sn1 phosphorylates bZIP, changing its ability to bind to other proteins, affecting gene expression and metabolism. Without bZIP, plants show signs of starvation, but adding back the normal bZIP fixes the issue, but not a mutated version that can't be phosphorylated by Sn1. The study found Sn1 is the main kinase responsible for phosphorylating bZIP and identified three key sites on bZIP that need to be phosphorylated for it to work. Plants overexpressing Sn1 had more phosphorylated bZIP, showing Sn1's role in vivo. Phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for bZIP's ability to bind to other proteins and regulate metabolism. Researchers propose a model of how Sn1 phosphorylates bZIP, changing its partners and affecting gene expression.
Researchers have identified a new protein called Ring finger 10 (R10) that acts as a messenger between synapses, the connections between neurons, and the nucleus, the control center of a cell's genetic material. R10 is activated by signals at the synapse, the connection between two neurons, and triggers changes in the cell's genetic code. It is found at excitatory synapses, where it binds to a part of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA), a key player in learning and memory. When this receptor is activated and long-term potentiation, a strengthening of connections between neurons, occurs, R10 moves from the neuron's branches to the nucleus. The study shows that R10 is transported from the synapse to the nucleus through a protein called importin. Silencing R10 prevents long-term potentiation and changes in neuron branches.

R10 binds to the NMD receptor in an activity-dependent manner and is transported to the nucleus through importin. The receptor's tail has sequences for signaling and scaffolding molecules. R10 and another protein, calmodulin, share the same binding site. R10 is a novel messenger for lasting changes in neuron branches after specific stimuli and required for modifications to induce long potentiation.

The study indicates that impaired R10 signaling and reduced levels are responsible for reduced branch density after silencing. Other studies suggest the NMD complex is a source of messengers that can travel to the nucleus. The messenger, transported, can encode and transduce signals from the synapse to the nucleus and dock to target sites in a stimulus-dependent manner. This study shows activation of synaptic not extrasynaptic NMDs increases R10 in the nucleus.

R10 is expressed in the nucleus and synapses, part of the NMD complex and interacts with the receptor's tail.
Researchers have studied how a protein called Mot1 interacts with a complex of DNA and another protein called TBP (TATA-binding protein) and a third protein called NC (transcription negative cofactor 2). This complex is important for controlling how genes are turned on and off in cells. Mot1 is a type of Swi/Snf enzyme, which helps change the structure of chromatin, the material that DNA and proteins are wrapped in, during processes like transcription, DNA repair, and replication. 

The study found that when Mot1 binds to TBP:DNA:NC, it causes small changes in the shape of the proteins and DNA, making it easier for the complex to break apart. This happens without using energy from ATP, which is usually needed for Swi/Snf enzymes to work. The researchers also found that Mot's interaction with NC helps separate NC's anchor to DNA, making it easier for Mot to break the complex. 

The study provides a detailed view of how Swi/Snf enzymes interact with DNA-protein complexes. Swi/Snf enzymes usually work by breaking the connection between DNA and proteins in a complex. The researchers used X-ray crystallography to see the structure of Mot1 with TBP:DNA:NC at 3.8 angstrom resolution and electron microscopy to see the full Mot complex. This is the first time a Sw/Snf enzyme has been seen with a DNA-protein complex. The study suggests that Mot's interaction with T:DNA:NC causes changes that could be important for breaking the complex with energy from ATP.
Researchers have discovered that a natural compound called ternatin and its synthetic variants can kill cancer cells by targeting a specific protein called elongation factor-1 ternary complex. This complex is involved in making proteins, which are essential for cell growth and survival. Ternatin and its variants are toxic to cancer cells, with some being up to 500 times more potent than the original compound. Scientists used a special probe to identify the elongation factor-1 ternary complex as the target and found that two other natural products, didnin and cyrien, also bind to it. Mutations in a part of the protein prevent tern from binding and make cells resistant to its effects, suggesting a specific spot on the protein is important for its function. The study shows that elongation factor-1 and its complex with GTP and amino-tRNA are common targets for toxic natural products.

The researchers made synthetic compounds similar to ternatin and tested their effects on cells. One variant was more potent than the original and all inhibited protein synthesis. They identified elongation factor-1 ternary complex as the target of these compounds. The more potent compounds blocked cell growth and one specifically bound to elong factor-1 in its complex with G and amino-tRNA. This is the first time a small molecule has been shown to bind to this complex.

The study aimed to find the target of tern, a natural product that stops cell growth. Inspired by its structure and activity, they made new compounds that are up to 500 times more potent. They found elongation factor-1 ternary complex as the target and two other natural products also bind to it. The study suggests elong factor-1 and its complex with G and amino-tRNA are common targets for toxic natural products.
Researchers have studied the role of a protein called OCRL in a process called clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is how cells take in substances from outside their environment. OCRL is a protein that interacts with clrin, a key player in this process. Mutations in OCRL cause a disease called Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease. Scientists thought defects in OCRL mainly affected how cells sort substances inside the cell, not how they take them in. However, they found that OCRL loss in cells with Lowe syndrome affects clrin endocyt and causes endytic defect. These cells have too many clrin-coated vesicles that don't lose their coat and more clrin-coated pits. This may be because coat components are trapped on these vesicles. Endytic vesicles that don't lose coat have many actin comets, which are structures inside cells. Researchers also found that SN9, a protein that helps late endytic clrin-co pits, binds to OCRL. This suggests OCRL helps uncoating and defects in clrin endyt likely cause disease in patients with OC mutations.

 Studies showed that SN9 binds to OCRL and examined OC's role in clrin endyt in Lowe cells. They found OC absence impairs endytic clrin dynamics and causes defect. Cells accumulate clrin-co ves that don't lose coat. A model shows OC's impact on clrin endyt in Lowe patients. OC's 5-phatase delays endyt by stalling late pits, impairs unating, and triggers comets from clrin ves that retain PI 4,5P2 and don't uncoat. Cells with OC have many actin comets, previously seen in Lowe patients. Findings suggest OC helps unating and recycling endytic factors, needed for endyt progression.

Researchers analyzed clrin pit dynamics in Lowe and control cells by time-lapse. Lowe cells have many act com driven by clrin ves, supporting link between endytic clrin coats and act, a topic of debate. Most studies support link for subset clrin endytic events.
Researchers have identified a new pathway that contributes to the development of colorectal cancer, a type of cancer that affects the colon and rectum. The pathway involves a protein called Wnt/β-caten, which is already known to be involved in cancer, but finding a way to block it has been a challenge. The study found that a protein called FAK/PYK helps activate W/βaten by phosphorylating another protein called GSKβ, leading to more W/aten accumulation and cancer growth. They tested this in mice with a genetic mutation that makes them prone to cancer and found that blocking FAK/P2 stopped cancer formation. They also found high levels of phosphorylated GSKβ in these mice, which was reduced by blocking FAK2. This suggests that FAK2 plays a role in cancer development by phosphorylating GSK to activate W/aten.
Researchers investigated how the brain controls the transition between standing and walking. They found that the balance system that helps us stay upright is turned off before we start walking and turned back on again when we stop. This happens before we even take a step. The study used electrical stimulation to the balance system and measured the forces on the ground to see how it works. The results show that the balance system is turned off before we start walking and on before we stop. This suggests that the brain uses different control systems for standing and walking.

The balance system helps us stay upright by sensing motion in space and is important for both standing and walking. It influences the muscles that control posture. To switch between standing and walking, balance responses are disrupted. Before transitions, the balance influence on body responses is suspended. The suspension of balance responses at movement starts while still standing upright, before transition. The suspension is not specific to one type of transition, it's a general process between standing and other motor states. Results show humans stop balancing before moving and moving before balancing again.

The suspension period of balance responses related to different feedback needed for movements. Standing and walking control policies. During standing, body movements and ground reactions are small. An adaptive controller is used. Balance during walking or posture-posture transitions can be monitored by quantifying balance responses over transition. A similar approach has been used to monitor engagement and disengagement of balance between self and external states.
Researchers have discovered that a key factor called RPA plays a crucial role in regulating the circadian rhythm of cyanobacteria, which is a type of bacteria that makes its own food through photosynthesis. RPA helps control how genes are turned on and off at different times of day and night. Without RPA, cyanobacteria can't survive when light and dark periods alternate, but they're fine in constant light. Scientists investigated why and found that RPA strain can't store energy at night, doesn't save food during day, and can't use stored food at night. Providing extra food helped restore energy and survival in RPA strain. This shows how circadian rhythm helps cyanobacteria prepare for energy changes in environment by coordinating food storage and use. The study suggests RPA helps store food during day and switch to using it at night, allowing cells to survive when resources are scarce.
Transition metals like zinc are essential for all living organisms, but too much of them can be toxic. Heavy-metal transporting P-type (P) ATPases help keep the balance by moving these ions in and out of cells. However, the structure of P-4-type ATPases, which can handle a wide range of metals, has been a mystery. Researchers studied the archetypal P-4-ATPase, CoT from Sulfitacter sp. NAS-1, and found a new insights into how they work. They discovered a unique features, including a role in metal release and a counter ion, histidine, and that P-ATPases don't need potassium to turn over, unlike others. This opens up possibilities for drug discovery, as P-4-ATPases are involved in many pathogens' virulence.

P-ATPases are divided into groups based on sequence and metal selectivity. Some have cobalt specificity, while others transport zinc, nickel, copper, and calcium. Cells need to adapt to changing metal levels, as they're essential but toxic in high amounts. P-ATases are crucial for heavy-metal homeostasis, like copper and zinc efflux. The structure of P-4-ATPases has been elusive, with some being the shortest in the P-type superfamily. Researchers used CoT to shed light on the structure and mechanism. The metal specificity of P-ATP is wide, so activity was tested in vitro with different metals. The results show promising leads for drug development to prevent metal accumulation or enrichment. The structure of P-4-ATP reveals an eight-helix configuration and no heavy-binding domains, at least in some members.
Researchers have identified a unique chromatin signature that distinguishes genes with mitotically stable allelic expression (MA) in human cells. This signature is characterized by the simultaneous presence of active (H3K36me) and silencing (H3me) marks in the gene body. The signature is found in about 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among developmental genes with bivalent chromatin in pluripotent cells. The study opens a new approach to study MA independent of polymorphisms and suggests MA is linked to cell differentiation.

Applying the approach to various cell types, up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed and more than one-third of tissue genes showed the chromatin of MA. Detection of MA does not rely on SNPs or sample clonality, making it feasible for analysis in primary samples, including comparisons of normal and diseased tissue. Among widely expressed genes, about 20 have chromatin characteristic MA in at least one tissue. Tissue-specific genes as a group, estimate 39-48 have MA pattern. Genes with MA chromatin share features as a group. MA in clones is reflected by chrom in polycl sample.

To test chromatin as predictor of MA state, genes with MA pattern were identified and allelic bias in monoclonal lines. Calculated gene-body signal for H3me and H3me for autosomal Ref genes on ENCODE Ch-seq GM78 lymphoblast cells. A large fraction of bivalent genes acquire MA chromatin in differentiated types, higher compared to silent in ES. Upon activation, master genes preferentially resolve into MA chromatin.
Researchers have discovered a new way that a type of protein called Clp helps control its activity in bacteria. Clp is a protein that helps break down other proteins, which is important for the bacteria's survival and resistance to stress. It works with another protein called Clp to do this job. A third protein called MecA helps Clp by targeting it to the right proteins to break down. Scientists found that Clp has a special structure that keeps it from working too much. This structure, called a coiled-coil, holds Clp in a resting state and prevents it from breaking down too many proteins. When MecA binds to Clp, it changes the structure and makes Clp active. Without the coiled structure, Clp breaks down too many proteins and causes harm to the bacteria. This discovery shows that coiled structures can control protein activity in a new way.
Scientists have been trying to understand how stem cells stay in a dormant state and how they are reactivated for a long time. Researchers used fruit flies, Drosophila, to study adult muscle stem cells called AMPs. They found that these cells send out thin filaments that touch neighboring muscles and keep in contact with them even when they are dormant. This suggests that muscles might play a role in reactivating AMPs. Genetic analysis showed that muscles send signals that turn on the insulin pathway in AMPs, leading to the activation of Notch, which regulates cell growth. The study found that Dophila AMPs behave like muscle cells and the muscle-driven insulin-Not-dyc cascade is key to reactivating AMP. This is similar to how it works in vertebrates. To understand the link between insulin, Not, and dyc in AMP behavior, researchers analyzed their activity in reactivated AMP. They found that dyc is a positive regulator of AMP reactivation, showing that muscle cell growth is regulated by same genes in Doph and vertebrates.
Scientists have long known that certain neurons in the brain fire at high rates, which is crucial for their function in brain circuits. One type of these neurons, called GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SN), a major output of the basal ganglia, provide inhibition to downstream brain areas. To understand how SN neurons maintain this activity, researchers used single-cell sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual SN neurons. They found that SN neurons express the sodium channel NAL, and SN lacking NAL have impaired firing. NAL is also involved in modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. This suggests disruption of NAL could impair basal gang circuit, leading to severe motor deficits in humans with NAL mutations.

Researchers identified the non-selective cation channel (NS) that supports firing of SN neurons and the molecular of glycolysis-sensitive NS. They used single-cell sequencing to determine gene profile of SN and relative levels of NS. Sodium channel NAL was highest in SN neurons. The molecular basis of this current is important for investigation of its properties and regulation of SN inhibition of basal targets. To address this, they performed transcript sequencing of SN and detected expression of NS that could generate depolar current. They found SN express NAL, a prime candidate for carrying depolar current in cells. SN require NAL for tonic firing, suggesting NAL mutations contribute to basal motor disorders. Disruption of normal firing by GABA agonists leads to muscle tension and dystonia, and hyperactivity in Parkinsonian animals. NAL is a candidate for depolar current, highest of all NS and in top 20% of ion channels. SN also express Unc, Unc, and Fam, genes interacting with NAL.
Researchers have developed a new way to cultivate and study microorganisms that are hard to grow in a lab, using tiny droplets of liquid. This method, called parallelized droplet cultivation, allows for many microorganisms to be grown at the same time, increasing the chances of finding new antibiotics. The traditional way of growing microorganisms on agar plates is limited, as it's a random process and not many species can't be grown. The new method uses tiny droplets, each containing a single cell, which can be stored and incubated in a controlled environment. This allows for high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity, meaning the ability to test many droplets at once for antibiotic production.

The researchers tested this method by growing a complex community of bacteria from soil and compared it to traditional agar plate cultivation. One isolate showed antimicrobial activity in the droplet screening, and its secreted metabolites were identified. The droplets provide a link between the microorganism's genotype and secreted products, keeping them confined to the cell they originated from. A high-throughput screening for antimicrobial products was also implemented using reporter strains in droplets.

The combination of droplet cultivation and screening streamlines the search for new antibiotics by selecting the most promising candidates for product development. An innovative strategy was devised using a modular droplet-microfluid platform, mimicking environmental conditions. Tiny droplets of 200pL allowed long-term cultivation of 2 million cells in 1.5mL, and screening for antibiotic production. Reporter strains were added to detect compounds in droplets. The approach was combined with a step to detect and select droplets containing cells producing compounds with activity. Even new species couldn't be maintained after isolation, but were used for high-quality genome information.
Researchers studied the connection between a specific genetic variation in the leukotriene A hydrolase (L4) gene and survival rates of patients with tuberculous meningitis, a severe form of tuberculosis that affects the brain and spinal cord. Tuberculous meningitis has a high mortality rate, and current treatments with anti-inflammatory corticosteroids only reduce mortality by 30%. The study found that patients with the C/T variant of the L4 gene, which regulates inflammatory eicosoids, had a higher survival rate when treated with corticosteroids. However, another study in Indonesia did not find the same benefit. Using a statistical method called Bayesian analysis, researchers combined both studies and found that the L4 TT genotype gives a survival benefit that starts early and lasts long-term in both populations. This benefit is lost in severe cases with high mortality. The study suggests that testing the L4 genotype with disease severity could help target corticosteroid treatment to those most likely to benefit from it.
Scientists have long known that axons, the long extensions of nerve cells that transmit signals, navigate their way through the brain and body in response to guidance cues. However, it was unclear how they convert these cues into movement. Researchers found that a protein called shootin plays a key role in this process. They discovered that mice without shoot, axons in the brain's forebrain region grow abnormally. This is similar to what happens in mice without another protein called netrin, which guides axons. Netrin creates a gradient, or slope, that axons follow. The researchers found that netrin causes shoot to be phosphorylated, or changed, within axons. This change allows shoot to interact with another protein, L-CAM, which helps axons move. They also found that this interaction is necessary for axons to turn in response to netrin's gradient. The study shows how netrin and shoot work together to guide axons.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the unique humming sound made by hummingbirds as they fly, known as their "humming." To understand this phenomenon, researchers studied six freely hovering hummingbirds using a special microphone array to record their sound and a new device to measure the forces on their wings. They found that the humming sound comes from the way the wings move through the air, creating lift and drag forces that vibrate at a specific frequencies. This is different from other birds and insects, which produce sound from the way their body weight is supported by these forces.

The researchers used a device to measure the forces on the wings, called an aerodynamic platform, and combined it with sound recordings to understand how the humming is made. They created a model that shows how the forces on the wings create the sound, and tested it with real hummingbirds. The results showed that the humming is directional, with most sound going down and harmonics depending on how the wing moves. The model assumes the wings are rigid, ignoring other factors like feathers and air movement.

Comparing hummingbirds and insects, the team found that larger birds are quieter and longer make more sound, while smaller ones are louder. This is due to how their body weight is supported by the forces on their wings. The study clarifies how animals make sound while flying, a complex behavior still not fully understood.
Scientists have long debated the roles of chance and necessity in the evolution of proteins, but have never studied them together on a timescale relevant to evolution. Researchers used a new technology to mutate and select proteins in the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family to acquire protein-protein specificities that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary trajectories from ancestral proteins, they found that chance was not the primary cause of sequence variation, even under strong selection. Instead, contingency, or the outcome of historical events, was the main driver. This suggests that present-day B-2 proteins and others are unique products of their unpredictable histories, shaped by chance, physics, chemistry, and selection.

The study found that contingency generated sequence change over long timescales plays a role in B-2 protein evolution under selection for new functions. The researchers used human and NO as binding partners, but during evolution these proteins varied in sequence, introducing chance and contingency to affect outcomes. The study's design and biological setting may have overestimated chance's historical role. Additional B- functions imposed constraints on evolution, reducing equivalent genotypes available to chance.

The results show paths leading to specificities changed during B- history, even when profiles did not evolve. For chance to influence evolution, multiple paths to a phenotype must be accessible with similar probabilities. This challenges the idea that selection, drift, and mutation shape evolution outcomes. The study suggests that contingency is a primary factor in protein evolution, alongside necessity and chance.
Researchers analyzed the genetic makeup of 48 sub-Saharan African populations to understand how different groups are connected through shared ancestry. They used a technique called genome-wide haplotype analysis, which looks at the combination of genetic markers on chromosomes. The study found that coastal populations have received Eurasian genetic material over the last 700 years, and Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo groups share ancestry with Central Africans due to recent expansions. Most sub-Saharan populations have ancestry from outside their region due to gene flow in the last 400 years. This research provides insight into shared genetic connections between ethnic groups and movement of alleles into new environments, relevant to studying diseases.

The study built on previous research (Hell et al, 2012; Leslie et al,2015; Montinaro et al,2015) which provided a measure of ancestry between groups and identified key events shaping diversity in sub-Saharan Africa. It also discussed the relevance to studying genotype-phenotype associations in Africa. The study found clear evidence of Eurasian ancestry moving into the continent through admixture over various times (Pag et al,2012; Pick et,2014; Gurdani et,2014; Hodgson et,2014;Llo,2015). A sample of 18 ethnic groups from eight countries, the Genome Variation Project (Gurdani et,2014 et, Li,201) described Eurasian and hunter-gather influence on sub-Saharan population history and movement of alleles and haplotype. However, the extent and timing of events and impact on contemporary populations remained unclear.

The study revealed broad geographic patterns, but also smaller, closely related groups consistent with self-reported ancestry (Tk et,2009 Bry,2010 Hodgson,2014). Gene flow between populations was related to historical movements into sub-Saharan. Admixture occurs when ancestral groups mix, a feature of human populations globally (Patterson et,201; Hell,201;Bus,201). Genome analyses refined models of Africa's history and impact on diversity
Researchers studied how the mitotic spindle, a structure that separates chromosomes during cell division, adapts to changing cell size during early development in the frog Xenopus lae embryo. They created a system using cytoplasm extracts from embryos that mimicked the spindle size differences between early and later stages of development. They found that a protein called kinesin-13, kif2, drives spindle scaling by destabilizing microtubules, but its activity is inhibited in early stages by a receptor called importin alpha. As the embryo grows, import alpha partitions to the membrane, allowing kif2 to activate and the spindle to grow. Disrupting spindle size in embryos affected orientation during metaphase, but not chromosome segregation. This suggests spindle size in Xenopus development is linked to cell size through a mechanism controlling microtule destabilization.

The researchers reconstituted spindle formation in extracts to understand how size is coordinated with cell during development. They identified kines-13 kif2 as a driver of spindle scaling among hundreds of known spindle proteins. Modifying spindle size without disrupting function revealed its role in maintaining orientation in early Xenopus cells. This indicates physical changes in cells can drive biochemical reactions altering spindle architecture. This is consistent with changes in meiotic to mitotic morphology during mouse development and suggests physical changes impact biochemical reactions (Couris et al, 2012). In extracts, import alpha phosphorylation is thought to release from membrane into cytoplasm, promoting activity (Hach et al,2004). Kif2 retrieved more import alpha from stage 3 than stage 8 extracts, suggesting sufficient alpha partitions to interact with k2. This mechanism enabled testing its significance during development. Observations suggest changes spindle pathways accompany size and influence size. To determine size during vertebrate development, an embryo system was created assembling spind in cytoplasm at any stage up to midblast transition when divisions become asynchronous (Newport and Kner,1982).
Scientists have discovered a new way that riboswitches, a type of RNA molecule, can work together to control the production of purine, a building block of DNA and RNA, in bacteria. Riboswitches are like tiny switches that can turn genes on or off by binding to specific molecules. In this case, two riboswitches bind to two different molecules, guanine and phosphoribos pyrophosphate (PR), to control the production of purine. This is like a "AND" logic gate, where both molecules must be present for the switch to turn on. The discovery shows that ancient RNA, the building blocks of life, could have had complex systems to control their own metabolism without proteins. This is a new example of how RNA can sense and control molecules to make more complex life forms.
Researchers have long known that the number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential affects the reliability of synaptic transmission. However, the source of this variability is unclear. The prevailing view is that release of a single vesicle (unives release, UVR) or multiple vesicles (multives release, MVR) reflects variability in vesicle release probability, which is supported by the calcium dependence of release. A new study using mouse brain slices shows that the number of vesicles released is regulated by the size of the readily releasable pool, upstream of vesicle probability. This means that protein kinase A and its vesicle target, synapsin, dynamically control release occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles without altering probability. These findings define molecular mechanisms that control MVR and functional diversity of synaptic signaling.

Diversity in calcium homeostasis and protein kinase A may contribute to variability in A and synapsin regulation across synapses. Recent models propose vesicles transition between states from loose to tighter tethering with release followed by calcium-triggered fusion, which may be akin to transitions from sites to docking prior fusion. MVR is widespread in the rodent CNS and appears to be the dominant mode in cortex. However, some synapses are limited to release of a single vesicle per zone, termed unives release, while others switch modes in activity-dependent.

The number of vesicles from an active zone is the product of ves release probability and number available. The simplest explanation is that the readily releasable pool is a measure of release-competent vesicles per zone, under control of synins, constraining number released. Surprisingly, this parameter has not been explored, leading focus on as principal of UVRM. High probability synapses display UVR, while low can exhibit M. This illustrates alone is insufficient to dictate mode, pointing contribution availability
Scientists have been trying to understand how the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) selects and packages its genetic material, called RNA, for a long time. The virus has a protein called Gag that assembles on the cell membrane and selects the viral RNA from other cellular RNAs, but the mechanism was unknown. Researchers created a simplified system with purified RNAs, recombinant G, and unilamellar vesicles to study the process. They found that the 5 untranslated region of the HIV genome is selectively packaged in the presence of excess RNA. Mutations in the CACT domain of G, which affects self-assembly, abrogated selectivity. They also discovered that RNA suppresses G binding when G has bound viral RNA. The study shows that G's ability to package RNA and self-assembly on membranes are interdependent.

The researchers propose a model where viral RNA with high-affinity sites for G recruits G to the membrane, allowing it to dissociate from other RNAs. The study suggests the NC domain of G is necessary but not sufficient for selective packaging. A previous study found most membrane-prox genomic RNAs are moneric in absence of G, but coalesce to dimers in presence. The results highlight the importance of membrane-local G assembly in genome selection and packaging. Existing data couldn't explain how cytosolic G assembles into particles with dimer genomes. The study reconstituted selective packaging in a minimal system with GUVs, recomant G and purified RN. Lattice contacts are crucial for selective packaging. The 5UTR is recruited by multized G without changes. Association with RNA inhibits assembly.
