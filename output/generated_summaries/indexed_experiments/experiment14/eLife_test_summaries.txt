Scientists have long known that the nervous system uses two types of communication: chemical and electrical synapses. Chemical synapses are identified by their structure, while electrical synapses are defined by the presence of gap junctions between cells. However, it's unclear if electrical transmission requires additional structures. Researchers studied single synapses on zebraf fish cells, where gap junctions coexist with neurotransmitter release. They used expansion microscopy to map synaptic structures and found multiple gap junctions of varying size with molecular components. Most synaptic surface was occupied by gap junction and adherens junction components, suggesting a close association. Glutamate receptors were confined to small areas, indicating most synaptic functions as electrical. The study revealed electrical synapses operate with multiple gap junctions, associated with adherens junction and signaling molecules. This will help establish boundaries of electrical synapses in animal connectomes and provide insight into syn diversity.

The complexity of chemical synapses is well understood, but less is known about electrical synapses. Electrical synapses are mediated by gap junctions (GJs). Researchers expanded 13 times the contact area and found no change in terminal morphology, consistent with previous studies. Transmission in zraf fish is by multiple GJs with variable channels. Labeling showed most area operates as electrical synapse. They asked what other structures contribute to electrical transmission. Since boutons define synapse limits, they examined structures together. Expansion microscopy exposed synaptic components in larval zraf. CEs share properties with adult fish. Chemical and immunological synapses share organization: adhesion molecules periphery, communication centrally. Results suggest this applies to electrical synapse.
Researchers studied the role of a group of brain cells called the pre-Böt complex (preBöt) in controlling breathing and facial movements. They found that some of these cells send signals directly to the facial nerve that controls facial and nasal muscles. To understand how these cells work, they used a technique to selectively turn off these cells with light and saw that it affected facial movements, but not breathing. This effect changed depending on the type of anesthesia and whether the animal was awake or asleep. The cells that send signals to the facial nerve were both excitatory and inhibitory and connected to other parts of the brain that control autonomic activity. The study suggests that targeting specific groups of preöt cells based on their connections could help understand how breathing and other movements are coordinated. This is important because problems with breathing and facial movements have been linked to diseases.

The researchers wondered if these cells are part of the breathing network or a separate group. Their data doesn't fully answer this, but they think they transmit rhythm, not generate it. They found that turning off these cells affected facial movements, not breathing, likely because of connections to other cells. To test this, they used a technique to selectively turn off cells that send to the facial nerve and saw it affected facial movements, not breathing. This was different from turning off all preöt cells, which affected breathing more. Under certain anesthesia, turning off these cells had little effect on breathing. They found a smaller group of cells with a specific location.

Turning off preöt cells that send to the nerve caused apnea, reduced sympathetic activity, and increased parasympathetic activity, and decreased heart rate. These cells also control facial behaviors.
Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal an alarm to the brain. These neurons are thought to serve as a general alarm system, modulating both passive and active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude of the threat. However, most research has focused on their role in passive responses, such as freezing, with limited exploration of their involvement in active behaviors. To address this, researchers examined the role of CGRP in active behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Electrophysiological results revealed CGRP encodes intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP during chasing elevated responses in both conditioning and retention, presumably amplifying perception of threat as more imminent. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP exhibited reduced responses, even when robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand understanding of CGRP in PBN as critical alarm, capable of regulating active behaviors by amplifying perception and ensuring adaptive responses to varying danger.
Researchers studied the relationship between obesity and brain structure using data from over 30,000 participants in the UK Biobank study. They found that a higher waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is linked to differences in brain microstructure in two distinct systems: the prefrontal/temporal/striatal system and medial/occipital/statal system. The prefrontal system is associated with lower water content, while the medial system is linked to lower neurite density. The prefront system is co-located with genes for immune functions, glial density, and opioid receptors, while the medial system is co-located with genes for G-protein receptors and decreased opioid receptors. The researchers also found that the two systems are negatively correlated, suggesting a two-way mechanism where neurite density in the medial system contributes to obesity and water in the prefront is a consequence of immune activation. 

The prefrontal system has been previously linked to episodic memory and navigation, and maps of water and neurite were negatively correlated. The study identified two anatomically and functionally distinct brain systems associated with obesity using gene expression, composition, and neurotransmitter density. The researchers tested the direction of relationship between obesity and brain structure using genome-wide association statistics and found that WHR has a tighter correlation with neurite than water. They also used data on neurotransmitter distribution to refine characterization of obesity systems and found that both are positively correlated with WH. The two systems are anatomically, transcriptionally, and neurologically differentiated from each other.
Researchers have been studying how cancer cells called cancer stem cells (CSCs) spread to other parts of the body, a process called metastasis. They found that these cells go through a change called epithelial-mesymal transition (EMT) to do this. However, they couldn't see this happening in human tumour samples, making it unclear if it's relevant to human cancer. They found two markers, EpCAM and CD, and mesenchymal marker Viment, that identify SCs in oral cancer cells. They used these to see if they could find SCs that had gone through EMT in human tumours. They looked at 12,000 images from 74 tumours and found EpCAM, CD, and Viment were together in cells that had gone through EMT and spread to surrounding tissue. They used a computer program to predict which tumours would spread with 87% accuracy. This study shows SCs that go through EMT in human tumours and can predict spread. 

They stained Ep and CD alongside Viment in 12,000 images from 74 tumours, stratified on metastasis, and found cells that had gone EMT and spread to surrounding tumours. They used a machine learning approach to show that EMTs in tumroma is predictive of metastasis. Presence of these SCs is strongly correlated with metastasis. They used machine learning to predict metast with high accuracy through EMTs. Immunofluores staining for E that retain Ep and Viment and plastic marker CD identified EMTs in stroma surrounding oral tumours, but epithelial keratins not retained. Ep alone with Viment not mark EMT that correlates with metastasis. They looked at single cells in thousands of fields and identified EMTs and used to train ANN to predict metast. Viment distinguishes E from epithelial cells in staining protocols. Combining Ep as tum lineage and E marker, Viment as mesym, and CD as E marker aimed to identify cells that had E and spread to stromal region
Researchers have long known that apoptosis, the process of programmed cell death, and efferocytosis, the removal of dead cells, play a crucial role in tissue repair. However, how these processes are regulated is not fully understood. A new study used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the dynamics of early inflammation in mouse wounds and found that apoptotic and efferyt pathways are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident macrophages during inflammation. In diabetic wounds, human upregulation of mRNAs for efferyt pathway and altered eyt signaling via receptor Axl and its ligand Gas was detected. Early in mouse wounds, upregulation of Axl in dendritic and fibroblasts via TLR-independent mechanisms was found. Inhibition in vivo in mice revealed Axl is required for repair but dispensable for eyt. In contrast, inhibition of another eyt receptor, Tim4, in wounds decreased eyt and abated repair. The study highlights distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell coordinates repair and provides potential targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.
Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues, enabling the creation of transcriptomic cell atlases. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and identifying cell types corresponding to gene clusters in single-cell sequencing sets remains a challenge. Researchers have developed a genetic barcoding approach, called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplex (Ta-EM), to address this issue. This method involves inserting a DNA barcode upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal-inducible UASFP construct, allowing the barcode to be read during single-cell sequencing, labeling a population of interest. By creating multiple barcoded fly strains, Ta- enables identification of cell types in atlases, multiplet droplets, and barcoding time, conditions, and replicates. Ta- barcodes can also be read using next-generation sequencing for population-scale measurements. This approach has potential for large-scale behavioral screens and improving single-cell transcriptomic multiplexing and annotation.

The method, called Ta-EM, takes advantage of powerful genetic tools in Drosophila for in vivo tagging defined populations. It involves inserting a DNA barcode upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal-indible UASFP, allowing the sequence to be read during single-cell sequencing, labeling a population of interest. By creating multiple barcoded fly strains, Ta- enables identification of cell types in atlases, multiplets, and barcoding time, conditions, and replicates. Ta- barcodes can also be read using next-generation sequencing for population-scale measurements.
Biologists have long been trying to understand how some frogs in the Dendrobatidae family developed the ability to defend themselves with chemicals they get from their food. However, most research has focused on colorful species that are known to be defended, ignoring those that are not. This has left a gap in our understanding of how defense evolved in this group. A new study found that non-defended frogs in the same family have small amounts of these chemicals and eat ants, which are a source of them. This challenges the idea that diet is the reason for their defense. Instead, the study suggests a new process called passive accumulation, where chemicals are taken in but not stored, leading to low levels. This is different from sequestration, where chemicals are stored and used for defense. The study proposes that accumulation is an early stage in the development of chemical defense in frogs and possibly other animals.
Epithelial-to-mesymal transition (EMT) plays a significant role in chemotherapy resistance and is a challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. Researchers have struggled to develop effective treatments due to the complexity of EMT, involving multiple signaling pathways and its reversal process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial (MET). A study used a Tri-PMT E lineage-tracing model and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze EMT status of tumor cells. Findings showed elevated ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) during EMT and MET phases. Ribi and subsequent protein synthesis by ER and mTOR signaling are essential for EMT completion. Inhibiting Ribi genetically or pharmacologically impaired EMT capability of tumor cells. Combining Ribi with chemotherapy reduced metastatic growth of epithelial and mesenchymal cells under chemotherapies. The study suggests targeting Ribi pathway a promising for treating advanced breast cancer.

Researchers used a unique E-lineageacing model to discover Ribi transiently elevated during EMT phases. Lower Ribi activity observed in mesenchym cells than epithelial ones. Consistent with the Triy model, combining CT with CT reduced metastatic tumor burden than mock or mono-treatment. Further analysis of human breast cancer scRNA data showed Ribi association with E status of tumor cells. Targeting E for therapy challenging due to E complexity and MET controversies. The E-lineacing model found upregulation of Ribi at E and MET phases. Activation Ribi during E process reported previously. Results suggest Ribi needed for mesenchym cells MET during outgrowth in lungs. Ribosome bi crucial in cancer pathogenesis. Signaling responsible for R upregulation in E process sorted and probed. Involvement unwed Ribi during E and MET makes Ribi new target for E-related chemoresistance and metastasis. Targeting Ribi RNase inhibitor impaired E transitioning and synergized chemotherap.
Researchers studied the root system of pearl millet, a drought-tolerant crop in the sub-Saharan region, to understand how it adapts to challenging environments. They found that pearl millet has a fast-growing primary root, which they believe is an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Using modeling, they showed that drought is a major constraint in the region where pearl was domesticated. They also found that increased primary root growth in pearl is linked to increased water tolerance in field conditions.

A study of 57 years showed that drought is a major issue in the region, affecting crops during the vegetative stage. To test if fast primary root growth after germination is an adaptation to drought, researchers phenotyped a panel of pearl millet lines representing the crop's diversity. They found that fast primary roots are present in pearl and lateral roots at 6 days after germination. They hypothesized the fast-growing root is an adaptation to the Sah environment.

Experiments showed that drought after germination is a major constraint in the region and primary growth is linked to tolerance under field conditions in pearl. Correlations between variables showed a strong relationship between primary growth and stay at the veget stage, an indicator of drought tolerance. Field experiments supported the hypothesis that rapid root growth is beneficial for pearl to cope with drought episodes after germination.

Differences in growth seem to be regulated by cell elongation. Genome-wide study and bulk segregant analysis identified a genomic region controlling the trait. Resequencing and reannotation of this region identified a glutaredin-encoding gene, PgXC, a potential regulator. However, the effect of polymorphisms on expression needs to be tested. To test the hypothesis, researchers studied the ortholog in Arabidopsis as functional studies are not possible in pearl.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes language in complex, real-world situations where multiple things like speech, faces, bodies, and objects are happening at the same time. They wanted to know how words and their meanings are stored in the brain during this process. The study looked at how concrete and abstract concepts are represented in the brain while watching a movie and if brain responses change depending on the context. They found that concrete and abstract concepts are stored in different brain areas, but these differences disappear when considering multiple senses are involved. When abstract words are in scenes related to their meaning, brain responds like concrete, but when unrelated, it's like abstract. This suggests that concepts are based on experiences, but brain's organization is not fixed and changes with context.

The brain is good at combining senses to form ideas, which is important for real-life experiences. The study shows how context affects abstract and concrete words in the brain. Similar effects might be seen in other senses. They tested if profiles change with objects in the scene. Predicted that abstract concepts in related scenes (e.g. "love" while kissing) engage brain areas for concrete and visual processing. First, they looked where concrete and abstract are processed and what they encode. Expected regions for typical experiences (e.g. learning) to activate across contexts. When concrete out of context (e.g. "apple" in a house), predicted abstract brain areas for internal/interceptive/affective processing. Conducted second analysis to see if representations change with context. Found brain's concrete and abstract processing change with visual context.
Researchers have been working to develop new treatments for cancer using the body's immune system to fight the disease, but a major obstacle is that cancer cells often don't have many targets for the immune system to recognize. One way cancer cells hide from the immune system is through a process called nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), which destroys RNA from genes with mutations, making them invisible to the immune system. To find a way to stop this, scientists conducted a high-throughput screen to identify key players in NMD in human cells. They found a kinase called SM1, which phosphorylates UP1, a protein involved in NMD, and developed a new inhibitor, KVS1, that blocks SM1. This led to increased expression of proteins from genes with mutations in human and mouse cells. Importantly, K1 also increased presentation of proteins on the surface of cancer cells that can be recognized by the immune system. This could be a new way to study and treat diseases where N plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.
Researchers have found that aging is a major risk factor for cancer, but the rate of aging varies among individuals. To better understand this, they created a new measure called "Phenotypic Age" (PhAge) to predict cancer risk. They used data from 374,463 participants in the UK Biob study and found that those who were older had a higher risk of cancer, with a 1.22 times more likely to get cancer in men and 1.26 in women. They also found that those with high genetic risk and older PhAge had 2.29 and 1.94 times more likely to get cancer compared to those with low risk and younger PhAge. Additionally, PhAge was associated with fewer healthy lifestyle factors. The study suggests that aging can be slowed with a healthy lifestyle. This research was funded by the National Science Foundation of China and the Youth of Jiangsu Province.
A new app called Biome has been launched in Japan to gather species observations from the public using identification and gamification elements. Since its launch in 2019, the app has amassed over 6 million observations. However, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Researchers investigated the quality of Bi data and its impact on species distribution models (SDMs). They found that species identification accuracy exceeded 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but was below 90 for plants, mollusks, and fishes. SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan showed that incorporating Bi data into traditional data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional data required over 200 records for accurate models (Boyce ≥ 0.9), while blending the two sources reduced this to around 300. The coverage of urban-natural gradients by Bi data compared to traditional biased towards natural areas may explain this improvement. Combining multiple sources better estimates species distributions, aiding protected area and ecosystem assessment. Establishing a platform accumulating community-sourced data will contribute to conserving and monitoring ecosystems.

The researchers assessed the quality of Bi data by investigating non-wild and misidentified records. SDMs are statistical tools for assessing biodiversity while accounting biases. They use occurrence and environmental conditions to estimate potential ranges and habitats (Booth et al, 2014; Box, 198; Elith et,201; Hutchinson,195; Phillips,200). The inclusion of Bi data improved SD accuracy (Figure 3). Most accurate predictions when 50-70 Bi data (Appendix 1). Both surveys and observations for comprehensive understanding distributions (Miller,201; Pacific,201; Robinson,202). They modelled distributions 132 animals and plants in Japanese archipelago subtropical boreal areas.
Researchers have long known that abnormal lung development can lead to congenital cysts, but the exact mechanisms behind this process are not fully understood. One theory is that cysts result from disrupted airway epithelial cell growth, but the role of developmental defects in lung mesenchymal cells in airway epithelial growth and cyst formation has not been thoroughly examined. In a new study using mouse models, scientists investigated the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1 (BMPRA)-mediated signaling in lung mesyme during prenatal development and found that abrogation of mesymal MPRA disrupted normal lung morphogenesis, leading to prenatal cystic lesions. Severely deficient air smooth muscle and subepithelial fibers were found in cystic airways of mesal MPRA knockout lungs. Additionally, ectopic mesal expression and airway epithelial perturbation of Sox-9 proximal-dist axis were detected in mesal MPRA lungs. However, deletion of Smad/5, two MP downstream effectors, from lungyme did not phenoc the cyst abnormalities in mesal MPRA lungs, suggesting a Sm-independent mechanism contributes to pulmonaryic lesions. These findings reveal the first role of mesal signaling in lung development and a potential mechanism underlying congenital cysts.

The study provides evidence that MPRA-mediated signaling in lungyme is crucial for development. Lungyme deletion of MPRA at an early stage causes abnormal morph and severe cyst at gestation in mice. Congenital cysts are reported in human patients as a result of prenatal development. Aberrant epithelial growth may also contribute air cyst formation, as models have suggested loss or expansion in air epithelia associated altered differentiation and cyst pathology. Mesal MPRA is essential for development, particularly airway morphogenesis. MP is expressed in mouse air epithelial at early gestation, but also in lungyme during mid-estation. Deleting MP in lungyme resulted in abnormal air development and cystic malformation. The relationship between MP deletion and MP expression in lungyme was confirmed by comparing MP in isolated lungyme with MP genotypes. Alterations other pathways, including FGF, Wnt, and Sh, were not detected by analyzing related genes. The phenotype resembles features in patients with congenital air mal. Investigating lung caused by mes-specific MP knockout and underlying mechanisms will enhance understanding congen lung diseases.
Scientists have long known that a type of lipid molecule called phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P) plays a role in regulating the activity of a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF). However, the way PI(4,5)P interacts with EG in living cells is not fully understood because it's hard to visualize the area around EG in the cell membrane. Researchers used super-resolution microscopy to see both EG and PI(4,5)P in the membrane of HeLa cells. They found that EG and PI(4,5)P form clusters before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EG). The degree of clustering decreased after EG stimulation and depended on phospholipaseγ, an EG effector that breaks down PI(4,5)P. Reducing PI(4,5)P in the membrane reduced dimerization and autophosphorylation of EG after EG stimulation. Inhibiting PI(4,5)P breakdown after stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EG-Th654. The study found that EG activity and PI(4,5) around EG molecules are mutually regulated.

The researchers examined dynamics and roles of PI(4,5) as a neighbor of EG in EG activation by EG stimulation. They found that EG and PI(4) form nanodomains that overlap before EG stimulation. The nanodomains form clusters and extent of coaggregation EG and PI(5) molecules in higher structure decreases after EG stimulation. They used super-resolution microscopy to visualize EG and PI(4) in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells and found that PI(4) and EG nanodomains aggregate before EG stimulation. The degree of coag decreases after EG stimulation and depends on PLC but not phosphoinosit 3-kinase PIK. Local PI(4) around EG stabilizes EG dimers to increase EG autosphorylation upon EG. The hydrolysis of PI(4) by PLC plays role in deactivation EG. The results suggest remodeling lipid environment regulates EG activity.
Researchers have identified a unique protein in the parasite Blastocystis that helps transport glycol intermediates, such as dihydroacetone and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the inner mitochondrial membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. This protein is different from other eukotes, where glycol is a cytosolic process. The Blastyst lacks key components of oxidative phosphorylation, such as complexes III and IV, ATP synthase, and AD/ATP carriers, making it rely on glycol for energy. The presence of glycol in the matrix powers energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, and NAD, used by complex I to generate a motive force for protein and molecule import. This protein is a potential drug target for stramenile pathogens, which are economically important.
Researchers have proposed a new framework for genetic studies called the Haplotype Score (HFS), which calculates the functional activity of each haplotype in an individual's genome. This score replaces the traditional genotype in association studies. They applied the H framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank dataset and found 361 independent associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 269 causal associations, a median of 63 more than single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis. The H-based analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait and 153-tissue associations with biological interpretability, such as 'circadian-chronotype' and 'aridonic-intelligence. Integrating HFS with SNP-based polygenic scores improved prediction by 16.1-39.8%. The study suggests HFS is a promising for understanding complex traits.

The researchers analyzed the association between H and each trait and found it offers improvement in biological and polygenic prediction compared to classic SNP-based methods. They used the ENTEX dataset, which aligns genomic peaks with specific haplotype, and showed HFS represents functional activities in genetic studies. The study designed the H framework and demonstrated it improves classic analysis in causal loci, gene, interpretation, and polygenic prediction. It suggests H is a strategy for future studies, but more algorithm and data are needed. Compared to SNP, H has several features, such as causal loci. H-based fine-mapping detected 11-334 more signals (median 63) than SNP-based for each trait. The study applied H to 14 traits in UKB and found 16,597 associations at p <5 ×10-8, equating to 361 independent.
Researchers studied how three different types of mental training programs affected the structure and function of the hippocampus, a brain region involved in regulating stress and emotions. The training programs focused on either attention, socio-affective (emotional) skills, or socio-cognitive (thinking) skills. The study involved 332 healthy adults and used MRI scans to measure changes in hippocampal structure and function over three months. They also measured cortisol levels, a hormone linked to stress, before and after training. The results showed that training in socioffective skills increased the volume of a hippocal subfield called CA-3, compared to training in socio-cognitive skills or a control group with no training. This change in CA-3 was also linked to increased connectivity and lower cortisol levels. Other hippocal subfields not affected by training also contributed to changes in cortisol levels. The study found a link between emotional training, hippocal changes, and reduced stress in healthy adults.
Scientists studied three species of sunflowers, Helianthus annu, Helthus argyll, and Helthus petolar, to understand how they adapt to their environments. These sunflowers have large regions of their genome where recombination is suppressed, often due to inversions, which are changes in the order of their DNA. These inversions are associated with traits that help the sunflowers adapt to their environments. The researchers wanted to know how much of the adaptation is due to these inversions and if other genes within the inversion can still contribute to adaptation without recombination. They found that inversions help adaptation, but some genes within them can still contribute without recombination. Many regions of the genome show adaptation, but strongest associations are species-specific, indicating redundancy in adaptation.

The study estimated how many regions of the genome contribute to adaptation for each trait and found redundancy. Results show adaptation in sunflowers involves repeatability at few genes, often with inversions, and non-repeated responses at many loci. The researchers explored repeatability of adaptation in the three sunflowers, which have large recombination-suppressed regions, often inversions, and adaptive traits. Most inversions are over a million years old and predate current adaptation, but not the underlying genes shared among species.

Results suggest some genome contributes adaptation with low redundancy and repeility, enriched in regions with inversions, while the rest is driven by species-specific loci. Repeatability with inv supports the adaptation model for long-term persistence of inversions in sunflowers, not dominance or meiotic mechanisms.
Researchers have found that aging affects cells in different ways, but at the level of organs and tissues, changes tend to be similar. They studied the breast tissue, which is made of two types of cells: luminal and myoepithelial. The luminal cells change a lot with age and are thought to be the source of breast cancer. They think that aging affects that help cells lose their identity make them more likely to become cancer. They looked at gene expression in lum and myepithelial cells from women under 30 and over 55. They found age-related changes and increased variation in gene expression that made cells lose their identity. Changes were common in both types, but some were only in luminal and involved chromatin and genome regulators. A protein that helps cells talk to each other, GJB, increased with age and helped myepith cells change luminal cells. They found a signal in luminal cells that can be seen in cancer and used to predict cancer type. They think luminal cells are where aging affects are integrated and make them more likely to become cancer and a warning sign of cancer.
Scientists have been trying to understand why some plants are more resistant to pests and diseases, but it's a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Researchers explored if non-target DNA reads from plant sequencing can be used as a shortcut to answer this question. They studied 207 lines of a plant called pennycress (Thlas arse) grown in a controlled environment with aphids, mildew, and other microbes. The number of non-target reads assigned to pests differed between populations, had a genetic basis, and were linked to climate and glucosinolate content. Plants from cold and fluctuating habitats, less favorable to aphids, had more aphid DNA, meaning less resistance. Genome analysis found genetic variants in defense genes and new regions associated with aphid and mildew load. Differentially methylated regions were found with pathogen loads, particularly in transposons and hypomethylation of a gene involved in stomatal closure. This study provides insights into Thpi defense and shows non-target sequencing can estimate plant interactions.
Researchers are working to find new ways to combat malaria, a disease caused by Plasium falciparum parasite, which has become resistant to current treatments. One approach is using drug combinations that make parasite more sensitive to one drug when it's resistant to another. This study looked at compounds that target Plas falcum's dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) enzyme, which is crucial for parasite's survival. They tested several DHH mutant lines against a panel of DHH inhibitors and found one, TDC-125, was effective against all, including a line that arose from treatment with another candidate drug, DSM. When TDC-125 was used, most resistance was due to extra copies of the dhod gene, but one mutation, DHH263, made parasites resistant to TDC-125 but not DSM. Selecting DH276 with TDC-125 led to more changes in the dh gene, making parasites less sensitive to TDC-125 and resistant to DSM. Researchers tested if combining DSM and TDC-125 could prevent resistance by exposing wild parasites to both at once. This selected parasites with a mutation that made them resistant to both and as fit as wildtype in lab tests. This shows the enzyme's ability to adapt to mutations.
Researchers have found that the spread of antimal drug resistance varies greatly across different geographic regions. While most malaria infections occur in sub-Saharan Africa, resistant strains often emerge in low-transmission areas. Current models of resistance lack consensus on the relationship between transmission and resistance, possibly due to overlooking factors like antigen diversity, host immunity, and selection. To address this, a new model was developed that tracks sensitive and resistant strains, as well as host and antigen-specific immunity dynamics. Results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance, regardless of resistance or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant data supports this trend. Discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-trans regions, while decreases in high-divers, high-trans regions. The study highlights the role of malaria diversity in geographic patterns of resistance.

The diversity of Plasium falcum parasites has not been considered in mathematical models of drug resistance. Orders of magnitude differentiate antigen diversity among geographic zones drive differences in epidemiological features. The model shows that diversity and strain-specific immunity, tracked through parasite structure, can predict the relationship between transmission and resistance. It implies control protocols should vary region to region, and there is no one-size-fits cure for malaria worldwide. The inclusion of diversity provides a mechanistic explanation for Southeast Asia's persisting resistance to antimal drugs, despite lower transmission than Africa. In regions with low diversity, parasites can't reinfect hosts, so clinically immune hosts don't carry often.

The study presents a theoretical argument based on a mechanistic model, why regions show variation in invasion and maintenance of antimal resistance. The Malaria Project didn't predict prevalence before 200, while antimal drugs started early 200 in African countries. Comparisons were restricted to studies between 1990 and 200, using 200 as proxy. Studies with less than 20 were excluded.
Cannabis, the most widely used illicit psychoactive substance worldwide, is increasingly consumed by pregnant women, despite the presence of cannabinoid receptors in the embryo. However, the impact of phytocannabinoids on early embryonic development is not well understood. Researchers used a step-by-step in vitro system to study the effects of the most abundant phytocannabinoid, Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabin (Δ-THC) on early embryonic development. They found that Δ-TH increased the proliferation of naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but not their primed counterparts. Surprisingly, this increase was dependent on the CB1 receptor and associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ-TH rewired ESCs' metabolism by increasing glycolytic and anabolic capabilities. This metabolic rewiring was retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and altered their transcription profile.

The study tested three developmental windows: exposure of ESCs, exposure ELCs, and combined ESC+ELC exposure. Cells were exposed to vehicle or Δ-TH in a range of 0.1-100M, corresponding to physiological concentrations in cannabis users. Results showed a moderate but significant impact of Δ-TH on embryonic processes. The study highlights the importance of metabolic remodelling by ΔTH and its role as a driver of exposure through stages. Metabolic, transcription, and epigenetic reprogramming of PGCs during development is sensitive to environmental insults, with consequences in offspring. The study is the first to shed light on Δ-TH at stages unfolding during the first trimester in humans.
Researchers studied the immune system of the zebraf fish, a species with hundreds of NLR genes, to understand how these genes evolve and function. They sequenced 93 zebraf from wild and laboratory populations and found 151 NLR, more than the previously known 400. Half of these genes were present in all populations, but only 4% were found in 80% of fish. Wild zraf had up to twice as many NLR per individual and four times more per population than laboratory strains. Despite many copies, nucleotide diversity was low, with half monomorphic and few polymorphisms, suggesting purifying selection. This suggests evolution is not neutral. Expression of NLR is often induced by pathogen exposure, but most zraf NLR genes' function is unclear. Laboratory strains have reduced single nucleotide variation and NLR copy numbers, likely due to population bottleneck. The study lays groundwork for understanding mechanisms behind large vertebrate gene diversity.
Scientists have discovered a new type of ancient seed from the Famenn period, around 372-359 million years ago, in the Late Devonian era. This seed, called Alemenia, is special because it has three wings that extend outwards and inwards, unlike other seeds from the same time period that were usually had a protective cup around them. The researchers found Alia in Xin, Anhui, China, and it's the second seed from the Famenn without a cup. They think the wings on Alia might have helped with photosynthesis and dispersal, not just protection. This suggests that seeds with wings evolved before other dispersal methods like plumes and parachutes. Analysis shows that seeds with three wings are better suited for wind dispersal than those with one or four wings under the same conditions.
Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia is a type of blood cancer that is difficult to treat. Current treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have helped patients live longer, but the cancer often comes back and the treatments stop working. Researchers found a new way that RSYN and BCR-ABL work together in Ph leukemia, and RSY makes B-ABL more stable. This makes B-ABL harder to break down and stay in the body longer. RSY also makes BABL more stable by stopping it from being broken down by a protein called CBL. RSY also activates its own activity to make BABL more stable and help the cancer grow. 

In this study, RSY was found in many patients with Ph leukemia and made the disease worse by making BABL stable. The study found that RSY makes BABL stable by adding a tag to it. This makes BABL harder to break down and stay in the body longer. The study found that RSY is important in making BABL stable and helps the cancer grow. RSY was found in many patients with Ph and made the disease worse by making BABL stable. The study found that RSY makes BABL stable by adding a tag to it. This makes BABL harder to break down and stay the body longer.

Researchers have found a new way to discover enzymes called peptoglycan hydrolases that can break down peptoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls. These enzymes are promising alternatives to traditional antibiotics as they don't easily lead to resistance. However, finding these enzymes is challenging due to limited access to bacterial genomes. A new method uses antimicrobial peptides from bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, as a template to search for peoglycan hyrolases in bacterial proteomes. This method was tested on Acinetobacter baumannii, a type of bacteria. Two enzymes, PH10 and PH11, showed strong antibacterial activity even at high temperatures, while others were sensitive to heat. The structures of PH8, PH10, and PH11 were solved, revealing PH10's unique folding process and PH8's monomer formation. Mouse models showed PH10's safety and effectiveness. This method provides a new way to discover promising antimicrobial drugs.
Researchers analyzed data from 6.9 million patients in the Danish National Patient Registry from 1994 to 2018, including 23,592 diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. They also used text mining to extract symptoms from clinical notes in electronic health records of 3,078 cancer patients and 30,780 controls. The study found that text mining clinical notes captured more symptoms before diagnosis than registry codes alone. Symptoms like 'blood pressure without diagnosis', 'abnormal heartbeat', and 'intestinal obstruction' were not found in registry analysis. Trajectories of symptoms showed two groups with lower survival: 'Cough→jaundiceintestinal' and 'pain→jaiceabnormal function'. This study compared two types of pancreatic symptom trajectories, combining data to detect early risk factors for pancreatic cancer. 

The study included text vocabulary of known pancreatic symptoms and compared trajectories using registry and EHR data to characterize symptom ordering. It found significant symptoms before pancreatic cancer that could be early risk factors for screening. Registry and EHR symptoms were compared, showing more in EHRs than NPR. Future work could use AI and text mining to build multi-trajectories for early cancer prediction in clinics. This could guide better screening and improve lives of pancreatic patients. The study showed registry and EHR data can detect patterns before pancreatic diagnosis. EHR had more early symptoms, suggesting multi-modality could be used to detect cancer.
Researchers studied how brain activity during sleep changes from childhood to adulthood. They focused on two types of brain waves: slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz) and fast spindles (12.5-16 Hz) that occur during non-rapid eye movement sleep. These waves are important for memory and learning. The study looked at children aged 5-6, 8, 11, 14, and 18, and adults 20-26 years old. They found that in all age groups, fast sples in the adult frequency range (12.5-16 Hz) were coupled with slow oscillations. However, this coupling was less precise in children. The study also found that fast sples matured (became more adult-like) with age, and this was linked to better coupling with slow oscillations. This suggests that the ability to generate adult-like fast sples improves slow-oscillation coupling from childhood to young adulthood.
Despite the advancements in high-throughput technologies that have identified novel genes associated with biological processes and diseases since the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, many genes featured in prior publications persist. Researchers have proposed several hypotheses for the bias in selection of genes as research targets, but their explanatory powers have not been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are systematically abandoned in favor of better-stud genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understud genes remain abandoned by studies that cite -omics experiments. Conversely, we find that publications on understud genes even accrue a greater number of citations.

Among 45 biological and experimental factors proposed to affect genes being studied, 33 are associated with the choice of genes in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. To promote investigation of understud genes, we condense insights into a tool, find understud genes (FM), allowing scientists to engage bias during selection. We demonstrate FM's utility through identification of underst genes in vertebrate aging. FM is developed and available for download at fm.amal.northwestern.edu as MacOS/Windows app.

Our findings reinforce that understud genes are abandoned between experiments and results rather than later. Abandonment could be driven by researchers' concern that less-invest genes yield lower impact. We sought to identify point in process underst genes ignored using - experiments. A gene must travel pipeline from reality to results, extended by subsequent research. Lack of some genes not explained by lack evidence. We evaluated possibility understud frequently found hits but not investigated. To promote underst genes, we combined insights to create FM. Literature revealed tools promoting understud by publicizing underst. There may be no incentive authors to highlight understud. To illuminate abandoned, we reviewed factors proposed limit underst (Supplementary). These range evolutionary to chemical factors, e.g.
Artificially sweetened beverages containing non-caloric monosaccharides have been suggested as a healthier alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages, but their potential effects on blood vessel function are not well understood. Researchers created a zebraf model that exhibits excessive blood vessel growth, similar to a condition seen in diabetic retinopathy. Using this model, they found that glucose and non-caloric monacides cause excessive blood vessel formation, especially small, branched vessels. These vessels were formed by activated endothelial cells turning into tip cells. Single-cell sequencing of endothelial cells exposed to high glucose showed an increase in proliferating cells and upregulated pro-angiogenic genes. Further experiments showed that fox1 mediated excessive vessel growth by upregulating marck1. This study reveals negative effects of non-cal monacides on the vascular system and underlying mechanisms.

A zraf model was established that exhibits excessive vessel growth similar to diabetic retinopathy induced by glucose. The model was used to examine effects of non-cal monacides on vessel development and mechanisms. Glucose and nonacides induced excessive vessel growth by activating endothelial into tip cells. Effects of monacides on vessel growth were mediated by fox-marck pathway. Results provide insights into roles of nonacides in health and mechanisms.

Several studies have investigated glucose effects on vascular in zraf. However, association between nonacides and vessel dysfunctions, such as excessive vessel, has not been elucidated. Knockdown ofck1 mitigated excessive vessel caused high-glucose or high-glucose, resembling effect with VEG inhibitor. Results suggested monac induced vessel through fox-mar pathway in embryos. Further showed fox regulates this process by downregulating targetck, regardless of glucose or glucose. Together, results suggest both cal and nonacides lead vessel by promoting differentiation endothelial into cells through fox-mar
Researchers investigated how our brains process and store multiple sequences of information, such as a series of colors and locations. They found that when these sequences share a common structure, like a path or trajectory, it's easier to remember and recall them. Participants were shown a sequence of colors and locations, then asked to recall the colors and locations in order. Some sequences had consistent paths, while others didn't. Those with consistent paths performed better and showed a strong connection between color and location. Brain recordings showed shared activity during encoding and recall, and spontaneous replay of sequences when recalling locations. This suggests a common structure is used to store multiple sequences by compressing and replaying them, making it easier to organize in working memory.

EEG recordings confirmed this strategy, showing shared activity during encoding and retention, and replay of sequences during recall. This activity is linked to working memory and behavior. When preparing to recall a sequence, the relevant color sequence replayed spontaneously, highlighting the connection between color and location when they share a path. With color-location correlation in behavior, findings suggest replay mechanisms in working memory use common structures to combine sequences.

Behavioral and neural evidence supports using common structures to facilitate working memory. Sequences with aligned color trajectories showed better memory and a strong correlation between color and location. Replay has been proposed to represent structure, inference, and generalization. When recalling sequences, replay occurs for color but not location, supporting spontaneous replay, as color features aren't relevant now.
Scientists have discovered that mutations in the PUR gene cause a rare neurodevelopmental disorder called PUR syndrome. Unlike many other genetic disorders, almost all mutations in this gene result in the disease. Researchers studied how these mutations affect the PUR protein and found that they impair its ability to bind to RNA, fold, and interact with other proteins. They also solved the 3D structure of the protein and used computer simulations to see how it moves. The results show that PUR is very flexible and prone to damage, which explains why even small changes in the gene cause full symptoms in patients.

The study found that even small changes in the protein can cause problems. This was seen in the structure of a mutated version of PUR, where a part of the protein is exposed to the outside. Computer simulations also showed that the N-terminal part of PUR moves a lot. This is different from other disorders like Rett syndrome, where mutations are usually in specific hotspots. In PUR syndrome, mutations are scattered throughout the protein.

Over 270 mutations in the PUR gene have been found in 650 patients with the disorder. Researchers wanted to know how these affect the protein's structure and function. This study is the first to look at how these mutations affect PUR's ability to bind RNA, unwind, and move to stress granules in cells. Some variants were predicted to have folding problems, but this study confirmed it.

The results show that PUR syndrome-causing mutations damage the protein's structure and function. This helps explain why patients have full symptoms. The study provides new understanding of the disorder and how it affects the protein. Further research is needed to understand why some patients have mild symptoms.
Researchers have found that a protein called TRPV4 interacts with another protein called ANO1 in sweat glands in the feet of mice, which could play a role in sweating. They discovered that TR4 is present in secretory cells of sweat glands in mouse foot pads and colocalized with other proteins called cytokeratin and aquapor-5. When menthol, a known activator of TR8, was applied, it inhibited sweating in both wild-type and TR4-deficient mice. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in wild-type mice was temperature-dependent, but not in TR4-deficient mice, and was inhibited by menthol in both wild-type and TR8KO mice. Without acetylcholine stimulation, sweating was inhibited by AN1 inhibitor. The study suggests that TR4 is involved in temperature-dependent sweating via interaction with AN1, and TR4 or the TR4/AN1 complex could be targeted to develop agents that regulate sweating.

The researchers also found that TR4-expressing secretory cells are involved in secretion of macromolecular components as well as water and ions. They showed that TR4 and AN1 form a complex that promotes secretion in eccrine glands of mouse pads. TR4 is expressed in human eccrine glands and sweat glands are innervated by sympathetic neurons, acetylcholine is released from nerve endings. The interaction of TR4 and AN1 is involved in temperature-dependent sweating and friction.

The study examined TR4 expression in sweat glands in mouse pads and found that wild-type sweat glands responded to TR4 agonist and acetylcholine. Temperature-dependent basal sweating without stimulation was observed in wild-type, but not TR4 mice. Menthol inhibited both TR4 and AN1, suggesting it would inhibit sweating. The study detected TR4, AN1, and water channel aquapor-5 in eccrine glands mouse pads.
Researchers have discovered a universal pattern in the shape and size of the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain, across different species. They found that all cortices can be described as a series of folds of different sizes that merge together. When these folds merge, the cortices of 11 primate species and 70 other mammalian species follow a similar pattern. This suggests that all cortices are approximations of the same shape with a fractal dimension of 2.5. This new understanding allows for a more precise measurement of brain shape at different scales. To demonstrate its importance, researchers showed that brain size changes with age, with a four times increase from two to eight standard deviations at a scale of 2mm. This new understanding may lead to biomarkers for various conditions in the future.

The study proposes a new way to describe brain shape as a function of scale, not just a list of measures or listing sulci and gyri. This method can show biological processes acting on specific scales, leaving others untouched, like aging. It suggests a blueprint for mammalian brain shape and common mechanisms governing folding. The new method can also differentiate subtle changes better than current metrics at a single scale, with comparable sizes for classification. Researchers found that primate and mammalian brains share shape properties beyond fractal dimension. They demonstrated a universal scaling equation for primate and mammalian cortices, with same fractal dimension 2.5 for all. Fractal scaling has been postulated for cortical morphology, with recent use of MRI data. Estimates of fractal dimension for whole cortex are close 2.5.
Researchers studied the role of the NF-κB transcription factor REL in pancreatic cancer cells, specifically in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). They found that REL is upregulated in PDAC tumors and plays a key role in immune and stress responses. Using live-cell imaging, they observed that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNα) induces rapid and sustained nuclear translocation of REL. Analysis of single-cell data showed that REL heterogeneity in PDAC cells depends on actin dynamics. RNA sequencing identified REL-regulated genes, including TNα-induced upregulation of actin regulators NU2 and ARHG31. Knockdown of ARHG and NU2 altered TNα-stimulated REL dynamics, establishing a negative feedback loop that regulates REL activation by TNα. The study also characterized the NF-κ pathway in PD cells, showing NF-κ/Iκ proteins interact with REL in the presence or absence of TNα. They found that actin modulators ARHG/NU2 are both REL targets and regulators of nuclear REL with TNα, providing a mechanism between actin and REL. In contrast, NF1 and NF2 showed increased interaction with REL TNα, forming NF-κ heteromers with REL, NF1 and NF2 in PD cells. The study suggests Iβ plays a role in suppressing TNα induction of REL in PD cells, and REL is modulated by NF-κ/I proteins in the absence of stress or inflammatory cues.
A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is crucial for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABA system, which alter this balance, are common in various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in Phosphase Tens Hom (PTEN), the main regulator of the phosphatidyositol 3-phosphate/Akt pathway, are associated with ASD. However, it's unclear if PTEN can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using Caenorhabditis elegans neuromus system, both excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (GABA) inputs regulate muscle activity, d-18/EN mutations impact GABA but not cholin development and function. This results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. Defects in the GABA system d-18EN mutants are due to reduced D-16 activity during development. Ketogenic diets (KDs) have proven effective for disorders with E imbalances. However, mechanisms remain elusive. A diet with ketone body-hydrobutyrate during development induces D-16 activity, improving GABA development in d-EN mutants. Our study links PT mutations and neurodevelopment defects and delves mechanisms underlying KD effects.
Researchers have found that the body's innate immune response to the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, plays a crucial role in the development of the disease. They discovered that certain factors released by immune cells, called monocytes, can stop the virus from entering and infecting cells. By testing different cytokines, or signaling molecules, they found that interleukin-1, or IL-1, a key player in inflammation, prevents the virus from spreading between cells. This happens because IL-1 activates a pathway that creates actin, a protein, at the cell junctions between infected and healthy cells, stopping the virus from jumping from one cell to another. Experiments in mice showed that IL-1 reduces the spread of the virus in the lungs. This study reveals a new role for cytokines in fighting viruses and highlights potential targets for treatment.
Researchers studied the role of insulin-producing cells in fruit flies, called IPCs, which are similar to human pancreatic beta cells that release insulin into the bloodstream. They used electrophysiological recordings to investigate how nutritional state affects IPC activity and found that it decreases with starvation and increases with feeding with glucose or fructose, but not with non-nutritive sugars. This is similar to the mammalian incretin effect, where glucose ingestion drives insulin release more than intravenous application. In contrast, a different neurons called DH44s in the brain respond to glucose perfusion but do not affect IPC activity. Functional experiments showed that DH44s inhibit other neurons that do affect IPC. This suggests two populations of neurons work together to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Activating IPC had a satiety effect on food-seeking behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, while activating DHs increased hyperactivity. The study demonstrates that IPC and DHs are part of a network that regulates glucose homeostasis and behavior in response to metabolic shifts. Insulin release is not solely dictated by sugar levels but influenced by multiple factors, including nutritional state. In vivo recordings showed IPC activity diminishes during starvation and rebounds after glucose. This is consistent with previous studies showing accumulation of DPs. Insulin release is modulated by enteroendocrine signals. IPC sense glucose in circulating hemolymph to release insulin in response to increases. Previous studies suggested IPC sense glucose autonomously, which is derived from glucose. Trehalose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, suggesting IPC do not directly sense hemol sugar levels. This is similar to mammals, IPC activity and insulin release is not modulated by hemol concentration. Several pathways could contribute to this. A subset of octaminergic neurons expressing Doph insulin receptor are necessary for regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity, implicating IPC in modulating foraging behavior.
Scientists have developed a new tool to study proteins in living cells called endogenous tags. These tags help researchers understand how proteins work in cells. However, creating these tags in human cells is challenging due to low efficiency. A new protein called splitNeGreen was used to create a large library of endogenous tags in human cells. This opens the door to studying proteins in healthy cells and different types. Researchers engineered a cell line to express a part of the splitGreen protein and showed it efficiently tags proteins. They also used imaging to study cellular processes like cell division in stem cells. This is a step towards creating a library of endogenous tags in human cells.

Researchers used stem cells to study cell division with high resolution. This work provides a basis for a high-quality library of endogenous tags in stem cells to study proteins across cell types. A cell line was engineered to express a part of the splitGreen protein and validated. It was used to tag multiple proteins and isolate tagged cells. This provides a foundation for a library of endogenous tags in stem cells.

The splitGreen system is efficient and easy to use. It retains brightness of the original protein. This allows tagging in cells where the protein is expressed. A library of proteins in cells requires high-throughput. Self-complementing fluorescent proteins can be used for large tagging.
Scientists have long used lesions to study the connection between the brain and behavior, but they can provide even more insight when combined with multielectrode techniques in neuroscience. A new platform has been developed to create electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted intracort multielectro probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophiology. A custom current source provides stable current for controlled repeatable lesions in awake animals. The performance of this lesion technique was validated using histology ex vivo and in vivo, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesion. This method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submill precision the location of the injury, and electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining population after lesion.

The technique can be used in many areas of cortex, several species, and theoretically with multielectrode. The low-cost device can easily be adopted into existing electrophiology setup. This is expected to enable causal investigations of the population's role in function while providing insight into reorganization after loss. A custom source was built to ensure stable current delivery throughout lesions, for repeated, and across different types and animals. The design can be used creating intrac electrodes for electrophiology and electrolytic.

The technique works with multielect probe testing in vivo rabbit cortex. There are no limitations preventing from working with any multielect probe. The method enables small inactivation while maintaining neuroelectroph recordings. Selection of current, amplitude, duration, and location offers combinations for investigations into the role of activity. This demonstrates spanning probes across rabbits, pigs, sheep, and macaques, and can be used with smaller species like rats. The approach is limited to superficial structures due to accessibility.
Bees play a crucial role in pollinating crops, but their populations are at risk due to pesticide use. One of the main threats they face is poisoning from pesticides in nectar and pollen. Research on neonicotinoids has shown mixed results on whether bees can taste these pesticides in sugar solutions and avoid them. This study tested whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestr) can detect pesticides in a solution mimicking nectar of oilseed (Brassica nap). Bees did not avoid solutions containing concentrations of imaclopr, thiamox, clothin, or sulfox spanning six orders of magnitude, even at lethal doses. Only high concentrations altered spiking in gustatory neurons, reducing firing or changing rate. This shows bees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant pesticides using mouthparts. Since bees rarely contact nectar with other parts, they are at risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in nectar of pesticide-treated crops.
Researchers studied the prevalence of Plasmodium knowlesi, a type of malaria parasite, in non-human primates (NHP) in Southeast Asia. This parasite is a public health concern and a barrier to malaria elimination in the region. They analyzed data from 632 NHP from 148 sites and found that prevalence varies across the region, with low overall and high rates in Malaysian Borne. They found that areas with high NHP prevalence overlap with human infection hotspots and transmission linked to land conversion and fragmentation. Using remote sensing and statistical models, they identified a relationship between P know in NHP and forest fragmentation, suggesting higher prevalence in complex habitats. This study fills gaps in understanding P know epidemiology and indicates simian reservoirs may drive human spillo risk.

The researchers aimed to assemble a georeferenced dataset of P know in NHP, evaluate variation by region, and assess environmental and spatial factors. They found associations between landscape and variation in simian Plasium spp in primates unexplored. They hypothesized that P know in NHP is spatially heterogeneous and driven by forest loss and fragmentation, contributing to land use and know risk. This study is the first to assess P know in NHP at regional scale and wide habitats. Prediction intervals indicate heterogeneity within regions, consistent with variability across sites. Forest plots for prevalence can be found in Appendix 2. Covariate and P know data used to explore relationships between landscape and N malaria.

The study highlights spatial heterogeneity and landscape driving know infection in NHP. Given intersection between epidemiology and ecology, it's essential to consider dynamics within reservoirs in public interventions.
Scientists have reconstructed the evolutionary history of a group of beetles called Belidae, also known as weevils, that feed on plants. They found that these beetles originated around 138 million years ago in the supercontinent Gondwana, where they likely fed on conifer plants. As Gwana broke apart, beetles tracked their host plants to distant landmasses. Some beetles shifted to feed on cycads and angiosperms when conifers declined, developing new relationships including mutualisms with cycads and parasitic angperms. Today, beetles are found in many parts of the world, with recent radiations in Australia and Hawaii.

Belidae are thought to have originated in Gwana, with two subfamilies Belinae and Oxycninae in Australia and Neotropical regions. Their likely host plants were conifers and angiosperms. Belinae had conifers as hosts, while Oxycinae had angperms. The two subfamilies diverged when Gana split. Both lineages still feed on their ancestral plants. In the East Gana clade, Belinae diverged 44.7 million years ago, during the separation of South America and Australia. Some beetles use plant organs opportunistically, feeding on different parts. Belidae originated 138 million years ago when South and Australia were connected via Antarctica.
Researchers have studied how tumors grow and change over time by looking at hundreds of samples from liver cancer tumors in two and three dimensions. They found that tumors grow mostly from the inside out, not just on the surface, and that mutations are spread throughout the tumor, not just on the edge. This helps us understand how tumors start and grow in the body and can be applied to high-resolution data in the field of spatial biology.

The researchers used data from previous studies on liver tumors at high resolution to analyze how tumors grow in the body. They are not the first to link tumor sampling with evolution on a larger scale, previous studies on primary and metastatic tumors showed dynamics of metastasis. They also form the basis of most population-genetic approaches analyzing tumor data.

To compare two different dynamics, they used high-resolution data on spatial distribution of mutations in tumors. From the distribution, it's possible to infer spatio-temporal of tumor evolution: is growth uniform across tumor or mostly at edge, and interplay between tissue and genetic dynamics. They used whole-exome data from liver carcinomas and previously published to infer how tumors grew earlier stages. To end, they developed metrics intra-tumor heterogeneity leveraging spatial position information.

This is different from surface growth, a dispersal mechanism postulated for observed distribution. To probe migration between regions, they looked at number of mutations in limited samples.
Scientists have discovered a new mechanism that helps an insect, Copsa chinensis, adapt to changing seasons by changing its physical appearance. This insect has two forms: summer-form and winter-form, with distinct features. Previous research showed that temperature and a protein called CTR regulate the change from summer to winter. However, the underlying process was not fully understood. A hormone called Bicon, responsible for hardening and darkening the insect's outer layer, was found to play a key role in this process. Researchers identified two subunits of Bicon, CBα and CBβ, which are regulated by low temperature and CTR. These subunits form a complex that influences the insect's outer layer and helps it change from summer to winter. They also found a receptor for Bicon, called CB-R, which plays a crucial role in signaling the process. A small RNA, mi-2, targets CB-R to regulate Bicon's function in the seasonal change. This study reveals a new mechanism behind the insect's seasonal change and provides insights into Bicon and its receptor. 

The researchers found that Bicon's subunits are more active in winter-form than summer, suggesting a role in the seasonal change. They tested the effect of low temperature and CTR on the sub's expression and found it increased. They identified the receptor for Bicon, CB-R, which has similar expression patterns to the subunits and is more active in winter. This suggests the sub and receptor are essential for the change from summer to winter by affecting the insect's outer layer. To study Bicon's role, they found a leucine-rich protein receptor, CB-R, which mediates the change by affecting pigment, content and thickness. A small RNA, mi-2, targets CB-R to regulate Bicon's function in the seasonal change. These findings show Bicon and its receptor play a key role in insect development and may be necessary for tanning in all insects.
Diffuse midline gliomas (DM) are aggressive and fatal tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatment. A mutation of the lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27M) is a driver in DM, reshaping the epigenetic landscape to promote tumorigenesis. H-K27 gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. Researchers examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting histone deacetyl (HD) and MY in these tumors. Treatment of H-K27-derived cells with Sop, an inhibitor of MY-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HD inhibitor Vorin, resulted in substantial decrease in viability. Transcript and epigen profiling revealed synergistic effect of this combination in downregulation of oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. In vivo studies of patient-derived orthopic xenograft showed significant tumor reduction in mice treated with the combination. These results highlight combined with HD and MY inhibitors as a promising approach for these aggressive tumors.

A novel strategy targeting epigen and transcriptional pathways in H-K27-mant DM is proposed. HD inhibition, with the MY inhibitor, inhibited oncogenic signatures and reduced growth in vivo. Findings emphasize ep dependencies of H27-driven gliomas and the potential of combined for this malignancy. Histone acylation is a potential target for cancer, with pan-deacetyl inhibitors such as Vor and Panin found to inhibit growth and restore expression in H27 gliomas. H27 gliomas are characterized dereg of ep pathways affecting post-transl modifications of 27 methylation and acylation and 4 methylation on hist H Bender et al, Chan et al, Lewis et Kr et, Fur et Harun et. High amplification of MY is observed in pediatric gliomas Bucowicz et Mack. H27 show high of MY and MY genes due ep alterations and variants in viability on MY signaling Kr et Paj et Dubois.

The PIN inhibitor Sop was shown to downregulate MY genes in vitro and block MY-driven in murine neuroblastoma models. To address an effective therapy for H27 DM, dual of histone and MY activation using Vor and Sop was tested.
The white-footed deerm (Peromys leucopus) is a long-lived rodent that serves as a reservoir for several zoonotic diseases in North America, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasis, and viral encephalitis. Despite being persistently infected with these pathogens, the deerm shows no apparent disability or diminished fitness. Researchers compared the genome-wide transcription in blood of P. leuc, mice (Mus musculus) and rats (Rattus norvegicus) after exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens. P. leuc was distinguished from mice and rats by LPS profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. In contrast, P. le displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower fold-changes in type 1 interfer-stimulated genes. These characteristics were also noted in a Borrelia herms infection model. The phenomenon was associated with reduced transcription of endogenous retroirus and cytoplasmic pattern receptors in the deerm. The results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in this species and other animal reservoirs for human disease.

P. leopus and M. mus had differentially expressed genes (DE) in blood, spleen, and liver. The deerm's inflammation phenotype was consistent with 'alternatively' M-type macrophage polarization instead of 'classically' M-type observed in M. mus. 'leocyte' and'migration' were down-regulated in M mus, while'response virus', 'interferon-beta', 'inter-gamma', 'protoan', and type II signaling were upregulated. P. le had restrained transcription response for M2, with greater fold-ch from baseline in M for M8, Sl, S1009, and Ilb, the interleukin-1 beta.

The white-footed deerm continues to thrive while infected with disease agents it serves as reservoir. Diverse tick pathogens and diseases for humans include extracellular Borre burgdorferi (Lyme), intracellular Anlas phagtophil (anlas), protoan Babes micro (babes), and Powan flav (encephal). le and LPS M mus had similar slopes, but y-intercept shifted towards higher neutils to lymph for blood from L group de. Control mice and de and LPS had percentages ~5 monocytes; mean rose 10 in L de (p0.12).
Caspases, a family of proteases, play a crucial role in cleaving and activating gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis. In humans, caspase 3 and casp 7 recognize the same motif DD, present in gasder E (GME). However, human GME is cleaved by cas 3 but not cas 7. The mechanism behind this observation is unclear. Researchers identified pyroptic puffer GME that was cleaved by puffer cas 3 and human cas 7. Domain swapping between puffer and human cas and GME showed the GME C-terminus and cas 7 subunit determined cleavage of GME by cas. Cas 7 contains a key residue that governs cas discrimination. This residue is conserved in vertebrate cas 3 and most vertebrates except mammals. In mammals, the residue is conserved in non-primates but not primates. However, cas7 cleaved human GME but not GME. These findings revealed mechanism of cas discrimination and divergence of cas 7-mediated GME in vertebrates. Results also suggested mutation-mediated alteration of cas enabled divergence and specialization of cas members in regulation of cellular activities in mammals.

A study found that puffer GME, belonging to teleost lineage, was cleaved by cas 3 and 7 at site to liberate pypt-inducing fragment. Teleost have two GME orthologs, G and Gb. Human cas 3 and 7 share same recognition motif, but 3 not 7 cleaves humanME at site. Mechanism is unknown. Researchers found puffer T. Results suggest independent of GME and cas7 in mice, which distanced GME and cas from each other. Similarly, 7 and GME may have undergone independent evolution, leading to disengagement ofME from relationship with 7. Identified tele GME that can be cleaved fish and cas3 to trigger pyptosis. Mutation cleavage site inhibited pypt and decreased LD release andME cleavage. Results indicated 3 cleavage required to activate GME-mediated pyptosis. SinceME is cleaved by  but not 7, observation thatME cleaved both and 3 intrigued to explore mechanism.
Ketamine has emerged as a promising treatment for treatment-resistant depression, but individual variability in response to the medication is not well understood. Researchers conducted a study to investigate how ketamine's molecular mechanisms connect to its neural and behavioral effects. 40 healthy participants received ketamine, and their brain activity was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The study found that ketamine's effects are multi-dimensional, reflecting individual variability in response. The neural effects of ketamine matched gene patterns of somatostatin and parvalbum cortical expression in humans, but not the mean effect did. Behavioral symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, resolvable at the single-subject level. These results highlight the importance of considering individual variation in response to ketamine and have implications for developing precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment in psychiatry.

Ketamine has been shown to be effective in treating treatment-resistant depression, but individual differences in response have been observed. A single ketamine infusion results in a response rate of 65% in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, this failed to replicate in patients 48 hours post-ketamine, suggesting a complex relationship between ketamine's acute and delayed effects. Graph theoretical approaches have demonstrated ketamine induces a shift from cortical to subcortically-centred brain, particularly basal ganglia and cerebellum. Limited studies have characterised ketamine's neural-level alterations using whole-brain approaches, showing ketamine results in brain-wide effects. For example, ketamine increases global connectivity in prefrontal cortex in healthy controls and normalizes reduced connectivity in patients with depression 24 post-ketamine.

The study hypothesized that ketamine results in multiple neural and behavioral axes of variation, reflecting individual variability in response. A multi-dimensional approach was used to capture ketamine's effects and relate to molecular mechanisms, specifically somatatin and parbum cortical expression. The extent of multi-dimension was investigated by comparing ketamine to other psychoactive substances with different pharmacological profiles: psilocin, preferential 5-HTA and 5-HTA agonist, and LSD, stimulating serotonin and dopamine receptors.
Researchers have proposed the RNA world hypothesis, which suggests that the first self-replicating units of life existed in the form of RNA-like polymers. However, this raises a problem: how did these units replicate without enzymes, and how did they maintain their information over time? To address this, scientists studied the growth of RNA-like replicators in a controlled environment with a constant population size. They found that large populations with small differences in replication rates allowed many species to coexist, and reduced the problem of errors in replication. The study also showed that the properties of the RNA, such as GC content, and the availability of resources, influenced how many variants could coexist.

The researchers used a model to study the growth of RNA-like replicators, taking into account errors and constraints. They found that parabolic growth was resistant to mutations, and proposed a simple way to solve the error problem of storing information in RNA. They also showed that Darwinian selection, or the survival of the fittest, was possible in this system. To test this, they used a model where resources were limited, and found that competition led to a switch from coexistence to survival of the fittest.

The study suggests that parabolic growth could have played a role in preserving sequences generated by random synthesis and providing genetic material for early ribozymes. It can also be used to study the evolution of naked and encapsulated replicators. However, there are other theories on the origin of life, such as metabolism first or autotrophic origins. The study shows that parabolic growth can sustain many competing species, but is prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, which promotes coexistence. In the infinite population limit, par growth can sustain unlimited competing species.
Scientists have discovered that the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, called Nsp, cleaves a human enzyme called TR1, which is necessary for modifying RNA in cells. When SARS-CoV infects human cells, TR1 levels decrease and RNA modifications are reduced, indicating that N cleavage of TR1 by Nsp. Nsp cleaves TR1 at a specific site matching the sequence of SARSV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a mutation in this site inhibits Nsp-dependent cleavage of TR1. The cleaved TR1 fragments have altered RNA activity and can't rescue RNA modification in TR1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type cells, TR1-deficient cells infected with SARSV-2 have reduced intracellular RNA levels. These findings show that Nsp cleavage of TR1 and perturbation of RNA patterns contribute to the pathogenesis of SARSV-2 infection. SARS-2 infection correlates with decreased TR1 levels and reduced m2G-modified RNAs, and TR1 is required for efficient SARS-2 replication in human cells. Studies uncover TR1 as a novel cleavage target of Nsp during SARS-2 infection and suggest mechanisms associated with perturbations in TR-catalyzed RNA.
Scientists have long wondered how some microbes become disease-causing pathogens, while others don't. A new research suggests that some microbes can become pathogens by chance, rather than being born to be one. The study looked at yeast, a type of fungus, and found that when it evolved to stick to a plastic surface, it also became more likely to form groups and grow in groups. This made it more deadly to a moth larvae. The study supports the idea that a beneficial trait, like sticking to a surface, can lead to a microbe becoming a pathogen by chance. 

To test this idea, researchers made yeast stick to a plastic for many generations and then tested how deadly it was to moths. They found that yeast that stuck well to plastic were more likely to kill moths than those that didn't. This shows that sticking to a surface can make a microbe more deadly. The study used yeast because it's easy to study and found in many places. It's also a good model for understanding how microbes work. The researchers wanted to see if sticking to a surface would make yeast more deadly and if it would form groups. They found it did, and it was more deadly to moths. This shows that sticking to a surface can make a microbe more deadly by chance.
Researchers have found that certain proteins called prion-like domains (PLDs) are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations, which can lead to the formation of abnormal biomolecular condensates. They used a computer model called Mpipi to study the impact of amino mutations on the stability of PLDs from six proteins: hnPA, T43, F, US, WS, RB14, T1, and IA. The simulations revealed scaling laws that quantify the change in critical temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino sequence mutations. These laws are consistent with physical properties of mutations and extend across the tested family, suggesting they can be used to predict changes in stability of PL condens.

The study found that for at least one protein, hnPA, there are rules that explain changes in thermodynamic parameters of condens in response to precise amino-acid mutations. They investigated whether scaling laws can predict changes in critical parameters of a broader set of PLDs in response to amino sequence mutations. The laws are cumulative, meaning effects of successive mutations can be predicted by addition of laws as long as resulting mutation stays within PL composition and patterning.

The researchers used a systematic approach to vary amino sequence of PLDs to determine how phase changes with amino compositional perturbations. For each type of mutation, they defined and tested three types of scaling. They found that changes in critical temperatures of PL as function of number and type amino sequence can be quantified by scaling, conserved across family of PL investigated.

The data was organized in a table to illustrate effect of single mutations on critical temperatures of family PL as function of PL length. Consistent with evidence and predictions, interactions involving aromatic residues are dominant in stabilizing condens formed by PL.
Predicting an individual's cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a key goal in modern neuroscience, but current approaches often miss a crucial aspect: how an individual's brain activity unfolds over time. Traditional methods use structural or time-averaged measures, but these don't capture dynamic patterns. A new approach uses a Hidden Markov model (HMM) and Fisher kernel to describe and predict traits. The Fisher is constructed mathematically, preserving the model's structure, making it ideal for combining generative and predictive models. This is important for studies with small sample sizes and heterogeneous data.

The approach, called H-Fisher, was tested on fMRI data and shown to be accurate and reliable. It was compared to other methods, time-vary and time-aver models, and outperformed them. The Hisher approach leverages individual's time-vary and functional patterns for prediction, with applications in cognitive and personalized medicine.

The study aimed to establish a method describing brain activity over time to predict traits. The Hisher approach accurately and reliably predicted traits from neuroimaging data, preserving the model's structure. This is crucial for studies with small sample sizes and heterogeneous data. The approach was tested on fMRI and simulated data, focusing on within-session changes in functional and amplitude. The Hidden Markov Model (H) was used, a probabilistic model of time-vary and functional dynamics. Despite its importance, reliability is often ignored in predicting traits from neuroim features. The Fisher approach, preserving the H's structure, accurately and reliably predicted traits from brain dynamics.

The Hisher was compared to kernels ignoring the model's structure and a previously used method based on Kull-Leibler divergence. It outperformed methods based on timeaver functional connectivity.
Researchers have found that a protein called leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRK2) is involved in two diseases: Parkinson's disease (PD) and Crohn's disease. LR2 variants lead to increased phosphorylation of its substrates. To understand how LR2 activity is regulated, scientists performed a targeted RNA screen and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LR2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10. Using imaging and immunopurification methods, they isolated lysosomes and found that Rab12 is recruited to damaged lysosomes, leading to an increase in LR2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10. PD variants, including LR2 R144G and V35DN, lead to increased LR2 recruitment to lysosomes and elevated levels of pRab10. This suggests a conserved mechanism where Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates recruitment of LR2 and phosphorylation of its substrates at lysosomes.

LR2's recruitment to lysosomes may promote phosphorylation by increasing local concentration of LR in proximity to substrates. Researchers hypothesized this might explain LR activation in additional contexts beyond lysosomal damage. They examined two PD-linked variants associated with increased LR activity, LR144 and V35DN, and found increased LR on lysosomes. Using endogenous conditions, they demonstrated that Rab, not Rab, regulates LR-mediated phosphorylation of Rab and Rab regulates localization and activation of LR on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress. PD-linked LR variant144, outside LR's domain, and V35 have increased LR activity in previous studies and confirmed here. There's a need to define LR recruitment to lysosomes, how steps to LR activation, and how conserved mechanisms in PD.

LR2 activity is observed in pathogenic variants and sporadic patients, but questions remain regarding regulation and response to endysosomal stress. Researchers identify Rab as novel regulator of LR activation and demonstrate Rab plays critical role in mediating LR-dependent phosphorylation response lysosomal. They show Rab promotes phosphorylation by recruiting LR to lysosomes following membrane. Pathogenic variants V35 and LR144 result in increased LR and pRab on lysosomes. Data delineate conserved mechanism LR regulated and response lysosomal and genetic variants disease.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the cell cycle of non-adherent cells, which are cells that don't stick to surfaces. Current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, but non-adherent cells remain challenging. The new method combines a specialized surface to enhance attachment, the FUCCI (CA2) sensor, automated image analysis, and machine learning. This allows precise measurement of cell cycle durations in non-adherent cells. The method was tested in myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi, which have unique cycle characteristics. The impact of cycle-modulating drugs on NB cells was also tested. The system is also compatible with adherent cells and is fully automated, providing insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This presents a valuable tool for cancer research and drug development by enabling automated cycle analysis in both adherent and nonherent cells.

The method was validated by tracking cells and manual correction of inaccurate analysis. The workflow is explained and illustrated in a figure. Single cells were followed and annotated according to red and green images. The impact of CD inhibitors was qualitatively confirmed. The difference in cycle progression of NB vs Kasumi cells was evident. Time-lapse images were composed of red and green channels detecting markers of the FUCCI (2 indicator.

The method allows researchers to analyze thousands of non-adherent cells per condition using image and data pipelines to perform processing, tracking, filtering, and cycle identification. The workflows rely on Fiji and R software, widely used by the community. Scripts are publicly available for customization. This streamlines cycle of cells expressing FUCCI (2 and makes it accessible to researchers with basic knowledge.
Researchers studied the brains of 16 primate species to understand how social and environmental factors contributed to the evolution of their cognitive abilities. They found that the size of two brain regions, the frontal pole (FP) and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DFC), involved in metacognition and working memory, were linked to a combination of social and ecological variables. The size of these regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by body mass, daily distance traveled, and population density. This suggests that metacognition and working memory are crucial for foraging in primates. FP was more sensitive to social constraints than DFC, in line with studies showing FP's role in complex interactions. The study highlights the weight of social vs ecological constraints on evolution of prefrontal brain and associated operations in primates.

The researchers used brain imaging data from 16 primate species to measure the size of FP and DFC and their relation to socio-ecological variables. They assumed that the more a cognitive function would be required to face a socioecological challenge, the bigger the brain region would be. The aim was not to identify anatomical boundaries, but to evaluate the strength of relation between regions and socioec variables across species. The size of FP and metac skills not related to population but also daily distance, compatible with the ecological hypothesis. The study complements laboratory and bridges the gap between neurosciences, ecology, and primate evolution.

FP and working are critical for foraging, especially when traveling long distances and dealing with complex navigation. This is in line with the ecological hypothesis, but provides insight into specific operations. The size of DFC, used for working and planning, showed relation with daily distance and to lesser with population. This suggests functions play in DFC in foraging.
Researchers have long wondered how muscle fibers grow in response to increased loading, such as during exercise. Specifically, they wanted to know if growth is due to larger myofils (the building blocks of muscle) getting bigger or more myils being added. To study this, they developed a new method to visualize myils using a standard microscope, called fluorescence imaging of myils with deconvolution (F-ID). This method provides high-resolution images and contrast, allowing for automated measurements of myil size and number. The team validated this method by comparing it to electron microscopy, a more precise but time-consuming method. They then used it to study mouse and human muscles that were subjected to increased loading and found that growth is largely due to adding more myils, not making them bigger.
Researchers studied three mutations in the SNAP25 gene that cause a rare form of epilepsy called epileptic encephalopathy. They found that these mutations, V48, D166, and I67, affect how the protein interacts with another protein called synaptagmin-1 (Sy1) and how it forms a complex with other proteins to release vesicles. The mutations reduced the ability of these vesicles to dock and fuse with the cell membrane in response to calcium, a chemical signal that triggers release. Two of the mutations, V48 and D166, led to an increase in spontaneous release of neurotransmitters, which can cause seizures, and a decrease in the number of vesicles ready to release. This is opposite of what happens in mice without the Sy1 protein. The mutations also increased the association of SNAP with other proteins, leading to uncontrolled fusion of vesicles. In contrast, the I67 mutation decreased the release of neurotransmitters due to a higher energy barrier for fusion. The researchers suggest that these mutations change the energy landscape for release and priming, making it easier or harder for vesicles to release.
Researchers analyzed data from 30 countries and found that disciplines with a higher proportion of women tend to have lower quality research evaluations and lower funding rates. This applies to both men and women, and is consistent across various measures such as the number of research outputs and bibliometric data. The study builds on previous findings that women's work is undervalued, regardless of who performs it.

The study used datasets of thousands of researchers and looked at funding rates and quality scores separately. It found a correlation between the quality of a researcher's work and the gender balance of their discipline. Both male and female researchers in female-dominated fields receive lower evaluations. This is robust across different disciplines and bibliometric measures. Funding rates also show a similar correlation, with male-dominated fields having higher success and quality than female-dominated. Accounting for researcher characteristics like age, institution, and publishing patterns, the results remain the same.

Researchers in male-dominated fields have higher funding and quality than female-dominated. This applies to both men and women. The findings do not suggest research in female-dominated fields is of lower quality, but rather that it's evaluated as lower than male-dominated. This affects everyone, but women more than men. A previous study found that as workforce becomes more female, salaries fall. To see if evaluation of research quality changes with feminization, longitudinal data is needed, which is not available. It's possible that female-dominated research is evaluated lower due to feminization over time.
Scientists have been working to create artificial circuits within living cells that can process information in a predictable way similar to electronic circuits. One key component of this is genome editing, which allows for the expression of specific genes or recording of information to DNA. However, controlling protein-protein interactions that trigger genome editing has been a challenge. Researchers have developed a new strategy called P3, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 guide. By engineering the interaction between crRNA and trRNA, they found that various protein-protein interactions and chemical dimerization of domains can activate editing in human cells. They also showed that P3 can be used with AD-based RNA sensors, allowing specific RNAs to induce genome edits in larger circuits. This enhances the control of CRPR-based editing, making it useful for synthetic circuits in living cells.

The team explored if P3 can be used with RNA sensors to control genome editing based on expression, expanding the range of inputs that can drive specific edits in synthetic circuits. Molecular sensors can be used to control cellular components of synthetic circuits, and outputting genome events may facilitate design such structures. They demonstrated that P3 can control editing via specific protein-protein interactions. To improve efficiency and specificity, they engineered the crRNA-MS/Box-pacrRNA design.

P3 is based on the CRPR-C9 system, but with crRNA dimer replaced with protein-binding aptamers like MS and Box hairpins. It mimics the native CRPR system, discovered as dual-RNA-guided. The team further developed a proximity sensor that drives genome editing.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-3 fatty acids, have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart and are recommended to be consumed at least twice a week. They increase the slow-rectifier current (IK) by shifting the voltage dependence of activation to more negative voltages. The IK current is crucial for the repolarization of the ventricular action potential and is mediated by the KCQ/KC1 channel complex. Mutations in this complex cause long QT syndrome (LTS), a condition with a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythm and sudden death.

The KCQ/K1 channel is a voltage-gated potassium channel that associates with the KC1 subunit, generating the IK current. It is expressed in the heart and contributes to the repolarization of the ventricular potential. Loss-of-function of the KC/KC complex is associated with LQ, leading to a reduction of the current and prolongation of the ventricular waveform. In contrast to other Kv channels, such as Shaker K, which are inactivated in low K, our studies suggest the selectivity filter of KC1 is unstable, contributing to the low probability of opening.

PUFAs increase the maximum conductance of IK channels by stabilizing the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state. They bind to two sites on the channel, one in the voltage domain shifting the dependence to negative and the other in the pore increasing conductance. The mechanism of PUAs increasing conductance is poorly understood, and it is unclear if they affect the single-channel conductance and open probability of IK channels. PUAs have been shown to exert a protective effect on sudden death and are recommended in diet. Restoring the physiological duration of the interval could be achieved by increasing activity of the KC/K complex.
Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairments in various brain disorders for decades, but the molecular mechanisms behind this link are not well understood and whether vitamin B supplementation improves cognition is unclear. An enzyme called pyridoxal 5-phosphatase (PDX) controls levels of pyridal 5-phosphate (PL), the active form of vitamin B, and may be a new target for treating B-related disorders. However, there are no drugs that inhibit PDX. Researchers found that PDX levels of PL in the hippocampus decline with age, providing a reason to develop PDX inhibitors. They discovered a molecule called 7,8-dihydroflavone (7,8HF) that directly inhibits PDX with low micromolar potency. In mouse brain cells, 7,8HF increases PL in a PDX-dependent manner, validating P as a drug target. 7,8HF is already studied in brain disorders, but its mechanism is debated. The discovery of 7,8 as a P inhibitor offers new insights into its effects in the brain.

PL deficiency has been linked to brain disorders for decades, but links are unclear. Aside from B administration, strategies to elevate PL levels are lacking. Researchers found 7,8 as a direct P that increases PL in brain cells, validating as a target to control PL levels in the brain. P is upregulated in middle-aged mice, suggesting B supplementation may not be enough to elevate PL where the enzyme is active. The discovery of  as a P inhibitor was unexpected.

Vitamin B is essential for the nervous system and affects cognitive function at any age.
Researchers studied how the development of the gonad in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of roundworm. The gonad has a mirror-symmetric structure, meaning it has two sides that are mirror images of each other. This structure is created by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), which come from the division of somatic gonadal precursors (SGP) Z1 and Z4. The researchers found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which have mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by three proteins: LIN-17, CWN-1, and EGL-20. LIN-17 and C-2 promote normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, while C-1 promotes the opposite polarity in Z1 and Z4. EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z. When LIN-17, EGL-20, and C-2 are missing, the polarity of Z1 is reversed and Ds from Z frequently migrate to the wrong side. The researchers also found that the mis-position of Ds in the gon due to the reversal of Z leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also seen in animals with missing C-1, which produces ectopic Ds. These results show the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of Ds to create a mirror-symmetric organ.
Researchers have been exploring ways to create combination therapies that take advantage of trade-offs in how cells become resistant to drugs. When a cell becomes resistant to one drug, it may become more sensitive to another. However, it's unclear how common these trade-offs are and whether cells that resist one drug have the same trade-offs. This is because resistant cells in clinics and labs often have mutations that give big benefits, not trade-offs. To study this, scientists tracked mutations in yeast that give it an advantage against fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. They tested 774 mutants in 12 environments and found 6 groups with different trade-offs. Each group's trade-offs suggest they affect fitness in different ways. Some surprising findings include mutants that resist one drug but not two, and same gene mutations have different trade-offs. These results show it's hard to rely on trade-offs for multi-drug treatments, but also suggest a way to use trade-offs to combat resistance. By grouping mutants with similar trade-offs, researchers reduced 774 to 6 types, making it easier to study how mutations affect fitness. This could help create multi-drug treatments that use trade-offs.
Researchers have long observed a phenomenon called the "central bias" or "contraction" in working memory, where the brain's judgment of the magnitude of items in memory appears to be biased towards the average of past observations. This is thought to be an optimal strategy for the brain to learn the structure of sensory input. However, other biases such as serial dependence are also observed and thought to reflect content of working memory. A recent study in rats suggests both may be more related than thought: when the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was silenced, both short and long-term biases were reduced. A model of circuit is proposed that may be involved in generating behavior, showing working memory susceptible to shifting to past experience producing short sensory biases naturally leads to contraction. Errors at individual trials are from the distribution of stimuli and not due to gradual shift memory towards sensory mean. Results are consistent with behavioral findings and predictions across different distributions and timings, intervals, as well as dynamics in working memory areas. A set of human psychophysics experiments validate the model in auditory parametric working memory task.

Repeatedly observed across species and modalities is central bias, where performance reflects shift of working memory toward mean of sensory history. A key feature is bias where averaged performance shifts progressively toward center of prior built from past. Biases toward recent stimuli have also been documented. In model, bias emerges as effect of errors in working memory due to persisting stimuli in preceding. Integration of persist in competes with current, giving rise to short effects. Recent found bias and effects in auditory comparison in rats and humans: performance depends on preceding up to three trials. Evidence challenges this picture: study parametric memory discovered PPC plays role in modulating bias. When optogenically inactivated, bias is attenuated.
Researchers have been trying to find new ways to improve cancer treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICs) and chemotherapy, which often fail in most patients. They found a protein called PD-LIM-containing 2 (PDL2) that acts as a tumor suppressor and is repressed in lung cancer, making it harder to treat and resistant to chemo and immunotherapy. This study looked at PDL2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer using human samples and a mouse model that mimics human lung cancer. They tested if delivering P2-expression plasmids in nanoparticles (nanoPIM) with PD-1 antibody and chemother drugs could improve treatment. Results showed P2 repression in lung cancer is due to genetic and epigenetic changes. NanoP showed low toxicity, high specificity, and anti-tumor activity, and improved PD-1 and chemotherapeutic efficacy, with complete remission in most mice and substantial reduction in remaining tumors. Mechanistically, nanoP increased major histocompatibility complex I (MHC) expression, suppressed drug resistance, and tumor-related genes, and enhanced lymphocyte infiltration, making tumors sensitive to IC and chemotherapeutic and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. This established a clinically applicable P2-based therapy for lung and possibly other cancers.
Animals have a built-in system to evaluate food quality and adjust their eating habits accordingly to survive in challenging environments. However, the mechanisms behind this system, which monitors nutrients from food and influences eating behavior, are not fully understood. Researchers created a low-quality food test and found that spoiled E. coli, a low-sugar food, triggers a cellular response that encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. This system depends on a stress pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR), innate immunity, and neuronal function, which regulates eating behaviors. Animals can adapt to low-quality food by supplementing with vitamin C, which inhibits the stress response. This study reveals the role of the stress pathway as a food evaluation system for nutritional deficiencies, enhancing survival.

The researchers used a low food evaluation system to understand how the stress pathway operates. It assesses glucose and vitamin content in food through the unfolded response (UPR) innate (PM-1/p38) axis. They identified a food mechanism that recognizes quality through UPR (RE-1/XBP) innate (PM-1/p38) regulated stress in neurons that dictates eating behaviors. This system is an adaptation for detecting deficiencies not sensed by the nervous system. A limitation is the lack of explanation for why E. coli activates the response. It's hypothesized that heat-killed E. coli may lack or have altered metabolites that activate or inhibit the response. The innate pathway, mediated by PM-1/p38, plays a role in evaluating unfavorable sources like E. coli, staphylococcus, and pseudomonas, helping animals avoid them. The researchers investigated nutrients sensed by the X-PM-1 axis for quality. Animals may assess quality through UPR and innate. To determine the role of UPR and innate in low-quality, they examined activation of UPR by E. coli on known components, IREBP, PER, and ATF.
Carbohydrates play a crucial role in various biological processes, but how they interact with important targets like G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is not well understood. Researchers studied the P2 purinoceptor 14 (P2Y14), a target for inflammation and immune responses, to see how sugar molecules activate GPCRs. They used computer simulations and experiments to find the sugar-binding site on P2 and discovered that UDP-glucose activates the receptor by bridging two parts of the protein. A specific chain was found to distinguish different sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDPgalactose, UDPgluronic acid, and UDP-acetylglucamine. This chain is a functional motif for both P2 and P purinoceptor 12 (P2). New sugar molecules were designed to target this motif and activate P2. This study expands understanding of purergic receptors and provides insights for carbohydrate-based drug development for GPC.

Purinoceptors respond to nucleotides like ADP and UDP, but P14 is activated by a class of carbohydrates, UDP-sugars. The arrangement of sugar sites between P and sugarases may determine selectivity. A conserved motif was found in P and P, extending understanding of carbohydrate regulation of GPC. Studies with other sugars showed interactions with TM7 determine potency. The carbohydrate site has not been fully characterized for GPC, except P. Other P-like family members have not been directly activated by carbohydrates. Models provide details for activation and recognition, inspiring drug development for GPC. Whether other motifs exist in GPC is unknown, further investigations will add concepts and understanding to the field.
Researchers have found that glial cells, a type of support cells in the brain, play a crucial role in regulating the behavior of neural stem cells called neuroblasts (NB) in fruit flies. They discovered that glial cells produce ferritin, a protein that helps transport iron into NB for energy production, which is essential for their self-renewal and proliferation. When glial ferritin genes were knocked down, NBs had energy shortages, leading to low proliferation and premature differentiation. Ferritin is also a potential target for tumor suppression. The study shows that glial cells are necessary for maintaining NB self-renew, revealing a new role of the glial niche in brain development.

The researchers investigated the role of iron homeostasis in fruit fly CNS by knocking down genes involved in iron transport, storage, and regulation in NB, neurons, and glial cells. Only glial knockdown of ferritin genes led to NB loss and defective brain development. Ferritin in glial cells is crucial for regulating NB behavior and larval development. In a proliferative state, NB receive iron from glial via ferr to fulfill energy requirements for proliferation and selfnew. Iron required by NB is stored in ferritin glial cells and allocated as needed. Bicellular ironostasis makes glial the pool for ferr production, relieving NB from producing ferr and transferring risk of iron-induced oxidative stress to glial.

Glial cells clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets, ensuring NB normal function during development. It's unclear if bicellular ironostasis exists in other stem cells and niches. Normal NB converted to immortal NB, highly proliferative, need nutrients including iron. Iron is vital for all living organisms, participating in electron transport and cellular respiration supporting ATP production. Tumors were strikingly decreased in larval brains lacking glial ferritin. This suggests glial ferr is required for tumor, a potential target for treatment. To verify iron in tumor suppression, iron levels were decreased by adding chelator B in fly food.
Researchers investigated the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 mortality in the US population during the pandemic. They analyzed death certificate data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease, and found that cancer mortality rose by only 3% over the pre-pandemic baseline, resulting in 13,600 excess deaths. Mortality was higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematological) and lower for cancers with poor survival (lung and pancreatic). In contrast, deaths from diabetes and Alzheimer's increased by 37% and 19, respectively. To understand these differences, they simulated expected mortality for each condition using COVID-19 rates, life expectancy, population size, and age of individuals with each condition. They found that mortality differences were primarily due to life expectancy, with risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting COVID-19 risk.

The study considered death certificates listing cancer as the underlying cause or anywhere on the certificate. Unlike previous studies, they propose that lack of excess cancer mortality reflects competing risk from cancer, especially deadly types, rather than protection from immunosup. Detailed analysis of six cancer types showed modest elevation during the pandemic. Results highlight the importance of considering multiple-cause records to reflect coding changes with a new pathogen emergence. Diabetes and Alzheimer were used as controls, illustrating associations between conditions and COVID-19 in population mortality. Diabetes is a useful for cancer comparison due to similar age-at-death and few in nursing homes.

Two factors drive cancer patterns during COVID: population size with cancer and life expectancy under diagnosis. These operate regardless of COVID-cancer relationship. The same applies to other conditions, such as diabetes or Alzheimer.
Researchers have discovered a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in removing R-loops from eukotic chromosomes. R-loops are abnormal structures formed during gene transcription that can be toxic to cells. The Smc/6 complex binds to RNA-DNA hybrids and promotes their removal by the enzyme RNase H2. This process is important for removing R-lo at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. Yeast mutants lacking the Sm/6 complex and RNase H accumulate high levels of R-lo in their chromosomes, leading to growth defects. The Sm/6 complex is also involved in repairing unscheduled R-lo generated by various genomic transactions. It binds to R structures formed during gene transcription and promotes RNase2 degradation of the RNA component. This suggests a link between growth defects in RN H and Sm/6 to R accumulation in chromosomes. R-lo are often found at highly transcribed genes and telomeres, and near replication forks. The Sm/6 complex stimulates RNase activity in vitro, but its role is not as extensive as RNase enzymes. A model suggests Sm6 acts in two ways: within and between pathways in response to R formation. It contributes to RNase-dependent removal of RNA-DNA from DNA and promotes RNase degradation.
Researchers studied how older adults' brains adapt to age-related hearing loss by using electroencephalographic and behavioral data from 105 individuals aged 39-82. They found that despite a decline in hearing sensitivity, listening performance remained stable over 2 years. However, neural filtering ability and behavior were only correlated at separate time points, not over time. This suggests that attention-based neural metrics may not predict individual changes in listening behavior. 

The study aimed to replicate previous findings and test the relationship between brain and behavior across time, expecting neural ability to impact performance independently of age or hearing status. However, in the longitudinal sample, neural filtering did not predict behavioral change, despite observed links within each time point. 

The researchers analyzed how hearing, filtering, and performance changed across middle to older age, and longitudinal change from time 1 to 2. They used linear mixed models to test age and time effects, and quantified test-retest reliability. Since neural filtering was independent of age and hearing, no change was expected. They tested longitudinal stability of the age and hearing-independent effect of filtering on accuracy and speed. 

Behavioral outcome, speed and accuracy, involves perceptual and cognitive processes. The study focused on attentional filter to explain individual differences and lifespan.
Scientists have long known that animals use their sense of taste and smell, known as chemosensation, to find food and avoid toxins. Humans have also used unpalatable and toxic substances as medicines, but the importance of chemensation in this process is not well understood. Researchers tested whether the intensity and complexity of chemos sensory qualities, as well as tastes and flavors, can predict the use of ancient Greek and Roman medicines. They found that chemensation is a strong predictor of therapeutic use: drugs with high versatility have simple tastes and intense flavors, and 21 out of 22 chemos sensory qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use. In addition to bitter, musky, sweet, and soapy flavors were associated with versatility. The study suggests that ancient uses of drugs were based on physiological effects consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste pharmacology.

The researchers hypothesize that chemensation and physiological effects are mediated by chemestesis and taste pharmacology, explaining the diversity of therapeutic uses of drugs in ancient times. If tastes and flavors, as determined by a modern panel, predict uses recorded in ancient texts, it would be an insight into how chemensation guided human behavior in prehistoric times. The theory of humors was the basis of Western medicine from ancient times until the Industrial Age, but is now discredited. However, the study proposes that taste and flavor of drugs links hum theory to modern medicine.

The study tested whether taste and flavor qualities, as well as overall intensity and complexity, predict therapeutic uses while accounting for confounding effects of shared chemos sensory stimuli from related species. The results show that chemos perception connects ancient knowledge with science, though etiologies were different in ancient times.
Bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family, such as Salmonella and E. coli, are known to cause gastrointestinal bleeding and bloodstream infections, leading to sepsis and death in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. However, the mechanisms behind their ability to enter the bloodstream are not well understood. Researchers found that these bacteria are attracted to human serum, a liquid in the blood, which simulates bleeding. They used a device to inject tiny amounts of serum and found it was enough to attract the bacteria. This attraction is due to chemotaxis, a response to a chemical in serum called L-serine, recognized by the chemoreceptor T. The researchers found the structure of Salmonella T with L-ser and a shared recognition motif among T orthologs. T is conserved among Enterobacteraceae and World Health Organization pathogens. They also found bacteria use serum as a food source and chemaxis and T provide an advantage to enter hemorrhagic lesions. This behavior is called "bacterial vampirism" and may relate to their proclivity for bloodstream infections.
Researchers have discovered a common genetic program that defines the identity of male cells across different animal species, dating back over 600 million years. This program is made up of approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes, with a third of them being deeply conserved, meaning they have been retained throughout evolution. These conserved genes form a scaffold of 79 functional associations between 104 gene regulators, representing a core of the conserved program of metazoan spermatogenesis. By interfering with these conserved genes, researchers found 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three potential causes of human infertility. This highlights the importance of evolutionary history in understanding reproductive diseases and establishes a cross-species pipeline for other cell and pathologies.

The study analyzed the sperocyte transcriptome of vertebrates and invertebrates to identify the conserved origin of metazo male cells at the molecular level. They found that despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ with new genes, conserved genes remain central in the germ cell transcript of distant species. This led them to explore increased connectivity as a means of gaining insight into the conserved basis of metazo spermatogenesis. They observed that in both vertebrates and invertebrates, the germ transcript has an evolutionary origin tempered by increased expression of younger genes at developmental stages. Data indicates a sperogenic program spanning over 600 years, expanding previous observations in mammalian lineage.

The researchers propose that despite rapid evolution of reproductive genes, the basis of metazo male cell relies on an conserved genetic program providing insight into sperogenesis and human infertility. They devised an interdisciplinary platform combining four approaches to test this hypothesis.
Researchers studied how the single-celled organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii swims using its flagella, or whip-like structures, to move through water. They found that the flagella beat in a synchronized, or coordinated, manner to steer the cell. This coordination is crucial for the cell's ability to move and change direction. The researchers wanted to know how the two flagella work together to achieve this coordination. They discovered that one flagellum, or flag-like structure, leads the way and the other follows. The leading flagellum's properties, such as how fast it beats, are copied by the other flagellum. The team used experiments and computer modeling to show that the leading flagellum responds to external forces, or loads, and the other flagell follows. This means the two flagella are connected and work together to steer the cell. The study found that each flagellum has a distinct role in coordination, which is important for the cell's ability to move and change direction.
Researchers have been trying to figure out how intermittent fasting helps with weight loss and overall health, but the exact mechanism behind it has been unclear. A new study found that intermittent fasting promotes the production of a protein called interleukin-22 (IL-22) by a type of immune cell called innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the gut. This IL-22 then helps turn white fat cells in the body into a type called beige fat, which is good for health. When these ILCs were transferred to mice with diet-induced obesity, it increased the amount of beige fat in their bodies. The study also showed that giving IL-22 directly to mice increased the amount of beige fat in their bodies. However, when the receptor for IL-22 was blocked, the effect of fasting on fat was reduced. Researchers looked at single cells in the gut and found that fasting increased a receptor called aryl hydrocarbon in ILCs. They also found that fasting made ILCs interact with other immune cells called dendritic and macrophages. The study suggests that ILCs play a key role in turning fat into beige and that the IL-22/IL-22 axis is involved in the benefits of fasting.
Researchers studied how animals respond to threats in different situations to stay safe. They used mice and a special training method called Pavlov conditioning, which pairs a sound and noise with a shock. The goal was to see how animals learn to associate the sound and noise with the shock, and how it affects their behavior. The study found that when the sound and noise were paired with shock, mice froze during the sound but jumped and ran during the noise. When the sound and noise were not paired with shock, mice froze less during the sound and didn't jump or run much during the noise. Over time, the mice learned to stop freezing during the sound and start running during the noise. But when the sound and noise were paired with shock, mice still froze during the sound and didn't run during the noise. This shows that animals learn to associate the sound with the shock, but also have a natural response to the noise. The study helps understand how animals respond to threats and how they learn to stay safe.
Researchers studied how insects navigate their environment and found that they use a specific pattern of activity in a ring of neurons to keep track of their direction. This pattern is a sinusoidal, meaning it looks like a wave. But it's unclear if this pattern is just a coincidence or if it helps them navigate better. To answer this, they looked at what's needed to encode direction and found that many circuits can do it with different patterns. They found that the sinusoidal pattern is the most resistant to noise, but only if the neurons are connected in a sinusoidal way too. They compared this to real data from locust and fruit fly brains and found it matches. They also showed that this pattern can emerge through learning, so it doesn't need to be hardwired in the insect's genes. This means the eight-column organization of direction circuits in insects is not random, but follows basic principles.

Insects' head neurons are predicted to have sinus patterns (Wittmann and Schler, 1995; Vicker and Paolo, 2005; Stone et al, 2017). Another idea is to compare direction in insects to mammals, which use many more neurons. Studies showed insect direction neurons have sinus-shaped activation (Lab,198; Lab,200; Lo and Hom,200; Pfe et,200; Pfe and Hom,200; Kin,200; Hein,200; Hom,201; El,201; El,201). Insect heading circuits have been studied, from simple to complex (Witt and Schler,199; C et,201) to models with many types (Kak and Bort,201; et, Su,201; Kim,201; Pis,202; Ly,202).

Previous thought sinus encoding is common because it adds vectors (Witt and Schler,199). But this can't be the only reason, as many circuits can do it. They compared to locust and fly data and found a match. They asked how insects develop this, and found a simple learning rule is enough.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations in PTEN kinase 1 (PINK) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CIS1, a homodimer mitochondrial iron-sulf-binding protein, is a target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. Researchers discovered a heightened propensity of CIS1 to form dimers in PINK mutant flies and dopaminergic neurons from PD patients with PINK mutations. The dimer consists of two monomers covalently linked by a disulf bridge. This conformation CIS1 cannot coordinate the ironulf cofactor. Overexpressing CISD, the Drosophila ortholog of CIS1, and a mutant CIS incapable of binding the ironulf cluster in Drosila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was pronounced with mutant CIS and aggravated in PINK mutant flies. Complete loss of CIS, in contrast, rescued detrimental effects of PINK mutation on climbing ability, posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial structure.

The study suggests CIS, ironpleted CIS, operates downstream of PINK, shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CIS1 as a therapeutic target. CIS1 is a mitochondrial protein involved in bioenergetics, quality control, and defense against oxidative distress, all hallmarks of PD. Researchers investigated CIS's role in PD using fly and mammalian systems. CIS, particularly ironpleted form, is a mediator of PD induced by loss of PINK and Park function. Immunlot revealed increased dimer and presence of CIS under conditions. Increased dimer in P mutant likely represents apo-CIS1, CIS devoid of ironulf cluster, caused by changes in homeostasis. CIS overexpression was neurotoxic, disrupted morphology, and accumulation phospho-ubitin blocks mitagy, resulting in defective mitochondria.
Scientists have long known that certain parasites can manipulate their hosts to make them more attractive to new hosts, but the underlying mechanisms behind this phenomenon are not well understood. A recent study has shed light on the role of a protein called SAP54 produced by a parasitic plant called phytoplas in attracting leafhopper insects. SAP54 causes infected plants to produce leaf-like flowers, but surprisingly, the insects are not attracted to these flowers. However, the study found that exposure to male leafhoppers is necessary for the attraction, suggesting that the insects can distinguish between male and female leafoppers in the presence of SAP. In contrast, SAP discourages female leafoppers from colonizing the plant. Researchers discovered that SAP suppresses the plant's stress response to male leafoppers and identified a key factor called SVP as crucial in female leafoppers' preference for SAP-exposed plants. They found that SAP promotes SVP degradation, making plants more vulnerable to maleoppers, thus facilitating attraction and colonization by the insects. SAP acts as a "molecular matchmaker" helping maleoppers locate mates by degrading S-containing leaves. This study reveals how a single parasite gene can alter host development and attract vectors, integral to its life cycle, and opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors regulate plant processes and insect interactions.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and has a substantial socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments fail, in part, because C. alb can initiate a drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration. Researchers used a nanol droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antif drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell stage with metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure, a time tolerance is measurable, cells bifurcate into two subpopulations: one with upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal, RNA machinery, and mitochondrial capacity, termed Ribo-domin (Rd); the other enriched for stress and processes, termed Stressomin (S). This bifcation persists at 3 and 6 post-treatment. The ribosome stress response (RR) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate survival.

Researchers used the DROPq system to explore phenotypic heterogeneity in C. alb response to antif drugs. They profiled transcriptomes of thousands of cells that were either untreated or exposed to antif compounds with focus on fluconazole (FC) across days. Previous studies profiled ~K cells. The nanol droplet-based assay enabled detailed analysis of C alb in absence and presence antif drugs over days, cost-effective and minimal issues. Results align with reports associate cell phase with expression and metabolism genes. The response to antif compounds fungatic fluconazole (FC) and fungidal CSP was investigated. The mechanisms differ from bacterial heterores, which exhibit growth in bacteridal drugs.
Researchers have proposed a new way to measure how well a species adapts to its environment, called the Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS). This index is based on how often a species uses certain codons, the building blocks of DNA, in its genes. Past methods to measure adaptation were limited because they were affected by other factors like the amount of G and C in the DNA or the types of amino acids used. The new index corrects for these issues and can be calculated from a single genome without needing data on genetic variation or mutation rates. It shows that more adapted species have a higher proportion of genes and sites with effective codon bias. This is a more direct measure of adaptation than estimates based on genetic diversity. The index can be used for more species as it doesn't require genetic data or mutation rates, only a complete genome. It's also not affected by amino acid frequencies. The researchers tested the index on vertebrates, a group with limited evidence of codon adaptation, and found that more adapted species have higher intrinsic disorder in their proteins. The index can be used for other species with stronger codon adaptation. The degree of synonymous cod usage driven by preference offers a direct way to assess selection at the molecular level. It can be estimated from a single genome without genetic or mutation data. A commonly used metric, the Codon Adaptation Index (CA), was developed by Sharp and Li in 1987.
Seps is a leading cause of millions of deaths worldwide and a global health priority declared by the World Health Organization. Seps-related deaths are due to dysregulated immune responses, indicating the need for strategies to target inflammation. A key mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), released by inflamed host cells and bacteria in a strain-dependent manner. Researchers investigated how bacteria release ATP using mutant Escherichia coli (E. coli) and found that ATP release is dependent on bacterial inner membrane ATPase and outer membrane integrity. In a mouse model of sepsis, effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using transformed E. coli with an arabin-inducible periplasmase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abating bacterial release shows ATP suppresses immune responses, reducing neutrophil counts and survival. Additionally, ATP has systemic effects via outer membrane vesicles (OMV) loaded with ATP, distributed throughout the body, upregulating genes degranulation in neutils, exacerbating seps severity.

E. coli, a frequent pathogen in abdominal seps, released most ATP in a mouse model. Demonstrating seps-associated ATP release, researchers questioned how release is dependent on ATP generation. Release is dependent on bacterial, with no differences in counts observed. ATP by bacteria suppresses abdominal responses and worsens survival in seps model. ATP is metabolized in extracellular, limiting action to immediate vicinity. However, role in non-colon compartments, such as abdominal or blood, remains unknown. This study investigated if released ATP influences seps outcome. Isolated seis bacteria and measured ATP release. E. coli released more ATP than E. faalis and S. aureus. Species differed in sequences, confirming release is strain-specific. Seps-associated release ATP in growth and strain-dependent manner.

Bacteria also release ATP into extracellular space, a conserved mechanism from host defense. Release shown for various bacteria, including seis E. coli, Klei pneumonia, E. faalis, and S aureus.
Researchers studied how genetic and environmental factors, such as family and neighborhood, influence psychotic-like experiences (PLE) in children. They used data from 6,602 children in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Study and found that lower intelligence and PLE are linked to lower genetic scores for cognitive phenotypes, lower family and neighborhood socioeconomic status, and less supportive environments. Intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLE, with positive parenting and school environments showing the strongest impact in reducing PLE. The study suggests that improving school and family environments and promoting economic development can enhance cognitive and mental health in children. 

The researchers looked at the associations between cognitive genetic scores, family, neighborhood, and environment with children's intelligence and PLE. They used statistical methods to consider potential confounding factors. They tested the mediating effect of intelligence on the relationship between genetic and environmental factors and PLE. The study used linear models and structural equation modeling to examine the trajectories of genetic and environmental influences on PLE mediated by intelligence. They investigated the mediating role of intelligence in the impacts of cognitive phenotypes, family, neighborhood, and environments on PLE. 

The study found that higher genetic scores for cognitive phenotypes correlated with higher intelligence. They tested the effects of gene-environment interactions on intelligence and PLE, adjusting for schizophrenia genetic scores given the association with cognitive deficit in psychosis. The study advances by demonstrating the effects of genetic and environmental on PLE through intelligence in 9-11-year-old children.
Scientists have discovered that a protein called FGF8 plays a crucial role in shaping the development of the human brain's cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain responsible for thinking and movement. In a study using human stem cells grown into brain-like structures called organoids, researchers found that FGF increases the diversity of brain cells, leading to the formation of distinct regions like the telencephalon and mesencephalon. Within the telenceph region, F8 affects the front-back and top-bottom identity of brain cells and the balance between two types of neurons, GABA and glutamate, impacting brain activity. The study also found that F8 modulates genes linked to several brain disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia.

The researchers analyzed the long-term effects of F8 on brain organoids by studying the development of FOX1 telenceph cells and molecular changes across stages. They found that F8 induces ventral telph genes, suggesting its role in promoting ventral identity. Genes like ASCL, DLX, and PBX were upregulated, while dorsal genes like EMX, NEURO, SOX, and LHX were downregulated.

The study showed that F8 leads to regional changes in 3D organoids compared to controls, resulting in multi-regional organoids with co-developing brain domains. F8 modulates NR1 and genes associated with brain disorders in FOX1 telph cells, highlighting its role in fine-tuning developmental and pathogenic pathways. The findings highlight F8 effect on identity and modulation of N-related targets, including conserved F8-NRF molecular axis. The study proposes that F8 guides developmental trajectories of brain cells along telph axes.

Interestingly, F8 modulation can vary based on cell identity. The presence of various domains in F8 organoids, specifically dorsal and ventral telph, as well as dience and mesph regions, is a significant outcome.
Scientists have long known that animals, like humans, have a natural sleep-wake cycle that follows a daily rhythm, with more sleep at night and wakefulness during the day. But how does this rhythm develop in young animals? Researchers studied fruit flies, Drosila, to find out. They discovered that in the early stages of life, sleep and eating are spread out across the day, but by the third stage, they become organized into a daily pattern. If young flies are forced to eat like older flies, it disrupts their sleep-wake rhythm and ability to form long-term memory. The researchers also found that the development of the internal clock that regulates sleep is influenced by the food environment. They discovered that a specific neurons, Dh44, act as sensors to detect food and regulate sleep through glucose and amino acids. The study suggests that changes in energy demands in young organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circuits and behaviors.
Scientists have long believed that animals moving in groups can be more energy-efficient than moving alone, but direct evidence has been hard to find. Researchers studied schools of a type of fish called giant danio to see if this is true. They measured how much energy the fish used when swimming alone and in groups, and found that groups used up to 56% less energy per beat than solo fish. When swimming fast, group fish used 44% more aerobic energy and 65% less anaerobic energy than solo fish, saving up to 53% of total energy cost. Group fish also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solo fish. This energy savings can help fish avoid predators and may explain why many animals move in groups.

Fish swimming in water is a good model to study how groups can be more efficient than individuals. By swimming fast, groups save anaobic energy and recover faster. It's expected that animals moving in air or water should save more energy at higher speeds. Researchers thought fish groups could reduce energy cost of fast swimming compared to solo, saving anaobic energy and recovery time. They measured energy used by fish swimming alone and in groups at various speeds and compared performance to solo fish. Fish in nature swim at many speeds, but no study has measured total energy and anaobic costs at high speeds.

Researchers found both solo and group fish have a curved metabolic rate-speed graph at lower speeds, with no difference at 0-3 body lengths per second. At 1 body length per second, groups used less energy than slower speeds. At higher speeds, groups used less energy than solo. The total energy curve of fish from slow to critical speed has not been measured.
Researchers studied the immune cells called macrophages in the lungs, which play a crucial role in fighting off infections. They found that these cells can change their behavior in response to different signals from the body's immune system. Macrophages in the lungs, called tissue-resident macrophages, were compared to those from the blood, called monocyte-derived macrophages. Both types were exposed to signals from the body's immune system, called IF-γ and IL-4, to see how they would react. 

When exposed to IF-γ, both types of macrophages increased their energy production by breaking down sugar, a process called glycolysis. IF-γ also increased energy production in both types by upregulating glycol and another process called oxidative phosphorylation. However, unlike blood macroages, lung macroph did not decrease oxidative phosphorylation and instead shifted to a different metabolism called 'Warburg-like'. IF- priming also increased cytokine production in lung macro. Blocking glycol with a sugar reduced IF- driven cytokine production, showing that glycol is key to IF- induced plasticity in lung macro. 

Comparing the two types, lung macro were more responsive to IF- and dependent on gly for cytokine secretion than blood macro. Tumor necrosis factor production was controlled by gly in lung but not blood macro. Blood macro upregulated HLA and CD with gly, while IF- upregulated HLA and CD on lung independently of gly. These results show lung macro are functionally plastic and respond to IF differently than blood macro. The study suggests lung macro are a target for inhalable therapies for respiratory diseases.
For the first time, researchers have shown that nocturnal ants use the polarized light pattern produced by the moon for navigation. Unlike the sun, which can be hidden by clouds or the horizon, the moon can still provide directional information through its polarized light. The sun produces polarized light across the sky as it enters the atmosphere, and polarized light is a known cue for navigating animals. The moon produces a similar pattern, but much dimmer than sunlight. Scientists found that nocturnal ants use polarized moonlight to navigate at night by rotating the overhead pattern and changing their headings. They can detect this cue throughout the month, even under crescent moons when polar light is lowest. This pattern is incorporated into their path system for homing, like sunlight is during the day.

Nocturnal ants leave their nest at twilight and rely on solar polarization to navigate, but return at night when the sun can't guide them. Researchers studied nocturnal ants, specifically the Myrmecia species, which mostly navigate evening and morning. These ants use solar polarized light, visible during twilight, to derive information. The ability to detect polarized moonlight may be present in other nocturnal insects, like bees and crickets, but this is the first evidence of its use in goal navigation. Comparing solar and moon polarization in ants, similarities occur in homing but not outbound.
Pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a soft, thin tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane was crucial for early pter flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and absent in birds and bats. Researchers used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-link lattice within the vanes of early pterosaurs. The lattice supported a dynamic tension system to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the tail to augment control and v function as a structure.

The first pter, non-pterodactloids, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base, similar to some dinosaurs like Velocaptor. Many of these tails ended in a soft tissue vane, which may have contributed to passive stability in flight. The stiffening of tails suggests they were important in early pter for control of mass or inertial control, as in terrestrial theropods with convergent tails. Dynamic control could improve maneuverability and stability, but v flutter would be costly and destabilizing unless v was tensioned under aerodynamic load.

Over 100 pter fossils were examined for well-preserved vanes using ultraviolet. Four exceptional specimens were imaged under Laser-Stim Fluorescence. Three exhibited vanes under light, but one was only visible under SF. Researchers investigated the van's properties, usage, origins, and context for disappearance in later pteractloids.
During adolescence, the brain undergoes significant changes in reward behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making, which are crucial for transitioning into adulthood but also increase the risk of developing psychiatric disorders. One key change is the reorganization of the dopamine system, which is thought to underlie these changes and increased vulnerability. Researchers used a technique called fast cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine dopamine release and mechanisms in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) of adolescent (28-35) and adult (70) male rats. They found differences in dopamine release between adult and adolescent rats, as well as the effect of a type of receptor called α nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) on dopamine release. Blocking this receptor, α-conxin, increased dopamine in adolescent rats but decreased in adult rats. Surprisingly, blocking GABA and GABA receptors showed that α increase in adolescent dopamine requires GABA signaling to occur. The study confirmed the role of αnCh and GABA in this effect using microdial. The results suggest a complex mechanism unique to adolescence involving acetylcholine at α-containing AChRs driving GABA tone on dopamine release. This is driven by multisynaptic regulation of dopamine in adolescent rats through acetyloline at α-containing ACh and GABA. The dopamine system reorganizes during adolescence (Wahlstrom et al, 2010). Another study found that blocking GABA receptors increased dopamine when β-containing ACh was blocked, indicating GABA and ACh have a complex regulation of dopamine that may be age-dependent. The study found dopamine release decreased in Nac of adolescent rats.
Researchers studied individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to understand the underlying causes of the condition. They found that people with two different types of autism, idiopathic and 16p.2 deletion, had similar problems with the growth and movement of nerve cells in the brain. This was surprising because the two groups had different genetic makeups. To find out why this was happening, the researchers looked at the proteins in the cells and found that a common pathway, called mTOR, was involved. mTOR is a pathway that helps cells grow and move. When mTOR was not working correctly, it caused problems with cell growth and movement. The researchers tested this by adding or blocking mTOR in cells and found that it fixed the problems. This suggests that mTOR is a common cause of autism in different types of the condition. The study also found that other pathways, ER/MK and PK, were involved in autism. The research shows that autism is not just one condition, but a group of conditions with similar causes.
Researchers have found that the diversity in the structure and function of synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) in the cochlea contributes to the diversity of sound-evoked and spontaneous firing of SGNs. The study used paired recordings of murine IHC and postsynaptic S boutons with stimuli and conditions to mimic those in vivo SGN characterization. They found that synapses with high spontaneous release rate (SR) were predominantly on the pillar side of IHC, with larger and more compact spontaneous EPs, lower thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2 channels and vesicular sites, shorter latencies, and higher release rates. This indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHC directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGN.

The study used paired I and S bout recordings in acutely explanted organs of Cort from mice with stimuli to mimic in vivo S characterization. This controlled I Ca influx and recorded postsyn S response to glutamate at single afferent synapse. The results support the presyn hypothesis of S diversity and highlight challenges in bridging the gap between presyn hair function and neural encoding.

Synaptic heterogeneity exists among synapses formed by individual I with 5-30 S, and is a mechanism for the cochlea to decompose acoustic information. The study compared physiology of affer syn with low SR by adapting protocols employed in vivo of sound by S. Depolarizations emulated physiological potentials that mature I of high-frequency cochlea have primarily represent the rectified envelope of stimulus. Caution is applied for ex and in data due to disruption of the milieu and incomplete maturation when ex on third week after hearing. More work is needed to elucidate S diversity in the cochlea.
Researchers have been trying to understand how the malaria parasite Plasium falciparum regulates its genes to survive and thrive in the human body. One protein, called MORC, has been found to play a crucial role in this process. MOR is involved in compacting DNA and silencing genes in various organisms, including plants and animals. Scientists used a powerful tool called CRISPR/Cas to edit the parasite's genome and study MOR's function. They found that MOR not only helps maintain the parasite's chromatin structure, but is also essential for its survival. MOR binds to specific regions of the genome, including those involved in antigen variation, which helps the parasite evade the immune system. When MOR is downregulated, the parasite's chromatin structure collapses, leading to its death. These findings confirm MOR's importance in gene regulation and make it a promising target for new malaria treatments.
Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, such as depression and anxiety, which can be linked to the presence of tumor-infiltrating nerves in the brain. Researchers used a mouse model of head and neck cancer to study how these nerves connect to the brain and affect behavior. They found that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct areas of the brain and activate a circuit that leads to changes in behavior, including decreased nesting, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced running. Tumor-infiltrating nocicept neurons, which detect pain, showed heightened activity and brain regions receiving these projections had increased calcium and fos, a marker of activity, compared to non-tumor counterparts. Eliminating these neurons decreased fos and mitigated behavioral changes caused by tumor presence.

Pain treatment restored normal nesting and cookie behavior but not running, indicating pain is not the only driver of changes. The study suggests tumor-infiltr nerves communicate signals to brain leading to cancer changes in behavior, independently of pain. Eliminating TR1-expressing nociceor neurons reduced tumor growth and improved survival, highlighting a potential target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients. Without these neurons, tumor-bearing animals had decreased fos and fos in brain regions, but not other areas were impacted. This suggests tumor-brain communication was disrupted without nociceor neurons. Evaluating effects on cancer-induced changes, animals' well-being was assessed through nesting behavior.

Findings are important as they show tumor-infiltr nerves are integrated into established circuit from tumor to brain, influencing behavior in pain-dependent and independent ways. Cancer patients and survivors experience poor mental health, and neural connection between tumor and brain, with altered nocor neurons, might contribute to changes.
Researchers studied the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its impact on the multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. They found that variations in the physicochemical properties of its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) allow for plasticity, but also have functional constraints similar to other coronaviruses. Experiments with mutated N-protein species showed that point mutations in IDRs can have nonlocal effects on thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid separation. In the Omic variant, distant mutations in IDRs have compensatory effects, shifting the balance of interactions controlling protein properties and creating a new protein-protein interface.

The study suggests that properties like charge, phosphorylation, polarity, and hydrophobicity of IDR subregions are biophysical constraints across coronaviruses, despite little sequence conservation. However, it's impossible to experimentally characterize all biophysical properties of mutants. Researchers computationally evaluated biophysical traits of SARSV-2 Nprotein domains and IDRs across mutants and related coronaviruses. The SARS-2 genome allows probing sequence impact on biophysical properties and constraints for viral viability.

Focusing on SARS-2 Nprotein, researchers studied biophysical phenotypes to understand mechanisms and bi fitness. Experiments with representative mutants from SARS-2 variants characterized thermodynamic stability, secondary, oligom state, energetics, assembly, and LLPS. A large biophysical space is available for Nprotein, with mutations modulating overall properties. Mutations in IDRs can have nonlocal effects on protein biophysical traits.
Hibernation is a period of metabolic suppression used by many small and large mammal species to survive winter. Scientists have long been trying to understand the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms behind this process. A new study aimed to determine if skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency change during hibernation to optimize energy use. Researchers isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators, Ictomys trcematus and Eliom quinus, and larger hibernators, Urs arct and Ursus american. They conducted experiments to measure myos dynamics and ATP demand.

 Results showed preservation of myos structure in Urs arct and american during hibern, but changes in myos metabolic states in I trcematus and quinus led to higher energy expenditure in type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at 20°C. Repeating experiments at 8°C, near body temperature of torpid animals, myos consumption in type II fibers was reduced by 77-107 during tor compared to active periods. My2 hyperphosphlation was observed in trcematus, stabilizing myos molecule. This may mitigate myin increases in muscle expenditure during tor in response to cold.

Myos is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to changes in ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. It is also altered in response to cold, highlighting myos as a contributor to muscle non-shivering thermogenesis. To investigate my DR and SR states and ATP rates during hibern, loaded-ATP assay was used in permeabilized muscle from Urs arct. Results showed higher consumption during tor and IBA, indicating adaptation to myin during hibern. Changes were also observed at lower temperature, relevant to actual muscle in small hibernators. Similar results were found in U american, with no changes to myin conformation, turnover, or ATP per fiber.

In smaller hibernators, remodeling of my DR and SR within muscles occurs, suppressing ATP demand during hibern. A study on trcematus cardiac muscle supports this, higher SR during tor. Skeletal fibers from small and large hibern mammals were examined. Previous studies found metabolic changes in muscle during hibern, such as decrease in respiration and suppression of ATP capacity in trcem during tor.
Researchers studied the formation of chondrocy columns in the growth plates of mouse embryos and postnatal mice using 3D imaging and morphometric analysis. They found that chrocytes in the embryonic plate are not typically arranged in columns, but rather in elongated clusters perpendicular to the growth direction. This is due to incomplete rotation of the division plane during cell division, resulting in non-stacking of cells. In contrast, postnatal plates showed both ordered and disordered columns and small disorganized clusters at the edges. The study suggests that clusters may promote expansion while columns support elongation. The findings support the idea that modulation of division plane rotation determines formation of clusters or columns, a multifunctional design regulating morphogenesis throughout growth.
Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are a class of proteins that play a crucial role in the oral bioavailability of various drugs. They are found in all living organisms and work by moving peptides across the cell membrane using a proton gradient. Recent studies have shown the structure of two mammalian OTs, SLC15A1 and SLC2, but left questions remain about how they work. Researchers used computer simulations to map the SLC2 conformation and its driving forces. They found a sequence of proton steps that help the peptide enter the cell and identified differences between mammalian and bacterial OTs. Experiments confirmed these findings. The study also linked proton binding to peptide recognition, a key to secondary transport in OTs. This research advances understanding of OT in mammals and paves the way for drug design to target specific tissues and organs.

The study used recent structures of bacterial and mammalian OTs to create a model of their mechanism. It explains how protons drive conformation changes and how changes are linked to substrate presence. The presence of substrate affects protein conformation and protonation of specific residues. The work provides a detailed model of steps for substrate and proton-coupled access in mammalian OTs.

To investigate peptide-proton coupling, simulations included a bound substrate molecule. Calculations showed affinity in two states, indicating substrate alone doesn't drive conformation change. The study generated hypotheses for further investigation of proton-state conformation changes. Enhanced simulations obtained conformation energy landscapes in proton and substrate conditions. A 2:1 stoichiometry was assumed for dipeptides, motivated by results indicating distinct roles of protons in conformation cycle.

POTs belong to the major facilitator superfamily and share a conserved six-helix structure. Their N-and C-termini face the cytoplasm.
Researchers have long believed that when we talk, our brains suppress the processing of sounds around us to focus on our own voice. This idea has been proven in non-human primates, but not in humans. To study this, 35 neurosurgical patients underwent intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings while speaking. The goal was to see if the areas of the brain that suppress sounds during speech are also sensitive to feedback. Results showed that areas in the superior temporal gyrus (ST) both suppressed sounds during speech and responded to feedback, with a strong link between the two. This supports the idea that suppression helps us detect and correct speech errors. When feedback was delayed during speaking, these areas responded more, and the degree of suppression and sensitivity correlated. This suggests suppression is key to speech monitoring. Additionally, when participants spoke with feedback, the posterior ST was active if they were in a feedback task, indicating attention can modulate sensitivity.
Scientists have conducted a comprehensive study on a type of bacterial defense system called McBC, which helps protect bacteria from viruses and other foreign genetic material. They found that this system is very common in bacteria and comes in many different forms. The researchers focused on a previously unknown branch of this system, called CoNu, which has a unique feature of coiled structures and enzymes. They discovered that CoNu has three types and subtypes, and can interact with various components of the cell's translation system, such as proteins that bind to RNA or DNA. Some CoNu might target RNA, while others might target DNA. CoNu are often found with other defense systems, like Type I, II, and III, and IV, and are regulated by small molecules that bind to them. The researchers think that CoNu, along with these other factors, use a defense strategy similar to Type III CRIS-C systems, where they first try to eliminate the virus or foreign material, and if that fails, they trigger a response that kills the cell.

The study found that CoNu have domains that interact with translation components, such as proteins that bind to RNA or DNA. They focused on a major branch of McBC, called CoNu, which has coiled structures and enzymes. They found three types and subtypes of CoNu that differ in their composition and association. CoNu might target RNA, based on their similarity to Type III, which encodes a protein that binds to RNA. CoNu of Type II and III are associated with DNA systems, suggesting a two-prong DNA and RNA strategy like Type CRIS-C. The researchers think RNA is a feature of CoNu. They found that Type and CoNu likely target RNA, given their operons encode RNases, the only nuclease in these systems. The association of CDC-like with CoNu, which encodes a protein that binds tmRNA, supports tm interaction. Analysis of a protein in these loci shows it has a fold that binds nucleic acid.
Researchers have studied the role of calcineur, a protein involved in various cellular processes, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that inhibiting calcine extends the worm's lifespan through multiple pathways. To investigate its role in immunity, they discovered calcine is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in C. elegans. Inhibiting calcine leads to defects in DMP, resulting in bloating, gut colonization by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to infection. They found that bloating caused by calcine inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, enhancing lifespan. The TF ortholog, HL-30, is required for lifespan mediated by calcine inhibition. The nuclear receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcine inhibition and necessary for increased lifespan. This study uncovers calcine's role in C. elegans DMP and a mechanism for calcine inhibition-mediated longevity.

 Calcine's effect on C. elegans innate immunity was examined. Surprisingly, tax-6 knockdown increased susceptibility to bacterial infection despite lifespan extension. Tax-6 is required for DMP. The role of calcine in C. elegans response to pathogens has not been studied. C. elegans lacks NF transcription factors, making it intriguing to study calcine's impact on immunity. This could shed light on the complex interplay between lifespan and immunity.

Calcine regulates C. elegans thermaxis, size, fertility, and lifespan. Tax-6 knockdown enhances lifespan via autophagy and CRE-regulated transcriptional coactivators. Calcine activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels. Increased calcium activates calcine via calmodulin binding. DMP is regulated by rhythmic calcium waves. The relationship between lifespan and immunity is complex and not fully understood. Calcine, conserved from yeast to humans, is a calcium/calmod-dependent phosphatase in cellular processes and signal pathways.
Researchers have long struggled to understand how the brain resolves conflicts between relevant and irrelevant information to achieve goal-directed behavior. Conflicts can arise from various sources, such as sensory input or internal representations, and a limited set of cognitive processes can address diverse conflicts effectively. According to the cognitive theory, conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a low-dimensional space, which can be resolved by a set of control processes along dimensions. This leads to the hypothesis that conflicts from similar sources are represented similarly in space.

A study was designed with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized. Human performance and fMRI activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supported that types of conflicts are organized based on similarity, suggesting space as a principle for representing conflicts.

The study aimed to test the geometry of conflict representation in space. It was hypothesized that types of conflicts are represented as points in space. The distance between points reflects the geometry of space, with difference in sources of conflicts represented by points. Dimensions in space can be domains, where domain-specific control are defined. A type of conflict's location in space can be parameter using limited coordinates, reflecting control needed for domain-specific control. Space can represent types with low dimensionality.

Different domains can be conjunct in space to achieve general control from sources can be resolved using same processes. It was hypothesized that space representing conflicts may be located in frontopetal due to roles in resolution. Two solutions resolving types proposed, differing on whether same mechanisms applied. Domain-general control posits frontopetal encodes information and flexibly control for types. This is supported generalizable adjustment.
Researchers studied the immune system's role in preterm birth, a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. They collected vaginal swabs from pregnant women who had term births, preterm labor (PT) or preterm rupture of membranes (PPROM) and analyzed 31 immune mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, and antimicrobial peptides. The study found that the vaginal immunopome, or immune system in the vagina, has a homeostatic or balanced profile in uncomplicated pregnancies, but shifts to a pro-inflammatory state in women who experience PT and PP. This inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte attractants, cytokines and reduced antimicrobial peptides. The immunome has predictive value over maternal characteristics in identifying women at risk for early preterm birth. The immunome changes throughout gestation and deviations are associated with preterm birth. The immunome can be a biomarker for early preterm, a subset associated with adverse neonatal outcomes.
Researchers have created a new computer model, called the Hernandez-Hern model, to understand how smooth muscle cells in blood vessels control blood flow and pressure. These cells, called myocytes, line the walls of arteries and arterioles. The model is based on new data showing differences between male and female myocytes, or muscle cells, in mouse arteries. The model explains how electrical signals and calcium (Ca2+) work together to create muscle tone, or tension, in blood vessels.

The model suggests that a specific channels, called KV.5, control the electrical potential, or voltage, in male myocytes. However, in female myocytes, another channel, KV2.1, plays a larger role in controlling the potential. The model also shows that a small number of potassium and calcium channels drive differences in calcium levels and excitability between male and female myocytes.

The model predicts that female myocytes are more sensitive to calcium channel blockers, which are commonly used to treat high blood pressure. This means that these drugs may be more effective in women than men. The researchers created a one-dimensional model of a blood vessel to test this idea and found that calcium blockers reduced calcium levels more in female myocytes than male.

The Hernandez-Hern model is the first to integrate sex differences in voltage-gated potassium channels. It shows that KV.1 channels are crucial in female myocytes and KV.5 in maleocytes. The model also predicts that calcium channel blockers reduce calcium currents more in female myocytes than male. This could be important for developing new treatments for high blood pressure that work differently in men and women.
Researchers studied how climate affects the breakdown of plant litter in different environments with varying levels of rainfall. They placed baskets of different mesh sizes in seven locations along a sharp rainfall gradient, from very dry to wet, and caught decomposers using pit traps. The study found that decomers of different sizes respond to rainfall in different ways, leading to similar breakdown rates across the gradient, except in very dry areas. Micro-decomposers increased with rainfall in winter, while macrocomposers peaked in dry areas during summer. This resulted in similar breakdown rates across the gradient, except in very dry sites. Macrocomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in dry environments. The study highlights the importance of macrocomposers in drylands, possibly solving the puzzle of breakdown in dry areas, and the need to consider decomer size when studying soil processes.

The study found that macrocomposers contributed little to overall breakdown in winter, but dominated in dry sites during summer. Pit traps showed that macrocomposer richness, abundance, and biomass followed a h-shaped response to rainfall, peaking in dry environments. The goal was to see how climate interacts with decomers of different sizes to affect breakdown. Results suggest decomers respond to rainfall based on size, leading to similar rates across gradient, except in very dry. Predicted that opposing dependencies of macrofauna and microorganisms mesofa lead to similar rates across gradient, except dry sites where decomers activity is minimal. To reveal mechanism, sampled macrocomers across dry gradient and seasons using pit traps.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a type of pancreatic cancer, has a poor prognosis with high rates of metastasis and limited treatment options. Research has shown that the KRAS gene is almost always activated in these tumors, leading to enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity and macropinocytosis. Macinocytosis is known as a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but its role in trafficking of signaling receptors is not well understood. A study found that CY-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumors in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of Cy, the gene encoding CY-B protein, accelerates tumorigenesis, leading to ER and JNK-induced proliferation in precancer lesions, indicating a role as a buffer of RAC activation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CY-B inhibits metastasis. CY-B depleted tumor cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysosphatidic acid, a driver of tumor spread, due to impaired macinotic uptake of lysosphatidic receptor 1. The study implicates CY-B as mediator of growth and signaling in pancreatic cancer, providing insights into pathways controlling metastasis.

In a mouse model of pancreatic cancer, deletion of Cy with expression of KRAS and p53 led to acceleration of Pan formation and increase in pancreas lesions with phospho-ER and phosph-JNK, crucial targets of KR and RAC that drive proliferation and expansion. CY-B was highly expressed in human cancers and correlated with poorer survival. Increased CY-B in mice suggested it could help reveal role in human PDAC. Loss of Cy in the model accelerates Pan formation and progression, likely due to CY-B's capacity to buffer RAC activation of KR leading to abnormal, combined ER and JNK drive proliferation. The model is characterized by metastasis to organs such as liver, diaphragm, and bowel.

CY localizes on macinos in pancreatic cell lines, suggesting mechanism for CY-B loss affecting tumor progression. First protein recruited to macinos is Rab, present in vesicles moving from periphery to perin region. To investigate role of Cy in cancer, expression of CY-B in metastatic PDAC model was assessed. In this, Pan develops around 10 and progresses to stages 15, with full PDAC at and median 150-200 days.
Researchers have identified a group of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) called HER-K H-2 in rhes macaques, a type of primate. This group includes intact or nearly intact viruses, but no fully functional viruses have been found in humans. Similar viruses have been found in other primates, including rhes macques, but the extent and timing of their activity inhes macques is unclear. The study found 145 H-2-like viruses inhes macques, including a group of younghes-specific insertions. The age, reading frames, and insertions of these viruses suggest recent or ongoing activity inhesques.

One group of the viruses has a 750 sequence between the env and 3 long terminal repeat (LTR) from an ancient recombination with a HER-K H-8-related virus. This group is found in Old World monkeys but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OW split. Similar viruses were found in white-cheek gibbons, with insertions within the Old World recombinant group, indicating interspecies transmission from OW to gibbons. The LTR of the youngest viruses have deletions U, disrupting the Response Element (RE) for nuclear export of unspliced RNA. The H-8 region functions as a constitutive transport (CT) element, indicating the RE-RE system was replaced by CT.

The study characterized a group of HER-K H-2-related viruses inhes macques and Old World monkeys that have a 750 non-coding region between env and 3 LTR from recombination a HER-K H-8 retroirus. This suggests the viruses are relatively young, less than 500,000 years old, andhes macques may harbor or have active H-2 viruses. The study found a group of viruseshes mac that may serve as a model for viral evolution over time and HER-K-2 virology and pathogenesis.
Wound infections are common and can lead to delayed or failed healing, causing significant morbidity and economic impacts. They occur in various contexts, including diabetic ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. Enteroccus faalis is often found in non-healing wounds, but its contribution to chronic wounds understudied. Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) on infected wounds compared to uninfected in a mouse model. They examined over 23,000 cells, creating a comprehensive atlas that captures cellular and transcript landscape of wounds. Analysis revealed transcription and metabolic alterations in infected, elucidating distinct changes with bacterial compared to normal healing. Identified dysregulated kerocyte and fibroblast transcript in response to infection, contributing anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faalis prompted premature epithelial-mesymal transition in kerocytes. Also, E. fa modulated M-like macroage polarization inhibiting pro-inflammatory in vitro, in vivo, and scRNA atlas. Discovered macroage cstalk with neutrophils, regulating chemine signaling, promoting anti-inflammatory with endothelial. Findings offer insights into immunosup role E. faalis in infections.

The study found uninf wounds undergo reparative angiogenesis while E fa infection evokes vascularization. Analysis underlines M-like macro-EC interactions as altered cell signaling during bacteria-infected healing. E fa persistence virulence factors, immunodulatory strategies, and implications in delayed healing to be investigated. A comprehensive atlas of host response to persistent E fa infection observed fa induces immunos in kerocytes and fibroblasts, delaying response. Insights from scRNA provide foundation for studies investigating factors contributing pathogenesis and underlying delayed healing.

The study compared transcript and cellular profiles uninf and E fa-infected full-thickness skin at 4 post-infection. However, lacks dataset uninf unwounded transcript, investigating changes induced by wounding alone. fa reaffirmed functions fibbl during uninf healing, consistent predicted lig-receptor interactions. Imm cells crucial in healing eliminating pathogens, kerocyte fibblast, inflammation, and repair.
Plants that are attacked by herbivores release volatile chemicals into the air, which can trigger defenses in neighboring plants. However, the timing of this process is not well understood. Researchers used a special equipment called PTR-ToFMS to study how volatiles are transferred between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. They found that when plants are exposed to a mix of volatiles from herbore-att plants, they have a delayed response, characterized by a burst of terpenes at the start of the second day. This burst is not due to terene accumulation at night, but coincides with jasmonate accumulation in plants. The burst happens regardless of day-night transitions and can't be explained by sender volat dynamics. Instead, it's a result of stress from exposure during the first day and secondary volat on the second. The study shows that prolonged exposure to natural stress volat results in a response that primes and induces a predictable pattern. This answers the question of whether volat induce or prime defenses in neighboring plants, revealing they can do both in sequence.

The study highlights the importance of tracking plant responses in real-time as they perceive natural volat from herboreatt neighbors. The ecological relevance of clocked kinetics of activation in neighboring plants is discussed. Responding strongly to cues on the second may avoid energy expenditure. This is due to volatile priming on the first that yields a clock response to volat the next. The mechanism and biological implications of this phenomenon are discussed. Plants respond to herboreat volat by increasing defenses, which can happen directly with hormone production and release. To test this, plants were exposed to volat from control or herbore plants for 1.25 hours, then disconnected and exposed to clean air until the next day. Half were then exposed to H as a trigger. H was selected as it showed strongest correlation with teres.

The delayed burst may be due to initial volatile that primes for higher release at onset second and secondary bioat from sender at second. When plants are exposed to volat from herboreatt, they release teres. To understand dynamics, a time-course of ter release by plants exposed to vol from sender under Spoptera caterpillars was conducted.
Researchers have long believed that recursion, a key feature of human language and music, is unique to humans. However, a recent study found that wild orangutans exhibit recursive vocal patterns in their calls, challenging this idea. The study analyzed the calls of flanged male orangutans in the wild and discovered rhythmic sequences within rhythmic sequences, consistent with a hierarchical structure. Notably, the lower-level rhythms were not multiples of the higher-level rhythms, suggesting they weren't created by parallel processes or physical constraints. This is the first evidence of recursive combinatorics in non-humans without syntax, semantics, phonology, or music. It suggests that recursive patterns may have originated in proto-musical expression in human ancestors, later adapted for language. Further research on orangutan and ape vocal behaviors could test this idea. A new approach to studying primate combics, focusing on structure in the wild, may reveal precursors to human recursion.
Scientists have long been studying the ongoing battle between viruses and their hosts, which has led to numerous innovations in the evolution of life. One key aspect of this battle is the interaction between viral receptors and host cells, as viruses use these receptors to initiate infection. A recent study focused on the relationship between the MDA receptor and 5'p-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate, the Miichthys mii. The researchers found that the frequent loss of R-I in vertebrates led to the search for alternative substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation (HDCR) being the main pathway. They discovered that M5 of Mii and Gallus, a homolog of R-I, can replace R-I in recognizing 5'p-R virus, potentially leading to R-I loss from the genome during evolution.

The study also found that 5p-R virus can utilize m6 methylation to degrade M and weaken its antiviral ability, promoting its replication and immune evasion. This research provides insight into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering perspectives on ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to the diversity of the immune system. The findings suggest that vertebrates have evolved M with alternative functions to detect viruses such as 5p-R, initially recognized by R-I.

The study used teleost fish Miichysii and chicken Gallus, vertebrates lacking R-I, and 5-R viruses to investigate strategies between 5-R virus and host. Results showed that M of Mii and Gallus lacking R-I evolved to recognize 5-R. The 5 virus used in the study affects Sinca, a species lacking R-I. The data suggest vertebrates evolved M with functions to recognize and resist 5-R virus in absence of-I.

In addition, 5 virus can utilize m6 to degrade M of Mii for immune evasion. These findings shed light on functional antiv activity and unveil complex between virus and immunity in vertebrates. The loss of-I in vertebrates is widespread, and research provides new perspective for verte groups lacking-I.
Researchers investigated the impact of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) on body composition and bone metabolism in men undergoing androgen therapy (AD) for prostate cancer. They found that FSH levels were associated with body fat mass, lean mass, and bone density after 12 months of treatment. At baseline, there was a weak relationship between FSH and fat mass in arms and legs, but a stronger correlation with total body fat and fat in arms and trunk after 12 months. An inverse relationship was observed between FSH and lean mass to body mass ratio. This study suggests FSH could be a marker for monitoring risk of sarcopenia and obesity in patients undergoing AD.
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite research on drugs targeting sarcolem ion channels, none have proven effective in preventing SCD. Sarcoplasm ryanine receptor 2 (Ry2) Ca+ release channels, downstream of sarlem ion channels, are underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive species (ROS)-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of Ry2 in the pathophysiology of S. Researchers tested the hypothesis that Ry2 inhibition in failing hearts reduces sarcasm Ca+ leak and repolar lability, mitigates VT/SCD and improves contract function. They used a guinea pig model that replicates clinical aspects of nonchemic HF, such as prolonged interval, high arrhythmic S, and Ca+ leak via hyperactive Ry2. Animals were randomized to receive drol (DS) or placebo in early HF. The incidence of VT/SC was the primary outcome, ECG heart rate and variability, echocardi left ventricular (LV) structure and function, immunisto LV fibrosis, and sarcasm Ry2 oxidation were assessed. DS prevented VT/SC by decreasing repolar and vent arrhythmias, compared to placebo, DS lowered heart rate, preserved competency during β-adnergic challenge, improved heart variability and function. Inhibition Ry2 with drol mitigates the cycle sarcasm Ca+ leak increases diolic Ca+ and ROS-mediated Ry2, reducing repolar and protecting VTSC. Moreover, sarcasm Ca+ load improves contract function.
Scientists have studied how cells respond to signals from the transforming growth factor-β (TGF) family, including the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, which play a crucial role in development and growth. In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the BMP4 ortholog DB-1 regulates body size through a specific signaling pathway. Researchers identified binding sites for two transcription factors, SMA-3 and SMA-9, and their target genes. They found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have some overlapping and unique targets, with SMA-3 acting as an activator and SMA-9 targeting both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in SMA-9 partially suppressed the small size phenotype of SMA-3, suggesting a level of antagonism between the two factors. Analysis of target genes revealed a new role in body size for genes involved in carbon metabolism and the endoplasmic reticulum secretory pathway, including disulf reductase d-11. The study shows that SMA and SMA-9 have complex interactions that regulate secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size.

 Researchers used genome-wide RNA and ChIP analysis to untangle the roles of Smad and Schnri transcription factors in the C elegans larva. They chose the second larval stage because Sm activity is high at this stage. Analysis revealed SMA-3 and SMA-9 target genes that are co-regulated, as well as separate genes they independently regulate. ChIP data showed 73.7% of SMA-3 binding overlap with SMA-9 sites, while half of SMA-9 sites did not overlap SMA-3. The number of sites may reflect low and degenerate sequence recognition of targets for their families. A matrix of SMA and SMA peaks was analyzed to identify direct targets differentially expressed genes from RNA comparison of wild-type versus SMA-3 using FDR 0.05 against genomic coordinates SMA peaks from ChIP analysis. SMA-exclusive genes imply Sm-independent for SMA in functions, consistent with vertebrate Schnri homologs in immunity.
Researchers have identified a protein called DUX that helps cancer cells evade the immune system, making it harder for treatments like immunotherapy to work. They found that DUX is expressed in about 10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers. In a study of urothelial cancer patients, DUX expression was linked to the immune system being excluded from the tumor and not responding to a common treatment called PD-1 blockade. DUX was also a predictor of shorter survival, even after accounting for other factors like tumor mutations and clinical features. The study suggests DUX could be a target for new treatments to overcome resistance to immunotherapy.

In uroth cancer, DUX was associated with an immune-excluded or immune-des phenotype, meaning the immune system was excluded from the tumor. DUX was also linked to lower levels of PD-1 in the tumor and immune cells. DUX is thought to be a driver of immune evasion in metastasis, but the mechanism is unclear. However, DUX in metastasis is linked to reduced anti-tumor immunity, similar to previous findings in primary cancers and cell lines. DUX is also linked to decreased survival under immunotherapy treatment. The study suggests DUX induces an immunosuppressive program, consistent with its role in inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling in primary cancers.

Uroth cancer had the highest frequency of DUX expression at 54% of patients, suggesting DUX is particularly important in this type. The study confirms DUX expression in metastasis is not due to technical issues with formalin-fixed tissues and is consistent with polyadenylated D4 transcript in both primary and metastasis. The study focused on uroth cancers due to high DUX expression.
Livestock abortion is a significant issue affecting livestock productivity and public health in Africa. However, there is a lack of data on its causes, which hinders effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security, and health. A study in Tanzania aimed to investigate causes and impacts of abortion in pastoral, agropastoral, and smallholder systems. Farmers reported events to livestock officers, and teams investigated within 72 hours. Samples and data were collected to determine causes, patterns, species, breed, previous history, and seasonality, reporting, and zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017-2019, 215 events in cattle, sheep, and goats were investigated. Attribution was achieved in 19.5% of cases, significantly affected by sample delays. Histopath proved less useful than PCR due to sample deterioration. Vaginal swabs were practical for pathogen detection.

The study demonstrated utility, acceptability, and feasibility of abortion as a syndromic event surveillance, and effective reporting system in various settings, including rural areas. It showed the feasibility of establishing a system through community-based officers, sample collection, and molecular platforms. Livestock surveillance can generate valuable information on causes, reproductive losses, and pathogens not captured through other surveillance. This study supports establishing a framework for evidence-based interventions to improve development, livelihoods, and health in Africa.

Livestock has many causes, including infectious, nutritional, physical, and genetic factors. Non-infect conditions, nutritional, metabolic, and toxic are likely causes in Tanzania. The study suggests stressful events, including drought, wild attacks, reported in a third unattributed cases.
Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor for developing various diseases, and nicotine (NIC) is a major component of cigarette smoke. However, the mechanism of how NIC affects stem cells is not well understood. This study shows that NIC increases the number and activity of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the body and in a lab dish. NIC also activates a protein (YAP) that helps cells grow and a signaling pathway (Notch) in ISC through a receptor (nACh) and a protein (PK). This effect is not seen in other cells. Blocking this pathway with a drug (DB) cancels out NIC's effect on ISC. NIC increases tumor growth in ISC when a tumor suppressor gene is lost, and DB blocks NIC-induced tumor growth. This study identifies a NIC pathway that controls stem cell growth and tumor formation and suggests DB as a potential treatment for intestinal tumors.

The study reveals NIC's role in promoting cancer cell growth in the intestine, explaining colon cancer in smokers. Developing drugs that block ACh, YAP/TA, and Notch may treat colon cancer. Extrinsic factors like NIC increase cancer risk by promoting cell division. Data shows NIC increases ISC, which may explain increased tumors in smokers. NIC enhances ISC via ACh and Y/TA and Not signaling. This is consistent with DB suppressing Y/TA and Not in NIC-treated mice. NIC expands ISC through upregulating ACh and forming the Y/TA-Not loop, suggesting targets for treating NIC-induced colon cancer.

This study contributes to understanding how cells respond to NIC, a major smoke component, and suggests a new treatment for smoking-related colon cancer. Analysis shows NIC affects ISC, not other cells, through YTA and Not activated by ACh. The interaction between Y, Not, and W regulates intestinal homeostasis.
A key protein called Hsp plays a crucial role in preventing protein misfolding and aggregation, which is linked to stress, aging, and disease. Hsp helps to dissolve aggregates and refold proteins through binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaper proteins called JDPs and nucleotide exchange factors NEFs. Researchers studied how Hsp interacts with different classes of NEFs and JDPs to understand its role in protein processing. They found that Hsp is essential in initial stages of disaggregation, determining its effectiveness. NEFs recruit Hsp to aggregates, making them smaller and easier to process by chaper. Hsp stimulation is stronger with class B JDP than class A and requires interaction between BDP and Hsp EE motif. The study also showed that H disrupts JDP-Hsp interaction, destabilizing chaper complexes, which can improve disaggregation but also inhibit suboptimal Hsp levels. The balance between coaper and H70 is critical to unlock disaggreg potential.
Researchers have developed a low-cost digital insole that can analyze a person's gait, or walking pattern, to help diagnose and monitor osteoarthritis, a musculoskeletal condition that affects the knee joint. Traditional gait analysis relies on visual observation, but this method is subjective and requires expensive equipment and trained staff. The digital insole uses machine learning to analyze force data from the foot to identify osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures, which are similar to those measured by a gold-standard force plate. A model trained on data from participants with osteoarthritis and controls was highly predictive of force data from a separate validation set and an independent insole dataset. The insole-derived g characteristics were comparable to traditional g measurements, and a single stride of sensor data could be assigned to each subject, allowing individuals to be identified by their gait. This work provides a framework for an alternative to clinical gait methods, adds to wearable technology pipelines, and supports at-home assessments, potentially improving ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring.
Researchers have been searching for non-opioid alternatives to manage post-surgical pain due to the severe side effects of opioid analgesics. A new study found that applying a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, called Clarix (FLO), reduced post-surgical hypersensitivity in mice without opioid side effects. This was achieved by inhibiting nocice dorsal root ganglion (DR) neurons via CD44 pathways. The team purified a major component, heavy-hyaluronic acid/paxin 3 (HCAX), from AM, which replicated LO's pain inhibition and had higher purity and solubility. HCAX induced cytoskeleton rearrangements and inhibited sodium and high-voltage calcium currents in nocice DR neurons, making it a promising non-opoid treatment.

The study suggests human tissue products can be used to treat post-s pain. HCAX was identified as the primary component responsible for pain inhibition, inducing cytoskeleton rearrangement and IN and HVA currents in a CD-dependent manner. To understand the mechanisms, researchers used cultured DR neurons to examine receptor and signaling pathways involved in inhibition by LO. HCAX mimics LO's ability to inhibit pain and has higher purity and solubility, making it suitable for cellular studies.

Injections of LO reduced activation of small-diameter DR neurons, mostly nocice, to noxious stimulation after incision. HCAX was purified from water-soluble AM and biochemically and functionally characterized. It may attenuate key pain receptors such as TR1, TR1, and Mpr, and decrease nocpt excitability by membranepolarizing and altering membrane properties. CD is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein regulating physiologic and pathologic processes.
Researchers studied the pigmentation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells grown in a lab. They wanted to know if the color of the cells was related to their function. They used a new tool to take pictures of individual cells and analyze their genes. The cells were grouped into four categories based on genes, but the color didn't match any specific genes. This suggests that the color of the cells might not be a good indicator of their function.

The researchers used a system to take pictures of cells, pick one at a time, and analyze their genes. They found that the color of the cells didn't match any specific genes. They looked at the genes related to pigmentation and found that it's dynamic, changing over time. It takes time for the cells to produce melanin, the pigment. This means the color of the cells might not be a good indicator of their function.

The researchers looked at genes related to retin recycling, important for R cells to supply photoreceptors. They found weak correlation with color of cells and genes like RD11, B1, 10, 3, and 5. This suggests that pigmentation might not be related to maturation of cells. Other studies show that poorly pigmented cells can become pigmented when transplanted, and unpigmented cells become pigmented when engrafted. This implies that pigmentation in lab-grown cells might not reflect their function.
Researchers have developed a new device called the Marmet Apparatus Automated Pulling (MAAP) to study the behavior of common marmets, a small, social animal closely related to humans. Traditional methods often fail to capture the complexity of their social interactions and cooperative behaviors. MAAP addresses this by providing high-throughput, detailed data that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more comprehensive analysis in a natural setting. The device is flexible, accommodating a range of behaviors and animal capabilities, and enables investigations of neural activity underlying social behaviors. MAAP bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal studies and neural investigations, paving the way for research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmets as a model.

The device captures nuances of cooperative behaviors and allows for high-resolution data collection, making it suitable for investigating underlying mechanisms in primates. With MAAP, researchers can examine the neural dynamics of cooperative behaviors in mets. The apparatus represents an advancement, bridging traditional behavior studies that address ethologically behaviors of animals and precise investigations of neural activity. By combining behavioral metrics from video and audio with the timing of mets pulling and reward, one can understand the interplay between behavior, communication, and interactions in this species using an automated task.

MAAP provides rich data and flexibility for various tasks, creating an avenue for simultaneous recordings while mets are engaged in tasks by MA. This increases the number of trials for analysis, ensuring statistical power investigating the relationship between activity and behaviors.
Researchers studied the effects of moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy on the developing fetus using a mouse model that mimics human drinking patterns. They found that moderate drinking during pregnancy altered specific DNA methylation in newborns, but didn't affect their behavior as adults. Whole-genome sequencing of newborn brain and liver showed that DNA changes were mostly tissue-specific, with some occurring as early as gastrulation. Methylation differences were in non-coding regions, suggesting broad effects on gene regulation. Replication in human studies with fetal alcohol disorder showed similar effects on genes linked to traits like facial features, intelligence, education, and autism. A diet rich in folate and choline protected against some damage in the mouse model. The study suggests early exposure can affect the fetus's genome without visible changes and highlights the importance of maternal dietary interventions.

The researchers looked at regions sensitive to alcohol exposure in humans and found similar results. They compared exposed and unexposed mice, and added a diet with high folate and choline to see effects. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing measured DNA methylation in brain and liver, two organs affected by alcohol. They found tissue-specific effects and some before germ layers separated in early gastrulation. Candidate genes were tested from previous studies sensitive to moderate exposure.

The study covered pre-conception to first trimester, typical human drinking. Outcomes were DNA methylation and behavioral deficits in neurodevelopment relevant to fetal disorder. Methylation data from 147 newborns with moderate exposure and controls showed no differences. In the model, effects were mostly tissue-specific, two regions and genes in both liver and brain. Changes may be established early and maintained in differentiating tissues.
Scientists have long believed that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is effective in silencing a wide variety of genes, and all genes are considered targets for RNA interference (RNAi). However, research on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has shown that loss of some regulators of RNAi can selectively impair silencing of some genes. A new study has found that this selectivity can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their metabolism. The network includes the Mael domain protein R-10, the intrinsically disordered protein-16, and the Argona protein-3, which work together but are required for silencing one gene, but singly required for silencing another. The requirement for protein-3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing.

The study used quantitative and exploratory models to find that changing regulatory elements of the gene can reduce dependence on protein-3, animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and cleavage tailing of mRNAs with U dinucleides, which makes them templates for amplifying RNAs, are enriched in 'UG' zones matching dsRNA. Similar pathways and amplification could result in selective silencing by endogenous RNAs.

The study used extensive characterization of RNA in C elegans to examine how differences between genes and reliance on regulators contribute to efficacy and resistance. A pathway required for silencing response to dsRNA has been worked out in C elegans. The requirement for protein- but not for or can be bypassed by enhancing processing ds, suggesting that loss has least impact on efficiency. A model of RNA during silencing by ds reveals criteria for efficient silencing.

The study found that any of the three proteins, structurally and functionally different, are required for silencing one gene, suggesting each could contribute to silencing any target. Similar mechanisms could generate other RNAs independent. Future studies are needed to test the model. RNA is widely used for silencing in plants, insects, and humans, like C elegans, plants, and some insects.
Researchers studied the genes and pathways involved in tuberculous meningitis (TBM), a serious infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, to understand why it's so deadly. They analyzed blood samples from 281 adults with TBM, 295 with pulmonary tuberculosis (PT), and 30 healthy individuals. They found that TBM triggers a strong inflammatory response similar to PT, but with distinct patterns in HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T cell activation were linked to TBM mortality. In HIV-positive individuals, angiogenesis was associated with death, while HIV-negative showed TNF signaling and impaired extracellular organization. Four genes (MMP1, N2, Z, C, and CD) were strong predictors of TBM mortality. A four-gene signature was identified as a potential biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status. The study also found differences in gene expression between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals, with increased angiogenesis in HIV and TNF and extracellular organization in HIV-negative.
Scientists have long known that many commercial antibodies, which are critical tools used to detect and study proteins, do not work as intended, but the extent of the problem was unclear. To address this, researchers developed a standardized approach to test 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 human proteins. They found that over 50% failed in one or more applications, yet 50-75% of proteins were covered by at least one high-performing antibody, suggesting significant coverage. Recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal. Hundreds of underperforming antibodies were used in published studies, raising concerns. Encouragingly, many manufacturers reassessed and altered or removed them. This study demonstrates the scale of the problem and suggests a strategy to achieve proteome coverage using existing antibodies and inform new generation.

The researchers developed protocols to assess specificity in three common uses: Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. They tested 614 against 65 targets, chosen by funders, to cover the entire mammalian proteome. The study provides an unbiased framework for performance comparison, coverage, and value of characterization, and identifies renewable antibodies for all proteins. Approximately two-thirds of proteins were covered by at least one high-performing and half by one-per renewable, suggesting significant coverage.

The analysis of 614 commercial antibodies assesses the performance and a step toward a standardized validation. They evaluated 65 proteins side-by in Western, immunrecipitation, and immunofluorescence. All data are openly available. Antibodies are critical in biomedical and clinical research, with ~1.6M targeting ~96% human proteins.
Researchers have developed a new tools to control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal. This is important for studying how organs communicate with each other. They combined the GAL4/UAS system with another system, like Lex or Q, to make this possible. They created a set of reagents to use these systems in Drosophila, focusing on genes with known expression patterns. Over 40 LexA and Q insertions were made by CRISPR and verified in larvae. They also made constructs with Q and Lex factors in one vector. This was integrated into the fly genome and FLP recombination used to isolate lines that express only Q or Lex. New vectors were made to knockdown genes in vivo and a library of RNAi lines created. These tools will help researchers turn on or off genes in different ways in the same animal.

A vector was made that creates a driver that expresses Q and Lex in a gene. One can be cut out with Fl, making flies express only Q or Lex. Both Q and Lex systems were tested for gene knockdown and a library of RNA lines made. A plasmid was created for cloning T2-Lex-G, T-Q, or T-Lex-G-T-Q fragments. Genes with tissue patterns were selected, including major organs of the fly. Most were fluorescent reporters, not genetic tools like RNAi. This slows studies that need two systems, as reagents must be made by groups. Methods were developed to make drivers with patterns. Genes with GAL insertion and specificity were chosen. Donors were cloned and injected into Cas-express embryos for CRPR HDR. A set of stocks, vectors, and protocols were made to expand Dophila researchers to modulate expression.
Researchers have found a link between the transcription factor B11 and neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. B11 is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy-CA synapses. However, the underlying mechanisms were unclear. The study shows that the synaptic molecule Cql is a direct target of B11 that regulates vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at moss-CA synapses in vivo and vitro. Cql exerts its functions through interaction with a specific variant neurexin, Nrx3b. Interruption of Cql-Nrx interaction by expression of non-binding Cql or deletion Nrx in dentate gyrus neurons recapitulates parts of B11 and Cql phenotypes. This study identifies a Cql-Nrx-dependent pathway through B11 controls moss synapse function. Findings contribute to understanding neurodevelopment disorders by synaptic dysfunction.
Scientists have been trying to understand how the different parts of a cell work together to control gene expression, the process by which genes are turned on or off. One key part, zinc finger protein S1 (S1), regulates genes involved in cell growth and division. Researchers found that S1 can control gene expression by binding to the start of the gene, like other activators, or to the middle of the gene, where RNA is being made. They studied how S1 works and found that after binding to the start, it moves to the middle and changes the shape of an enzyme, RNA polymerase II, which makes RNA. Surprisingly, S1 also binds to some RNAs being made and stabilizes them. The interaction between S1 and RNAs is controlled by the start of the gene and when S1 leaves the DNA. Interestingly, how much S leaves DNA is related to how much of the enzyme is backtracking. The team proposes that after binding, S accompanies the enzyme and regulates backtracking. The back enzyme is more compatible with S moving to new RNAs, where S accompanies them to the cytoplasm and regulates stability. S's binding to RN imprints their fate, serving as a model for communication between making and breaking down RNAs, and a dual role for some zinc proteins. The interaction between S's two modes of regulation needs to be studied.

S1 impacts the life of RN from making to breaking down. Its effect on making is linked to function, suggesting they are connected. S has two zinc fingers. Data show correlation between S binding to middle and enzyme in genes. S's ability to alter enzyme in context of and backtracking likely underlies its effect. Alteration in enzyme is reflected in backtracking, indicated by values. Binding S to middle correlates enzyme, particularly in genes. S function in some genes extends beyond making and encompasses, as proposed earlier. Interaction with DNA has effect on enzyme and RN, suggesting mechanistic linkage. Enzyme is a subunit which enhances activity and instability due imprinting.
Researchers investigated the connection between programmed cell death during plant development (PCD) and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thalian roots. They focused on the root-specific transcription factor ANAC/SMB and senescence-associated nuclease B1. Mutations in both PC regulators increased colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendita, primarily in the differentiation zone. The smb-3 mutants exhibited hypercolonization around the merematic zone and delay of S-induced root growth. This suggests that root PC and post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Reporter and transcription analysis revealed B1 expression is downregulated during S colonization in mature epidermal cells, suggesting a transcriptional control facilitating accommodation of microbes in roots.

The study found that impaired PC in Arabidopsis mutants increased colonization by the endophyte S. The smb-3 mutants displayed hypercolon along the primary root, suggesting extra cell corpses surrounding smb roots provide nutrients for fungal colonization. PC protects the meristem from microbial colonization, but some microbes manipulate host PC processes by affecting B1 expression to facilitate accommodation. Transcript analysis showed significant decrease in B1 expression after 6 days post-inoculation in older root parts, independent of fungal colonization. Inoculation of B1 reporter lines with S observed reduction in activity in epider cells in contact with fungus compared to mock-treated roots. B1 expression and localization in root xylem was not affected by S.

The researchers propose that tight regulation of PC and rapid clearance of root cell corpses restricts fungal colonization at the apical meristem. They also show S downregulates B1 in older epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation. The study highlights microbes' ability to modify PC processes to enhance colonization.
Researchers have found that large vesicles, called exophers, are released from stressed neurons in a type of worm called C. elegans. These exers may contribute to the spread of disease-causing proteins and inflammation, which can lead to neurodegenerative diseases. However, the factors that control the release of these exers are not well understood. The study found that mechanical force, or pressure, can increase the release of exers from stressed neurons in C. elegans. The release of exers from a specific neuron called AL peaks at day 2 or 3, which coincides with the worm's reproductive peak. Disrupting the worm's ability to produce sperm, eggs, or embryos can stop the release of exers from the AL neuron. Restoring egg production through mating or genetic interventions that block egg-laying can increase ex release. Interventions that promote ex production are linked to longer uterus, while those that suppress it are linked to shorter. The study also found that the presence of unfertilized eggs, dead eggs, or fluid in the uterus can stimulate ex release, not just the presence of fertilized eggs. The study suggests that mechanical pressure in the uterus can increase release of ex from stressed neurons. The findings highlight the importance of mechanical signaling in ex production and spreading, making a case for more attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.
Researchers have found new evidence that a protein called Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) plays a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). K3 is a secreted by brain cells and accumulates in amyloid plaques, which are a hallmark of AD. The study investigated how K3 affects synapses, the connections between brain cells, in healthy and AD brains. Results show that K3 levels are higher in AD brains and increase early in the disease. In mouse models of AD, K is found outside cells and around amyloid plaques. Functionally, K triggers loss of excitatory synapses and increase inhibitory synapses through different pathways. Knocking down K in mice restores synapses and memory.

 Studies show K regulates stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus, a brain region important for memory. In a mouse model of AD, knocking down K ameliorates changes in synapses before and after plaque formation. Loss of synapses around amyloid plaques is well described, but K loss-of-function in mice supports that K is a key contributor to synaptic changes in this model. AD is characterized by loss of synapses around amyloid plaques. Investigated if K affects synapses around plaques in 9-month-old mice. Impact of K on synapses and function, affected by W signalling, in AD, is unknown. Studying K in AD sheds light on mechanisms contributing to syn vulnerability.

Synapse loss is strongest correlate of cognitive impairment in AD. Mechanisms triggering changes are poorly understood. Investigated function of W antagonist K on integrity and memory in healthy and AD brains. Changes in syn induced by silencing K unlikely due to plaque formation, as observed similar changes when plaques absent. Knocking down K does not affect number or size of amyloid plaques in hippocampus. Gain-of-function studies demonstrate K directly affects integrity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
Scientists have been searching for new ways to combat the growing threat of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. One approach is to find natural compounds that microbes use to fight off competitors. Researchers have found that iron-chelating compounds called pyoverines, produced by a type of bacteria called Pseudomonas, have strong antibacterial properties. These compounds work by withholding iron from pathogens, a key element they need to grow. A screen of 320 Pseudas isolates against 12 human pathogens found several pyines with strong antibacterial properties and unique characteristics. The most effective pyine reduced growth of three types of bacteria: Acinetobacter baumann, Klei pneumonia, and Staphlococcus aureus, in a concentration-dependent manner. Pyines also increased survival of infected fruit fly larvae and showed low toxicity to mammalian cells and red blood cells. Whole-genome sequencing of pathogens showed limited resistance to pyines. This suggests pyines from environmental bacteria could be a new class of sustainable antibiotics against human pathogens.
Researchers have long known that schizophrenia is linked to problems with the prefrontal network, a part of the brain involved in decision-making and behavior. However, they don't fully understand how disruptions at the level of individual synapses, or connections between neurons, lead to network failures. To address this gap, scientists created a computer model of prefrontal circuits to study how NMDA receptors, a type of synapse, and spike synchrony, or synchronized activity, relate. They found that reducing NMD synaptic currents prevents networks from shifting to oscillatory states in response to external inputs, similar to those during behavior. This parallels observations in monkey prefront cortex and suppression by NMD antagonists. The model explains the link between NMD synaptic and spike synchrony deficits in a pharmacological model of prefront failure in schizophrenia.

The study provides a theoretical basis for how NMD reduction leads to desynchronization in prefront circuits. It shows that networks near a boundary between asynchronous and synchronous states can explain various biological observations. Reducing NMD synaptic currents prevents networks from transitioning to oscillatory activity in response to external inputs, preventing spike synchrony. Prior studies have linked NMD and oscillatory activity in prefront networks but not the topic of this study, how NMD and external inputs influence spike and oscillatory dynamics in presence of AMP. This study developed a spiking network to understand the link between NMD malfunction and reduced spike synchrony observed in biological data. The emergence of synchrony between prefront neurons when inputs push the network across boundary and failure to emerge when NMD currents are reduced, as seen in recordings in primate prefront cortex.
Researchers have studied the process of angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels from existing ones in low-oxygen environments. They found that the initial steps of angiogenesis depend on the differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and St cell types, controlled by NOTCH cell-cell communication. However, the spatial patterning of this cell specification is not fully understood. Using a controlled angiogenesis model and mathematical analysis, they found that Tip-St cell patterning undergoes an order-disorder transition at high levels of pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. This results in robust but unstable differentiation for most cells, with a subset of Tip cells leading to sprouts. Sprouts form in a way that maximizes mutual distance, consistent with a Turing model that depends on fibronectin enrichment. The study suggests NOT signaling enables cell differentiation but not instructs subsequent steps in angiogenesis, requiring additional cues and self-organization.

In the context of angiogenesis, the challenge is to enable vascular morph through responsive differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and St states. This is guided by proangi cues like VEG and local organization by paracrine-NOTCH signaling. Recent models are plausible but need to be tested for causality. The Turing mechanisms appear to explain the results obtained. The analysis supports a dynamic view of angi induction, where VEG input induces NOT signaling and Tip cells can behave as sprouts. Inputs can specify fate, for example VEG promoting Tip and NOT St suppressing in the same cell. These can result in complex outcomes poorly understood.

The Tip-St ratio was used to calibrate the model's parameters to match observed fractions at VEG input. To compare predictions and observations, the spatial patterning of Tip cells was quantified in the angi model. Endothelial induction may contrast with other processes like epithelial, where NOT modulates leader and follower patterns. This underscores the need to develop models that integrate biochemical and mechanical regulation of Tip-St fate.
Researchers have long known that the locus coeruleus (LC) and its projections to the hippocampus play a crucial role in learning and memory. However, the exact timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus were unclear. The LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity through the release of norepinephrine, but recent studies suggest it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other regions. In some cases, dopamine from the LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norephrine. A new study investigated the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during fear conditioning in mice. The results show the LC and its projections to the hippoc respond to task-relevant stimuli and amplifying responses with optogenetic stimulation enhance long-term memory. The study also found the LC increases norepine and dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus and the timing of hippocal dopamine during fear conditioning is similar to LC activity. Finally, hippocal dopamine is important for fear memory, while norephrine is not.
