Planarian worms regenerate their nervous system by first regenerating specific neurons expressing a gene called delta-2, followed by the formation of glial cells from Notch-1-expressing progenitors.

A new partial loss-of-function mutation in sem-2 was identified, revealing its involvement in dorsoventral patterning and proliferation of specific cell lineages. SEM-2 was found to interact with LET-381 and regulate the expression of hlh-8, a Twist transcription factor. These findings contribute to understanding the gene regulatory network in postembryonic development and shed light on the functions of SoxC proteins.
