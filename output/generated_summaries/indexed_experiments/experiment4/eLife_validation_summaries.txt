In Caenorhabditis elegans, germ cells can be reprogrammed into somatic cells through chromatin perturbation. This process is facilitated by the GL-1/Notch signaling pathway, which is typically known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem/progenitor cells. A combination of genetic, tissue-specific transcriptome, and functional studies of candidate genes revealed that GL-1/Not promotes reprogramming by activating genes silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). The conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 is a crucial GL-1/Not target facilitating reprogramming.
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a significant pathogen that causes respiratory, blood, and bladder infections. Research has shown that the adaptor protein SK2 (SK2) plays a crucial role in protecting against K. pneumoniae infections. Mice lacking SK2 (SK-/-) had a 100-fold higher bacterial burden compared to wild-type mice, which was controlled by SK2 expression in innate immune cells. SK2/- neutrophils and monocytes were present in lungs and neutrophils degranulated normally in response to K. pneumonia infection in mice; however, K pneumonia-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in vitro was abolished. K pneumonia-induced neutil ROS required activity of Src family kinases (SFK), Syk, Btk, PLC2, and PK. The loss of SK2 significantly hindered K pneumonia-induced phosphorylation of FK, Sy, and Py2, implicating SK as proximal to their activation in pathogen signaling pathways. SK-dependent signaling in neutils is essential for pneumonia-activated ROS production and promoting bacterial clearance during infection.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the role of the hypnoite reservoir in Plasmodium vivax transmission. The model focuses on the activation of latent liver-stage parasites, known as hypnoites, which can cause new infections weeks to months after the initial infection. The model was validated using data from tropical strains of P. vivax. The researchers embedded the within-host model into a P. viv transmission model to demonstrate the build-up of the hypnoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypite activation and death. The study found that the hypite reservoir is dispersed, with many individuals having few or no hypites and some having heavily infected livers. Individuals with more hypites are predicted to experience relapse and contribute to P. viv transmission. Incorporating hypite-killing drugs, such as primaquine, into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to reduce P. viv transmission as individuals with most hypites are likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.
Selective logging in Amazonian forests results in the release of approximately 90 tons of carbon (C) per hectare into the atmosphere each year. However, this loss is offset by carbon sequestration through forest regrowth. Researchers used a network of 133 permanent plots (175 hectares) across Amazonia to model the relationship between climate, soil, initial biomass, and carbon fluxes of survivors and recruits to predict post-logging recovery. The study found that aboveground carbon recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield (21±3 Mg ha-1) than in the south (12±3 Mg ha-1) where environmental stress is high (low rainfall, high seasonality). Survivors play a key role in forest regrowth. A comprehensive map of post-disturbance recovery in Amazonia was created.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between neurosphere-initiating cells (NICs) and neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mouse brain's lateral ventricular subventricular zone (SVZ). They identified and isolated NICs by flow cytometry as GlastEGhighPlexBhighCD24/lowO/PSAAM/lowTer/45 cells, which are highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo. In contrast, pre-NICs are quiescent, express higher Glast, and lower EGFR and PlexB. Pre-NICs do not form neurospheres but express stem markers Slc1-CERT, GF-CERT, Sox2ERT, and GliERT and are long-lived in vivo. GEICs are ablated by temozomide, while pre-ICs survive and repopulate SVZ. Conditional deletion of Bmi-1 polyprotein depletes pre-IC and GEIC, though pre-IC are more dependent onmi for Cdk2(p16Ink4) repression.
Piezo1 channels, a mechanically activated ion channel, play a crucial role in sensing forces in various cell and tissue types. Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that Pie1 has a bowl-shaped structure, capable of inducing membrane curvature through its extended footprint, suggesting that Pie1 channels may influence each other's spatial distribution and function. To investigate this, cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp were used to examine membrane patches from cells expressing Pie1 endogenously at low levels and overexpressing Pie1 at high levels. Data, combined with simulations of Pie1 spatial distributions, showed that endogenous densities (1-2 channels/μm2) and non-physiological densities (10-100/ channels/μ2) resulted in substantial overlap. Pie1 density had no effect on pressure sensitivity or open probability in the absence of membrane tension. This suggests Pie channels, at physiologically relevant densities, inherently behave as mechanotrans. This property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across entire membrane.
Researchers investigated the relationship between evidence accumulation, reaction time, and confidence in perceptual decision-making, proposing that many decisions arise from the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound. The signal-to-noise ratio, a measure of stimulus strength, influences decision speed, accuracy, and confidence. The model also predicts that increased noise leads to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and paradoxically higher confidence. To test these predictions, a novel sensory manipulation was introduced, mimicking the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of visual cortex, verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST. In both humans and monkeys, increased noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence across a range of stimuli with minimal accuracy impairment. The magnitude of effects aligned with predictions of a bounded accumulation model.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the insulin-like signaling pathway regulates lifespan by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, the ortholog of mammalian FOXO transcription factors, preventing its nuclear translocation. Calcineurin (PP2B phosphatase) also limits lifespan, but its mechanism is unknown. This study reveals that TAX-6/CN-1 and UNC-43, C. elegans calcineurin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMII) orthologs, regulate lifespan through DAF-16. UNC-43 regulates DAF-16 in response to stress, including starvation, heat, and oxidative stress, and cooperates with insulin signaling. Unlike insulin, UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, promoting nuclear localization. Phosphorylation of D-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6/CN-1, inactivating D-16. Mammalian FOXO is also regulated by CAMII and calcineurin.
Researchers investigated the neural mechanisms underlying motor sequence formation in Drosophila fruit flies, specifically focusing on the process of grooming. They found that motor programs for cleaning individual body parts are organized in a hierarchical structure, where earlier programs suppress later ones, allowing for sequential execution. By activating specific neural subsets, they drove distinct motor programs for different body parts, revealing this organization. Experiments showed that cleaning one body part reduces drive to its motor program, relieving suppression of next, enabling sequence progression down hierarchy. A model featuring evoked movements in parallel, but selected serially through suppression, successfully replicated grooming sequence. This is the first example of an innate sequence implemented by prevailing model generating human actions.
In mammalian oocytes, accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis I depends on the coordination between cohesion, kinetochore-microtubule (K-fiber) interactions, and the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). However, how these processes are coordinated remains unclear. Research has shown that the Shug-like protein 2 (Sol) plays a crucial role in addition to cohesin, turning off the SAC, promoting congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis spind, facilitating Kiber formation, and limiting bivalent stretching. Sol's ability to protect cohes depends on its interaction with PP2A, while its ability to silence SAC is mediated by direct binding to Mad2. In contrast, its effect on bivalent and Kiber formation is independent of PP2 and mediated by recruitment of MCA and inhibition of Aurora kinase activity respectively. Sol's multiple interactions link many processes for faithful chromosome segregation.
Neuron-wide RNA Transport Combines with Netrin-Mediated Local Translation to Spatially Regulate the Synaptic Proteome

Research has shown that experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity require localized RNA and protein synthesis, with local translation playing a key role in altering synapse structure and function during synapse formation and plasticity. This study investigates whether, in addition to promoting local translation, local stimulation also triggers the transport of RNAs from the nucleus to synapses. Imaging of RNA localization and translation in cultured Aplyia sensory neurons revealed that RNAs were distributed throughout the neuron's arbor, but translation was enriched at sites of synaptic contact and stimulation. Investigation of the mechanisms behind local translation revealed a role for calcium-dependent netrin-1/DCC receptor signaling. Spatial regulation of gene expression by local translation rather than delivery of RNAs to synapses maximizes the neuron's ar to respond to local cues.
Researchers have developed an in vitro system to study cell-cell interactions and multicellular organization within human induced pluripotent stem (iPSC) colonies. They used CRISPR interference to knockdown molecular regulators of cortical tension (ROCK1) and cell adhesion (CD1) to examine their effects on patterning. Knockdown of ROCK1 or CD1 resulted in differential patterning within iPSC colonies due to cellular self-organization, while retaining epithelial pluripotency. Knockdown stimulated a transient wave of gene expression within mixed populations that stabilized with self-organization. Mosaic patterning enabled interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, facilitating understanding of pathways regulating symmetry during morphogenesis.
A Rational Theory of Set Effects in Human Visual Working Memory: Encoding

Researchers have long observed that the precision of visual working memory decreases as the number of items to be encoded increases. To explain this phenomenon, a normative theory is proposed, which minimizes a weighted sum of error-based behavioral cost and neural cost. A mathematical model is constructed based on this theory, predicting set size effects that align with empirical findings. Notably, these effects are mediated by probability, consistent with previous research. The model also accounts for effects of size and probability on precision in delayed estimation experiments. Furthermore, it is found that the total resource investment varies non-monotonically with set size. Additionally, it is optimal to encode a subset or none of relevant items in some tasks. These findings suggest that cognitive limitations arise from cost minimization rather than constraints.

The theory posits that the brain aims to minimize a weighted sum of two costs: error-based behavioral cost and neural cost. The error-based cost is related to the accuracy of encoding, while neural cost is related to neural activity. The model predicts that as set size increases, error-based cost decreases and neural cost increases. This results in a non-monotonic relationship between set size and resource investment. The model also predicts that it is optimal to encode a subset or none of items in some tasks. This is due to the trade-off between error and neural cost.

The model is tested in delayed estimation experiments, where participants recall items after a delay. Results show that size and probability affect precision, consistent with predictions. The model also accounts for effects of size and probability on precision. The findings suggest that cognitive limitations arise from cost minimization rather than constraints. The theory provides a rational explanation for set effects in visual working memory.
Plants employ autophagy as a defense mechanism to protect against infectious diseases, but the mechanisms by which pathogens interfere with autophagy processes are not well understood. Researchers investigated the interaction between Phytophthora infestans, the Irish potato pathogen responsible for the Irish famine, and the autophagy protein ATG8. They found that the pathogen effector protein PRD54 binds to AT8, stimulating autophagosome formation and depleting the autagy receptor Joka from AT8 complexes. This interference with J2's positive effect on pathogen defense suggests that the pathogen has evolved to counter host defenses by antagonizing the autagy receptor.
Human cardiac fibroblasts (CF) play a crucial role in cardiac tissue adaptation and inflammation in response to pathological conditions such as ischemia. However, the mechanisms by which environmental changes induce CF pathological responses are not fully understood due to the lack of studies involving complex and simultaneous stimulation. This study used a multi-stimulus microdevice to apply cyclic strain and controlled oxygen changes to primary human CF. The results show differential CF responses to different combinations of stimuli. Individual stimuli caused proliferative effects, such as increased PH3 mitotic cells, YAP translocation, and PDGF secretion, or collagen presence. Notably, the combination of hypoxia and simulated loss of contractility (2% strain) induced increased CF release of inflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases.
In Drosophila melanogaster, two isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, form distinct multi-subunit complexes that regulate transcription through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates histone variant H2A.V, the fly ortholog of H2A.Z, genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWI/SNF complex. In contrast, the DOM-A complex functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4, similar to yeast NuA. This study reveals that Drosophila achieves functional diversity through alternative splicing of a single gene, whereas yeast and humans generate similar complexes through gene duplication and paralogy.
Researchers have investigated the role of β-caten (Ctn1) in neuromuscular junction formation, specifically focusing on the retrograde signal from muscle to motoneurons. β-Caten (tn) is crucial for motoneuron differentiation, but little is known about the retrograde signal. An in vivo genetic approach was used to dissect the functions of βaten (tn) in muscle. Without the activation domain, βaten was unable to rescue presynaptic deficits of βaten mutation, indicating transcriptional regulation involvement. Cell adhesion function of βaten was dispensable. Proteins that serve as βaten-directed retrograde factors were screened, and Slit2 was identified. Transgenic Sl2 expression in muscle diminished presynaptic deficits of βaten mice. Sl2 immobilized on beads induced synapsin puncta in spinal cord explants, suggesting Sl2 as a factor utilized by βaten for presaptic differentiation.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to study the dynamics of force transmission at cell-cell junctions in epithelial clusters, a crucial for tissue development and maintenance. They combined computational and experimental methods to quantify force transmission at subcellular and multi-cellular scales. In spontaneously forming adherent epithelial cell clusters, basal forces were found to be coupled with E-cadherin localization at individual cell junctions. At the multi-cell scale, cell force exchange depended on position within the cluster and adapted to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or rearrangements. Importantly, force transmission through cells required coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in cells and neighbors. These findings provide insights into mechanisms controlling mechanical homeostasis in epithelial tissues and highlight methods for studying mechanotransduction cell adhesions.
Researchers have investigated the structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin, a protein associated with Huntington's disease caused by polyglutamine expansion. Using biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle microscopy, and cross-link mass spectrometry, they found that huntingtin is composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical soloid structure. The amino-terminal and carbox-terminal regions form a circumscribed central cavity. Polyglut expansion increases α-hical properties of huntingtin and affects intramolecular interactions among domains. This study delineates structural characteristics of full-length hunting affected by polyut expansion, resolving the conundrum of how amino-terminal polyut confers disease-causing property on hunting.
Ferritinophagy via NCO4 is a crucial for erythropoiesis and is regulated by iron-dependent HER2-mediated proteolysis.

Ferritinophagy is the selective autophagic turnover of ferritin, a key regulator of intracellular iron bioavailability. However, the control of ferritin flux and roles of N4 in iron processes are poorly understood. Analysis of the N4-F1 interaction reveals a direct association between a key arginine in F1 and C-terminal element N4 required for ferritin delivery to lysosomes via autophagosomes. N4 abundance is regulated by autophagy and the ubiquitin proteome. Ubiquitin-dependent N4 turnover is promoted by excess iron and involves an iron-dependent interaction between N and HER2 ubiquitin ligase. In zebraf and cultured cells, N plays an essential role in erythropo differentiation. This study elucidates the N4-ferritin complex and how intracellular iron modulates N-mediated ferritinagy in an iron-dependent setting.
Research on the organization of the lateral prefrontal cortex (LP) has shown that it plays a crucial role in higher-level cognition, but its functional organization has remained unclear. A proposed theory suggests that the LP is organized hierarchically, with progressively rostral areas processing more abstract information for efficient and flexible cognition. However, evidence supporting this theory has been limited. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed rostral-caudal gradients of abstraction in the LP, indicating hierarchical processing. Dynamic modeling showed asymmetrical LP interactions indicative of hierarchical processing. Contrary to assumptions, the strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioned midLP as the apex of the hierarchy. Cognitive demands modulated connectivity towards LP consistent with a role in integrating information control. Strengths of these dynamics related to higher-level cognitive ability. Results suggest the LP is hierarchically organized with midLP synthesizing abstract and concrete to control behavior.
Researchers have investigated the role of the hominoid-specific gene TBCD1 in the development of the cerebral cortex, a region of the brain linked to higher intelligence. TBC1 has undergone segmental duplications in homin evolution, but its function in brain development was unknown. The study found that expressing T1 in ventricular progenitor cells of mice in utero led to delamination of ventricular radial glial cells (RG) and generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with morphology of outer radial glia (RG), abundant in primates. Downregulation of T1 in human brain slices decreased generation of RG. Localized RG resulting from in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of T1 was found underlie cortical folding regions. The study identified a homin gene required for RG generation, regulating cortical expansion and folding.
The study investigated the role of ubiquitination in the transcriptional activity of the plant immune activator NPR1, a key regulator of systemic acquired resistance in plants. NPR1's ubiquitination was found to be a progressive process initiated by Cullin-RING E3 ligase, which promotes its chromatin association and expression of target genes. However, further polyubiquination by E4 ligase U4 targets NPR for proteasomal degradation. Conversely, ubiquitin ligases UBP7 and proteas-associated deubitinases enhance NPR longevity. This suggests that immune transcript reprogramming requires sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases balanced by opposing deubitinases to fine-tune NPR activity without sacrificial turnover. NPR1's ubiquination is not solely for proteasomal degradation, but also for chromatin association and gene expression. NPR1's activity is regulated by a balance of ubiquitination and deubiquination.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24 siRNAs) play a crucial role in guiding cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes. The biogenesis of 24 siRNAs requires the involvement of RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR), and DICER-like 3 (DCL3). However, the precursors of these siRNAs have remained undefined. Researchers have identified Pol IV and R2-dependent RNAs (PR RNAs) that accumulate in DCL3 mutants and are diced into 24RNAs by D3 in vitro. These PR RNAs are mostly 26-45 nucleotides in length and initiate with a purine adjacent to pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts in vitro. R2 terminal transferase activity was also demonstrated in vitro, accounting for occasional non-templated nucleotides at PR RNA 3 termini. The 24 siRNAs correspond to the 5 or 3 ends of PR RN, suggesting a model where siRN are generated from either end PR duplexes by single dicing events.
Researchers have investigated the development of neural networks in the brain during the postnatal period to understand how they become capable of complex computations. Using high-resolution in vivo electrophysiology in mice, they found that large-scale and cellular activity patterns emerge rapidly after a brief period of quiescence at the beginning of the second postnatal week. This transition is characterized by spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity. A similar developmental trajectory was observed in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. The researchers hypothesize that this quiescent period is necessary for the emergence of coordinated networks.
Researchers have developed an agent-based model to study the population structuring of multi-copy antigen-encoding genes in Plasium falciparum, a parasite responsible for malaria. The model extends earlier strain theory by considering the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression. It tracks the dynamics of unique repertoires in a population of hosts and shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition through cross-immunity structures the population into a subset of coexisting repires of genes whose degree of antigenic overlap depends on transmission intensity. 

The model suggests that the parasite population is structured into a subset of coexisting repires of genes whose degree of antigenic overlap depends on transmission intensity. Empirical comparison of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports the role of selection in structuring parasite diversity. The model shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition through cross-immunity structures the population into a subset of coexisting repires of genes whose degree of antigen overlap depends on transmission.

Deamidation of a glutamine residue in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC by the deamidase OI from enteric Shigella flexner disrupts the interaction between UBC and the R-finger ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. This disruption silences the polyubiquination activity of the UBC/TR6 complex, which is required for the NF-κB inflammatory response. The study investigated the role of deamation in silencing the U/TR6 complex and found that it inhibits the interaction between U and TR6's RING domain (TR6RING). Deamation creates a new intramolecular saltbridge in U that competes with a critical intermolecular saltbridge at the native U/TR6 interface, preventing the formation of a stable U/TR complex. Additionally, the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged glutamate residue and the positively charged surface of TR6 prevents transient interactions between the two proteins. The study reveals a mechanism by which post-translational modification alters the conformation and stability of transient complexes to inhibit protein-protein association.
Researchers investigated the effects of activating and inactivating specific types of cortical interneurons in the auditory cortex of awake mice to understand their computational roles. They used optogenetics to manipulate somatostatin-positive (S+) and parvalbum-positive (Pb+) interneurons while recording their responses to tones. The results showed that inactivating S+ interneurons increased response gain, while inactivating P+ interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer, indicating distinct computational functions. However, activating S and P interneurons showed no differences. A simple network model was used to understand this asymmetry, revealing that small changes in parameters, such as spontaneous activity or light strength, determined whether activation or inactivation produced consistent or paradoxical conclusions about interne functions.
Researchers investigated the relationship between externally induced frontoparietal synchronization and working memory (WM) performance using transcranial alternating current (tACS) stimulation. WM is an emergent property of large-scale network interactions, and synchronization of oscillatory activity may enable coordination of long-range processes. However, evidence of oscillatory activity's impact on network dynamics in humans is limited. The study applied tACS to modulate oscillatory activity in the right frontopari network supporting WM. Externally induced synchronization improved performance under high cognitive demands. Simultaneously, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed ACS effects dependent on stimulation phase and internal processing. Specifically, synchronous ACS during WM increased parietal activity, correlating with performance. Functional connectivity showed frontopetal stimulation influences information flow within WM. Findings demonstrate a link between WM performance and large-scale synchronization.
In vertebrate and amphibian embryos, embryonic polarity is largely determined by maternal factors that specify cell fates early in development. In contrast, amniotic embryos remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. Researchers sought to understand how polarity is determined in these embryos. In the chick, the earliest known factor is cV1, a homolog to mammalian growth differentiation factor 1 (GDF1), a transforming growth factor beta (Tβ) expressed posteriorly before gastrulation. A molecular screen for upstream regulators of c1 in normal and manipulated embryos forming twins revealed the transcription factor Pit2 as a candidate. Pit2 is essential for axis formation and directly regulates c1 expression by binding to enhancers within neighboring genes. Additionally, Pit, c1, and Nodal are key in left-right asymmetry, suggesting an ancient polarity mechanism has been co-opted for different functions during evolution.
Fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) exhibit robust odor-guided behaviors in response to odor gradients. To investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli, flies were subjected to precisely defined odor waveforms and examined spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OS) and projection neurons (PN). A significant transformation between OS and PN spike patterns was found, with PN strongly signaling OS rate and rate of change. A two-dimensional model admitting OS rate and rate change as inputs predicted PN output. When cascaded with rate-change encoding OS, PNs signal acceleration and rate of dynamic stimuli to brain, enabling reliable response to odor onsets.
In flowering plants, seed development begins with the fusion of the egg and central cells with two sperm cells, resulting in the formation of the embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilized products are surrounded by a maternally derived seed coat, whose development is regulated by epigenetically by the Polycomb (Pc) protein family prior to fertilization. Research has shown that fertilization of the central cell leads to the production of auxin, which is likely exported to maternal tissues, driving seed coat development and removal of Poly (c function. Mutations in the MADS transcription factor AGL62 result in impaired auxin transport from endosperm to integuments, leading to seed abortion. AGL is proposed to regulate auxin transport from endos to integ, removing the Poly block on seed development.
Researchers used a high-throughput, locus-specific phage engineering method to systematically dissect the functional role of every residue in the receptor binding domain of T bacteriophage T7 (T7) phage. The study aimed to elucidate the molecular rules governing the interaction between the phage and its host, which is mediated by the phage's receptor protein (RBP). A total of 166 variants of T7 RBP were generated, allowing for the comparison of functional profiles across different hosts to identify regions of functional importance, many of which were previously unknown. Substitution patterns revealed host-specific differences in position and physicochemical properties of mutations, indicating adaptation to individual hosts. The study discovered gain-of-function variants against certain hosts and host-restrict variants that eliminated others. To demonstrate utility, highly active T variants were engineered against a urinary tract pathogen. This approach presents a framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in phage-bacterial systems.
Individuals with congenital amus, a lifelong condition characterized by unreliable pitch processing, tend to rely on other dimensions such as duration during speech perception. This study investigated the neural basis of this strategy using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifteen individuals with amus and 15 controls read sentences with indicated grammatical boundaries, then heard sentences differing in pitch and/or duration, and selected the best match for the written sentence. Results showed prominent reductions in functional connectivity in the amus group between left frontal language-related regions and right hemisphere-related pitch regions, reflecting between-group differences in cue weights. These differences were not present during a control task. The study suggests that perceptual dimension reliability is linked to connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions, indicating a compensatory mechanism.
A newly discovered cancer, Devil Tum 2 (D2), has been identified in the Tasman devil (Sarcus harris), a species that already harbors a widespread cancer, Devilum 1 (D1). In contrast to D1, D2 cells express major histocompatibility (MHC) class I molecules, indicating that loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of a contagious cancer. However, the highly expressed MHC I alleles in D2 cells are common among devil polymorphic, reducing immunogenic in the population sharing alleles. In vivo, MHC loss is emerging, D2 may mimic the trajectory of D1. The results suggest that contagious cancers exploit histocompatibility between tumour and host, but loss allogenic antigens facilitate transmission D2.
Researchers have investigated the neural circuits in the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG), a region critical for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, using optogenetic mapping in mice. The study reveals a dissociation between parallel circuits in superficial SG that process disparate inputs. The anterior thalamus and dorsal subic, sources of spatial information, selectively recruit low-threshold (LR) pyramidal cells in SG. In contrast, regular-spiking (RS) cells are preferentially controlled by clastral and anterioringulate inputs, sources of non-spatial information. Precise subaminar and dendritic arbor within SG layer 1 permits parallel processing. Thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable LR neurons to compute speed of rotation despite head inputs not explicitly encoding speed. Parallel streams identify distinct neuronal subtype supporting spatial computations in SG.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant risk factor for the development of tauopathies, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The mechanisms underlying the prion-like spreading of Tau after TBI are not fully understood, partly due to the lack of tractable animal models. This study investigates the potential role of seizures in promoting the spread of tauopathy. Researchers created a "tauopathy" zebraf expressing a genetically encoded fluorescent biosensor that reports accumulation of human Tau species seeded via intraventricular brain injections. Zebraf larvae subjected to a novel TBI paradigm exhibited T features including cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. Application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued T-induced tauopathy and cell death. These findings suggest a role for seizure activity in the prion seeding and spreading of tau following TBI.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between the spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions, focusing on how the arrangement of cortical areas affects measures of brain connectivity. They found that the shape and location of brain regions strongly interact with modeling brain connectivity, and that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior. This suggests that variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions may be misinterpreted as changes in connectivity. Understanding these effects is crucial when interpreting functional imaging data and cognitive traits.
Researchers investigated the role of TBP (TATA-binding protein) in the activation of MyoD target genes in skeletal muscle cells, which are crucial for muscle development and regeneration. A previous study suggested that replacing the canonical TFIID (TBP) complex with TRF/TBP2 is necessary for muscle gene expression. However, the lack of developmental phenotype in TBP null mice led to further investigation of whether TBP deficiency affects adult muscle formation. The study found that TBP null mice have intact regeneration potential upon injury and TBP is not expressed in C2C12 muscle or primary mouse muscle stem cells. TFI subunits and TBP are downregulated during myoblast differentiation, but reduced amounts of these proteins form a complex detectable on muscle gene promoters, essential for their expression. This indicates TBP does not replace TBP during differentiation as previously proposed, with limited TFI-TBP amounts required for muscle-specific expression.
Researchers have investigated the effects of optogenetic stimulation on large-scale neural networks in non-human primates, specifically macaques. A large-scale optogenetic interface enabled simultaneous stimulation of excitatory neurons and electrocortic recording across primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M) cortex. Two measures of network connectivity were tracked: the response to focal stimulation and baseline coherence between pairs of electrodes, which were strongly correlated before stimulation. Within minutes, stimulation in S1 or M significantly strengthened functional connectivity between areas. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous changes across the network. These changes reflected correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent with Hebbian plasticity models.
In a rare case of a rhesus macaque monkey born without primary visual cortex (V1), researchers investigated the neural consequences of damage to this area on visual perception and behavior. The monkey's behavior was unremarkable, but visual task performance was impaired. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed that structures outside the lesion appeared normal. Visual stimulation with checkerboards activated the lateral geniculate nucleus, while full-field dots activated pulvin. Visual activation was sparse, including patches consistently across the lesion and control monkeys. Functional analysis showed a network of bilateral dorsal areas temporally correlated with V/MT activation, even without V. Despite subcortical responses to stimulation, there was little evidence for subortical input to VMT supporting residual function or blindsight phenomena.
The innate immune system's ability to recognize foreign double-stranded (ds) DNA in the intracellular environment is crucial for defense against pathogenic threats. However, the distinction between foreign and host DNA within the nucleus is not well understood. Researchers used biochemical and single-molecule techniques to study the innate sensor IF16, which recognizes foreign DNA in the nucleus. They found that IF16 one-dimensionally scans long stretches of exposed dsDNA to form supramolecular signaling platforms. Nucleosomes prevent IF16 from targeting host DNA by interfering with this one-dimensional movement. This scanning-assisted assembly allows IF16 to distinguish between friend and foe, assembling oligomers on foreign DNA efficiently and selectively.
Spatially Targeted Microproteomics (STOMP) is a novel proteomics technique that enables the interrogation of micron-scale regions of interest (ROIs) in mammalian tissue without the need for genetic manipulation. This method involves staining methanol or formalin-fixed specimens with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize ROIs, followed by soaking in a solution containing 4-benzylbenzyl-glyc-histidine. Confocal imaging with two-photon excitation is used to covalently photo-tag proteins within each ROI to a resolution of 0.67 µm in the xy-plane and 1.48 µm axially. After solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry.

The technique was tested on amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and post-mortem AD case, confirming known constituents and discovering new ones. STOMP can be applied to various samples including cell lines, primary cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy, and post-mortem tissue.
Frizzled3 plays a crucial role in axonal development in distinct populations of cranial and spinal motor neurons. Disruption of the Frizz3 gene results in defects in axonal growth of the VIIth and XIIth cranial motor nerves, phrenic nerve, and dorsal nerves of fore and hindlimbs. In Fr3−/− limbs, dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the plexus, whereas in contrast to other axon-guiding mutants, Fr3−− dorsal axons do not reroute to other trajectories. Affected motor neurons undergo cell death 2 days prior to normal developmental cell death, coinciding with innervation of muscle targets in vivo. This suggests that developing neurons with long axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at targets on schedule.

 Frizz3−/− mice exhibit defects in axonal growth of cranial and spinal motor nerves, including the VIIth and XII cranial nerves, phren nerve, and dorsal nerves of fore and hindlimbs. Axons stall at a specific location in the plex, distinct from other axon-guiding mutants. Affected motor neurons die 2 days before normal developmental cell death, coinciding with muscle innervation in vivo. This indicates that neurons with long axons are programmed to die if axons do not reach targets on time.

Researchers investigated the role of transposable elements (TEs) as enhancers in the regulation of gene expression in embryonic and trophlast stem cells in mice. Transposable elements are repetitive DNA sequences that have been thought to contribute to the establishment of gene regulatory networks in both embryonic and extraembry lineages of the early embryo. However, there is limited evidence of their involvement in gene regulation. The study tested a set of long terminal repeat TE families as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophlast stem cells. Epigenetic and transcriptomic data indicated that many TEs contributed to tissue-specific gene expression. Genetic editing of individual T confirmed a subset of regulatory relationships. However, a broader survey via CRISPR interference of RL13 elements in embryonic cells revealed only a minority played significant roles in regulation.
C4 photosynthesis has evolved independently in at least 60 plant lineages from the ancestral C3 pathway. However, the evolutionary history of this complex trait is unclear. Researchers conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C, or intermediate C-C forms of photosynthesis to parameterize a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape. This landscape revealed four major trajectories of C4 photosynthesis evolution. A novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model was developed and experimentally verified to predict the C phenotype. The evolutionary histories underlying C4 photosynthesis were determined by ancestral and initial phenotypic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis. The order of C trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic factors. This flexibility facilitated convergent evolution of the complex trait.
Researchers have reengineered the ATPase active site of a bacterial protein SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity, revealing that the nucleotide base plays a crucial role in the protein's function. SpoIVA is a cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during Bacillus subtilis sporulation. It evolved from a TRAC class P-loop GTPase, but the evolutionary pressure that drove the change in nucleotide specificity was unclear. The reengineered protein, SpoAGase, functioned as a Gase but failed to polymerize because it did not form an NDP intermediate required for polymerization. Incubation with ATP did not promote polymerization, indicating that the nucle base, in addition to energy from hydrolysis, is critical for specific functions. The study suggests that increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation drove the change in nucle preference in Spo.
Researchers investigated the long-term consequences of leptin signaling absence in early life by restoring leptin signaling in mice lacking the leptin receptor (Lep) gene at 4 or 10 weeks of age. Leptin plays a crucial role in energy balance and neurotrophic effects during development, but its role in development is not fully understood. The study found that previously irreversible defects caused by neonatal leptin deficiency, such as poor arcuate nucleus projections, were recovered by Lep reactivation in adulthood. However, Lep deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity due to suppressed energy expenditure. Lep reactivation in adulthood resulted in reduced hypothalamic Pomc, Cart, and Prlh mRNA and defects in reproductive and growth systems. Findings indicate that early leptin signaling defects cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems.
Arabidopsis thaliana heterotrimeric G proteins play a crucial role in regulating immunity by directly interacting with the FLS receptor. The FLS receptor perceives the bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the cytoplasmic kinase BIK. Heterotrimeric proteins composed of the non-canonical G protein XL2, the G protein AGB, and the G proteins AG1 and AG2 are required for FLS-mediated responses through an unknown mechanism. This study reveals that in the pre-activation state, XL2 directly interacts with F2 and B1, and functions with A and AG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of B1, allowing optimal activation. Following activation by fl22, XL dissociates from A and is phosphorylated by B in the terminus. The phosphorylated XL enhances production of reactive species (ROS) by modulating NAD oxidase Rho. The study demonstrates the proteins are directly coupled to the F receptor and regulate signaling through pre- and post-mechanisms.
Arabidopsis circadian clock regulates gene expression across the day-night cycle through a complex feedback loop, generating a 24-hour rhythm. However, the robustness of the clock in individual cells and coordination across the plant remains unclear. This study investigates clock activity at the single-cell level in Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant conditions. Results show robust oscillations in individual cells, albeit desynchronized. Two waves of clock activity are observed: one descending and ascending in the root. Cell-to-cell coupling of the clock is evident, particularly in the root tip. A model demonstrates that cell-to-cell coupling and measured period differences between cells generate the observed waves. The study reveals the spatial structure of the plant clock, suggesting that unlike the centralized mammalian clock, Arabidopsis has multiple coordination points.
In a study of over 100,000 adults with clinically normal hearing, researchers found that multi-talker speech intelligibility varied widely among individuals, with some experiencing significant difficulties in understanding speech in noisy environments despite normal hearing thresholds. Using electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from the ear canal, neural locking to frequency modulation (FM) cues was identified as a predictor of multialker speech intelligibility. A combination of neural fine temporal processing, pupil-indexed listening, and FM accounted for 78% of the variability in multialker intelligibility.
Researchers have developed a method to non-invasively image and measure single-cell blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels of the retina, a part of the central nervous system, in living mammals. The mammalian eye's transparency allows for a clear view of microvessels, but imperfections in the eye's optics blur microscopic retinal capillaries and blood cells. This limits early evaluation of vascular diseases originating in capillaries. To overcome this, researchers used 15 kHz adaptive optics to measure blood flow in C57/BL6 mice. Measured flow ranged 4 orders of magnitude (0.0001-1.55µL/min) across retinal diameters (3.2-45.8µ) without surgery or dye. The ultrafast imaging pipeline analyzed millions of cell speeds.
Researchers have identified a receptor-like kinase called Symbiosis Receptor Kinase (SYK) as crucial for the development of two types of symbiotic relationships between plants and microorganisms: phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis. However, the mechanisms that distinguish between these two symbiotic fates have remained unclear. This study found that ectopic expression of receptor-like genes Nod Receptor 1 (N1), N5, and SYK triggered spontaneous nodule organogenesis and nodulation gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Overexpression of N1 or N5 associated with endogenous SYK in Lotus japonicus Epasis revealed that dominant SYK initiates signaling independently of N1 or N5 and upstream a set of genes required for calcium-spiking in both symbes. Only SYK but not N overexpression triggered expression of AM-related genes, indicating SYK plays a key role in deciding between AM or nodule development.
DeepPose, a software toolkit for fast and robust animal pose estimation using deep learning, has been developed to address the limitations of current methods in speed and robustness. Quantitative measurements are crucial for various scientific disciplines, including neuroscience and ecology, and state-of-the-art deep learning methods have improved data quality and detail by automatically estimating animal body parts from images or videos. However, existing pose estimation methods have limitations in speed and robustness. DeepPose uses an efficient multi-scale deep model, StackedNet, and a GPU-based peak-detection algorithm for keypoint estimation with subpixel precision, improving processing speed by more than two times with no loss in accuracy compared to current methods. The toolkit's versatility is demonstrated with challenging pose tasks in laboratory and field settings, including groups of interacting individuals. The work reduces barriers to using advanced tools for behavior measurement and has broad applicability across behavioral sciences.
When innate immune cells, such as macrophages, are challenged by environmental stresses or pathogens, they activate multi-protein complexes called inflamomes to initiate inflammatory responses and pyroptosis, a form of cell death. Researchers have identified an intracellular trigger of NLR3-mediated signaling, IL-1 production, and pyptosis in murine bone-derived macrophages, mediated by disruption of glycolytic flux. This results from a drop in NAD levels and induction of ROS, which can be rescued by adding products that restore NAD production. This signaling is crucial for host response to intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimur, which disrupts host glucose metabolism by uptake. The study reveals an inflammatory network used by cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens.
PAL2 is a tumor suppressor protein linked to various malignancies, including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. It coordinates BRCA1 and BRCA2 functions during homologous directed repair (HDR) and interacts with chromatin proteins. In addition to its scaffold function, PAL2 binds DNA. The role of this interaction is poorly understood. A major DNA binding site of PAL2 was identified, mutations which reduce RAD51 foci formation and HDR efficiency by 50%. PAL2 N-terminal DNA binding domain (NDB) stimulates RAD51 recombinase function. Surprisingly, NDB possesses strand exchange activity without51. Moreover, NDB stimulates inverse strand exchange and uses RNA substrates. Data reveal a versatile interaction of PAL2 and a critical role of PAL DNA binding for chromosome repair in cells.
Bacterial actin Mre, a prokaryotic homologue of actin, forms antipar double filaments in vitro and in vivo. Unlike previously known actin filaments, which consist of parallel protofilaments, Mre protoaments are arranged in an antipar fashion. Crystal structures of Caulobacter Mre reveal the antipar arrangement of protoaments at the atomic level. The antipar orientation of protoaments is essential for Mre's role in cell shape maintenance, as demonstrated by site-specific cross-linking of antipar M protoaments in E. coli. coli. Cryo-electron microscopy shows Caulobacter Mre protoaments bind tightly to membranes. Crystal structures of Caulob M in different nucleotide polymer states reveal conformation changes accompanying antipar filament formation. Antimicrobial agent A22MP binds to nucleotide M, preventing hydrolysis and destabilizing protoaments.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis for the difference in petal number between Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirs, two closely related plant species. Arabidopsis thalian has a fixed petal number, whereas Cardamine hirs has variable petal number. The study found that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator APETALA1 (AP1) accounts for the species-specific difference in petal robustness. AP1 in Arabidopsis thalian confers robustness by masking the phenotypic expression of quantitative trait loci controlling pet number in Cardamine. In contrast, Cardamine AP1 fails to complement this function of Arabidopsis AP, resulting in variable pet number. Regulatory regions of AP contribute to this divergence. Furthermore, pet number is maintained in Cardamine despite standing genetic variation in accessions producing four-pet flowers.
Insulin Misfolding is an Early Event in the Progression to Type 2 Diabetes

Insulin is a crucial for maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and its biosynthesis begins with the folding of the proinsulin precursor, which involves the formation of evolutionarily conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. In normal pancreatic islets, a subset of proins molecules have at least one free cysteine residue. However, in islets with perturbed endoplasmic reticulum environment, non-native proins forms intermolecular disulf-linked complexes. In genetically obese mice with wild-type islets, disulf-linked proins complexes are more abundant, and in leptin-deficient mice, such complexes further increase with onset islet deficiency and diabetes.

Proins-Cys19 and Cys20 are necessary for proins disulfide complex formation, and pro-Cys-Cys19 homodimers resist reductive dissociation, providing a basis for aberrant pro complex formation. Increased proins misfolding via disulf complexes is associated with prediabetes, worsening ß-cell dysfunction in type two diabetes.
SUVH is a histone lysine methyltransferase that specifically targets peric regions and plays a crucial role in assembling heterochatin. It recognizes trimethylated H3 (H3me3) via its chromodomain (CD) and H3me allows SUV to target specific chromosomal regions. However, the mechanisms of targeting chromatin without existing H3me are not well understood. This study reveals that SUVH's chromodomain (SUVH-CD) binds nucleic acids, which is essential for its function in heterochatin assembly. SUV-CD has higher affinity for RNA than DNA and its nucleic binding is independent of Hme recognition. In vivo, SUV binds major satellite RNAs and knockdown of satellite RN lowers SUV retention on peric. SUV mutational studies indicate that nucleic and Hme activities of SUV-CD are crucial for peric heterochatin assembly. These findings suggest chrom-bound RN contribute to SUV's specificity.
Researchers have investigated the role of the entorhinal cortex in spatial navigation and attention. Grid cells in the entorinal cortex are thought to contribute to precise spatial decoding and navigation. A prerequisite for this hypothesis is that grid cell activity does not depend on physical movement. The study found that movement of attention, without physical movement, elicits spatial fields in the entorinal cortex. Monkeys were trained to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a stimulus in the periphery. A population of entorinal cells with spatially structured fields was identified. This contrasts with recordings in the hippocampus, where grid-like representations were not observed. The study provides evidence that macaque entorinal cells do not rely on physical movement.
Standardized and Reproducible Measurement of Decision-Making in Mice

Researchers have long recognized the importance of standardized assays that can be readily shared and compared across laboratories to advance scientific progress. However, reproducibility has been a concern in neuroscience, particularly in measurements of mouse behavior. To address this issue, a standardized task for decision-making in mice was developed and tested across multiple laboratories. The task was designed to assess perceptual and value-based decision-making in head-fixed mice, with a standardized protocol, hardware, and software, and procedures. 

A total of 140 mice were trained across seven laboratories in three countries, with over 5 million choices collected into a publicly available database. Learning speed varied across mice, but once training was complete, there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice from different laboratories relied similarly on visual stimuli, past successes, and failures, and estimates of prior probability to guide their choices. These results demonstrate that complex behavior can be reproduced across laboratories, establishing a standard for reproducible rodent behavior and providing an unprecedented dataset and open tools to study decision-making in mice.
Researchers have created a comprehensive atlas of gene expression and cell types in the intestine of Schmidtea mediterrane, a planarian flatworm that can regenerate its organs, including the gut. Using laser-capture microdissection (LCM) and RNA sequencing, they identified hundreds of genes with intestinal expression not previously detected by other methods. Systematic analysis revealed extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans. The study also uncovered previously unknown regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, particularly in intestinal goblet cells. Two intestine-enrich transcription factors were identified: gli-1, which regulates hedgehog signaling, and Rb2, which maintains goblet cells.
In a study on the sensory adaptations of weakly electric fish, researchers investigated the relationship between evolutionary divergence in perception and physiological coding of stimuli. Mormyrid fish, a type of weakly electric fish, can detect subtle variations in electric signals by encoding waveform differences in spike timing between sensory receptors. In contrast, species insensitive to waveform variations produce spontaneously oscillating potentials. The study found that oscillating receptors respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase, resulting in synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing, not waveform. These receptors were most sensitive to frequencies found in conspecific signals, correlated with increased behavioral responses. Different perceptual capabilities correspond to receptor physiologies. The study suggests divergent mechanisms represent adaptations for different environments.
Researchers have determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the bacteriophage BPP-1, which infects and kills Bordetella species that cause whooping cough, at a resolution of 3.5 Å. The structure reveals two major protein folds: the jelly roll fold of the capsid protein (CP) and the HK-like fold of the major capsid protein (MCP). Notably, the topology of MCP is non-circularly permuted from the previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. The new topology is likely the only feasible alternative to the old, with β-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions contributing to non-covalent chain formation in BPP-1, unlike coval interprotein linkages in HK97. The termini of both CP and MCP are positioned for DGR-based phage display.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that cycles between mosquito and mammalian hosts. To understand how DENV adapts to these environments, researchers used serial passage in human and mosquito cell lines and estimated the fitness effects of single nucleotide variants in these populations using ultra-deep sequencing. This allowed them to determine the contributions of beneficial and deleterious mutations to the collective fitness of the population. The study found that a large burden of deleterious mutations counterbalances the effect of rare, host-specific beneficial mutations on adaptation. Beneficial mutations preferentially map to intrinsically disordered domains in the proteome and cluster in defined regions of the genome. These phenotypically adaptive alleles may facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation. The evolutionary constraints observed in this system mirror those across DENV and Zika strains, indicating recapitulating key biophysical and biological shaping long-term evolution.

Researchers used single-particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy (sPALM) to study the behavior of KRas12, an active mutant of the Ras protein, in U2OS cells. They found that KRas12 is confined to distinct membrane domains, approximately 70 nanometers in size, embedded within larger domains of 200 nanometers that allow for intermediate mobility. The rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion. KR12 is continuously removed from the immobile domains and replenished to the fast state, similar to internalization and recycling. The diffusion and trafficking properties of KR12 remain constant over a range of expression levels.
In vertebrates and invertebrates, the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling plays a crucial role in patterning the dorsoventral embryonic axis. The prevailing view in vertebrates is that BMP gradient formation is achieved through a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists and ligand shuttling to generate peak signaling levels. However, a study in zebraf has challenged this understanding by quantifying BMP activity in wild-type and mutant embryos and combining data with a mathematical model-based screen to test hypotheses. The analysis ruled out BMP shutling and transcriptional gradient mechanisms, instead supporting a source-sink model where a restricted antagonist acts as a sink to drive BMP dorsally and gradient formation. This mechanism was further supported by measuring Bmp diffusion, indicating a new pathway to shape BMP gradients during development.
Lysosomes play a crucial role in intracellular protein degradation and cellular homeostasis by facilitating the export of low-molecular weight catabolic end-products through polytopic transmembrane proteins. However, many lysosomal transporters remain poorly understood. This study focuses on MFSD, a previously uncharacterized lysosomal member of the major facilitator superfamily. MFSD is non-glycosylated and contains a dileucine sorting motif necessary for its transport to lysosomes. Mice lacking MFSD exhibit splenomegaly and severe liver disease. Proteomics analysis of lysosomes from MF mice reveals GL as a critical accessory subunit for MFSD. MFSD and GL physically interact, with GL essential for maintaining normal MFSD levels in lysosomes and vice versa. GL knockout mice mimic MFSD phenotype. Our data demonstrate a tightly linked MFSD/GL lysosomal protein complex.
Researchers have gained insight into the process of microtub transport powered by kines motors, which is crucial for various cellular processes in eukaryotes, by developing atomic models of nucleotide and ATP states of the moneric kines motor domain microtub from cryo-EM reconstructions at 5–6 Å resolution. These models were compared with existing X-ray structures of AD-bound kines to infer a mechanistic scheme. Microtub attachment, mediated by a conserved 'chpin' residue kines (N255), triggers a clam opening of the nucleotide cleft and release of AD. Binding of ATP closes the cleft in a manner tightly coupled to translocation of cargo via kines's 'neck' element.
Researchers have identified a novel quality control (QC) pathway for misfolded proteins at the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM) in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This pathway targets temperature-sensitive (ts) peripheral OM proteins, sen2-Hs and sam-2Hs, for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteome system. The ubiquitination of sen-2H is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1, while sam-2 is primarily ubiquinated by San1. Mitochondrial-associated degradation (MAD) of both substrates requires the Hsp70 and HspS1 chaperones, indicating a role for chaperone involvement in MAD. Additionally, the C48-N4-U1 AAA-ATase Do1 and a mitochondrial pool of transmembrane C48 adaptor Ubx2 are implicated in degradation. This study reveals a unique QC pathway combining cytosolic and mitochondrial factors distinct from other cellular pathways.
Researchers have developed an ERK FRET biosensor to visualize epidermal ER activity in living mice. Under steady-state conditions, the epidermis exhibited bursts of ERK activity that propagated radially from cell to cell. The frequency of this spatial propagation of ER activity (SP) correlated with the rate of epidermal cell division. SPs were stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoyphol 13-acetate (TPA) in a manner dependent on EGF receptors and their ligands. At wounded skin, ER activation propagated as a wave parallel to the wound edge, suggesting ER activation can be superimposed. Visualizing the cell cycle, SPs were associated with G2/M cell progression.
Researchers have investigated the cyanobacterial circadian clock, a biological process that regulates daily physiological changes in response to environmental cues. In natural settings, circadian rhythms are not self-sustained but rather driven by external cues that vary with seasonal timing. The mechanisms governing circadian alignment with external cycles are not well understood. This study presents experiments demonstrating the cyanobacterial circadian clock in vivo and in vitro. The phase of the circadian rhythm follows a simple scaling law in light-dark cycles, tracking midday conditions with variable day length. The core oscillator, comprised of Kai proteins, behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating intrinsic dynamics within these proteins. A mathematical framework is developed based on instantaneous transformation of the cycle by external cues, predicting behavior in various environments.
A genome-wide association studies have identified Meis as a risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), a leading cause of premature death in the general population. Meis inactivation in the neural crest leads to altered sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac rhythmicity in adults, characterized by chronotropic incompetence and conduction defects, increasing susceptibility to SCD. Meis is a major regulator of sympathetic target innervation and Meis deficient neurons die by apoptosis from embryonic to perin stages. Meis regulates transcription of molecules necessary for endosomal machinery, traffic of Rab5 endosomes is severely altered in Meis-inactivated neurons. Meis interacts with trophic signaling pathways during postmitotic neurons.
Researchers have investigated the formation of surface-attached bacterial communities called biofilms, which exhibit diverse morphologies despite known structural and regulatory components. Using Vibrio cholera as a model, they combined measurements, theory, simulation, image analysis, surface characterization, and mutagenesis to show that mechanical instabilities, such as wrinkling and delamination, drive biofilm morphogenesis. Interfacial energy is identified as a key driver of morphogenesis, dictating the creation and annihilation of interfaces. A feedback loop between morphogenesis and bio expansion shapes the biofilm contour. The study's principles, based on mechanical instabilities and interfacial energies, are applicable to morphogenesis in higher organisms.
Researchers have investigated the role of the transcription factor NRS in the development of epilepsy, a condition characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. Previous studies have shown that interfering with NRS function reduces the severity of the disorder. This study found that severe seizures increase NRS levels in the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in memory and emotion. However, surprisingly, only a small subset of NRS target genes are repressed. Blocking NRS binding to chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins, rescues the repressed genes. Genes selectively repressed by NRS have moderate binding frequencies to the repressor, making them sensitive to fluctuations in NRS levels. These genes code for ion channels and receptors crucial for neuronal function. Dynamic regulation of NRS target genes may influence neuronal properties in pathological and physiological contexts.
Researchers have investigated the parallel processing of sensory information in the mammalian olfactory system, specifically focusing on the pathways formed by mitral and tuft cells in the olfactory bulb of mice. The study aimed to characterize the emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via distinct lateral inhibitory circuits. Results show differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between mitral and tuft cells, attributed to distinct activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations demonstrate that circuit-level differences enable mitral and tuft cells to discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, suggesting segregation of information about stimulus intensity may be a function of these parallel pathways.
The M2 muscarinic receptor, a prototypic model of allosteric G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), has been studied to elucidate the molecular and supramolecular determinants of alloster effects. Monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor were compared to identify alloster properties gained in oligomers. Alloster interactions were monitored using a FRET-based sensor at the alloster site and pharmacological assays involving mutants to exclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of alloster at the atomic level were examined in molecular simulations. Alster effects in monomers were exclusively negative, derived from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between alloster and orthosteric ligands. Alster effects oligomers could be positive or negative, depending on alloster-ortheric pair, arising from interactions between constituent protomers. The behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations.
SET2, an enzyme responsible for trimethylating histone H3 lysine 36 (H3me36), plays a crucial role in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair and activation of the p53-mediated checkpoint. Researchers found that SET2 is necessary for homologous recombination of DSBs by forming RAD51 presynaptic filaments. SET2-mutant clear cell carcinoma (RCC) cells showed impaired DNA signaling, despite persistent DNA lesions. SET2-deficient cells failed to activate p53, a guardian of the genome, and showed decreased survival after DNA damage. The study proposes a novel role for SET2 in chromatin bookmarking DSB signaling and repair. In CC, SET2 loss may enable p53 inactivation without additional TP53 mutations.
Researchers have identified a missense variant in the Rasgrp gene, known as RasgrpAna, which results in an amino acid substitution in the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor of the Ras1 protein. This mutation leads to the development of autoantibodies and the accumulation of a CD44+ Helios+ PD-1+ CD4+ T cell population, which is dependent on B cells. Despite reduced Ras1-Ras-ER activation in vitro, thymocyte selection in RasgrpAna mice is mostly normal, although CD44 is overexpressed on naïve thymocytes and T cells in a T-autonomous manner. CD44 expression is identified as a reporter of mTOR kinase signaling through a novel strain, chino, with a reduction-of-function in mtor. Elevated mTOR signaling in Rasgrp naïve CD+ T cells CD44, CD+ T subset and autoib all returned to normal in RasgrpAnaMtorchino double-mut mice, demonstrating that increased m activity is essential for RasgrpAna T dysregulation.
Mutations in members of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling family are common in cancer, but the mechanisms by which disruption of SWI/S components affects tumorigenesis are not well understood. This study investigated the effect of loss-of-function mutations in the SWI/S subunit Arida in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) initiation. Researchers used shRNA-mediated, inducible and reversible suppression of Arida in the mouse pancreas in the setting of oncogenic KrasG12. Results showed that Arida cooperates with Kras in the pancreas post-silencing of Arida following KrasG12 expression induces rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PDAC lesions. In contrast, Arida silencing during embryogenesis concurrent with Kras12 activation leads to retention of ac cell fate. The study demonstrates Arida as a critical modulator of K-dependent changes in ac cell identity and highlights the influence of timing and genetic context on SW/S complex alterations in epithelial tumenesis.
Researchers investigated the effects of social isolation on the brain's response to stress in mice, focusing on the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons, which play a key role in stress regulation. They found that isolating pre-adolescent female mice from their littermates for 24 hours altered the intrinsic properties of these neurons, increasing first spike latency (FSL) and decreasing excitability. This was not observed in age-matched males. In contrast, subjecting either isolated or group-housed females to acute physical stress through swimming increased FSL. The increase in FSL following social or physical stress was blocked by the glucocortic synthesis inhibitor metrapone and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. The increase in FSL resulted in a decrease in excitability of CR neurons.
Hemoglobin (H) is a protein that has been extensively studied in the context of molecular adaptation in vertebrates. While both the affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding to H have a significant impact on oxygen delivery to tissues, it was previously thought that only affinity determined adaptations of H. This study suggests that H affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptations that optimize oxygen delivery to tissues. To test this hypothesis, the relationship between the Hill coefficient and conformation parameters of the Monod-Wann-Change alloster model was derived and graphed, creating a 'physical landscape describing this relation. Results show that mammalian H cooperativity values reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity on this landscape, allowing for both gross and fine-tuning of oxygen unloading to meet distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen. This reveals the underlying mechanism of body-related adaptation of mammalian H.
Researchers conducted a longitudinal analysis of Plasmodium sporozoite motility in the dermis to understand how the parasite locates and enters blood vessels after being injected into the skin by an Anopheles mosquito. The study used intravital microscopy in mice to observe sporozoite movement and interaction with dermal blood vessels. The results show that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: 'vascular' motility' far from blood vessels, characterized by high speed and low confinement, and 'non-vascular motility' near vessels, with more constrained movement. Curvature of sporite tracks was found to optimize contact with dermal capillaries. Mutations in key adhesive proteins highlighted the importance of sporite gliding speed and modulating adhesive properties for successful exit from inoculation site.
Cells are organized into functional modules, consisting of components that, when removed, compromise the module's function. Despite their importance, these components are not universally conserved across the tree of life, suggesting that cells can perform the same biological functions with different proteins. Researchers evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 100 generations without the polarity gene BEM1. Initially, bem1 lineages increased in fitness, then reached >90% of their BEM ancestors' fitness at the end of evolution. Sequencing their genomes and monitoring polarization revealed a common evolutionary trajectory with a fixed sequence of adaptive mutations, each improving polarization by inactivating proteins. The study shows organisms can be evolutionarily robust to physiological perturbations and recovery by inactivation can lead to divergence in cell biologically important functions.
Researchers investigated the neural mechanisms underlying economic decision-making in the human medial prefrontal cortex by presenting participants with a series of independent choices between goods or gambles with lasting consequences, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. Participants were asked to decide whether to accept or reject prospects with sustained financial returns. Brain activity in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmFC) encoded value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value over time. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encoded value only when participants rejected or accepted a prospect. ACC activity reflected two biases: deferring commitments to later and weighting potential losses more heavily than gains, paradoxically maximizing reward in this task. These findings provide new insights into the pressures shaping economic decisions and value computation in the medialfrontal cortex.
Researchers have investigated the role of paraspeckles, nuclear bodies that form around long non-coding RNAs and RNA-binding proteins, in controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level through the retention of mRNA containing 3'-UTR inverted repeats of Alu (IRu) sequences. In pituitary cells, components of parasck, including major proteins and Neat, displayed a circadian expression pattern. The study found that insertion of IRu at the 3'-R of EGFP cDNA led to rhythmic circadian retention of egfp mRNA, which was lost when parasck were disrupted, whereas insertion of single IRu had a weak effect. Using real-time microscopy, IRu were shown to drive circadian of EGFP.
Presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) play a crucial role in converting electrical signals into chemical signals at the synapse. However, the proteins that regulate their function in the active zone are not well understood. Research has identified Munc13, a protein essential for exocytosis, as a controller of VGCC function during various forms of activity. In vitro studies revealed that Munc interacts with VGs through a pair of basic residues in its C2 domain. Eliminating this interaction by removing M13 or replacing it with a C mutant altered VG response to high-frequency bursts and action potential and calcium influx from single stimuli.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between the shape and function of plant cells, specifically focusing on the puzzle-shaped cells found in the epidermis of various plant species. The epidermis is the outermost layer of plant tissue, responsible for protecting the plant from environmental stress and damage. The intricate shape of these cells has long been observed, but its functional significance remained unclear. The study proposes that the complex shape of these cells serves to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall of the epidermis. When tissue growth is isotropic, or uniform in all directions, lobes emerge at the cellular level to prevent the formation of isodiametric cells, which would bulge under stress from turg pressure. Data from multiple plant species supports the relationship between lobes and isotropy, which is tested in mutants where growth direction is perturbed. Simulation models demonstrate a mechanism regulating cellular stress that reproduces epidermal cell shape. Results suggest mechanical stress drives cell morphogenesis.
Human genes contain multiple introns, which require mechanisms to define exons and ensure proper connection by spliceosomes. Spliceosome assembly involves cross-intron and crosson interactions, but how they work together is unclear. Researchers examined human nuclear extracts interactions of single pre-mRNA with fluorescently tagged spliceosomal complexes to investigate how cross-in and crosson processes jointly promote pre-splice assembly. U1 complex bound to 5' splice of intron acts with U bound to 5' of next intr to increase rate and efficiency of U2 recruitment to 3' splice of upstream intr. Flanking 5 sites have greater effects implying distinct mechanisms U recruitment. Synergy of 5 introns and exons is likely promoting correct and efficient splicing multi-in preRNAs.
Researchers have identified a novel folding system that assists membrane proteins on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This system involves the ubiquitination of a specific lysine on the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6, which promotes its folding while preventing degradation. The ubiquitin is then removed by the deubiquinating enzyme USP19, allowing LRP6 to exit the ER. This process is similar to glucylation-deglycosylation in the ER during calnexinreticulin cycle. To prevent futile cycles, LRP6 is palmitoylated and exported, while misfolded proteins are polyubiquinated and targeted for degradation. This system also regulates proteostasis of membrane proteins CFTR and anthrax receptor 2, involved in human diseases.
Researchers investigated sex differences in learning and decision-making processes in mice using a two-armed bandit task, a classic value-based decision-making paradigm. The study aimed to uncover latent variables that define decision-making approaches in animals with similar performance. Results showed that male and female mice had similar accuracy, but achieved this through different patterns of exploration. Males made more exploratory choices, often getting stuck in exploration once started, while females explored less but learned quickly during exploration. These findings suggest sex influences decision-making during learning and exploration periods, not during stable choices. Exploration is altered in individuals with addiction, depression, and neurodevelopmental disorders, highlighting neural mechanisms as a translational avenue for sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.
Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is a process where proteins are ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome. The cytosolic ATPase Cdc48 drives extraction by pulling polyubiquitinated substrates. However, the mechanism of how hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) segments are moved from the phospholip bilayer into cytos, together with hydrophil and ER luminal parts is unknown. 

A reconstituted system with purified proteins from Saccharomy cerevisiae reveals that ubiquitin ligase Doa10 (Te-4/MARCH in animals) is a retrolocase that facilitates protein extraction. The substrate's TM segment interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Do10 and passively moves into aqueous phase. Luminal segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state. Unfolding occurs on luminal side of membrane by cytoplasm C48 action.
In Drosophila, Hedgehog (H) proteins induce transcriptional changes in target cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Doph Ci or mammalian Gli proteins to nuclear repressors and activating full Ci Gli proteins. This study investigated the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent H signaling in Doph wing imaginal discs using Ci variants expressed at physiological levels. Results showed that Ci variants that cannot be processed supported a normal pattern of graded gene activation and development of adults with normal morphology when supplemented with constitutive Ci repressor, indicating H can signal in the absence of regulated processing. Processing-resistant Ci variants were also activated in the absence of H by elimination of Cos2, likely through binding the CORD of Ci or PKA, revealing inhibitory roles of these components in addition to established promoting processing.
Researchers have identified a specific type of neuron in the spinal cord's dorsal horn, called calretinin-positive interneurons, which play a crucial role in processing sensory information. These interneurons form a network that amplifies excitatory signals and transmits them to lamina projection neurons, which are responsible for relaying pain information to the brain. Using an optogenetic approach, the researchers selectively activated these interneurons expressing the calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR) and found that they initiate and sustain enhanced excitatory signaling. The activation of these interneurons in vivo resulted in significant nocifensive behavior, which was sensitive to morphine and caused conditioned aversion, and was enhanced by spared nerve injury. Furthermore, halorhodin-mediated inhibition of these interne elevated sensory thresholds. The study suggests that dorsal horn circuits involving excitatory CR neurons are important for pain generation and amplification and identifies these interneurons as a potential analgesic target.
Mutations in the gene encoding Ras-associated protein 23 (RAB23) cause Carpenter Syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by polydactyly and skull morphogenesis defects. To investigate RAB's role in skull development, Rab23-deficient mice were generated, which survive to an age where skeletal development can be studied. Along with polydactly, these mice exhibit premature fusion of sutures due to aberrant osteoprogen proliferation and osteogenesis in the suture. Fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10)-driven fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling is elevated in Rab-/-sutures, leading to an imbalance in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP), hedgehog, and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUN2) expression. Inhibition of FGFR1 signaling results in normalization of osteoprogen proliferation and concomitant reduction of osteogenic gene expression, and prevention of craniosynostosis. These findings suggest a novel role for RAB as an upstream regulator of FG and canonical hedgehog signaling, and non-canonical regulation of GL1 through FGFR1.
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) plays a crucial role in maintaining epigenetic repression of genes in animals and plants by modifying chromatin at its targets. Histones. Modified by PRC can be inherited through cell division. However, it is unclear whether this inheritance is a long-term memory of gene states (cis) or if chromatin states are dictated by diffusible factors (trans). Researchers studied the expression of two Arabidopsis Polycomb target FLOW LOCUS (FLC) in plants. One copy was repressed while the other was active. This mixed state was inherited through many cell divisions as plants developed. Data show epigen memory of FLC expression is stored in cis.
Researchers investigated the structure and function of oligomers formed by the endoplasmic retic (ER) chaperone Hsp70, also known as BiP. Using site-specific proteolysis and cross-linking, they found that these oligomers consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate site of another, which attenuates the chaper function of Bi. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapid modulation between the burden of unfolded proteins and Bi oligomers, and slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified Bi. Lumen ER depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian Bi and coincidental diminution in substrate binding, indicating the inertness of oligomers. The equilibration between inactive oligomers and active monomeric Bi is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER protein load on a rapid timescale neither by interversion of active covalently-modified Bi nor the unfolded response.
Researchers have determined the near-atomic structure of Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), a representative of the Potexvirus genus, using cryo-electron microscopy at 3.9 Å resolution. The virus particle consists of hundreds of helically arrayed coat proteins (CP) protecting a single-stranded RNA. The structure of PepMV CP was modeled and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles nucleoproteins (NPs) from the Phlebovirus family, a group of enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses. The main difference between Potvirus CP and Phlevis NP lies in their C-terminal extensions, which determine distinct multimer assemblies: flexible helical rod or loose nucleoprotein. This homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic and single-stranded RNA viruses.
Researchers have developed a new method, SiteLoc, for estimating the location of antibody binding sites on cell surfaces at the nanoscale resolution. This method uses topological averaging to determine the distance between a bound ligand and a reference point on the cell surface. Traditional techniques for epitope identification are time-consuming and unsuitable for high-throughput analysis, hindering the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Antibodies bind heterogeneously across cell surfaces, making particle-averaging challenging for accurate localization. Site achieves nanoscale resolution in one dimension, the distance from a bound ligand to a reference. Results show Site is well-suited for antibody binding measurements on native cell morphology and can be applied to other molecular estimations.
Systemic vascular pressure in vertebrates is regulated by a complex interplay of factors, with peripheral resistance in capillary tissue beds being a key element of control. The relationship between central control of vascular flow and peripheral resistance is not fully understood, particularly in the context of hypoxic response in tissues and its effect on systemic adaptation to oxygen deprivation. This study investigates the role of hypoxic response via HIF transcription factors in a large vascular bed, the skin, on cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia in mice. Results show that the skin's response to hypox influences a range of cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressure, and body temperature. This is the first demonstration of oxygen sensing in a peripheral tissue directly modifying cardiovascular response to hypoxia.

 The study utilized a mouse model of hypoxia to investigate the role of HIF transcription factors in the skin. HIF-1α and HIF-2α were found to be upregulated in response to hypox in the skin. This led to increased expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, glycolysis, and cell survival. The skin's response to hypox was found to influence systemic cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and body temperature. The skin's response to hypox was found to be mediated by HIF-1α and HIF-2, with HIF-1 having a greater effect on angiogenesis and H-2 on glycolysis.

 The skin's response to hypox was found to feed back on the cardiovascular system, increasing heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and body temperature. This is the first demonstration of a peripheral tissue directly influencing cardiovascular response to hypox. The skin's response to hyp was found to be mediated by HIF-1 and H-2, with H-1 having a greater effect on angiogenesis and H-2 on glycolysis. The skin's response to hyp was found to feed back the cardiovascular system, increasing heart rate, mean pressure, and temperature.
Researchers have developed a novel optogenetic method for mapping neural circuitry with single-neuron resolution. This approach utilizes a two-photon beam expansion in the imaging plane and channelrhodin targeting to the soma and proximal dendrites to evoke action potentials in individual neurons. The method allows for verification of spike generation with GCa6 and determination of synaptic presence or absence with patch-clamp electrophys recording.

 The technique involves expanding a two-photon beam in the imaging plane using temporal focusing to target channelrhodin to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons. This enables the evocation of action potentials in individual neurons, which can be verified with GCa6, a genetically encoded calcium indicator. The presence or absence of synaptic connections is then determined with patch-clamp electrophys recording.

 The method is based on the use of channelrhodin, a light-activated cation channel, which is targeted to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons. Channelrhodin is activated by two-ph light, causing depolarization of the neuron and evocation of action potentials. GC6 is used to verify the generation of action potentials. Patch-clamp electrophys recording is used to determine the presence or absence of synaptic connections between neurons.

 Results show that the method can reliably evoke action potentials in individual neurons and verify spike generation with GC6. The presence or absence of synaptic connections is also determined with patch-cl electrophys recording. The method provides a new tool for mapping neural circuitry with single-neuron resolution.
Researchers have investigated the interaction between two transcription factors, Sox2 and Oct4, on eukaryotic genomes. Previous studies using single-molecule techniques suggested an ordered assembly of these factors on DNA, but the calculated quantity of binding did not determine the order, instead indicating energy expenditure away from thermodynamic equilibrium. A rigorous biophysical analysis led to the concept of reciprocity, where Sox2 and Oct exhibit negative reciprocity, with Sox2 increasing Oct4's genomic binding and Oct decreasing Sox2's binding. Models show that negative reciprocity can arise from energy expenditure or a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct genomic loci. This implies unexpected complexity in how transcription factors interact with DNA, with single-molecule methods providing novel detection capabilities.
Researchers have investigated the ability of Drosophila melanogaster to detect and respond to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which are molecules that trigger immune responses in the presence of infection. They found that Dophila display strong aversive responses to LPS and identified gustatory neurons expressing the Gr66 receptor as key in mediating avoidance of LPS in feeding and egg-laying assays. The chemosensory channel TRPA1 was found to be necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance in these neurons. LPS was shown to stimulate Dophila neurons in a TR1-dependent manner and activate exogenous TRPA channels in human cells. The study demonstrates that Dila detect bacterial endotoins via a gustatory pathway through TR1 activation, a conserved mechanism.
Researchers have identified a zinc finger protein called Zfp335 as crucial for the formation of naïve T cells, a type of immune cell essential for immune function. A mouse mutant, Zfpbl, with a hypomorphic mutation in Z335, exhibits a lack of naïve T cells due to a developmental defect starting in the thymus and continuing in the periphery, affecting cells that have recently left the thym. The effects of Z335 are multifaceted and cannot be attributed to altered thym selection, proliferation, or Bcl-dependent survival. Z335 binds to promoter regions with a specific motif, and targets genes related to metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcription regulation. Restoring one target, Ankle, partially rescues cell maturation.
Researchers have challenged the long-held assumption that mRNA abundance directly correlates with protein abundance in bacteria and archaea, finding that the two are often imperfectly correlated. Discrepancies can be attributed to mRNA features such as codon usage and secondary structure. A new factor, mRNA:RNA avoidance, has been identified, which increases translational efficiency. A strong selection for avoidance of mRNA:RNA interactions is observed across prokaryotes, with a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. Variants of green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with varying mRNA:RNA potential were generated, showing GFP levels correlate with avoidance. Accounting for mRNA:RNA interactions enables precise protein abundance modulation.
In a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), denervation of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) occurs early in the disease progression, but it is unclear whether this is a result of global motor neuron degeneration or a distinct process. Researchers used in vivo imaging to track single axons and NMJs in SOD1G37 mice over a three-month period and found that motor units are dismantled asynchronously. Prior to complete axonal degeneration, axonal branches are dismantled accompanied by new axonal sprouting and synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first NM, suggesting a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. These findings indicate NM denervation in ALS is a dynamic process of continuous denervation and innervation rather than sudden motor neuron degeneration.
Researchers investigated the effects of tamoxifen, a medication used to treat breast cancer, on mice to understand its long-term side effects. Tamoxifen improves survival rates but causes issues such as hot flashes, bone density loss, and fatigue in patients. Due to a lack of animal models, the mechanisms behind these side effects are unclear. The study found that mice on tamifen treatment experience changes in temperature, bone density, and movement. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed tamifen induces gene changes in the hypothalamus and preoptic area (hypothalamus-PO). These changes depend on estrogen receptor alpha (ER) as conditional knockout of ER in hypoth-PO ablates tamifen gene expression. ER-deficient mice do not exhibit tamifen changes in temperature, bone, or movement.
ISG15, an interferon-stimulated linear diubiquitin-like protein with antiviral activity, has been found to play a crucial role in countering Listeria monocytogen infection. Research has shown that IS15 expression in nonphocytic cells is dramatically induced upon Lister infection, and this induction is independent of type I interferon and relies on the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA signals through STING, TBK, IRF3, and IR7. IS15 has been found to restrict Lister infection in vitro and in vivo. Stable isotope labeling in culture (SILC) was used to identify ISylated proteins responsible for the protective effect, revealing that overexpression of IS15 leads to ISylation of ER and Golgi proteins, correlating with increased secretion of cytokines counteracting infection.
Single-molecule Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (smRET) is a technique used to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, the development of high-throughput methodologies and commercial instrumentation has outpaced the development of standardized and automated methods to analyze the resulting data. To address this, researchers have developed DeepRET, an open-source software based on deep learning that automates the analysis of single-molecule RET data. 

DeepRET takes raw microscope images as input and outputs histograms of biomolecule behavior, requiring only user-adjustable threshold for quality. It integrates standard features of RET analysis, outputting common metrics such as kinetic information. On ground truth data, DeepRET achieved >95% accuracy, outperforming human operators and commonly used threshold, requiring ~1% of time. Its rapid operation on real data demonstrates DeepRET's capacity to quantify biomolecular dynamics and contribute to benchmarking RET for structural biology.
Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) plays a crucial role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. SCML, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila SCM, is a Poly-group protein that associates with PR1. This study demonstrates that SCMLA, an SCML isoform tightly associated with chromatin, contributes to PR1 localization and directly represses certain Polycomb target genes. SCMLA binds PR1 via its SPM domain and interacts with ncRNAs through a novel RNA-binding region (RBR). Targeting SCML to chromatin involves the action of MB domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PR1 through SPM. Deletion of BR reduces SCML occupancy at target genes and overexpression of mutant SCML lacking BR causes PR recruitment defects.
Researchers have elucidated the mechanisms of ribosome stalling by SecM at multiple elongation steps in Escherichia coli. Ribosome stalling by the C-terminal sequence of SecM regulates the Sec-dependent secretion pathway. Cryo-EM structures of Sec-stalled ribosomes at 3.3-3.7 Å resolution reveal two distinct stalling mechanisms at elongation steps of the translation cycle. One mechanism involves inactivation of the ribosomal peptid-transfer center, inhibiting peptide bond formation with proly-tRNA. The other involves prolonged pept-RNA residence at the A site, inhibiting full tRNA translocation.
Researchers used an Adaptive Optics Scanning Ophthalmoscope to image the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects, measuring cone density and other metrics in visual and linear retinal units. The study found that the foveal cone mosaic is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite a decrease in cones/mm^2, myopes have a higher angular density in cones/deg around the fove compared to emmetropes. This suggests better visual acuity in myopes. Reports of best-corrected fove vision deficits in myopes compared to emrop cannot be explained by increased photoreceptor spacing due to retinal stretching during myopic progression.
Researchers have developed a model to calculate the duration of pneumocococcal carriage in infants, a leading cause of invasive disease in low-income settings, from longitudinal swab data. They combined this with whole-genome sequence data and found that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the variation, while host traits (age and previous carriage) accounted for less than 5%. The heritability was partitioned into lineage and locus effects, with serotype contributing 17%, drug-resistance 9%, and other locus 7%. A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences associated with decreased carriage, independent of serotype, potentially disrupting competence mechanism. This supports theoretical models of pneumoccal competition and resistance.
Researchers have investigated the stoichiometry of the KCNQ and KC1 subunits in the slow rectifier (IK) channel, which plays a crucial role in cardiac repolarization. The stoichi between the two subunits has been debated, with some studies suggesting a fixed 2:1 ratio and others a variable up to 4:1. To address this, the authors created fusion proteins linking KC1 to one, two, or four KCQ subunits to reproduce 4:1, 2:1, and 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole-cell and single-channel recordings showed that fusion proteins with four KC subunits had hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter latency compared to those with one sub, which was abolished by addition of KC1. Furthermore, using unnatural amino acid photo-crosslinking, the authors found that fusion with four sub crosslinked at slower rates than those with one, indicating no intrinsic limit to four sub association within the IK complex.
In a study on zebraf fin regeneration, researchers investigated the role of interleukin-1 beta (Ilb) in the process. Cellular responses to injury are crucial for complete tissue regeneration, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Zebraf mutants lacking myoid cells, which are essential for regeneration, display apoptosis of regenerative cells during fin regeneration. The study found that apoptosis is caused by prolonged expression of Ilb. Myoid cells are the primary source of Ilb, but epithelial cells also express Ilb in response to injury, initiating the inflammatory response. Macrophages are necessary for survival of regenerative cells. Ilb regulates expression of regeneration-induced genes, playing an essential role in fin regeneration. Proper levels of Ilb and inflammation, tuned by macrophages, are crucial for tissue regeneration.
Researchers investigated the impact of ribosome surface properties on the nature of the cytoplasmic proteome in three bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Lactoccus lactis, and Haloaxii volcanii. They used surface-modified fluorescent proteins (FPs) to measure translational diffusion coefficients (D) in the cytoplasm of each species. The study found that in E. coli, protein mobility depends on net charge and distribution, with positively charged proteins diffusing up to 100-fold slower than negatively charged ones. This effect was weaker in L. lactis and H. volcanii due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in mobility was attributed to interaction of FP with ribosomes, confirmed by in vivo measurements and in vitro with purified ribosomes.
Planarians, a type of flatworm, have the ability to regenerate entire body parts, but the mechanisms behind this process are not fully understood. They respond differently to wounds that result in tissue loss versus those that do not. Researchers investigated how these distinct responses are activated and found a protein called S-follatin, a homolog of follatin, is required for planarian regeneration. Sollatin inhibits responses to tissue loss but not normal tissue turnover. Two activin homologs, S-activ-1 and Sactiv-2, are necessary for Soll phenotype. Soll is induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue loss. These findings suggest Soll inhibits S-activ proteins to trigger regeneration specifically after injuries involving tissue loss and identify a mechanism for initiation of regeneration across the animal kingdom.
Researchers have identified a unique genetic signature in tumors with mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency, characterized by persistent DNA replication errors that manifest as mutations. Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing confirmed this signature is distinct from other tumor genomes, yet similar to germline DNA, suggesting a significant fraction of human variation arises from escaping MMR. A set of recurrent indels was found to be associated with microsatellite instability (MSI), and a novel marker was developed to detect MSI in endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, showing greater specificity and selectivity than standard tests. Recurrent indels were enriched in the 'double-strand break by homologous recombination' pathway. Consequently, DSB repair is reduced in M-deficient tumors, leading to dose-dependent sensitivity of M-deficient cultures to DSB inducers.
Researchers have developed an optimized version of a light-inducible dimer protein called Magnets, derived from the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid. This protein enables precise and spatial control of biological processes in a non-invasive manner. Magnets are small modules engineered by orthogonalizing the homodimer interface into heteromers, consisting of two well-tolerated protein partners that require simultaneous photoactivation to interact, confining dimerization to a single excitation wavelength. However, they require concatemerization for efficient responses and preincubation at 28°C to be functional. To overcome these limitations, an optimized Magn pair, called eags, was engineered, requiring neither concatization nor low preincation. eags were validated by rapidly and reversibly recruiting proteins to subcellular organelles, inducing organel contacts, and reconstituting OS-VAP-ERol tethering in phosphatidyositol-4-phosphate metabolism.
Research on the effects of ribosome stalling during translation has shown that it can lead to neurodegeneration, but the underlying signaling pathways triggered by stalled elongation complexes are not well understood. To investigate these pathways, researchers analyzed the brains of C57/BL/6-Gbp2tm2f-/- mice, which have elongation complexes stalled at AG codons due to deficiencies in tRNA and GTP2, a mammalian ribosome factor. Elevated levels of phosphorylated eIF2α (Ser51) were detected before neurodegeneration in these mice, and transcript analysis revealed activation of ATF4, a key factor in the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway. Genetic experiments demonstrated that this activation was mediated by the e2 kinase GC2, in a deacylated tRNA-independent manner. Furthermore, the ISR was found to attenuate neurodegeneration in C57/BL/6-G2tmf- mice, highlighting the importance of cellular context in the outcome of this pathway activation. These findings illustrate the interplay between elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during stress.
A century of Trends in Adult Height: A Global Analysis of 18.6 Million Participants

A comprehensive analysis of 147 population-based studies has estimated the mean height of adults born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries. The study found that being taller is associated with increased longevity and higher earnings. The largest gain in adult height over the past century occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who increased by 20.2 cm (95% CI 17.5-22.7) and 16.5 cm (13.3-19.7) respectively. In contrast, little change in height was observed in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia over the century. The tallest individuals over 100 years were men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, averaging 182.5 cm, while the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896, 140.3 cm (135.8-144.8). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations 100 years ago remained the same for women and increased for men despite changes in country rankings.
Opioid-induced respiratory depression is a major contributor to the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States, with rates quadrupling between 1999 and 2017, resulting in an average of 130 deaths per day. To address this issue, researchers investigated the brain regions and cell types responsible for opioid-induced respiratory depression in mice. They found two key sites in the brainstem involved in this process: the pre-Bötzinger Complex, where breathing rhythm originates, and the locus coeruleus, which regulates breathing rate. By eliminating the µ-opioid receptor in these areas, they confirmed the brainstem's role in opioid-induced respiratory depression. Further investigation revealed that 70-140 neurons in the preötz Complex are responsible for opioid sensitivity. Characterization of these neurons may lead to therapies that prevent respiratory depression while preserving analgesia.
Researchers have identified sodium taurochotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as a functional receptor for human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its satellite virus (HDV). HBV and HDV infections remain a significant public health concern, with co-infection with HDV leading to more severe disease. The entry of both viruses into cells is mediated by HBV envelope proteins, with the pre-S domain of the large protein being a key determinant for receptor binding. However, the identity of the receptor was unknown. Using near-distance photo-crosslinking and tandem purification, researchers found that the pre-S region of HBV specifically interacts with NTCP, a transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NT inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NT expression made hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to viral infection. Replacing amino acids 157-165 of nonfunctional monkey NT with human counterpart conferred ability to support both viral infections.
Sepsis leads to lasting changes in the phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in long-term immunity. The health burden of seps and its associated cytokine storm is significant, with early intervention improving survival during the storm, but those who survive enter a state of immunoparalysis characterized by lymphopenia and functional deficits in surviving cells. Memory CD8 cells provide rapid cytolysis and cytokine production upon reencounter with cognate antigen to promote long-term immunity, and CD8 cell impairment due seps can predispose individuals to re-infection. This study investigated the influence of seps on pre-existing memory8 cells and their recovery. Central memory8 cells from septic patients proliferate more than those from healthy individuals. Using LCMV mice and CLP model to induce seps, it was demonstrated that central proliferation is associated with recovery of pathogen-specific memory8 cells following seps-induced lymphopenia. This leads to changes in composition of memory8 cell compartment and altered localization. Further, memory8 from seps survivors have altered transcriptional and chromatin accessibility indicating lasting cell changes. Seps changes the composition of memory8 pool and transcriptional landscape resulting in altered cell function and reduced capacity to control L monocytogen infection.
Long interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition poses a mutagenic threat to human genomes, and cells have evolved strategies to regulate L1 retroposition. The APOB3 (A) family of enzymes catalyze deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides (C-U) in single-strand substrates, with APO3A being the most potent inhibitor of L1 retroposition in cultured assays. However, characterization of L1 retroposition events in presence of A3 did not yield evidence of deamination, leaving the mechanism by which A3 inhibits L retroposition enigmatic. In vitro and in vivo assays demonstrate A3 can inhibit L retroposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA during process of L integration, providing mechanistic explanation how A3 cytidine deaminase protein inhibits L retroposition.
Researchers investigated the role of the protein Rem2, a GTPase, in shaping neural circuitry and plasticity in response to sensory experience. They found that mice lacking Rem2 exhibited impaired ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period. At the cellular level, Rem2 was shown to regulate the intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, prior to changes in synaptic function. In vitro and in vivo recordings revealed increased spontaneous firing rates in the absence of Rem2. The study demonstrates Rem's key role in regulating neuronal excitability and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience.
Recent studies have investigated the effects of magnetic fields on biological molecules and cells, prompted by reports of magnetism in biological systems. Qin et al. (2016) identified a protein that acts as a compass to guide magnetic orientation in animals, while Stanley et al. (2015) and Wheeler et al. (2016) demonstrated magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel and manipulating it with a magnetic field. However, these claims conflict with fundamental laws of physics, exhibiting discrepancies of 5-10 log units. If these phenomena occur, their causes must differ from proposed by authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes limits their utility for magnetically sensitive cells.
Researchers have investigated the process of quiescence in Drosophila neural progenitor cells, specifically neuroblasts. These cells can self-renew, differentiate, or enter quies, and understanding how they switch between these states is crucial for stem cell therapeutics. Neuroblasts have been a model for studying self-renew and differentiation, but quies has been poorly understood. The study found that when neurobl enter quies, the factor Prosper is transiently detected in the nucleus, followed by a unique molecular profile lacking progenitor and differentiation markers. A low level of Prosper precedes entry into quies, even when timing is advanced or delayed by changing factors. Loss of Prosper prevents quies, while a low level can drive proliferating neurobl into quies. The study proposes that Prosper levels distinguish progen states: absent for selfnew, low for quies, and high for differentiation.
Researchers have developed a single-molecule fluorescence microscopy method to study the real-time kinetics of HIV-1 capsid uncoating in vitro after viral membrane permeabilization. The study reveals that the opening of the first defect in the lattice is the rate-limiting step of uncoating, followed by a rapid collapse of the capsid. The caps-binding inhibitor PF74 accelerates caps opening but stabilizes the remaining lattice. In contrast, binding of polyan to a conserved arginine cluster in the lattice delays initiation of unating but does not prevent lattice disassembly. The findings suggest that different stages of unating can be controlled by the interplay between capsid regulators, determining overall unating kinetics.
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women, with genomic analysis of cancer DNA indicating frequent loss-of-function mutations in components of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Despite JNK's role in promoting cell proliferation through activation of the AP-1 transcription factor, its association with tumor development was unexpected. This study investigated the effect of JNK deficiency in murine breast epithelium. Loss of J signaling caused genomic instability and breast cancer development. J deficiency also led to widespread neoplasia and rapid tumor formation in a murine breast cancer model. This suppressive function was not mediated by J's role in tumor growth, but its requirement to prevent initiation. Data identify J pathway defects as driver mutations promoting instability and initiation.
Researchers have identified a crucial enzyme called peptidylglycine-amidating monooxygen (PAM) that plays a key role in the formation of cilia in both Chlamdomonas and mammals. Cilia are hair-like structures on cells that help with movement and sensing the environment. The study found that P is necessary for the assembly of motile and primary cilia in Chlamdomonas and mice. When P was knocked down in Chdomonas, cilia failed to form beyond the transition zone, had abnormal Golgi architecture, and altered levels of cilia components. Similarly, decreased P expression in mice resulted in reduced motile cilia on the ventral surface and cytoplasmic axemes lacking ciliary membrane. Primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in P-/- embryos were also aberrant. The study suggests that P activity and post-Gol trafficking contribute to ciliogenesis and reveals a conserved link between P amidation and ciliary assembly.
Myosin III (My3) and the actin-bundling protein Espin play crucial roles in the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells, with defects leading to hereditary hearing impairments. My3 interacts with Espin through its tail homology motif (TH), but the mechanism by which My3 acts on Esp to regulate actin assembly and stabilization is unclear. This study reveals that My3 TH contains a pair of sequences capable of strongly binding Espin ankyrin repeats, unveiling a novel My3-mediated Espin crossing mechanism. The My3-Espin complex structures elucidate the binding mechanism and reveal My3-induced Espin autoinhibition release. My3 crossing also promotes Espin actin bundling activity.
Voltage-gated calcium channels play a crucial role in the functioning of excitable cells, such as neurons and heart and skeletal muscles, by controlling processes like synaptic transmission and contraction. These channels activate at distinct voltages and kinetics to accomplish their diverse functions. To understand the molecular basis of voltage sensing, researchers analyzed the structures, free energy, and kinetics of two functionally distinct voltage-sensing domains (VSDs) of the eukary calcium channel CaV1.1 using modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology. 

The two VSDs exhibited features of the sliding helix model, but differed in ionair formation of outer charges. Stabilization of the activated state enhanced voltage dependence, while stabilization of resting slowed kinetics. This mechanism explains how ionair in VSDs realize characteristic properties of voltageated cation channels.
Researchers investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in adult brain plasticity, specifically in the visual cortex (V1) of healthy and stroke-affected mice. Matrix metalloproteinases have been linked to experience-dependent plasticity in juvenile V1, but their role in adult V1 is not well understood. In healthy brains, MMP activation facilitates structural changes, whereas in injured brains, MMP upregulation promotes lesion spread and impairs recovery. To reconcile these opposing outcomes, the effects of MMP inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected mice were examined. In healthy mice, 7-day MMP-inhibition prevented plasticity, while treatment with MMP-inhib once, but not twice, rescued plasticity lost under stroke conditions. These findings suggest an optimal MMP activity level is necessary for adult plasticity to occur.
AMPA receptors, a type of glutamate-gated ion channel, play a crucial role in signal transduction at vertebrate excitatory synapses. These receptors consist of four subunits that assemble as dimers. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have revealed full-length structures of AMP receptors, both alone and in combination with auxiliary subunits. These structures suggest that dimers undergo lateral motions during gating, exposing the extracellular layer along the twofold axis. To investigate this, bifunctional methaniosulfate crosslinkers were used to calibrate AMP receptor conformations in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Starg. Results indicate that the extracellular layer of AMP receptors can be trapped in stable, opened conformations upon glutamate exposure. In contrast, Stargin limits conformation flexibility. Under synaptic conditions of brief glutamate and auxiliary presence, extracellular AMP domains likely remain compact during gating.
Researchers have developed a method to isolate single intestinal cells from mice infected with helmin, a type of parasitic worm, from the duodenum, a part of the small intestine. This was challenging due to the strong immune response triggered by the parasite, which causes mucus production, tissue remodeling, and immune cell infiltration. A standard digestion protocol was optimized to isolate millions of immune cells from the infected duodenum. High-dimensional flow cytometry and confocal microscopy were used to validate the accuracy of the isolated cells. The method allowed identification of hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the course of helmin infection and has potential for single-cell discoveries of local helmin immune responses previously unfeasible.
Proteasomal degradation plays a crucial role in regulating protein half-life and cellular processes, including metabolism and immunological responses. Despite its significance, the mechanisms governing proteas activity are not fully understood. Researchers employed an integrated approach to develop and validate mechanistic models of proteomal peptide hydrolysis. The 20S proteasome is dynamic, with activity varying due to interactions between substrates, products, and proteolytic sites, and their locations. A model predicted and experimentally confirmed these sites and interactions. Analysis revealed the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is substrate transport into the proteasome, with varying efficiency between standard and immuno-proteomes, affecting total degradation and cleavage-site usage.
In Drosophila, the recycling of neurotransmitters is crucial for sustained synaptic transmission. Histamine, a key neurotransmitter, is rapidly taken up by laminar glia and converted to carcinine, which is then delivered back to photoreceptors, where it is hydrolyzed to histamine and β-alanine. Histamine is repackaged into synaptic vesicles, but the mechanism of β-al return to lamin glial cells is unclear. A new βanine transporter, Bala (β-alanine Transporter), has been identified. Bala mutants exhibit lower β-al levels and reduced β-al accumulation in the retina. Bala is expressed in retinal pigment cells and required for visual transmission and photaxis.
Researchers have investigated the role of oxidants in the aging process of post-mitotic cells, specifically focusing on the chronological aging of yeast cells. The study reveals that these cells undergo a sudden redox collapse, affecting over 80% of thiol-containing proteins. Contrary to the free radical theory of aging, this collapse is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants, but rather a drop in NAD+ levels, which normally maintains cellular redox homeostasis. This decrease in NAD occurs early in lifespan, initiating a cascade that downregulates cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a universal lifespan-extending measure, increases NAD and delays the cascade. The study outlines a timeline of events leading to widespread oxidation of the proteome before cell death.
In the biological world of macromolecules, homochirality is essential for cell survival, and its enforcement is crucial for proper function. A key mechanism that ensures this homirality is the proofreading of the genetic code during translation, specifically the removal of D-amino acids from tRNAs. Researchers have identified the mechanistic basis of this process in the enzyme D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase (DTD) from Plasmodium falcum, a parasite that causes malaria. 

 The crystal structure of DTD in complex with a substrate-mim analog reveals how it captures the chiral center of D-amacy-tRNA using an invariant cross-subunit Gly-Pro dipeptide. No protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, but a unique side-chain mode of substrate recognition allows DTD to act on multiple D-am acids. This strict chiral specificity explains how the enriched pool of L-amacy-tRNAs escapes the proofreading step. The study provides insights into fundamental enantio selection and elucidates a chiral mechanism crucial in preventing D acid infiltration during translation.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between the opening and closing of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel and the dimerization of its two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). In the wild-type CFTR channel, ATP-induced dimerization of the NBDs opens the pore, while dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis closes it. However, in certain mutated CFTR channels, spontaneous openings occur without ATP and are stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CF potentiator. The study found that spontaneous openings are strictly coupled to NBD dimer, which can occur without coordinated NBD/pore movements. This suggests that CFTR's ATP alters the stability, not the structural architecture, of open and closed conformations. The findings provide insights into the effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP and spontaneous activity, and shed light on CF and drug mechanisms.
Researchers have proposed a novel mechanism for the assembly of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, which they refer to as the "pre-transition" or "preel" effect. This phenomenon arises from the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane. Using large-scale molecular simulations, they demonstrate that a protein with a hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic order-disorder interface with finite stiffness. When two such proteins approach each other, their assembly reduces the interfacial energy, leading to their assembly. This effect is analogous to the hydrophobic effect and is referred to as the "orderobic" effect. It is mediated by proximity to the order-disorder phase transition and the hydrophobic mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered.
Researchers investigated the relationship between action potential (AP) and fluorescence signals in genetically modified mice expressing GCaMP6 or GCa6, a fluorescent calcium indicator used to study neural dynamics. The study focused on layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex. Simultaneous imaging and cell-attached recordings were used to detect APs and fluorescence. Under optimal conditions, most APs were detected. However, under typical population imaging conditions, only a minority of AP1 and AP2 events were detected, approximately 10-20% and 30% respectively. This highlights the limitations of detecting AP under realistic imaging conditions.
Researchers have discovered a unique biological valve in the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave-dwelling insect, Neotrog, which enables it to receive multiple seminal packages from males. This valve is composed of two sclerites, a closure element, and in- and out canals, allowing females to have a penis-like intromitt organ to anchor and receive voluminous semen. The semen is stored in a capsule, formed by seminal injection, which serves not only for fertilization but also as a source of nutrition for the female. The valve has two slots for insemination, enabling Neotla to mate while one slot is occupied. In conjunction with the penis, this valve is a morphological novelty allowing females to compete for seminal in nutrient-poor cave habitats through prolonged copulation and multiple injections. The evolution of this valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of introm organ in Neotla.
Synaptosomal N-ethylimide-sensitive attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins play a crucial role in the rapid exocytosis of neurotransmitters in a Munc-1-dependent manner. However, the functions of different stages in exocytosis and the role of Munc-1 in SN assembly are not well understood. Researchers used optical tweezers to observe four stages of SNARE assembly: N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker (NTD, MD, CTD, and LD) domains. They found that SN mutations differentially affect SN assembly. Comparison of effects on SN assembly and exytosis reveals NTD and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, while MD regulates SN assembly and fusion. Munc-1 initiates SN assembly and stabilizes SN C-terminus independent of syntaxin N-terminal domain (NRD). The study demonstrates distinct functions of SN domains whose assembly is chapered by M-1.
Researchers investigated the assembly of integrin adhesomes, the protein complexes that mediate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, by examining the cytosolic state of integrin components and their exchange between adhesion sites and cytos. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), they found that integrin adomes are pre-assembled in the cytos as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites. Stationary adhesions release the same types of protein complexes they recruit, maintaining a uniform cyolic pool of building blocks in space and time. This suggests a model where multi-protein blocks enable rapid and modular assembly of adhesion sites and exchange of blocks preserves specificity and assembly logic of the system.
Researchers have identified a new electrophysiological marker that can distinguish between different states of reduced arousal in humans, including wakefulness, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and general anesthesia induced by propofol. This marker is based on the 1/f spectral slope of the electrophys power, which reflects non-oscillatory, scale-free neural activity. 

 Studies using intracran and surface EEG recordings in four independent data sets showed that the 1/f slope effectively discriminates wakefulness from propof anesthesia and NREM sleep. Critically, it also distinguishes wake from REM sleep based solely on neurophysiological brain state. This suggests that reduced states of arousal are not solely defined by synchronized oscillations in the electroencephalogram (EEG). Unlike REM sleep, which is characterized by desynchronized 'wake' EEG, NREM and propof anesthesia are associated with synchronized oscillations. 

 The 1/f slope was found to be a common electrophys marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including sleep stages as well as anesthesia in humans.
Researchers have discovered that stromules, dynamic tubular extensions of chloroplasts, interact with microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (AF) to facilitate chloroplast movement during innate immunity. The study found that MT organization directly affects stromule dynamics, increasing numbers and length when stabilized chemically or genetically. Actin filaments are not required for strom extension, but provide anchoring points for stromules. A correlation exists between strom direction and chloroplast movement. Chloroplast movement was observed in steady-state conditions without immune induction, suggesting a general strom function in epidermal cells. Microtubules and actin facilitate perinuclear chloroplast clustering during innate response. A model proposes stromules extend along MT, connect to anchor AF points, facilitating chloroplast movement to nuclei during immunity.
Researchers have developed a method to predict residue-residue interactions across protein interfaces using evolutionary information. They investigated whether amino acid sequences of residues that make contact across interfaces covary during evolution. The study found that residue pairs identified using a pseudo-likelihood method covary across proteinprotein interfaces in the 50 ribosomal unit and 28 bacterial complexes with known structures are almost always in contact in the complex, provided the number of aligned sequences is greater than the length of two proteins. This method was used to make subunit predictions for 36 complexes with unknown structures and models based on these predictions for the tripart ATP-independent periplasm (TR) transporter, tripart efflux system, pyruvate form lyase-activating enzyme, and methine ABC transporter. 

The pseudo-likelihood method identified residue pairs that covary across protein interfaces in the 50 ribosomal unit and 28 bacterial complexes with known structures. These pairs were almost always in contact in the complex when the number of aligned sequences was greater than the length of proteins. The method was used to predict subunit for 36 complexes with unknown structures. Models based on these predictions were made for the tri ATP-independent periplasm (TR) transporter, tri efflux system, pyvate lyase-activating enzyme, and meth ABC transporter.
Researchers investigated how people interpret visual scenes by gathering information from multiple locations in the scene. They used a gaze-contingent paradigm in a categorization task to show that participants' scan paths follow an active strategy that incorporates prior knowledge of the scene's structure and statistical patterns. Participants' performance improved when locations were revealed by an optimal Bayesian sensor. A combination of Bayesian observer and sensor estimated that 70% of apparent optimality arises from biases, perceptual noise, and eye movement inaccuracies. The process of selecting locations is 70% efficient in the task. Participants select eye movements to maximize information about categories requiring integration from multiple locations.
Nucleocytoplasmic transport is a tightly regulated by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which controls the passage of thousands of molecules into the nucleus. Large cargoes, such as pathogens, mRNAs, and pre-ribosomes, can cross the NPC intact, despite their size exceeding 15 nanometers. However, the requirements for nuclear import of these large cargoes are not well understood, particularly the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors via nuclear localization sequences (NLS) and the effect on import efficiency. This study investigated nuclear kinetics of 30 cargo models of capsid-like particles, 17-36 nanometers in size, with tunable numbers of up to 240 NLS. Results show that requirements for transport can be recapitulated by a two-parameter biophysical model correlating import with energetics of large transport through NPC. The study reveals molecular determinants of large import in cells.
CD28 is a co-stimulatory molecule that plays a crucial role in the activation of helper T cells. However, its function in maintaining T cell responses after activation is not well understood. To investigate the role of CD28 after T cell priming, a strain of mice was generated where CD28 was removed from CD4 T cells after priming. The study found that continued CD expression of CD28 is necessary for effector CD4 T cells following infection. Specifically, CD28 is required for the expansion of Th1 cells and the differentiation of T follicular helper cells during viral infection. Additionally, CD28 is necessary for clearance of Citrobacterium rodent from the gastrointestinal tract. These findings demonstrate that CD persistence of CD28 is required for T cell polarization response to infection, revealing a novel function of CD28 distinct from its role in priming.
Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium responsible for stomach infections, requires a helical shape to efficiently colonize the stomach. However, the molecular mechanisms generating this shape are unclear. Research has shown that the helical line and radius of wild-type H. pylori cells exhibit significantly higher positive and negative Gaussian curvatures compared to straight or curved rod-shaped H. pylori cells. Three-dimensional microscopy analysis using fluorescent probes revealed enhanced cell growth at sidewall extremes. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated that Mre is abundant at negative curvature, while bactin C is most abundant at positive curvature. Strains expressing C variants with altered polymerization properties lost helical shape and positive curvatures. The study proposes a model where C and M promote synthesis at positive and negative curvatures, respectively, and this patterning is necessary for maintaining helical shape.
Cdc48, a ubiquitin-selective chaper, plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics by orchestrating the activities of E3 ligases and deubiquilases (DUBs). Research has identified a new function of C48 in ubiquitin-dependent regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. Two Ds, Ubp1 and U2, exert opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion, cleaving different ubiquitin chains on mitofus F1. C48 integrates the activities of these Ds, which are themselves ubiquilated. Firstly, C48 promotes proteolysis of U1, stabilizing pro-fusion ubiqulation F1. Secondly, loss of U stabilizes U2, thereby removing ubiquitin chains F, inhibiting fusion. C48 synergistically regulates ubiqulation status F, controlling balance between activation or repression of mitochondrial fusion. A cascade of ubiqulation events, C48 and Ds, fine-tunes fusogenic activity F1.
Researchers investigated the role of vision in the development of categorical representation in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOT) using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in sighted and congenitally blind individuals. The study aimed to determine if vision is necessary for the organization of VOT responses to sound categories. The results showed that VOT reliably encodes sound categories in both sighted and blind individuals using a representational structure and connectivity similar to that found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group using a representational format closer to that found in vision. Crucially, VOT in the blind represented categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. The findings suggest that sounds trigger categorical responses in VOT of congenitally blind and sight people match the topography and functional profile of visual responses, despite differences in categorical organization between modalities.
Researchers have identified a fungal pathogen, Entomophthora muscae, that manipulates the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster in the laboratory setting. This pathogen induces striking changes in host behavior, but the underlying mechanisms are not well understood due to the lack of a suitable experimental system for molecular manipulation. A strain of E. mus was found infecting wild D. melanogaster, and methods were established to infect D. melanaster in the lab. Infected flies exhibit moribund behaviors characteristic of E mus infection: they climb upward, extend their proboscis, affix in place, then raise their wings, clearing a path for spores to launch from their abdomens. The fungus invades the nervous system, suggesting a direct means to induce behavioral changes.
Researchers have mapped the transcriptome-wide binding profiles of 30 RNA degradation factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, revealing the distribution of degradation factors across different RNA classes. The results are consistent with the canonical pathway of closed-loop degradation for forming mRNAs after deadenylation. Modeling of mRNA half-lives suggests that most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, whereas decapping factors are recruited for mRNA degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step. Decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons, consistent with degradation of inefficiently translated mRNAs. The nuclear machinery, including complexes Nrd/N3 and TR4, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and snoRNAs.
Researchers have identified a novel type of chromatin associated with the rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes in response to pathogen signals in Arabidopsis. Camalexin is a potent defense compound in Arabidopsis thaliana that can be rapidly induced by bacterial and fungal infections. While several transcription factors controlling camalex biosynthesis genes have been characterized, the rapid activation of this pathway upon pathogen signal remained unknown. By combining publicly available epigenomic data with in vivo chromatin mapping, researchers found camalex biosynthesis genes marked with epigenetic modifications with opposite effects on expression: trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3me27) repression and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 (H3ac) activation. These modifications form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants with reduced H3me or Hac suggested both modifications required for timing gene expression and metabolite accumulation at early stress stage. The study indicates Hme-Hac bivalent chrom, named kstat, controls timely gene expression upon stress in plants.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the histone methyltransferase EZH2 in adult astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the mouse brain. These astrocytes, also known as neural stem cells (NSCs), express EZ2 and rely on this Polycomb repressive factor for neurogenesis, independent of its role in cell proliferation. Deletion of EZ2 in NSCs rescues proliferation, but neurogenesis remains defective. Olig2, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, is a direct target of EZ2, and its repression is critical for neuronal differentiation. EZ2 also prevents the activation of genes associated with non-SV neuronal subtypes. In the human brain, SV cells including astrocytes express EZ, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. EZ2 is an epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SV astrocytes, orchestrating distinct aspects of adult stem cell biology, with implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis.
Researchers investigated the ecology and evolution of viruses infecting uncultivated SUP bacteria in a marine oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) using single-cell and metagenomics. They isolated 127 single amplified genomes (SAGs) from uncultivated SUP bacteria and identified 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA Caudirales and ssDNAviridae. The study found that approximately one-third of SUP bacteria were infected with viruses, with higher infection frequency in areas of severe oxygen deficiency. Observed Microviridae clonality suggested recovery of bloom-terminating viruses, while co-infection between dsDNA and ss viruses indicated previously unrecognized cooperation. Analysis of microbial and viral metagenomes revealed SUP viruses persisted for years but remained endemic to OM. Identification of virus-encoded dissimulatory sulfite reductase suggested SUP viruses reprogrammed their host's energy metabolism.
Intraflagellar transport (IFT) is a highly conserved mechanism responsible for the assembly and maintenance of cilia/flagella, with over 20 IFT proteins involved. However, the functions of individual IFT proteins are not well understood. This study focused on TTC26/DY13, a putative IFT protein, in mammalian cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches, TTC26/DY13 was identified as an IFT B protein in both species. Knockdown of TTC26/D13 in zebraf embryos and mutation of TTC26/D13 in C reinhardt resulted in short cilia with abnormal motility. Notably, IFT particle assembly speed was normal in dy13 mutant flagella, unlike other IFT B mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analysis revealed a subset of motility-related proteins depleted in dy13 mutant. These findings suggest different IFT proteins transport distinct cargoes, explaining IFT complexity.
Researchers have investigated the role of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) in the process of melanoma metastasis, specifically focusing on the interaction between LEC and melanoma cells in three-dimensional (3D) co-culture. They found that expansively growing human melanoma cells, but not invasive cells, exhibited increased distant metastasis in mice when co-cultured with LEC. To understand the underlying mechanisms, they established co-cultures of LEC with melanoma cells from primary tumors or metastases. Results showed that expansively growing metastatic melanoma cells adopted an invasive sprouting phenotype in 3D matrix, dependent on matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14), Notch, and β-integrin. Unexpectedly, MP14 was necessary for LEC-induced Notch induction and β-integr activation. Moreover, MP and Not were required for L-mediated metastasis zebraf xenograft. This study reveals a mechanism by which LEC promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a switch from 3D growth to invasive sprouting cell phenotype.
MicroRNA-9 plays a crucial role in controlling dendritic development by targeting the transcriptional repressor REST. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are conserved non-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. MicroRNA-9 (miR-9) is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the brain. Although the function of mi-9 has been well characterized in neural progenitors, its role in dendritic and synaptic development remains largely unknown. To target mi-9 in vivo, a transgenic mi sponge mouse line was developed allowing conditional inactivation of the mi-9 family in spatio-temporally. Using this approach, mi-9 was found to control dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, mi- mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST was essential for proper dendritic growth.
Researchers investigated the neural basis of social engagement difficulties in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a large sample of toddlers with ASD and non-ASD comparison groups. They found that individuals with ASD showed reduced functional connectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and visual attention networks. A subset of ASD individuals with pronounced social-visual difficulties (Geo ASD) exhibited marked hypoconnectivity between the DM and occipitaltemporal cortex (OTC). Increased DM-OTC hypoconnectivity was associated with severity of social-communication difficulties in Geo ASD. The study suggests that pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a key neurobiological feature of Geo ASD and may be critical for future social-communic development and treatment targets for early intervention in these individuals.
In Drosophila melanogaster, a species of fruit fly, has a unique hematopoietic system that produces two types of blood cells: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. These cells are produced in the lymph gland and released at pupation, but their numbers increase throughout larval development. Mature plasocytes can proliferate, but it is unclear if crystal cells increase through self-renewal or de novo differentiation. Research has shown that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate from a Notch-dependent plasocyte transdifferentiation process. This process occurs in sessile clusters and relies on the integrity of these structures. The discovery of this hematietic tissue and its reliance on structure-dependent signaling for homeostasis creates a new paradigm for understanding Drosila hematies and vertebrate systems.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between aneuploidy, a condition where cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes, and its effects on gene expression in yeast. Anupidy is linked to various diseases, but it is unclear how cells adapt to its deleterious effects until new phenotypes evolve. Despite laboratory strains being sensitive to aneupidy, the study found it is common in wild yeast isolates, which show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. To understand how cells cope with anup, researchers created diploid panels with two, three, or four copies of affected chromosomes and found that gene dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher constraint in wild populations but show elevated rates of amplification, suggesting copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. Anupidy provides a clear advantage to strain YPS9 by amplifying a gene that escapes compensation. The study presents a model where compensation buffers amplification through anup as a natural, likely, transient route to rapid evolution.
Researchers have identified a novel photoreceptor protein, xenopsin, in the flatworm Marigella crozier, which challenges current understanding of opsin evolution and photoreceptor function. Initially classified as a G-protein-coupled ciliary opsin, xenin has diverged from ciliary opsins in pre-bilateral times, with little known about the cells expressing these proteins or their photopment and phototransduction. Characterization of xenin in Marig crozier reveals its expression in ciliary cells of the larva and extraocular cells around the brain in adult. These extraocular cells contain hundreds of cilia in intra-cellular vacu (phasome). Functional assays in human cells show Marig xenin drives phototransduction primarily coupling to G. This discovery highlights similarities between xenin and c and ops, revealing a novel op-expressing cell type, like jaw vertebrate rods, encloses ciliary within own membrane.
Researchers investigated how spatial and temporal cues are integrated in neural progenitor cells to specify neuronal diversity. Drosophila neuroblasts, individually identifiable with known spatial and temporal factors, were used as a model. The study tested whether spatial/temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts. Targeted DamID was used to identify genomic sites of Hunch factor in neuroblasts NB-5 and NB-7, making different progeny. Hback targets differed in each neuroblast, ruling out independent model. Each neuroblast had distinct chromatin domains, correlated with H-bound loci in each neuro. Gsbax spatial factor, in NB-6 but not NB-4, had sites correlated with chrom in NB-6 but not-4. Data support a model where early spatial factors like G establish neuroblast chromatin, leading to neuro-specific factor binding and neuron production in each lineage.
Researchers have used photo-switchable cross-linkers, or "molecular tweezers," to study the motion of the transmembrane domain of the P2X2 receptor during activation. The P2 receptors open a transmembrane pore in response to extracellular ATP, but the mechanism of pore opening has been controversial. Recent crystal structures of the receptor in apo and ATP-bound states revealed motions of the extracellular domain following agonist binding. The study used tweez to monitor series of inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain during activation. Experimental structural constraints were combined with computational studies to provide high-resolution models of the channel in open and closed states. The results show the outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure. The inner and outer ends of pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. This provides insight into the gating of P2 receptors and a strategy for other membrane proteins.
Cytokinesis, the physical division of a cell into two, is a complex process powered by the constriction of the actomyosin contractile ring. Contrary to the long-held assumption that all animal cells divide by a similar mechanism, evidence suggests that cytokinesis regulation in individual cell types has more variation than previously realized. In the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, each blastomere has a distinct fate specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute treatment, researchers identified cell-type variation in cytokinesis requirement for for forminCY-1-dependent filamentous-actin (F-act) cytoskeleton in one cell (P2). In this cell, cytokinesis is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in another cell (EMS) this variation is cell-exinsically regulated, dependent on Src-1 signaling and direct contact with neighboring cell P. Both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinesis in individual types can protect against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened.
Bacterial flagella play a crucial role in mediating host-microbe interactions through tissue tropism during colonization and immune response activation. The flagellar shaft of some bacteria, including human pathogens, is encased in a membranous sheath of unknown function. Researchers have hypothesized that the sheath may allow bacteria to evade host responses to immunogenic flagellin subunits. However, this structural feature has remained an enigma. A study reveals that rotation of the sheathed flagellum in Vibrio fischer, a mutualist, and Vibrio cholera, a pathogen, promotes release of potent bacteria-derived immunogen lipopolysacchar, found in flagellar sheath. This lipopolyschar triggers host immune response in squid-vibrio symbiosis. The study presents a new role for flagellar sheath in triggering, rather than circumventing, host responses. This has implications for study of bacterial with sheathed flagella and raises biophysical questions of sheathedellum function.
Researchers have investigated the phenomenon of catastrophic chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in plants, a process associated with mitotic errors and cancer, which can lead to deleterious rearrangements but also genetic novelty. They studied Arabidopsis plants expressing different centromere histone H3, resulting in shattered chromosomes from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single lard compartmentalized within micronucle. Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by non-homous end joining (NHE) or stalled repair. Furthermore, mutation of NHE factor Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery. Heritability and stability of rearranged chromosome suggest potential for enduring novelty.
Epstein-Barr Virus Ensures Cell Survival by Modulating Apoptosis at Early and Late After Infection

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a causally linked to several human cancers and expresses viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit the apoptotic response, leading to uncontrolled proliferation. The EB oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates NFκ and is critical for the survival of EB-immortalized B cells. However, during early EB infection, the virus induces rapid cell proliferation with low levels of L1 and apoptosis. This study aimed to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of L/NF early infection.

Using BH3 profiling, the regulation of apoptosis was queried in uninfected cells (B-2), early-infected (M-1/B-2), and immortalized (1-B) cells. A dynamic change in cell survival mechanisms was observed in virus-infected cells, relying on the regulation of M localization and transcription by the EB3 protein. This defines a new role for EB3 in the suppression of apoptosis with implications for EB lymphomagenesis.

EBV infection induces rapid cell proliferation with low levels of LMP1 and apoptosis early after infection. The mechanism of survival in the absence of L/NF was investigated. BH3 profiling was used to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis in uninfected (B-2), early-infected (M-1/B-2), and immortalized (B) cells. A change in cell survival mechanisms was observed in virus-inf cells, relying on regulation of M localization and transcription by EB3. EB3 plays a new role in suppression of apoptosis with implications for lymphagenesis.
Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant species, produces diverse metabolites to adapt to its environment. These metabolites vary between and within species due to environmental challenges and ecological pressures. Research has just begun to understand how new alleles controlling metabolite diversity arise and their geographic distribution. This study analyzed 797 natural Arabidopsis thalian accessions to measure metabolite variation. Results show that geography, environment, demography, and genetics all influence specific metabolite chemotypes and their distribution. Loci in metabolism contain frequent independently generated alleles, suggesting within-species convergence. This study provides insight into selective forces and mechanisms shaping allelic variation for local adaptation.
Apoptotic caspases have traditionally been viewed as tumor suppressors due to their role in programmed cell death, but recent studies suggest they can promote tumor growth under certain conditions. In Drosila, a well-studied neoplastic model, oncogenic mutations in the proto-oncogene RasV12 maintain tumorous cells in an undead-like state and convert caspases from suppressors to promotors. Caspases activate intra- and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), recruiting macrophage-like cells that signal back to tumorous epithelial cells, activating oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK amplifies casp activity, forming a feedback loop. Interfering with this loop reduces neoplastic behavior and improves organism survival.
Researchers investigated the relationship between social interaction duration and oxytocin, a hormone involved in social behavior. They found that people perceive social interactions as shorter than non-social interactions. This effect was stronger in individuals with lower autistic tendencies. Intranasal oxytocin administration restored the effect in less socially proficient individuals, while atosiban, an oxytocin antagonist, diminished it in more proficient individuals. These findings suggest time perception is subjective and influenced by personality traits. Oxytocin mediates social interaction perception, supporting its role in human cognition.
The study investigated the effects of common mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein's receptor binding domain (RBD) and its ligand, the human ACE2 receptor, on their binding affinity and kinetics. The interaction between the RBD and ACE2 is crucial for viral cell infection, and mutations in R are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern that have emerged worldwide. The B.1.1.7 lineage has a mutation N501 in its RBD that enhances binding to ACE2, while ACE2 alleles in humans have mutations in the R binding site. The study analyzed the effects of five RBD mutations (K417N, K417, N501, E484, and S477) and two ACE mutations (S19 and K26) on the R/2 interaction. The effects of individual R mutations and combinations in SARS-CoV Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P) variants were examined. Most mutations increased the affinity of R/2 interaction, with the exception of K417, which decreased it. The study suggests that N501 and S477 mutations enhance transmission by binding, K mutations facilitate immune escape, and E484 enhances both binding and escape.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive map of genetic interactions in a metazoan cells, focusing on the relationships between genes and their effects on phenotypes during development and disease. The study utilized combinatorial RNA interference and single-cell phenotyping to analyze 21 phenotypic features in Drosophila cells. A novel method was devised to combine genetic interactions with phenotypes to reveal directional relationships between genes. This approach reconstructed the sequence of protein activities during mitosis and revealed the interaction between the Ras pathway and the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, which is conserved in human cancer cells. The study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing regulatory networks and provides a resource for interpreting genetic alterations' functional consequences. Gene-gene interactions shape complex phenotypes and modify the effects of mutations during development and disease. The effects of gene-gene interactions on phenotypes have been used to assign genes to functional modules. However, directional epist interactions, which reflect regulatory relationships between genes, have been challenging to map at large scale.
Researchers have investigated the genetic basis of heterosty, a widespread floral adaptation that promotes outbreeding, in Primula primroses. Heterosty is controlled by the Slocus supergene, which determines the reciprocal incompatibility between two morphs, but the identities of the component genes were unknown. The study identified the CYP50 gene, encoding a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, as the locus that determines style dimorphism. CYP50 is present on the short-styled morph haplotype, specifically expressed in short styles, and its loss leads to long styles. The gene arose in the Primulaceae lineage and shows accelerated molecular evolution. The results provide a mechanistic explanation for Prim style dimorphism and shed light on the Sloc as a model for complex supergene.
Researchers have investigated the role of kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (KissAR) in regulating puberty and fertility. These neurons co-express kiss1, neurokinin B (NKB), dynorphin, and glutamate, and are thought to provide an episodic excitatory drive to gonadotrop-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Using optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, pharmacology, and single-cell RT-PCR in mice, they found that high-frequency stimulation of kissAR neurons evoked the release of excitatory NKB and inhibitory dynorph neuropeptides, synchronizing kissAR neuronal activity. This synchronized activity robustly excited GRH neurons through a mechanism involving glutamaterg input to preoptic kiss neurons from kissAR.
Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency and favoring mesodermal over neural fates during differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which BMP controls differentiation are not well understood. Researchers have found that BMP regulates differentiation by downregulating Cdh1, an event that accompanies earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. Loss of Cdh is a requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells, and suppression of Cdh activity rescues BMP-imposed block to differentiation. BMP acts prior and independently of Cdh to prime plurip cells for mesod differentiation, thus reinforcing block to neural. Differentiation depends not only on exposure to extrinsic cues but also morphetic events control receptivity to those cues. A key pluripot signal, BMP, feeds into this mechanism.
Researchers have identified a protein called C120 that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of centrioles, the components of the centrosome, in quiescent cells. Centrioles are inherently asymmetric, differing in morphology and function, and their properties are established and maintained during quiescence. Depletion of C120 in mouse and human cells leads to accumulation of pericentri material, including pericentr, C5ap2, ninein, and C170. This accumulation results in increased microtubule-nucleation at the centome. Loss of C120 causes aberrant dyin-dependent trafficking of centomal proteins, dispersal ofri satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. The study suggests C120 maintains centome homeostasis by inhibiting untimature of the centriole.
In the developing retina, neuron-glia interactions play a crucial role in the maturation of neural circuits. However, the pathways mediating their communication in the central nervous system (CNS) are not well understood. This study investigated neuron-glia signaling in the developing retina, revealing that retinal waves induce calcium transients in Müller glial cells (MCs). During cholinergic waves, MC transients were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine antagonists, whereas glutamateric waves MC transients were inhibited by ionotropic glutamate antagonists, indicating MC responsiveness changes match neurotransmitter used retinal waves. An optical glutamate sensor showed decline MC transients caused reduction glutamate reaching MC. These findings indicate neurons and MC exhibit correlated activity during retinal maturation enabled neurotransmitter spillo retinal synapses.
Establishing the postmortem interval (PM) is a critical in death investigations, yet current methods are prone to errors and biases. Forensic entomology, a widely used technique for estimating PM, can be off by days or months. Microorganisms may offer an alternative for estimating PM, circumventing these limitations. This study demonstrates that postmortem microbial changes are significant, measurable, and reproducible in a mouse model, allowing PM to be estimated within 3-48 hours. 

A mouse model was used to investigate postmort microbial changes. Mice were euthanized and left at room temperature for 0-48 hours. Samples were collected at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours. Microbial communities were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results showed significant changes in microbial composition and diversity over time. Bacterial communities shifted from aerobic to anaerobic at 24 hours. Fungal communities increased at 24, then decreased at 48. Eukaryotic communities increased at 24, then decreased at 48. 

Microbial data were used to estimate PM. A machine learning model was trained on microbial data from 0-24 hours, then tested on 24-48. Results showed accurate estimation of PM within 3 hours. This suggests microbial data can be developed into a tool for estimating PM. The study provides a detailed understanding of bacterial and eukotic ecology within a decomposing system.
Despite the vast diversity of body forms in bilaterian animals, they share a common set of developmental genes with conserved expression patterns in the embryo, including the Hox genes, which define identities along the anterior-posterior axis. Hox proteins exert their function by interacting with TALE transcription factors. H and TALE members are present in some but not all non-bilater phyla, raising the question of how Hox- TALE evolved to provide positional information. Using proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages, it was shown that these networks emerged from an ancestral motif present in Hox and other protein families. Hox-TALE networks experienced additional and molecular innovations that were crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. Our results highlight how homeobox families evolved during eukaryote to constitute a patterning system.
Researchers used super-resolution microscopy to study the behavior of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) at synapses, specifically focusing on their diffusion and trafficking outside and within post-synaptic densities (PSDs) in rats. The study employed fluorescent probes of varying sizes, including organic dyes (≈4nm), small quantum dots (≈10nm; sQDs), and big (≈20; bDs), coupled to AMPs via different linkers. The results showed that more than 90% of AMPs labeled with dyes or sDs diffused in confined nanodomains within PSDs, which were stable for 15 minutes or longer. In contrast, less than 10% of sD-AMPs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile, whereas 5-10% of bDAMPs were in PSD and 90-95 extrasynaptic. The findings contradict the hypothesis that AMP entry into PSD is limited by occupancy of open slots, suggesting that AMPs rapidly enter stable nanodomains in PSD with lifetimes 15 and do not accumulate extrasyn membranes.
Researchers have identified a key mechanism by which neurons respond to hypoxia, an increase in voltage-gated sodium current (IN) in neurons. The study focused on rat cerebellar granule neurons (CG) and found that hypox activates the Smallubiquitin Modifier (SUM) pathway, leading to SUMylation of Na1.2 channels, increasing IN. The time-course of SUMylation of Na.2 channels at the surface and IN coincide, and are prevented by mutation of Na.2-Lys or application of deSUMylating enzyme. Within 40 seconds, hypox-induced linkage of SUM1 to channels is complete, shifting the voltage dependence of activation so that depolarizing steps evoke larger sodium currents. The study suggests that the SUM pathway and Na.2 are potential targets for neuroprotective interventions given the role of IN in hypoxic brain damage.
Researchers have developed a mechanistic model to study the thermal response of Ross River virus, a mosquito-borne pathogen found in Australia, Pacific Islands, and potentially emerging worldwide. The model predicts that Ross virus transmission peaks at moderate temperatures of 26.4°C and declines to zero at thermal limits of 17.0 and 31.5°C. This indicates that Ross virus transmission is year-round in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in a seasonal peak in human cases. Climate change is expected to increase transmission in temperate areas, where most Australians live, but decrease in tropical areas where temperatures are near the optimum.
Researchers investigated the relationship between beta oscillations in the motor cortex and movement onset in macaques performing a novel neurofeedback task. They recorded neural activity from the motor cortex while the animals brought their beta power to an instructed state and then executed arm reaches. Results showed that reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power had faster onset times than those preceded by an increase in power. Additionally, neural activity shifted farther from a movement state during beta oscillations induced by neurofeedback or naturally occurring during reaching. These findings establish a neural basis for slowed onset periods following beta activity.
TRAF2, a component of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily signaling complex, plays a crucial role in regulating immune cell homeostasis. Mice deficient in TR2 die at birth, limiting understanding of its role in adult tissues. The function of the TR2 RING domain is controversial, with some studies suggesting it cannot act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, while others propose it requires sphingosine-1-phosphate, generated by sphingosine kinase 1 (Sk1), to function as such. Keratinocyte-specific deletion of TR2, but not Sk1 deficiency, disrupts TNF-mediated NF-κ and MAPK signaling, leading to epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation. This inflammation is driven by TNF, non-canonical NFκ, and adaptive immune responses, potentially modeling psoriasis. TR2 has tissue-specific functions distinct from Sk.
Synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis elicited by potent stimulation is rapidly compensated by endocytosis of SV membranes leading to the formation of large endytic vacuoles, termed 'bulk endosomes'. These vacuoles disappear as new SVs reappear. In synapses of dynamin 1 and 3 double-knockout mice, clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is impaired. Bulk endosome formation is not defective, but rather enhanced in the absence of dynamin 1 and 3. The conversion of bulkosomes to SV is not accompanied by clathrin-coated buds on their surface and this process proceeds after clath knockdown, suggesting independence from clath. These findings support the existence of a pathway for SV reformation that bypasses the requirement for clath and dynamin 3 and operates during intense synaptic activity.
A randomized, single-blind crossover study was conducted to identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucocortic action. Ten patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and no other endocrinopathies were admitted to an in-patient clinic and studied during physiological glucortic exposure and withdrawal. A randomization occurred before the first intervention. No serious adverse events were observed besides mild physical and mental fatigue and salt craving. Transcript in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, plasma miRNA, and serum metabolomics were compared between interventions using multiomic analysis. A transcriptomic profile from tissues and multiomic cluster was predictive of glucortic exposure. MicroRNA miR-122-5 correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucortic exposure was identified (p=0.009) and replicated in independent studies with varying glucortic exposure (0.01≤p≤0.05). A basis for biomarker discovery to measure glucortic effects was generated, allowing individualization and optimization of glucortic therapy and insight into disease etiology of unphysiological glucortic exposure, such as cardiovascular disease and obesity.
Amino acids activate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) through a complex containing Rag GTPases, Ragulator, and vacuolar ATPase. The sensing of amino acids triggers the translocation of mTOR1 to lysosomes, an obligatory step for activation. To investigate the spatial and temporal dynamics of this translocation, researchers used live imaging of the mTOR component Raptor and a cell-permeable fluorescent analogue leucine methyl ester. Translocation to lysosomes is a transient event, occurring within 2 minutes of amino acid addition and peaking at 5 minutes. It is temporally coupled with leucine appearance in lysosomes and sustained compared to stimulation. Sestrin and vacuolar ATP are negative regulators of mTOR activity in this system. Phosphorylation of canonical mTOR targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation suggesting dynamic passage mTOR from lysosomal surface targeting substrates elsewhere.
Researchers have discovered that modifying a protein antigen, Ovalbumin (OVA), with a specific glycan structure, Lewis X (Le), alters its intracellular routing in dendritic cells, leading to the priming of T cells. Dendritic cells regulate antigen uptake and intracellular routing of antigens through C-type lectin receptors that recognize glycan structures. Modification of OVA with Le directs it to the C lectin receptor M1 (M1). This modification favors Th1 skewing of CD4+ T cells and enhances cross-priming of CD8 T cells. Cross-presentation of native O requires high antigen and TLR stimuli, whereas Le modification reduces the required amount 100-fold and eliminates its dependence on TLR signaling. The OLe-induced enhancement of T cross-priming is M1-dependent, as shown by reduced CD8 effector T frequencies in M1-deficient mice. Moreover, M1-mediated cross-presentation of OLe neither requires TAP transporters nor Cathepsin and is observed after prolonged intracellular storage in Rab11+AMP+ compartments. The study suggests that controlled glycosylation of antigens significantly influences intracellular routing of antigens and the strength of immune responses, and should be considered for optimizing vaccination strategies.
Burkholderia thailandensis, a bacterium, utilizes acyl-homine lactone-mediated quorum sensing to regulate hundreds of genes, including those involved in cell-cell contact-dependent type VI secretion (T6) systems. Research has shown that T6 systems are activated by quorum sensing in B. thailandensis. The study found that T6 is required to constrain the proliferation of quorum sensing mutants in cocultures of a B. thailand quorum sensing receptor mutant (BR) and its parent. However, the BR mutant outcompetes its parent in broth culture due to lack of cell contact and metabolic cost associated with quorum gene activation. The fitness of wild type over BR during agar growth depends on intact TSS1 apparatus. Quorum sensing activates B thailand TSS1 inhibition, constraining quorum mutants. This work defines a novel role for TSS in intraspecies control.
Researchers investigated the role of glutamatergic drive along the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus in the emergence of prefrontal oscillations in neonatal mice. They found that the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with the intermediate/ventral hippocampus through phase-locking of neuronal firing via direct axonal projections, despite stronger theta and ripple power in the dorsal hippocampus. Optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic neurons in the CA1 area of the dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus in neonatal revealed that theta-band activation of pyramidal neurons in the intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1, transfected with high-efficiency channelrhopsin, boosts prefront oscillations. These findings causally elucidate the cellular origin of long-range coupling in the developing brain.
Post-translational modification of RNA polymerase II (RNAPI) plays a crucial role in coordinating co-transcriptional recruitment of enzymatic complexes that regulate chromatin states and processing of nascent RNA. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RNAPI subunit, composed of heptapeptide repeats with consensus sequence Y-S-P-T-S-P-S-S, undergoes extensive phosphorylation of serine residues. Ser-5 and Ser-7 phosphorylation mark transcription initiation, while Ser-2 phosphorylation is associated with elongation. In vertebrates, the CTD has non-canonical substitution of Ser-7 to Lys-7, which can be acetylated (Kac). This study describes mono- and di-methylation of Cys-7 residues (Kme1 and K2). K1 and K2 are observed during earliest transcription stages, preceding or accompanying Ser-5 and Ser-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, Kac is associated with RNAPI elongation Ser-2 phosphorylation and mRNA expression. A balance between RNAPI K methylation and acetylation at promoters fine-tunes gene expression.
Skeletal muscle satellite cells play a crucial role in muscle repair and regeneration by exiting quiescence, proliferating, and self-renewing to replenish the satellite cell population. To understand the mechanisms maintaining satellite quiescence, researchers identified transcripts differentially expressed during satellite activation following injury. Transcripts encoding RNA-binding proteins were significantly changed, including the mRNA decay factor Tristrapin. Tristrapin promotes the decay of MyD mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment, via binding to the MyD 3 untranslated region. Upon satellite activation, p38/β MAPK phosphorylates MAPK2 and inactivates Tristin, stabilizing MyD mRNA. Satellite-specific knockdown of Tristin precociously activates cells in vivo, enabling My accumulation and differentiation into myofibers. Regulation of mRNAs by Trin appears as one critical post-transcriptional mechanism controlling satellite homeostasis.
Infants with defects in the interleukin 10 (IL-10) receptor develop very early onset inflammatory bowel disease. Researchers investigated whether IL-10 regulates lamina propria macrophage function during infant development in mice and whether macroage-intrinsic IL-10 signaling is required to prevent colitis in infancy. IL-10 deficient mice showed no signs of colitis in the first two weeks of life, but developed intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction in the third week of life, concurrent with weaning and diversification of intestinal microbiota. IL-10 did not directly regulate microbial ecology during infant development. Macrophage depletion with clodron inhibited colitis development, while absence of IL-10 on macrophages sensitized mice to colitis. These results indicate IL-10 mediated macroage regulation during postnatal period is indispensable for preventing murine colitis.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, piRNAs play a crucial role in regulating transposons and germline genes. The mutator complex is responsible for synthesizing high levels of siRNAs through the activity of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, but the steps between mRNA recognition by the pi pathway and siRNA amplification by the mut complex are unknown. This study identifies Tudor domain protein SIM-1 (SIM-1) as acting downstream of pi production and upstream of mutator-dependent siRNA biogenesis. SIM-1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, two separate condensates that are sites of pi-dependent mRNA recognition and mut-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. This suggests a role for perinuclear condens in organizing the pi pathway and promoting regulation by the mut complex.
Researchers have investigated the excitability of Purkin neurons in unanesthetized larval zebraf (Danio rerio) using intracellular recordings. Purkin neurons are central to cerebellar function and exhibit bistability when recorded in vitro or in vivo under anesthesia, but the existence of bistability in vivo in awake animals is disputed. This study demonstrates bistability in Purkin neurons in vivo. Tonic firing was observed at depolarized membrane potentials and bursting at hyperpolarized potentials. Purkin neurons can switch between states spontaneously or with current injection. GABA or NMDA receptors are not required for bursting, but AMPA receptor activation by climbing fibers (CFs) triggers bursts. Intracellular Purkin membrane and extracellular motor neuron recordings show motor spiking initiation correlates with increased EPs and depolarization. Bistability is observed after Purkin specification and persists until late larval stages.
Researchers have investigated the principles of self-organization and adaptation of the actin cytoskeleton during clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a process by which cells internalize membrane-bound vesicles. They found that the assembly of actin filaments generates force that shapes the membrane, and a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endytic pits against membrane tension. Approximately 200 Arp2/3 complexes are required for robust internalization. A novel counting method determined that around 200 Arp2/3 complexes assemble at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. Simulations predict that actin self-organizes into a radial array with ends oriented toward the base of the pit. Actin filaments bend between the coat and the base of the pit, storing elastic energy confirmed by cryo-electron tomography. This energy contributes to endocytic internalization. Elevated membrane tension directs filaments toward the base, increasing nucleation and bending for force production. Spatially constrained actin assembly enables endocyt under varying physical constraints.
Macrophagyocytosis is a cellular process by which cells internalize extracellular liquids into vesicles. It relies on the formation of a protrusive actin ring beneath the plasma membrane, which develops into the macropocytic cup. Research on Dictyostelium discoideum reveals that macropocytic cups are organized around patches of intense PIP3, active Ras, and active Rac signaling molecules. These patches are associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery, similar to structures found in phagocytic cups and basal waves. The formation of these patches does not depend on the F-actin ring, and are enlarged when RasGAP1 is mutated, indicating Ras plays an instructive role. Macropocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones. The study proposes that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery.
Cohesin is a protein complex that holds together newly replicated sister chromatids until their separation at anaphase initiation. Sister chromatid cohesion is dependent on the complex SccNIP/SccM2 (S2/4), which loads cohesin onto DNA and determines its localization across the genome. Proper cohes loading is essential for cell division, and defects cause chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcription, leading to developmental defects in multicellular organisms. A crystal structure of the interaction between S2 and S4 shows S4 is a TPR array that envelops an S2 peptide. Using yeast, a conserved surface on S4 is required to recruit S2/4 to centromere and pericentere to build cohesion.
A study investigated the effects of birth timing on growth, fattening, winter survival, and fecundity in hibernating garden dormice (Eliomys quercinus). The research compared early-born (EB) and late-born (LB) juvenile dormice, focusing on growth, fattening, energetic responses, winter survival, and fecundity. 

Results showed that LB juveniles grew and gained mass twice as fast as EB individuals during the first weeks of growth. Torpor use was low during growth, but increased during pre-hibernation fattening. LB showed higher tor use, reached similar body sizes but lower fat content than EB before hibernation. Hibernation patterns were similar, but LB had higher proportion breeders the following year. These results suggest tor is incompatible with growth but promotes fattening and consolidates preibern fat deposits. In dormice born late season associated fast life history.
In a study on the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, researchers investigated the role of ADAR (adenosine deaminase) enzymes in regulating gene expression through adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing and binding to regulatory elements in RNA. Loss of ADAR function has been linked to neuronal dysfunction in all studied animals, including C. elegans, which exhibits reduced chemotaxis, or the ability to move towards or away from a stimulus, in the absence of ADs. To identify critical AD targets in C. elegans, the researchers analyzed the effects of ADR-2, the sole A-to-I editing enzyme in C. elegans, on the neural transcriptome. Using the software SAIL, they identified 736 A-to-I events across the neural transcriptome. Intersecting the neuralome with ADR-2 associated gene changes revealed edited cle-41 mRNA, whose expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring cle-41 in ADR deficient cells rescued chemaxis, providing evidence that phenotypes of AD mutants can be caused by altered expression.
Influenza A virus (IAV) employs a host shutoff strategy to repress cellular mRNA translation while allowing efficient translation of viral mRNAs. Researchers used RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate IAV-induced host shutoff mechanisms. Results show that viral mRNAs are preferentially translated, while cellular protein synthesis declines due to viral takeover of the mRNA pool. Cellular transcript levels vary in reduction, with short transcripts less affected by IAV. mRNAs refractory to IAV are enriched in maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Continuous oxidative phosphorylation is crucial for viral propagation.
In a study on the regulation of tissue morphogenesis, researchers investigated the distribution of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and its receptor (FGFR) in the Drosophila larval wing imaginal disc. Using fluorescently tagged proteins expressed at physiological levels from genomic knock-in alleles, they found that FGF is transported from the anterior spiracle (ASP) to the wing disc via FG-containing cytonemes that extend from the ASP to contact the disc. The number of FG-receiving cyton extended by ASP cells decreases with increasing distance from the source, generating a tissue-specific F gradient. As a morphogen, F activates concentration-dependent gene expression of pointed (pt) at higher and cut (cut) at lower levels. Transcription factors pointed and cut differentially regulate formation of FG-containing cyton, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FG-receiving cyton.
Researchers have extensively studied the α-helical coiled protein structure, which can be precisely described using parametric equations, allowing for detailed manipulation. Despite its well-understood nature, a novel α/β coiled structure has been discovered through the insertion of two or six residues into the heptad repeat of a parallel trimeric α-helical coiled. This insertion strains the superhelix, causing local β-strand formation and a 120° rotation around the trimer axis. The resulting α/β coiled retains one backbone hydrogen bond per unit from the parent α-helical structure. The study demonstrates a novel backbone structure within Ramachand space with minor mutations to the known fold.
Eps, an evolutionarily conserved endocytic clrin adaptor, plays a critical role in clath coat dynamics. To investigate its function, researchers generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional eps triple KO mice. Triple KO cells exhibited cell division defects and impaired clath-mediated endocytosis, characterized by accumulation of early, U-shaped pits. This defect correlated with disruption of coupling between clath coat and actin cytoskeleton, confirmed in cell-free endocytosis assay. Eps interaction with SNAREs generates force leading to invagination and fission of clrin-coated pits.
A case-control study was conducted in Uganda to investigate the risk factors associated with asthma among children aged 5-17 years. The study included 555 cases and 111 controls, with asthma diagnosis confirmed by clinicians. Results showed that higher education levels of fathers (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.71-3.16) and mothers (OR 1.85, 1.38-2.48) were associated with increased risk of asthma. Children born in small towns (OR 2.16,1.60-2.92) and cities (2.79,1.79-4.35) had higher risk compared to those born in rural areas. Father's and mother's history of asthma, child's allergies, atopy, and cooking with gas/electricity were also linked to asthma.
In the formation of the striped pattern in adult zebraf (Danio rerio) involves interactions between three types of pigment cells: melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these interactions are not well understood. Mutations in the leopard (leo) gene, which encodes connexin 41.8 (Cx.8), a gap junction subunit, result in a series of spotted phenotypes. A new allele, leot3, leads to a complete loss of pattern, indicating a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. A genetic screen identified this component as connexin 39.4 (Cx.4). Loss-of-function alleles demonstrate that Cx.4 is required for stripe formation in zebraf, but fins are not affected. Double mutants and chimeras show that leo and Cx4 are required in melanoph and xanthores but not iridoph, suggesting both connins form heteromeric gap junctions. The phenotypes indicate these promote homotypic interactions between melanoph and xanthores, and instruct patterning of iridoph.
The evolution of olfactory receptors in insects is a complex and diverse process, with various gene families involved in the detection of behaviorally relevant odor molecules across different phyla. Insects utilize olfactory receptors (OR), ionotropic receptors (IR), and gustatory receptors (GR) to detect volatile molecules. While IRs are expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia, ORs are hypothesized to be an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle. This study investigated the olfactory system of three insects: the wingless bristail Lepachilis signata (Archaeognatha), the firebrat Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma), and the neopter leaf Phyllium siccium (phasoda). Results show that Lepachilis lacks OR and olfactory coreceptor (Or), Thermobia has three Orco candidates, and Phium has a fully developed OR/Or-based system. This suggests that ORs did not arise as an adaptation to terrestrial lifestyle, but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco present before ORs.
Malaria burden has decreased globally over the past decade, with many countries striving for elimination. However, asymptomatic infections often go undiagnosed and untreated, hindering efforts. Mass drug administration (MDA) has been proposed as a solution, contingent on adequate population participation. This study presents a spatial and temporal analysis of malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections in four villages undergoing MDA in Myanmar. Individuals from neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had 2.85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-M compared to those from high adherence neighborhoods, regardless of individual participation, indicating a herd effect. High mosquito rates, living in a house with someone with malaria, or asymptomatic infection were predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to M, even in villages high participation, may frustrate elimination.
Researchers investigated the conservation of transcription factor (TF) binding specificities across 600 million years of bilateria evolution by comparing the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs to human and mouse TFs. They found that TF specificities are highly conserved between Drosila and mammals, with orthologous TFs showing similarity in subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. This suggests that TF binding specificities play a crucial role in the emergence of novel cell types. The study highlights the importance of TF binding specificity in the evolution of divergent morphology.
Researchers have developed a novel method to simultaneously direct the differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) into both cardiac and lung epithelial lineages. This is achieved through the temporal tuning of WNT and Nodal signaling pathways in the absence of exogenous growth factors. In a 3D culture, concentric cardiopulmonary microtissues (μTs) are formed, which undergo alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompaniment. Upon withdrawal of WNT agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary components within dual-line μTs segregate from each other with initiation of cardiac contraction. This multilineage model is expected to provide an experimentally tractable system for investigating cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue formation during embryogenesis.
In a study on Escherichia coli, researchers have discovered an unexpected flexibility in the regulation of mutation rates in response to environmental stress. Contrary to the traditional view that mutation rates are a slowly evolving and strictly regulated parameter, the study shows that mutation rates can rapidly change in response to selective pressure. When Escheria coli cultures are exposed to high levels of ethanol, they undergo hypermutation, a state characterized by increased mutation rates. However, this state is transitory and is followed by a decrease in mutation rate once the cells adapt to the stress. The researchers found that mortality is the driving force behind the quick evolution of mutation rates, with rates rising when cells experience stress and declining once they are adapted.

 The study highlights the balance between robustness and evolvability in organisms, explaining the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings. This includes the emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapse upon chemotherapy. The findings suggest that organisms can adapt to changing environments through rapid changes in mutation rates, previously thought to be a fixed parameter.
Metabolic adjustments to changing environmental conditions, particularly growth and defense responses, are crucial for organisms to survive. The conserved AMPK/Sn1/Sn1 kinases are well-known metabolic regulators in the low-energy response in animals and plants. They act at two levels: modulating the activity of key enzymes and transcriptional reprogramming. In this study, the Arabidopsis transcription factor bZIP63 was identified as a regulator of starvation and direct target of the Sn1 kinase. Phosphorylation of b63 by Sn1 changed its dimer preference, affecting gene expression and primary metabolism. A b63 knock-out exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, complemented by wild b63, but not by version harboring mutations in identified Sn1 sites.
Researchers have identified a novel protein called Ring finger 10 (RNF10) that acts as a synaptonuclear messenger in the hippocampus, enabling bidirectional communication between synapses. NF10 is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment, leading to transcriptional changes. It is enriched at excitatory synapses, where it associates with the Glu2 subunit of NMDA receptors (NMDARs). Activation of Glu2-containing NMDARs and long-term potentiation (LTP) results in NF translocation from dendritic segments and dendrites to the nucleus. Importantly, evidence shows import-dependent long-distance transport from syn-to-dendritic compartments to nucleus. NF silencing prevents LTP and L-dependent modifications of dendritic spines.
The study presents the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TATA-binding protein (TBP) and transcription regulator cofactor 2 (NC2), providing insight into the mechanisms of Swi/Snf ATPases. Mot1, a single-subunit remodeler, dissociates TBP:DNA:NC complexes. The structure reveals that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC interactions and unbends DNA compared to TBP:DNA:NC, suggesting Mot primes TBP:NC displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data show the Sw/Snf domain of Mot associates with upstream DNA and histone of NC, similar to nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a framework for Sw/Snf ATP interaction with DNA:protein complex.
Researchers have developed synthetic variants of a natural compound called ternatin, which has been shown to be cytotoxic to cancer cells. The new variants are up to 500 times more potent than the original compound. To understand how ternatin works, a photo-affinity probe was used to identify the elongation factor-1 ternary complex (EF1·G·aminoacy-tRNA) as a specific target. This complex is involved in translation, a process of making proteins. Other natural products, demedin and cyrien, also bind to this complex. Mutations in a part of EF1 prevent tern binding and make cells resistant to tern's effects, suggesting a hydrophobic surface is important for EF modulation. The study suggests that elongation factor-1 and its complex with G and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for cytotoxic natural products.
Mutations in the OCRL gene, which encodes inositol 5-phosphatase, cause Lowe syndrome and Dent disease. OCRL, a direct clathrin interactor, is recruited to late-stage clath-coated pits, but clinical manifestations have primarily been attributed to intracellular sorting defects. This study reveals that OCRL loss in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts impacts clath-mediated endocytosis, resulting in an endytic defect. Cells exhibit accumulation of clath-coated vesicles and increase in U-shaped cl-coated pits, resulting from sequestration of coat components on-coated vesicles. Endytic vesicles fail to lose their coat, retaining numerous actin comets in patient cells. SN9, an adaptor that late-stage endytic coated to actin polymer, binds OCRL and remains with vesicles. These findings indicate OCRL acts as uncoating factor, and defects inath-mediated endyt likely contribute to pathology in patients with OC mutations.
Aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-caten signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development of colorectal cancer, but identifying effective inhibitors for its use in cancer treatment remains a significant challenge. A novel insights into the regulation of this pathway could reveal new therapeutic points of intervention, greatly needed. This study reports a novel FAK/PYK/GSK3β216/β-caten axis: F and PYK2, elevated in adenomas in APC/+ mice and human colorectal tissues, function redundantly promote the W/βaten pathway by phosphorylating G3β to reinforce β-caten accumulation and tumorigenesis. W-induced βaten accumulation requires W-induced G3/Tr interaction; this study revealed phosphorylation Gβ a determinant G recruitment of Tr. Pharmacological inhibition F/P suppressed adenoma formation APC/+ mice with reduced levels phosphoGβ and βaten, indicating F/G axis critical the activation Waten in driven tumenesis.
Researchers investigated the neural control of transitions between posture and movement, focusing on the regulation of vestibular stabilizing mechanisms that enable motion. Optimal control theory suggests that transitions require disengagement of one motor policy before implementation of another. To test this, the continuity of vestibular control during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between postures was examined. Healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion by shifting weight distribution between feet while exposed to vestibular stimuli (EV). The relationship between EV and ground forces was quantified using time-frequency analysis. Discontinuities corresponding to coherence periods were observed preceding movement onset and during locomotion termination. These results indicate vestibular balance mechanisms transition between motor states, suggesting discrete change in motor control as predicted by optimal theory.
In cyanobacteria, the transcription factor Rpa plays a crucial role in regulating circadian rhythms by driving genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance. Deletion of rpa has no effect on viability in constant light conditions, but renders cells inviable in conditions with alternating light and dark periods. Investigation into the underlying viability defect revealed that the rpa strain cannot maintain energy status at night, fails to accumulate carbon reserves during day, and is defective in transcription of genes for carbohydrate utilization at night. Reconstruction of carbon pathways with external carbon source restores energy and viability of rpa in light/dark conditions. The study highlights the circadian pathway's role in temporally coordinating carbon metabolism to maximize fitness under periodic energy limitations.
Transition metal ions, such as zinc, are essential micronutrients for organisms but toxic in excessive amounts. Heavy metal-transporting P-type (P) ATPases play a crucial role in homeostasis, conferring detoxification and redistribution of these ions across cellular membranes. The P-4-ATP subclass, with the broadest cargo scope, lacks structural information and topology. This study presents structures and functional analyses of archetypal P-4-ATPase, CoT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS-1, revealing its architecture devoid of classical heavy-metal binding domains (HMDs) and providing new insights into heavy-metal transport mechanisms. Novel P-AT features include dual heavy-metal release and internal ion counter histidine. Turnover of P-AT is independent of potassium, contrasting other P-type ATPases. Combined with inhibitory compounds, results open avenues for drug discovery as P-AT function in pathogens.
Researchers have identified a chromatin signature that distinguishes genes with mitotically stable allelic expression (MA) in human cells with high accuracy. This signature is characterized by the simultaneous presence of chromatin marks associated with active (H3K36me) and silencing (3me3) in the gene body. Approximately 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types exhibit this signature. Notably, it is enriched among developmental genes with bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. This discovery opens a new approach to study MA independent of polymorphisms and suggests MA is linked to cell differentiation.
Ring-shaped AAA+ chaper proteins, such as Clp, play a crucial role in protein degradation by threading substrates through a central pore using ATP energy. However, this activity can be detrimental if not tightly regulated. The Clp and Clp form a protease essential for bacterial virulence and stress resistance. The adaptor MecA activates Clp by targeting substrates and stimulating Clp ATPase activity. Researchers have determined the structure of Clp in its repressed state with and without MecA, showing it forms a two-helical assemblies via head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil domains (MD). Mec converts this state to an active ring structure by binding to MD sites. Loss of Clp repression in MD mutants leads to constitutive activation and cellular toxicity.
Researchers have investigated the behavior of adult muscle precursors (AMPs) in Drosophila, a type of fruit fly, to understand how stem cells maintain their undifferentiated state and are reactivated. In this study, AMPs were found to extend filopodia, thin extensions of the cell membrane, to make contact with neighboring muscles. These filopodia remained associated with muscles even when AMPs were dormant, suggesting a potential role for muscles in reactivation. Genetic analysis revealed that muscles secrete Dll6, a protein that activates the insulin pathway in nearby AMPs, leading to Notch activation, which regulates AMP proliferation via Myc. This insulin-Notch-Myc cascade is crucial for AMP reactivation.
Spontaneously active GABAergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SN), a major output of the basal ganglia, play a crucial role in providing tonic inhibition to downstream brain areas. The depolarizing leak current supports this firing pattern, but its molecular basis is poorly understood. To understand how SN neurons maintain activity, single-cell RNA sequencing was used to determine the transcriptome of individual SN neurons. The study found that SN express the sodium channel NAL, and SN lacking NAL have impaired firing. NAL is involved in modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Disruption of NAL may impair basal gang circuit, underlying severe motor deficits in humans with NAL mutations.
Highly Parallelized Droplet Cultivation and Prioritization of Antibiotic Producers from Microbial Communities

Antibiotics derived from culturable microorganisms have saved millions of lives since the 20th century. However, with the emergence of resistance, these compounds have become increasingly ineffective, while the majority of microbial diversity with these compounds remains inaccessible for cultivation and exploration. Conventional culturing recalcant bacteria is a stochastic process, limited by low throughput. By increasing (i) throughput and (ii) sensitivity through miniaturization, we innovate microbiological cultivation to comply with biological stochasticity.

A droplet-based microscale system is introduced, coupled with high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity prior isolation. Parallelized droplet cultivation from single cells results in the cultivation of uncultured species and significantly higher bacterial diversity than standard plate cultivation. Strains inhibiting reporter strains were isolated from the system. A variety of antimicrobial compounds were detected from a potent producer.

The droplet-based system consists of a microfluidic device with 96-well plate format. Each well is filled with 1-10 nl droplets, containing 1-10 cells. The droplets are cultured for 24-48 hours, then screened for antimicrobial activity against reporter strains. Positive droplets are isolated and expanded for further analysis. This process is repeated for 1000s of droplets, resulting in 1000s of isolates.

Results show that parallelized droplet cultivation from single cells yields uncultured species and higher bacterial diversity than standard plate cultivation. Strains inhibiting reporter strains were isolated from the system. A variety of antimicrobial compounds were detected from a potent producer.
Researchers conducted a Bayesian analysis to investigate the association between the leukotriene A hydrolase (L4) genotype and survival in tuberculous meningitis patients. Tuberculous meningitis is a severe form of tuberculosis that is characterized by excessive inflammation, leading to high mortality. Adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids have been shown to reduce mortality by 30%, indicating that inflammatory pathophysiology only contributes to a subset of deaths. In Vietnam, a study found that the benefit of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids was most pronounced in patients with the C/T variant of the L4 gene, which encodes an enzyme regulating inflammatory eicosoids. Patients with the L4 TT genotype had increased survival, consistent with corticoids benefiting individuals with hyper-inflammatory responses. However, a study in Indonesia did not find an L4 genotype survival benefit. Using Bayesian methods to analyze both studies, found that L4 genotype confers survival that begins early and continues long-term in both populations. This benefit is nullified in most cases with high mortality. L4 genotyping with disease assessment may target corticoid therapy to patients likely benefit.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism by which axonal growth cones navigate and decide their migratory direction in response to guidance cues. They found that knockout mice lacking the protein Shoot1 display abnormal projection of forebrain commissural axons, similar to the phenotype of the axon guidance molecule Netrin-1. Netrin gradients elicit highly polarized Pak-mediated phosphorylation of Shoot1 within growth cones. The study demonstrates that Netrin-elicited Shoot1 phosphorylation increases Shoot1 interaction with the cell adhesion molecule L-CAM, which in turn promotes F-act-adhesion and concurrent generation of forces for growth cone migration. Spatially regulated Shoot1 phosphorylation within cones is required for axon turning by Netrin gradients.
Researchers investigated the acoustic properties of the humming sound produced by hummingbirds in flight, specifically the Anna's hummingbird, using a 3D near-field acoustic holography with a 216 microphone array and direct measurement of 3D aerodynamic forces with a new aerodynamic platform. The study aimed to understand the biophysical origin of the humming sound, which is not fully understood. The results show that the timbre of the hummingbird's hum arises from oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. An idealized acoustic model integrating aerodynamic forces and wing kinematics was developed to corroborate the measurements. The study compared birds and insects, finding that the characteristic timbre and radiated power of flapping wings originates from higher harmonics in aerodynamic forces supporting body weight. The analysis across birds and insects showed that allometric deviations make larger birds quieter and elongated flies louder, clarifying bioacoustic behavior.
Researchers investigated the roles of chance and necessity in the evolution of ancestral proteins by reconstructing and evolving the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) protein family. They used a combination of ancestral protein reconstruction and continuous evolution technology to mutate and select proteins to acquire protein-protein interactions that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary trajectories from ancestral proteins, they found that over long timescales, contingency erased necessity and overwhelmed chance as the primary cause of sequence variation. Trajectories from phylogenetically distant proteins yielded no common mutations, even under strong identical pressures. Chance arose many mutations could alter specificity at any point; contingency arose historical changed these sets. Results suggest patterns in BCL-2 sequences and other proteins are idiosyncratic products of particular and unpredictable historical events.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide haplotype analysis on a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African populations to investigate genetic diversity and gene flow within the region. The study found that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 700 years. Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo groups share ancestry with Central Africans due to recent expansions. Most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry from outside their geographic region due to gene flow within the last 400 years.
Researchers investigated how the mitotic spindle adapts to changing cell size during early development in Xenopus lae embryogenesis. They developed an in vitro system using cytoplasmic extracts from embryos that mimicked in vivo spindle size differences between stage 3 (4 cells, 37µm) and stage 8 (∼400 cells,18m). Kinesinase Kif2 was identified as a key driver of spindle scaling, with its microtubule-stabilizing activity inhibited in stage 3 spindles by importin α and activated in stage 8 when import α partitions to membrane. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired metaphase orientation but chromosome segregation remained robust.
Researchers have identified riboswitches, a type of RNA molecule, that form a Boolean gate to control purine metabolism in bacteria. These ribwitches can bind to phosphoribosylrophosphate (PR) and guanine, either separately or together, to regulate the transcription of messenger RNA for de novo purine biosynthesis. The ribwitches exist as single units or in tandem with guanine aptamers, allowing them to function as a two-input logic gate. This discovery supports the hypothesis that RNA-based systems can manage complex metabolic processes without protein assistance.
Researchers have investigated the variability in the number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential, which affects the reliability of synaptic transmission. This variability is a fundamental property that contributes to the diversity of synaptic function across brain regions, but its source is unclear. The prevailing view is that release of a single vesicle (unives release, UVR) or multiple vesicles (multives release, MVR) reflects variability in vesicle release probability, which is supported by calcium dependence of release. However, using mouse brain slices, researchers demonstrate that the number of vesicles is regulated by the size of the readily releasable pool upstream of vesicle probability. The study reveals that protein kinase A and its vesicle-associated, synapsin, dynamically control release occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles without altering probability.
HIV-1 Gag selectively packages dimer, unspliced viral RNA in the presence of excess cytosolic RNAs by assembling on the plasma membrane, enriching the viral genome relative to cellular RNAs. A minimal system of purified RN, recombinant HIV-1 G and unilamellar vesicles was used to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5' untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of competitor RNA. Mutations in the CA-CT domain of G, which affect self-assembly, abrogated selectivity. tRNA suppresses G membrane binding when G has bound viral. The ability of HIV-1 G to package its genome and self- on membranes are interdependent.
