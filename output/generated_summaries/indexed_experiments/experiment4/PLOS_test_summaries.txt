Researchers have made significant progress in reducing the number of reported cases of Gambian human trypanosomiasis (HAT), a fatal vector-borne disease, over the past two decades through intensified interventions. However, pockets of infection remain, and it is crucial to assess which regions are on track for elimination and where efforts should be focused. A stochastic model for AT in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was developed and fitted to data from 16 health areas in Mosango zone, Kivu province, using particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methodology. The model captures the dynamics of AT at the health district level (approximately 10,000 people) for the first time, allowing for quantification of uncertainty in results. Spatial heterogeneity in cases is reflected in the results, predicting that Kinamba II, with one-third of the zone's cases, will be the last to reach elimination target. Deterministic version of the AT model using MCM is faster than stochastic, but produces similar posteriorisation. This suggests using deterministic fits for health area expansion and stochastic for projections to capture variation in reporting and elimination estimations.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze the tumor microenvironment (ME) of cancer patients, focusing on its cellular composition and spatial distribution of tumor and immune cell populations. The goal is to explore variations in ME between patients and predict outcomes such as survival and treatment success with immunotherapies. Due to numerous cell interactions, they aim to identify specific interactions useful for predictions. The approach involves summarizing spatial relationships in ME using spatial functions and applying functional analysis and random forest models to predict outcomes and identify relationships. This method was tested in simulations, identifying interactions while controlling false discovery rate. The approach was applied to two real datasets of multiplex ion images of ME in triple-negative breast and lung cancer patients.
Researchers investigated how abnormal neural synchronization in the brain, observed in various disorders, affects brain function. They computationally studied neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure changes, particularly during desynchronization and how they are affected by external perturbations. To examine the impact of different plasticity mechanisms, they combined a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic and structural plasticity mechanisms: (i) spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), (ii) homeostatic structural plasticity (SP), (iii) combination of ST and SP, and (iv) combination of ST and SP with weight-dependent pruning. A stochastic model was introduced to accommodate diverse neuronal firing timescales. Network theory revealed that structural reorganization enhances network synchrony. Weaker connections were preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning, synchrony was achieved with fewer connections in STDP model. Strengthening contacts from high-firing to low-firing neurons and weakening in opposite direction, followed by removal, allowed synchrony with fewer connections. This reorganization resulted in degree-degree correlations and assortativity. Stimulation-induced desynchronization in ST model was compared to models (iii) and (iv). Latter required higher intensity for long-term desynchronization. Findings may inform preclinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive modalities inducing lasting relief, e.g., Parkinson's disease.
Researchers have studied the process of regeneration in planarians, a type of flatworm, to understand how they can regrow missing parts of their nervous system. Planarians can regenerate large regions of their nervous system, including neurons and glia, which are types of non-neuronal cells. However, this process is challenging due to the unpredictability of injuries and the need to regenerate from multiple starting points. In planarians, neurons and glia come from distinct progenitor cells. The study found that planarians first express a gene called delta-2 in neurons in central and peripheral nervous systems, while glia come from mesodermal phagocytic progenitors that express Notch-1. Inhibiting delta-2 or Notch-1 reduced glia in planarians, but not other phocytic cell types. Loss of delta-2-expressing neurons prevented glia differentiation associated with them, while transplanting delta-2-express photoreceptors formed glia at ectopic locations. The study suggests a model where delta-2-express neurons instruct phocytic progenitors to differentiate into glia, a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of cell numbers and types.
Researchers investigated the role of gamma-delta (γδ) T cells in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV in individuals with early and acute HIV infection (AHI). They found significant differences in γδ cell surface marker expression between those who developed broad neutralization breadth and those who did not. Activation of γδ cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and was associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on Vδ1 cells and CD57 on V2 cells was higher in broad neutralizers during AHI and associated with development of neutral breadth later. CD16 on V1 levels were also associated with early Env-specific IgM production. These findings suggest γδ cells may promote neutralization breadth development, with implications for vaccine strategies.
Cancer metastasis, the spread of cancer from one organ to another, is responsible for the majority of cancer-related deaths. Current anti-cancer drugs primarily target tumor growth, not metastasis. Research found that tumor-secreted interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) synergize to enhance metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner. Blocking IL-6 and IL-8 receptors with a novel bispecific antibody, BS, significantly reduced metastatic burden in preclinical cancer models. Bispecific antibodies (Bs), combining two antigen-binding sites in one molecule, offer enhanced avidity and dual targeting potential. However, elucidating mechanisms of Bs binding is crucial for maximizing efficacy. A computational model of BS was developed to investigate multivalent binding, providing insights into affinity and avidity effects. Simulations of monovalent and bivalent interactions between antibody constructs and IL-6 and IL-8 receptors showed how properties and conditions impact binary and ternary complex formation. Results demonstrate balance drives receptor inhibition, providing generalizable predictions for design.
Researchers investigated the role of ZYG-8, a conserved doublecort-family kinase, in centrosomal spindle assembly in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes. ZYG-8 is the mammalian homolog of a microtub-associated protein upregulated in many cancers and implicated in cell division. Depletion of ZYG-8 from oocytes resulted in elongated spindles with pole and midindle defects. Experiments with monopolar spindles showed that Z-8 depletion led to excess forces within the spindle, suggesting a potential role in regulating the force-generating motor BM-1/kines-5. Z-8 is also required for microtub dynamics within the oocyte and kinase activity is necessary for both meiosis and mitosis.
Researchers investigated the relationship between type 2 diabetes (T2) and circulating metabolites in the UK Biob dataset using the Nightingale panel of 249 metabolites, 92% of which are lipids (HDL, ID, LDL, VLDL) and lipoproteins. They integrated this data with large-scale T2 GWAS from the DIANTE meta-analysis and found 79 metabolites causally associated with T2, spanning lipid-related classes except glucose and tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites were causally affected by T2 liability, spanning all classes, including branched-chain amino acids. Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, they identified four metabolites replicated in an independent Estonian Biob dataset, with genetic loci in different regions showing attenuated regulation in T2 cases compared to controls. Variants from QTL were significant for corresponding metabolites in the population but not associated with T risk, indicating T consequences of T on metabolite regulation. Differential analysis found 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macro, or both types of T complications, with few discriminating between classes. Of these, 40 were not causally linked to T in either direction, suggesting mechanisms specific to complications. This study provides a map of T consequences on metabolite levels and regulation, enabling understanding of T trajectory to complications.
Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a bacterium that can colonize humans asymptomatically but also cause opportunistic infections ranging from mild to life-threatening conditions. Resistance and tolerance are two ways the host can survive infection. Resistance limits the pathogen burden, while tolerance limits the health impact of a given pathogen burden. A previous study found that collaborative cross (CC) line 061 is highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, USA300), while CC024 is tolerant. To identify host genes involved in S. aureus infection, CC061 and CC024 mice were crossed to generate F1 and F2 populations. Survival after MRSA infection in F and F generations was 65% and 55, following a complex inheritance pattern for CC increased survival. Colonization in F animals was more extreme than parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. A Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 was identified for survival and weight change after infection. In this TL, WSB/EJ allele in CC mice contributed to MR tolerant phenotype. Two genes, C5 and C2, have high-impact in this region. C and C are receptors for complement Ca, anaphylato that trigger massive response by binding to receptors. It is hypothesized Ca may have altered variant in CC mice, reducing damage by cytokine storm resulting in ability to tolerate higher pathogen and longer.
Researchers investigated the impact of gene regulatory networks on the availability of beneficial alleles and adaptation in a population. They modeled a quantitative trait as a product of a gene regulatory network with a negative autoregulation motif and used forward genetic simulations to measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models. The study found that both models harbored distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected, contrary to the expectation from adaptive walk theory that the distribution of fitness of new mutations is exponential. The network model also exhibited a complex bimodal distribution of fitness among mutations, with a considerable density of deleterious coefficients. This behavior is similar to the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. The results suggest that interactions from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects.
Researchers have proposed a new understanding of how the brain's cortical circuits integrate information from various sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. According to Bayesian theory, animals optimally integrate information, but the biological implementation of this process is unclear. A novel theory suggests that conductance-based neurons and synapses can optimally perform integration. In this view, apical dendrites represent prior expectations of somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parameterized by local quantities, effective potentials and conductances. The somatic compartment naturally computes the posterior under these assumptions. A gradient-based plasticity rule allows neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by their reliabilities. This theory explains experimental findings on single-cell and multi-sensory integration. Simulations illustrate the theory. Predictions on Bayesian dendritic and synaptic plasticity are made.
Researchers have applied the Evolutionary Classification of Domains (EC) framework to classify and catalog domains from 536,808 proteins in the AlphaFold database, covering 226,424,000 amino acid residues. They achieved accurate classification for 90% of residues, identifying 746,349 domains. The study examined domain populations in eukaryotes and bacteria, finding higher fractions of disordered regions and unassigned domains in eukotes. Eukotes also have more proteins with globular and small repeats. Shared domains between eukotes and bacteria include Rossm, TIM barrels, and P-loop. The study compared homolog groups from the proteome to the EC reference database, identifying enriched groups. The findings suggest implications for protein classification strategies in large sets.
Researchers have investigated the life cycle of BK polyomavirus (BKPyV), a major cause of kidney transplant failure with no current antiviral treatment, to understand how it replicates in host cells. They used single-cell analysis to track the expression of BKV's large T antigen (TAg) throughout the cell cycle and found that robust TAg expression is required for host DNA replication, not the other way around. By using inhibitors that only affect host replication, not viral, they showed TAg and viral production rely on initial S phase. BKV is known to promote cell re-entry into S phase from G2 without passing through G1 or mitosis, prolonging S for viral replication, resulting in cells with more than 4N DNA content. Subsequent rounds of host DNA replication rely on canonical cell cycle regulators despite BKV infection. These findings suggest a model for polyomavirus replication where robust TAg depends on initial S and BKV primarily replicates during host-replication. Understanding the molecular events required for BKV production may lead to effective targets against BKV.
Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying genetic associations by integrating gene expression studies with genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Traditional TWAS approaches focus on marginal analyses of one gene at a time, but recent developments in TW fine-mapping methods enable joint modeling of multiple genes to refine identification of causal ones. However, these fine-mapping methods primarily focus on quantitative traits and local regions, leading to suboptimal performance. A new TW fineapping method, FIO, is designed for binary traits, modeling all genes on a chromosome. FIO employs a probit model linking genetically regulated (GX) genes to outcomes, accounting GX correlation among genes on a chromosome. FIO controls false discoveries and offers substantial gains over existing TW fineapping approaches. Simulations evaluate FIO's performance and apply it to six binary traits in the UK Biob dataset. FIO reduces causal sets by 27.9-36% over existing approaches across traits. Leveraging power, FIO prioritizes genes associated with diseases, including GATA for asthma, ABC2 for gout, and SHB for hypertension. FIO is an effective TW fineapping tool for disease.
Misfolded proteins that evade quality control mechanisms can be sequestered to specific sites within cells to prevent dysfunction and toxicity from aggregation. Two proteins, Btn2 and Hsp42, act as compartmentalized sequestases, but their intracellular functions and substrates are not well defined. Research shows that Btn and Hsp are required for tolerance to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide. They sequester oxidized proteins into proteasome quality control (PQC) sites following exposure, and their absence leads to protein aggregate accumulation. The toxicity of aggregate accumulation causes sensitivity in Btn and Hsp sequease mutants. Overexpression of Hsp104 disaggregase rescues oxidative tolerance. The Sup35 translation factor is identified as an in vivo sequease substrate, and Btn and Hsp suppress oxid-induced formation of the [PS+] prion, an amyloid form of Sup35. [PS+] pr formation in sease mutants does not require insoluble protein deposit (IPOD) localization, where amyloids are thought to fragment and propagate. Instead, amorph and amyloid Sup aggregates are increased in Btn Hsp mutants, suggesting prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress without sequease activity.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the role of non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in glioblastoma (GB) invasion, a type of brain cancer. They used CRISPR-interference (CRPR) to evaluate the function of GB-associated lncRNAs in an unbiased screen and characterized the mechanism of identified candidates. A CRPR lRNA loss-of-function screen was implemented to assess the association of lRNA knockdown (KD) with invasion in Matrig cell lines. Top candidates were validated using CRPR and oligonucleotide (AS)-mediated knockdown in three tumor lines. Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Atlas (TA) and Genotypeissue (GT) Expression analysis. Mediators of lRNA effect were identified via differential expression following lRNA KD and assessed for invasion using knock and rescue experiments. Forty lRNAs were significantly associated with 33-83% decrease in invasion (p<0.01) upon knockdown. The top candidate LINC45 was identified with 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion upon knock, while LINC45 expression was associated with patient survival and tumor grade (p<0.0001). RNA analysis of LINC45 knock revealed WAS3, implicated in tumor studies, was highly correlated with lRNA, while WAS KD was associated with decrease in invasion. WAS overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive lost with L45 KD. CR screening identified L45, previously unannotated lRNA, as critical to GB invasion. Expression is associated with grade and survival. RNAq and mechanistic studies suggest this l may regulate via WAS.
Researchers investigated the brain's ability to assign probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli using electroencephalographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic process. The study aimed to identify the classes of models used by the brain to perform this task. A novel clustering procedure was applied to EEG data, revealing that the brain utilizes the recurrence of regular auditory stimuli order to build a model. This suggests that the brain's probabilistic modeling of sequences is based on pattern recognition of regularities in the environment. The findings indicate that the brain's probabilistic modeling is not solely based on statistical properties of individual stimuli, but also on their sequential dependencies. The study's results provide evidence that the brain's probabilistic modeling is not solely based on statistical properties of individual stimuli, but also on their sequential dependencies.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for analyzing gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, but has limitations. It fails to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcriptome size (total number of transcripts per cell) and dissociation-induced cryptic gene expression, particularly in heterogeneous tissues requiring dissociation for analysis. This leads to discrepancies between bulk RNA-seq results and reconstituted bulk-seq using sc-se data. To address this, we propose a computationally calculated "cell-specific weighting factor" (cWF). We introduce concept and compute WF for 76 cell types across 10 organs, validated by accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk-se data using sc data and WF of composite cells. Additionally, WF predict aging progression, suggesting diagnostic applications and association with aging. Our study provides method to solve sc-se limitations of complex tissues. Findings suggest WF utility and biological significance.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effect of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVM) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, MVM can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic variants used as instrumental variables, violating one of the core assumptions. Genetic variants giving outlying estimates are considered potentially pleiotropic. Radial plots can help identify these variants. 

A new formulation of MVM and an adapted radial plot are proposed, allowing the effect of each exposure within M analysis to be visualized. Radial MVM includes removal of outlying SNPs violating M assumptions. A R package is presented for implementing the methods. The effectiveness of Radial M is demonstrated through simulations and analyses. Outliers with respect to exposures can be visualized and removed through Radial M. Simulations show removal decreases bias in effects under pleiotropy. Radial is applied to the effect of lipid on coronary disease (CHD). Simulated examples highlight features of M can be explored using tools within the package Radial effectively visualizes causal estimates and provides diagnostic information on M assumptions.
Researchers recorded the behavior of individual Drosophila melanogaster flies at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days in featureless arenas on sucroseagar media, resulting in a dataset of nearly 2 billion pose instances. Using the deep learning framework SLE, a full-body pose dataset was produced for 47 individuals. Stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, probis extension, and locomotion were identified and used to create ethograms to explore the flies' behavior across time and days. Daily patterns in stereotyped behaviors were found, including trends in grooming modalities, probis extension duration, and locomotion speed, providing new insights into the D melanogaster circadian cycle. The hour after dawn was identified as a unique point in the flies' daily pattern, with behavioral composition correlating with indicators of health such as locom speed and fraction of time spent resting.
Researchers have investigated the role of protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor (PTPs) in the adaptive immune system, but their functions beyond immunoregulation are not well understood. This study identifies a novel function for the Caenorhabditis elegans phosphatase PTP-22, which is involved in molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. A genetic screen found that loss of PTP-22 phosphat activity suppressed molting defects caused by mutations in the conserved NIMA kinases NE-2 and NE-3, which regulate membrane trafficking and actin. To understand PTP-22 functions, proximity labeling was used to identify interactors of P-22 during development, revealing the CDC42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor DN-1 as an in vivo partner of P-22. Loss of DN- also suppressed molting defects. Genetic and localization studies showed P-22 in epidermal adhesion complexes, including hemidesmosomes, suggesting P22 maintains tissue integrity. Proximity labeling implicated P22 in nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly in the germline, where one-third of P22 interactors are gran components.
Malaria elimination efforts face a significant challenge due to the emergence of artemisinin resistance, a major antimalarial drug. If artem resistance spreads to Africa and India, malaria-related deaths are expected to increase substantially. Understanding the spread of artem resistance in Southeast Asia is crucial for health organizations to prioritize control measures. However, data on artem resistance are limited. A comprehensive database from the World Antimal Resistance Network was used to analyze the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kel 13 ( K ) gene, associated with artem resistance. A Bayesian geostatistical model was applied to produce spatio-temporal predictions oftem resistance. The results show an expansion of the K mutation across the Greater Mekong region from 2000 to 202, with the most change occurring between 2010 and 2015. The study provides critical information for malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia by predicting spatio-temporal patterns and extents oftem at the subcontinent level.
Function-to-domain (FI) containing proteins, including NLR1 and CARD8, are crucial components of the inflammasome signaling pathway, which is vital for the innate immune response. These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FI domain, resulting in full-length (FL), N-terminal (NT), and C-terminal (CT) peptides that form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state. Researchers found that NLR paralogs and CARD form conserved autohibitory complexes involving NT-CT and FL-CT interactions with distinct mechanisms. The linker region between LRR and FI in murine NLR1 (mNLR1) plays a role in forming NT-CT autohibitory, while Z5 of rat NLR1 (N1) and CARD mediates NT-CT. Cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DPP9) interacts with these complexes, forming FL-PP-CT and NT-PP-CT complexes, but not with NT of human NLR1. Functional assays showed DPP is involved in NT-CT of rodent NLR and CARD but does not influence inhibitory activity of NT on CT.
Researchers investigated the role of the ER and Golgi localized protein R1 (R1) in regulating protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. They found that loss of R1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eukary initiation factor 2 (eIF2), a key regulator of protein synthesis. Cell analysis revealed that R1 mutant cells are identified as "losers" and eliminated through competition with healthier neighbors. Interestingly, R1 levels are upregulated in cells overexpressing Myc, which causes overgrowth despite high prote stress. This suggests that increased R1 provides protection to My-overexpressing cells by alleviating prote stress and supporting overgrowth. The study demonstrates R's novel role in regulating proteinostasis in Dophila and its function in competitive survival.
Researchers investigated the impact of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the CHEK2 gene, which is associated with an increased risk of breast and other cancers. Most of the 3,188 unique amino acid changes resulting from SNVs in CHE2 have not been tested for their effect on the function of the CHE2-encoded protein (CHK2). To assess the function of variants, researchers tested their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHE2, RAD53. This approach has provided functional information on over 100 CHE2 SNVs, aligning with human cell-based assays and pathogenicity. This study tested all 4,887 possible SNs in the CHE2 reading frame for ability to complement RAD53 using high-throughput deep mutational scanning (DMS). Among non-syn changes, 770 were damaging to protein function, while 417 were tolerated. Results correlate with previous structure and function data, providing a first functional assay for variants of uncertain significance in clinical databases. This approach can help predict pathogenicity of CHE2 variants of uncertain found in screening and applied to other cancer genes.
Researchers have discovered that the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae forms multiple populations with distinct epigenetic and phenotypic characteristics through Psr-driven inversions of the DNA methyltransferase hS genes in the opacity determinant (cod locus. This results in a switch between opaque and transparent colonies, with different methylation patterns that confer pathogenesis traits. The study found that the Spx1-Ten toxin-antitoxin (TA) system regulates the orientations of hS inversions and associated epigen traits, such as colony opacity. Spx1 and Ten constitute a conserved type II TA system in S pneumonia. Overexpression of Ten led to growth arrest in E. coli and autolysis in S pneumonia, while antitox Spx1 repressed the transcription of the sp1-ten operon. Ten bound to ribosome factor Rim, reducing Com expression, which activates transformation genes. Reduced Com expression enhanced transcription of the invertase Psr, favoring transparent colony-associated hS configurations. Moderate Ten expression reshaped pneumoc epigen and colony. Spontaneous variations in the promoter region of the sp1ten operon act as a genetic switch generating subpopulations with epetic and phenic diversity.
High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and comparing datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns in one condition is desirable. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this as they operate on one dataset. Contrastive Principal Component Analysis (cPCA) has been proposed to address this issue, but has seen limited adoption due to requiring a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions with no knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA foreground and background conditions are treated differently, making it unsuitable for comparing experimental conditions symmetrically. A new approach, Generalized Contrastive PCA (gcPCA) has been developed to address these issues. gc avoids hyperparameter requirement and treats foreground and background equally, making it suitable for comparing conditions symmetrically. 

gcPCA was developed to address cPCA's hyperparameter requirement. cPCA requires a hyperparameter to determine the number of components to retain, resulting in multiple solutions with no knowing which is correct. gc uses a novel algorithm to determine optimal number of components, eliminating hyperparameter. gc also treats foreground and background equally, unlike c, making it suitable for comparing conditions symmetric. 

An open-source gc toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of gc variants for different scenarios has been developed. gc has been applied to high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II in single-cell RNA sequencing. gc is fast, robust, and easy-to-use, facilitating analysis of high-dimensional to gain insights into complex phenomena.
Researchers have investigated the role of B cell receptor (BCR) signaling in the survival and maturation of B cells and its deregulation in B cell lymphomas. While proximal BCR signaling is well understood, little is known about downstream effector pathways and a comprehensive network analysis of BCR signaling is lacking. A semi-quantitative modeling of BCR in Burkitt lymphoma (BL) cells using perturbed phosphorylation data from BL-2 and BL-41 cells revealed feedback and cros structures in the BCR network, including negative cros from p38 to MEK/ER. The relevance of cros was verified by B and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by phosphoproteomics on ERK and ER target sites. The trained network for BL-2 was transferable to BL-41 cells and also suited B signaling in diffuse large cell lymphoma lines with aberrant B signaling (H-1, OCI-L3), indicating B aberration does not major rewiring.
The Notch signalling pathway plays a crucial role in tissue growth and maintenance, with its activity regulated by two opposing mechanisms: intercellular Notch activation through receptor-ligand interactions and intracellular cis inhibition by ligands binding to the same cell. Different Notch/ligand combinations elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, determining the pathway's strength, duration, and specificity. This study investigated the molecular basis of Notch ligands DLL4 and JAG1 in angiogenic sprouting, using experimental and mathematical approaches. Results showed that DLL4, not JAG, induces Notch1 receptor activation, and JAG blocks DLL-dependent cis-inhibition of Not signalling through a JAG/DLL complex formation. A new Notch signalling model was proposed, recapitulating tip and stalk cell formation necessary for sprouting.
Researchers have developed Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM), a Bayesian non-parametric clustering algorithm that incorporates uncertainty associated with data points. This approach outperforms existing methods on simulated data and cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics, which have uncertainty linked to sample size. DPM separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. A novel procedure was introduced to generate a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different from where it was discovered, incorporating variability in expression across genes within individuals. Three public gene expression datasets containing IMD patients with range were summarized using relevant signatures. DPM clusters were associated with disease and structure replicated across datasets. The study demonstrates that data uncertainty should inform clustering and presents a method, DPM. A procedure was also presented to use gene signatures in datasets other than where defined. Gene expression data from IMD patients was summarized using relevant signatures and clustered with DPM. DPM outperforms existing methods on simulated data. DPM separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates subgroups such as adultset arthritis. A procedure was introduced to generate a summary of a gene on a dataset different where it was discovered, incorporating variability in expression across genes within individuals. Three public expression datasets containing IMD patients with range were summarized using relevant signatures. Clusters by DPM were associated with disease and structure replicated across datasets.
Deep neural networks have been successful models of the primate visual system, but they fail to account for the importance of shape in primate vision. Unlike humans, who judge category membership to a large extent on shape, deep networks rely more on features such as color and texture. This discrepancy has been documented, but underlying reasons unclear. To investigate, artificial datasets were designed where shape, color, and texture can predict class. Networks were trained to classify images with single features and combinations, showing some architectures unable to learn shape, while others use shape but biased towards other features. The bias attributed to interactions between weight updates in mini-batch gradient descent. This suggests algorithms with sparser, local changes make networks sensitive to shape and improve human-like vision.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the dynamics of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and their role in liver fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver function in chronic diseases. The model includes the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes recently highlighted by single-cell RNA sequencing. HSCs are modeled as agents with seven physiological states interacting with TGF-β molecules, which regulate H activation and secretion of type I collagen, a main component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Simulations revealed the critical role of HSC inactivation during fibrosis progression and reversion. Inactivation eliminates activated Hs during reversion, while reactivation of inactivated Hs (iHs) sustains fibrosis. The model is sensitive to TGF-β parameters, adaptable to various pathophysiological conditions with differing Tβ levels. Experimental data from a mouse model of CCl-induced fibrosis validated predicted ECM dynamics. The model also predicts accumulation of is during chronic disease. RNA sequencing from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated fibrosis confirmed this, identifying is as novel fibrosis markers. This study provides the first model of H dynamics in chronic disease, exploring is role in liver homeostasis. The model can be generalized to fibroblasts and fibrosis in other tissues.
Researchers have developed a novel meta-analysis framework to estimate the total effect of high-dimensional omics mediators, such as genomic data, across multiple studies while accounting for inter-study heterogeneity. This framework leverages the asymptotic standard error of R-squared (R)-based effect estimation for high-dimensional omics mediators and requires only summary statistics from individual studies. The method can evaluate and account for potential heterogeneity across studies due to varying genomic platforms. Simulations showed the method to be computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory operating characteristics comparable to individual-level data analysis when no interudy heterogeneity. The framework was applied to 5 studies from the Trans-Omics Precision Medicine (TOP) program with 580 participants to estimate the mediation of gene expression on age-related systolic blood pressure and sex variation high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The method is available in R package Meta2 on GitHub.
Cancer development is driven by the accumulation of a small number of genetic mutations that confer a selective growth advantage to cells, while most mutations do not contribute to tumor progression. Identifying the genes responsible for tumorigenesis is crucial for effective treatment design. Current methods often provide a single gene list for an entire patient cohort, ignoring heterogeneity across patients. A novel method, PWH, prioritizes mutated genes in a patient based on impact on downstream gene expression across patients with shared co-mutations and profiles. Experimental results on 16 cancer datasets from TCG showed PWH excelled in identifying known drivers and tumor-specific drivers. Comparative testing across five cancer types, PWH outperformed individual and cohort methods. PWH identified both common and rare drivers. Personalized profiles improved stratification provided insights into heterogeneity and a step toward personalized treatment. One predicted gene, low-density lipoprotein-related protein 1 (LRP), was validated on tumor proliferation in vitro assays, promoting high expression.
Researchers have developed a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy, known as the Virtual Epileptic (VEP), which combines anatomical data with dynamic models of abnormal brain activities to generate spatio-temporal seizure patterns similar to those recorded by invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG. This allows for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before surgery. A global optimization approach using the SaSS, a metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation, was used to calibrate VE models, yielding high-quality solutions without excessive computational time. Benchmarking on synthetic data showed VE successfully solved various configurations, outperforming other parallel solvers. Bayesian optimization for hyperparameter tuning improved accuracy and reduced computational cost. A scalable uncertainty quantification phase was added to assess variability in estimated parameters across problems. This study aims to improve estimation of pathological areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making.
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a significant global health issue with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Pulmonary TB is primarily caused by Mtb growth in the lungs, but the rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of infected animals, such as rabbits, are largely unknown. Experiments were conducted with rabbits infected with a novel, virulent M isolate of the Beijing lineage H878, carrying plasmid p10. In vitro, p10 was found more stable in H878 than the commonly used laboratory-adapted strain H37R (segregation coefficient 0.10 in H878 vs 0.18 in37). The kinetics of plasm-bearing bacteria in M-infected rabbits did not follow a monotonic decline; the percent plasm-bearing increased between 28-56 post-infection and remained 84-112 post-in despite large increase in lung numbers at late points. Mathematical modeling suggested a non-monotonic change in plasm-bearing can be explained by lung Mtb consisting of at least 2 subpopulations with different replication/death kinetics: one expanding early controlled/eliminated, another expanding later causing counterintuitive increase plasm-bearing. A homogeneous M population model could not explain data when run stochastically. H878 forms well-circumscribed granomas, results suggest independent dynamics in granomas.
Researchers have developed a computational algorithm called GlycanModeler to predict the structure of carbohydrates, also known as glycans, attached to proteins. Determining the structure of glycans is challenging due to their complexity. Glycaner uses kernel density estimates of common glycan conformations from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations to build glycans layer by layer. The algorithm was tested on various glycan structures and showed high accuracy in both de novo modeling and density-guided building. Glycaner was used to design new glycans on a protein scaffold to shield it from antibody recognition, which was experimentally verified.
In the study of protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, the SCF (Skp-Cul1-F-box) complex plays a crucial role in regulating protein quality by recognizing target substrates via the F-box protein. However, the limited number of identified ubiquitin-ligase substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the field. Penicillium oxalicum, a filamentous fungus, contains transcription factors such as Brl, CreA, Xln, and Ace1 that regulate development and transcription of hemi-cellulase genes. Transcription factor Ace1, also known as Slt, is positively correlated with growth and conidiation and negatively with expression of hemi-cellulase genes. The ubiquitin-ligase substrate SCFbx-Ace1 is identified in P. oxalic, with most Pbx present in free form within the nucleus and a small portion associating with Sk1 to form Pbx-Sk1 heterodimer. Under glucose signal, Pbx absence results in decreased transcription of brA, the master regulator of asexual development and spore pigmentation genes, and impaired conidiation. Under cellulose, transcription of hemiulase genes in Pbx mutant are significantly upregulated. Pbx present, Ace exists as full-length and low-molecular weight versions, with Ace polyubiquin modification. Deleting Pbx does not affect Ace transcription but results in accumulation of all Ace versions. Accumulated Ace is dysfunctional, no longer binding to promoters of target genes, including cellulase cb1, hemiculase x11, and pigmentation abB. Pbx acts as transcription coactivator, recognizing Ace, allowing to regulate target genes with different effects under signals.
The basement membrane (BM) is a crucial structural component of tissues and plays a significant role in organogenesis. However, the mechanisms underlying its formation and diversification are not well understood. In Drosophila melanogaster, the follicular epithelium relies on a BM composed of oriented fibrils and a homogenous matrix. This study aimed to determine the molecular and cellular basis of BM protein secretion. Two parallel routes for BM secretion were identified, mediated by Rab10 and Rab8. Abolishing both routes blocked BM production, but genetic interactions revealed they competed. Rab10 promoted lateral and planar-polarized secretion, while Rab8 promoted basal secretion, forming fibrils and homogenous BM, respectively. Dystrophin-associated protein complex (DC) and Rab10 were found in a plan-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins. DC was essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards Rab10. Exocyst complex had a dual function: Ex70 subunit interacted with dystroph to limit planar polarization and was required for Rab8 route.
Researchers have explored the use of machine learning to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), which can enhance therapeutic benefits. However, current datasets are limited by underrepresentation of some HIV-1 subtypes, affecting models' generalizability across subtypes. Additionally, combinations of bnAbs are required to avoid resistance to singleAb, but determining optimal combinations computationally is unsolved. A new approach, multi-task (MTL) learning, trains models on outcomes for multiple antibodies at once, improving predictions. This study develops a new model that not only boosts performance but also addresses previous challenges. MTL mitigates underrepresentation of subtypes, enabling models to learn patterns of co-resistance to combinations, providing tools to predict epitopes and select optimalAb combinations. The model, publicly available at https://github.com/ia/LBUM, can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by the aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow, with varying treatment effects between patients, necessitating the development of prognostic models for informed decision-making. Previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the role of pathway dysfunction in disease progression. This study developed two predictive models incorporating pathway information: pathway score method and group lasso using pathway. The pathway method converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for fitting, considering three score calculation methods (ssSEA, GS, and z-scores) and 14 data sources. The methods were implemented in microarray data (GSE324) obtaining a model with best performance in validation. The model was compared to gene-based and published models in external data, showing group lasso incorporating pathway (Vax) more competitive in both internal and external validation. Immune information, V pathways were predictive for MM. V outperformed previously models. The model was more resistant to missing values, with presence <5% not deteriorating accuracy using imputation. Pathway-based models using lasso were alternatives to gene-based for MM, documented in R package (https://github.com/ShStatMM) with imputation integrated for future validation.
Mitochondrial fission in response to cellular insult is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death, highlighting the need to understand molecular mechanisms regulating this process. A nonlinear dynamical systems model of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-dependent fission was developed to identify parameters regulating total fission rate (TFR) as a function of time. FR was nondimensionalized, undergoing a Hopf bifurcation with parameter μ = kM, where M is total mitochondrial fission factor (M) concentration and k+, k- association and dissociation constants between oligomers on outer membrane. μ represents maximum disassembling rate of oligomers. Nondimensional system resulted in four dimensionless parameters, FR and cumulative fission (TF) depend only on μ. TF does not monotonically increase with μ, instead increasing to a point then decreasing as μ continues. This non-monotonic dependence on μ suggests targeting k, k, or M may have non-intuitive impact on fission. Understanding regulatory parameters, such as μ, may assist therapeutic selection.
Researchers have developed a CRISPR-based gene drive system to control disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests by targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyros decarboxylase 2 (T2) in Drosophila suuk, a notorious fruit pest. The system uses a 3-gRNA homing gene to suppress the T2 gene, resulting in low homing in the germline but restored egg-laying defects in T2 mutant females. This allows for easier maintenance of the drive system. The effectiveness of a similar system was tested in Drosila melanogaster and additional drive systems were constructed with promoter-C9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. The study found that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations limit the spread of gene alleles and Cas9 activity is influenced by position. Conditionally rescuing female infertility caused by the drive was also demonstrated, offering a tool for industrial-scale production of gene transgenic insects.
Research has shown that the brain's energy expenditure is not only limited by the energy required for computation, but also by the energy needed to form and maintain memories. Experiments have demonstrated that even simple learning tasks, which necessitate only a few synaptic updates, incur significant metabolic costs. In contrast, achieving 95% accuracy on the MNIST task requires at least 108 synaptic updates, suggesting the brain has evolved to learn with minimal energy efficiency. To investigate energy expenditure in feedforward neural networks, a parsimonious energy model was used to propose two plasticity-restricting algorithms: 1) modifying only synapses with large updates and 2) restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses forming a path through the network. Biological networks are often larger than required, yet vanilla backpropagation updates all synapses. In this case, savings can be achieved with only slightly worse learning time. Restricting plasticity competitively saves energy associated with synaptic plasticity. Results may lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a match between artificial and biological learning. Algorithms may also benefit hardware as electronic storage is energetically costly.
Researchers investigated how laboratory evolution can overcome defects caused by the deletion of non-essential genes in the genome of the bacterium Escherichia coli strain AD1x, which was engineered to have deletions of 22-42 kilobases and 70-293 kilobases. They evolved populations of AD1x and each deletion strain for 300 generations in chemically defined and complex media and sequenced the genomes of endpoint isolates. Fitness increased in all cases except two, which failed to improve in one environment. Mutations in protein-coding and small RNAs were associated with one environment or deletion. The global transcription regulators ribonuclease D, csrA, and hfq were frequently mutated across strains, with varied effects on function and fitness. Mutations in this network compensated for earlier deletion in ADx ancestor, restoring csr function. Results show that fitness lost during genome streamlining can be regained through evolution, often through deletion-specific and regulatory adjustments.
Researchers have developed a self-cleaving ribozyme tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebraf. The tool, called T3, was inserted in an intron of a reporter gene and showed rapid pre-mRNA cleavage with up to 20-fold reduction in expression, outperforming other ribymes. T3 was then inserted in the intron of the albino gene using CRISPR/Cas and observed a pigmentation similar to mutant. Base-editing inactivated the ribyme showed the phenotype was reversible. A Flippase and Cre-activatable version, Ribo, was generated to control mRNA of albino. Ribo activation induced knockdown and recapitulated mutant phenotype. Cre and Dre-controllable Gal/UAS in RFlip labeled cells independently of target expression. The RFlip cassette is introduced as a tool to control endogenous expression in vertebrate and alternative to existing knock strategies.
Researchers have developed a new software tool called "aiSEG" that enables the segmentation of cellular structures in microscopic images using only transmitted light, eliminating the need for fluorescent labeling. This approach reduces phototoxicity, frees up imaging channels, and speeds up the process. The software uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect structures in bright field images. It was evaluated on various cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities with curated and novel data sets, totaling 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images. SEG accurately segments nuclei from bright field images similar to manual segmentation, retaining biologically relevant information. It is adaptable to new cases with only 32 images for retraining. SEG is accessible through command line and graphical user interface, agnostic to environments, and does not require user coding experience.
Researchers investigated whether humans rely on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features to address the challenge of identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments. One such property is the rate of change, as behaviorally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. To test this, 295 participants learned rewards of two-dimensional bandits with either slowly or quickly changing feature predicting the bandit reward. Across two experiments and preregistered replication, participants accrued more reward when the bandit's relevant feature changed slowly and its irrelevant quickly, compared to the opposite. No difference was found in generalizing to unseen values between conditions. Feature speed's effect on learning was tested with a set of function approximation Kalman models, revealing higher learning rate for slow feature and adjusting to relevance and speed. Larger improvement in performance for slow compared to fast bandits correlated with adjusting learning rates. These results suggest humans favor slower features, indicating a bias in reward learning approach.
Patients with estrogen receptor-negative (ER) breast cancer have the worst prognosis among all breast cancer subtypes, often experiencing rapid recurrence or progression to metastatic disease shortly after diagnosis. Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in most solid tumors, making understanding metastatic biology crucial for effective intervention. A systems genetics approach previously identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility. This study extends those findings to identify Res1, a poorly characterized gene, as a novel metastasis gene in ER breast cancer. Res1 is a large, unstructured protein with evolutionarily conserved intron structure, but poor amino acid conservation. CRISPR gene knockout mouse models crossed with Polyoma middle T antigen engineered mouse (MTV-PMT) demonstrated reduced Res1 resulted in increased tumor growth, shortened survival, and increased lung metastases consistent with patient data. Analysis of matched primary and metastatic tissues revealed loss of wild-type Res1 in tumor tissue, consistent with Res1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed Res1 role in transcriptional control through association with G-quadruplex sequences, particularly ribosomal biogenesis. Results suggest Res1 loss enhances ER breast cancer progression through transcriptional and translational alterations.
Researchers investigated the roles of the Mec1 and Rad24 proteins in meiotic recombination during meiosis. They found that deletion of Rad24 reduced spore viability and recombination frequency, consistent with previous studies. However, loss of Mec1 increased recombination frequency and had less effect on spore viability. Despite these differences, multi-chromat events initiated by closely spaced DSBs occurred more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec, suggesting loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation. Both Mec and Rad have roles in spatial regulation of crossovers (COs). Loss of either Mec or Rad resulted in more random CO distributions, suggesting reductions in global manifestation of interference. These effects are similar but less extreme than the phenotype of 'MM mutants such as zip3, and may be driven by reductions in proportion of interfering CO. In addition to shared CO regulation, results highlight separable roles for Rad as pro-CO factor and Mec as recombination frequency regulator, loss of which helps suppress broader CO defects caused by DDR abrogation.
Researchers have struggled to culture Pneumocystis jiroveci, a deadly fungus that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients, due to its inability to grow in vitro. A comprehensive in silico genome-scale model of Pneumyst growth and metabolism was developed to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances hindering growth. The model was created using published genome data, literature, and bioinformatics tools, and validated through Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches to predict metabolic fluxes and critical components of Pyst medium. The study provides insights into Pyst biology and a strategy to overcome culturing the pathogen vitro.
Researchers investigated the role of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ motif (TAZ) in cell proliferation, particularly under high-density conditions. They found that at low cell density, YAP/TA localizes to the nucleus, promoting proliferation, while at high density, the Hippo pathway activates, relocating Y/TA to the cytoplasm, resulting in cell cycle arrest. Cancer cells have higher Y/TA levels than normal cells, but it's unclear if this increase alone overcomes contact inhibition. A 3D mathematical model was constructed incorporating the Hipp-Y/TA pathway, introducing a novel component reflecting cell density dynamics. The model simulated cell interactions using reaction and molecular dynamics equations, adhesion and repulsive forces, and friction. Cell cycles were composed of mitotic and growth phases under kinetic influence. Simulations were performed at various YTA levels to determine required increase for sustained proliferation at high density. Results showed a twofold increase in YTA in cancer cells was sufficient to evade arrest, enabling continuous proliferation. The model, incorporating cell interactions and Hipp-YTA, may evaluate malignancy based on YTA levels, develop drugs to suppress cancer proliferation, and determine drug dosages.
Researchers have identified that many eukaryotic proteins and RNAs contain low-complex domains (LCDs) with a tendency to form biomolecular condensates. Mutations in LCDs can disrupt condens dynamics, leading to pathological transitions to solid-like states. To understand how LCD sequence governs condens dynamics, an energy framework was developed based on a'stickiness' scale, rather than explicit sequence. Sequences were characterized by Wasserstein distance to random counterparts. The framework maps material and dynamical properties governed by energy features modulated by LCD complexity, including periodicity and disorder. Periodic LCDs promote elasticity, while random sequences exhibit viscosity. Results show minimum periodicity is crucial for fluid condens, avoiding glass or solid states. The framework explains prion domain findings and predicts cond viscoelasticity alterations.
Researchers have investigated the development of ectodermal organs, specifically focusing on the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that invaginates into the underlying mesyme to form an organ shape. Signaling molecules play a crucial role in epithelial morphogenesis, but the mechanisms leading to cell rearrangement and tissue changes are unclear. Using the mouse dentition as a model, the study found that non-mus myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and functions by promoting cell adhesion and convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling controls these processes by inducing myosin II activation via AKT. Pharmacological induction of AK and myos II rescued defects caused by Sh inhibition. The results support a model where Sh signal is transmitted through myos II to power cellular rearrangement for proper epithelial invagination.
Researchers have leveraged large-scale single-cell RNA and chromatin accessibility data to gain a deeper understanding of complex biological mechanisms. By transferring labels from single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-seq), the exploration of single-cell omics data has been empowered. However, current transfer methods are limited due to their inability to preserve fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic/extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. To address this, a deep transfer learning-based graph convolutional network, scGCN, was developed, achieving high performance in preserving biological variation while processing hundreds of thousands of cells in minutes with low memory. scGC was applied to integrate mouse atlas data from multimodal datasets generated by ATAC-seq and C-seq, demonstrating high transfer accuracy and knowledge across modalities.
Researchers have characterized the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the Mc3 subunit of the replicative helicase, a protein essential for DNA replication. The NLS is a short motif rich in basic amino acids, but identifying it is challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 modeling, they found that precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mc3 through interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs nuclear import of Mc, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the M complex and poor growth.
Ataxin-2 (ATN) is a gene associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease. The protein is a therapeutic target for ALS-related conditions. ATN or At2 in insects functions in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability, and assembly of RNP granules, mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). The LSm-like domain of At2 stimulates translation, antagonizes RNP assembly. This study advances previous findings through experiments on Drosophila and human Atin-2 proteins. Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified by Editing (TRIBE) and co-localization immunoprecipitation indicate the polyA-binding protein (PAB) interacting P2 motif of Atin-2 is a major determinant of mRNA content in Atin RNPules. Experiments with transgenic Dophila show the At-LS domain protects against neurodegeneration, while P2 and IDR interactions support At-induced cytotoxicity. The data propose how Atin-2 interactions remodel translational control, structured and non-structured interactions contribute to specificity and efficiency of RNP condensation and neurodegeneration.
Researchers investigated the role of gene regulatory networks in the development and maintenance of muscle stem cells in different anatomical locations. They used mice with a Pitx2 gene driver to study its function prenatal, postnatal, and lineage progression. The results showed that Pit2 is dispensable for muscle stem cell specification and maintenance in extraocular muscles, but not limb muscles, where it is a major regulator during early development. Constitutive Pax7 inactivation postnatally led to a greater loss of stem cells in extraocular muscles compared to limb. A relay between Pit2, My5, and 7 was proposed for stem cell maintenance in extraocular. Muscle stem cells in extraocular adopt a quiescent state earlier than limb and do not proliferate in adult, but have higher content per area pre- and postnat. In contrast, limb stem cells proliferate in Duchenne muscular dystrophy model, fewer were present in extraocular model compared to controls and non-proliferative. This study provides comprehensive characterization of stem heterogeneity along body axis and insights into sparing of extraocular during muscular dystrophy.
Researchers have identified several variants of concern (VOCs) and variants of interest (VOIs) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since 2020, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron lineage, and others. These variants exhibit distinct levels of virulence, antigenicity, and infectivity, necessitating specific control measures. To simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among the population, a new infectious disease model was proposed, combining epidemic data with physical neural networks (PINs) to develop the VOC-informed network (VOC-IN). The model was tested using reported data from British Columbia (BC) and internal health agencies in Canada, demonstrating accuracy in fitting observed data and simulating unobserved dynamics, time-dependent parameters, and short-term predictions. Experimental results showed variations in control strategies across regions, with VOC-IN performing well in long-term and multi-wave data analysis.
Researchers have developed a new approach called CytoNet, a deep learning-based method that improves the accuracy of image-based cell profiling by 30-68% compared to traditional averaging methods. This method, known as CytoNet, uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple instance learning framework to aggregate single-cell data, making it easier to apply than previous strategies. CytoNet achieves this improvement by down-weighting mitotic cells or debris and prioritizing crowded cells. The approach only requires perturbation labels for training, which are available in most cell profiling datasets. CytoNet offers a post-processing step for single-cell profiles that significantly boosts performance on image-based datasets.
Researchers have identified that the ability to solve complex tasks relies on adaptive changes in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity, and alterations in these dynamics can lead to impaired cognitive performance, manifesting as difficulties in attention, distraction, inhibition, and behavioral impairments, resulting in decreased efficiency and increased effort in accomplishing goal-directed tasks. To address this, a framework was proposed to associate cognitive effort during task performance with electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns, utilizing discrete dynamical states (EEG microstates) and optimal transport theory. A dataset from a spatial version of the Stro task, a cognitive test requiring participants to respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another conflicting aspect, was used to validate the framework. The Stro task requires participants to respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another often conflicting aspect. Results showed an increase linked to cognitive effort, confirming the framework's effectiveness in capturing and quantifying transitions.
Researchers investigated the role of atypical memory B cells (aBC) in malaria-exposed individuals, specifically focusing on Plasmodium vivax (P. viv)-specific aBC and their contribution to humoral immune responses. To this end, they generated P. viv Duffy Binding Protein II (PvDBPI) probes to detect and track the development and persistence of aBC. Results showed that PvPI-specific aBC were elicited during malaria illness and persisted through recovery. To understand the biology and function of P. viv-specific aBC in producing antibodies, a single aBC was cultured and secreted Ig tested for binding activity. aBC-derived antibodies showed variable levels of anti-PDBIg, with some comparable to classicalBC. The focus shifted to aBC function in neutralizing antibodies. Among aBC clones, A12 and B11 produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against PvPI variants. Notably, B cell receptors (BCRs) of PvPI aBC expressed unique IGH genes, similar to classicalBC. Somatic hypermutation (SH) and CDR length VH and V in theseBC subsets were not different. Findings revealed P. viv infections elicited development and persistence of P. viv aBC. Accumulation of aBC during infections may play a role in producing antibodies against malaria.
Researchers have developed a new method called MR-MASHS, an extension of the MR-MASH model, to predict complex trait phenotypes using summary data from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel. Unlike MRASH, which requires individual-level data, MRASHS uses summary statistics, making it applicable to datasets not publicly available and scalable to large-scale data. Simulations show that MRASH is competitive and outperforms state-of-the-art methods for single and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in various scenarios differing in effect sharing patterns across phenotypes, number of phenotypes, causal variants, and heritability. A real analysis of 16 blood phenotypes in the UK Biobank demonstrates MRASH achieves higher accuracy than competing methods for most traits, especially with smaller sample size datasets.
Researchers have developed a novel framework to predict the spread of infectious diseases by incorporating spatial and temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models. This is achieved by introducing a continuous recruitment process for susceptibles, approximated by a neural network to develop a Universal Differential Equations (DE) model. A specific form for the recruitment rate is also proposed and a mechanistic model is developed. Data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai is used to train the DE model using deep learning and calibrate the mechanistic using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methods. The model is then used to project the attack and peak of new infections for the first wave in China after the dynamic-COVID policy adjustment. The results show an attack rate and peak of new infections of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, respectively, compared to homogeneous model projections of 99.97 and 32.78%. This represents an 18.6% improvement in accuracy based on actual data. Simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity in susceptibles decreases herd immunity by 37.36% of population and prolongs outbreak from 30 to 70 days, aligning with real cases.
Researchers have found that synapses in the brain exhibit high levels of noise, which is surprising given their high energy consumption. They propose that synapses use this noise to represent uncertainty about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. A mathematical framework was developed, where the synapse interacts with the soma of the postsyn neuron like an agent in an uncertain environment. This framework suggests synapses use an internal model of somatic membrane dynamics updated by a learning rule resembling LTP/LTD mechanisms. Synapses utilize noisy release to encode uncertainty of somatic potential. Each syn predicts somatic dynamics of postsyn neuron, but emergent dynamics of many synapses in a network resolve problems like classification and closed-loop control in dynamic environments. Synapses coordinate to represent and utilize uncertainties in network behaviorally ambiguous situations.
Researchers have developed a new method called Scup for reconstructing cell lineages using both bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. This approach addresses challenges associated with single-cell sequencing, such as allelic dropout and amplification errors, by incorporating them into the analysis. Scup calculates distances between cells and uses the neighbor-joining algorithm to reconstruct the lineage tree. The method is designed to be embarrassingly parallel, allowing it to perform faster than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy. Its robustness is demonstrated using synthetic and biological datasets of 18 cells.
In low-income settings, efficient allocation of limited resources can improve population health outcomes given the available healthcare system capacity. Efforts to achieve this are often framed through "health benefits packages" (HB), which establish services the public healthcare system should provide. Analytic approaches used to weigh evidence for interventions and inform the HB process have limitations. This study proposes the individual-based Thanzi Lae (LO) model, tailored for Malawi HB evaluation, addressing these limitations. By mechanistically modeling and calibrating country-specific data, disease incidence, health behavior, and system capacity to meet demand under resource constraints, health gains under plausible HB strategies were simulated. A linear optimisation (LA) achieved the largest health gain, ~8% reduction in disability life years (DALs) 202-204 compared to a benchmark, concentrating on high-impact treatments. However, this incurred excess DALs in initial years. Other prioritization approaches assessed included service based on patient characteristics, not type. Unlike LA, this approach achieved consistent gains relative to benchmark year-by-year and 5% reduction over period, suggesting patient-based might be beneficial.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms of meiotic chromosome pairing and segregation in the holocentric moth Plodia interpunctella and compared them to the silkworm moth Bomby mori, which diverged 100 million years ago. Using oligo DNA FISH, they found that both species initiate pairing at gene-rich chromosome ends and form rod-shaped bivalents at metaphase I. However, unlike Bomby, Plodia orients bivalents in multiple ways at metaph I. Kinetochores assemble at non-telomeric loci towards the chromosome center, regardless of bivalent position. Sister kinetochores are not paired, instead four distinct kinetochores are observed at metaph I. Clear microtubule attachments and lateral microtub attachments orient separated kincho. These findings challenge the classical view of paired pole-facing kinchores for accurate homolog separation in meiosis.
The median eminence (ME), located at the base of the hypothalamus, plays a crucial role in exchanging information between the brain and pituitary gland. Previous research has shown that mutations and duplications affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox result in hypopituitarism, likely originating from the hypothalamus. This study demonstrates that the absence of Sox3 predominantly affects ME phenotypes that occur in juvenile animals, despite embryonic onset of SOX expression. In the pituitary, hormone levels are reduced due to lack of endocrine maturation. Additionally, ME2-glia and oligodendrocy differentiation are affected. Treatment with low-dose aspirin, known to affect NG-glia, rescues proliferative defects and hypituitar in Sox mutants. The study highlights a central role of NG-glia in ME function during postnatal development, indicating sensitivity to extrinsic signals.
Researchers investigated the regulation of F-actin, a protein involved in morphogenesis, and its misregulation in diseases such as cancer. In C. elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis, GTPase CED-10/Rac was identified as an activator of F-act. However, the GEF that activates CED-10rac during embryonic cell migration was unknown. Two-component GEF CED-5/C-12 activates CED-10 to promote cell engulfment of dying cells during embryogenesis and larval migration. It was believed CED-5/C-12 promotes corpse and DTC migration by F-act formation. Contrary to expectation, C-5/C-12 supported embryonic migrations, but inhibited F-act in epidermis. To address this, C-12's GAP function was investigated. A GAP region in C- away from GEF catalytic region was found. Mutating R537 in GAP region altered epider cell function, not corpse function. Interfering with GEF by C's ability to bind Rac1/C- altered ventral enclosure and corpsement. Mutating S in C predicted to bind and stabilize Rac resulted in loss of ventral and corpse. Genetic studies support GAP acts on Gases. C-5/C- support cycling multiple Gases by distinct domains, promoting and inhibiting F-act nucleation.
Researchers investigated the hierarchical organization of temporal processing in the rodent visual system using information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis. They found that information and timescales of spiking activity increased along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreased. In contrast, intrinsic timescales of spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, but predictability was stimulus-dependent. A basic recurrent network model with correlated input reproduced these observations. The study suggests that the rodent visual system uses intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration in higher areas while reducing predictability for an efficient neural code.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications. However, the neural circuits engaged during TMS are poorly understood. To address this, researchers used epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of motor cortical macrocolumn and investigate mechanisms underlying response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves. An in-depth analysis identified important pathways and machine learning was used to identify common features among these pathways. Sensitivity analysis revealed neuron types that preferentially contributed to corticospinal waves, which could be predicted using average probability of connections between activated neurons and L pyramidal tract (PT) neurons. Conduction delay of shortest path to PT determined latency of corticinal wave. Multiple neuron activations modulated corticinal waves, supporting hypothesis that different pathways contribute with excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Activation of afferents to motor cortex and specific neuron types initiated I-waves, interpreted to propose origins of afferents giving rise to Iaves. Methodology provides workflow for sensitivity analysis on complex models relating to network structure, understanding response to acute stimulation.
Cell-free placental DNA (cfDNA) is present in the maternal circulation during gestation, offering a potential research and clinical tool to investigate the placental epigenome across gestation, previously requiring invasive placental sampling. cfDNA has been implemented in clinical non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) settings. However, the biology of cfDNA remains poorly understood, limiting research and clinical utility. This review examines current knowledge of cfDNA, including origins and molecular characteristics, highlighting gaps in knowledge and future directions.

cfDNA is released from the placenta into the maternal circulation through various mechanisms, including apoptosis, necrosis, and microvesiculation. cfDNA concentration increases with gestation, peaking at 20-24 weeks. cfDNA originates from the placenta, fetus, and maternal tissues, with paternal and maternal DNA present in maternal circulation. cfDNA is degraded, fragmented, and methylated, and carries epigenetic modifications.

cfDNA has been used in NIPT for aneuploidy screening, microdeletion syndromes, and sex chromosomal ane abnormalities. However, accuracy and sensitivity vary depending on gestational age and cfDNA concentration. cfDNA has also been used for fetal sex determination, RhD typing, and HLA typing. cfDNA has potential for monitoring fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, and other pregnancy complications.

Gaps in knowledge include understanding cfDNA origin, transport, metabolism, and degradation. The role of cfDNA in pregnancy complications, such as preeclamps and intrauterine growth restriction, is unclear. Further research is needed to elucidate cfDNA biology, improve NIPT accuracy, and clinical utility.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the shared risk factors among hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), including breast, endometrial, and prostate cancers. They found that risk variants clustered across these cancers, suggesting a common etiology. The study identified 44 multi-HDC regions across the genome, defined as overlapping risk regions for at least two HDCs, with two regions containing variants for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDC, and 28 for two HDC. Integrating data from genome-wide association studies, epigenomic profiling, and promoter Hi-C maps from diverse cell models, they annotated 53 candidate genes at multi-H risk regions. These targets were enriched with established cancer genes from the COSMIC Gene Census, but had previously unreported pleiotropic roles. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified as potential HDC targets and risk in several regions altered transcription motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known drug targets were overrepresented among candidate-H risk genes, implying some may serve as targets for development or repurposing existing treatments for HDC. The study provides a framework for identifying genes driving complex traits and understanding susceptibility.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the genetic cause of polymyositis in the Kiker dog breed. The study involved 33 cases and 106 controls, and identified a significant association with a region on chromosome 19 (p = 4.7*10^-10). Haplotype analysis revealed a 2.9 Mb region shared by cases in homozygous or heterozygous state. Next-generation sequencing of genomic DNA implicated a 39 kb deletion 10 kb upstream of interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The deletion frequency was 0.81 in cases and 0.25 in a random Kiker breed sample. Leukocytes from affected dogs homozy for the deletion overexpressed IL and IL upon mitogen stimulation. The study suggests elements 10 kb upstream of IL/IL play a role in regulation and deletion is a risk factor for polymyitis in Kiker. Estimated penetrance was 10-20 for homozyg and 0.5-2 for heterozygous.
Researchers have developed a novel protein language model, ESMm, to predict protein stability using a large-scale dataset of 528 natural and de novo sequences derived from 461 protein domains. The model can accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple mutations. ESM is trained on a dataset of 528 natural and de novo sequences from 461 protein domains. The model can be fine-tuned to predict folding. ESM performs reasonably well on small domains and generalizes to sequences distant from the training set. The model is compared to state-of-the-art methods in generalizing to larger protein scaffolds. The results highlight the need for large-scale stability measurements on a dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths observed in nature.
Inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) are a family of inhibitory receptors expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and late-differentiated T cells. Research suggests that KIR regulate T-cell immunity. A previous study found that T-cell control was enhanced by KIR in viral infections. The authors hypothesized that in autoimmunity, where T-cell response is detrimental, KIR would have an opposite effect. Type 1 diabetes (T1) was studied as a paradigm of autoimmunity. T1 variation in Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) genes explains up 50% of genetic risk, indicating T-cells major role in T1 etiopathogenesis. To investigate KIR effect on T response, HLA associations with K genes were examined. Immunogenetic analysis of case-control T1 dataset (N=11,961) found K genes, in presence of encoding ligands, consistent and significant effect on HLA class II genetic associations. Results were validated in independent set. KIR significantly decreased HLA II associations, suggesting K regulate CD4 T responses in T1.
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FE) is an age-related cause of vision loss and the most common expansion-mediated disease in humans characterised to date. Up to 80% of European FE cases have been attributed to expansion of non-coding CT repeat (CT18.1) within ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene T4. The nonoding nature of repeat and transcript complexity of T4 have made it challenging to decipher molecular mechanisms underlying disease. This study comprehensively describes CT18.1-driven molecular components in primary-derived corneal endothelial cells (ECs) from individuals with CT18-expanded (+) and CT18-independent (-) FE. Long-read, short, and transcript techniques interrogate expansion-specific biomarkers. Long sequencing and alternative splicing of short transcript data reveal global altered splicing in FE and transcripts with CT18-expans. Differential expression highlights transcript consequences FE within ECs. Exon usage, pathway, and transcript reveal T4 isoform skewing in FE with potential consequences. Exome data from FE cases identified rare and potentially deleterious T4 variants in, suggesting T4 independent of CT18 may increase FE risk. This study supports hypothesis that distinct mechanisms, RNA and T4 iso-specific dysregulation underpin pathophysiology FE.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LT) in rice (Oryza sativa) to improve direct seeding in cold climates. They identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) named qLT11 in the variety Arroz Terra, which exhibits rapid germination at lower temperatures using QTL-seq. The candidate region was narrowed down to a 52-kb interval containing the REGULATORY FACTOR14 (GFh) gene, expressed during germination. Arroz Terra's GFh allele encodes functional GFh, whereas Japanese variety Hitome has a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out GFh in a near-isogenic line (NIL) carrying Ar Terra's allele decreased LT, while overexpressing GFh in Hitome increased LT, indicating GFh is the causal gene behind q11. Analysis of numerous rice accessions revealed the functional GFh allele was lost in popular varieties during breeding. A near-isogenic line (NIL) was generated in Hitome background with 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz including GFh. The NIL showed superior LT to Hitome with comparable agronomic traits. The GFh allele from Ar Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Hepatitis B virus (HB) relaxed circular (rc) DNA possesses an 8-9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy (TR) on the negative strand derived from the reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). The structure and fate of TR during covalently circular (cc) DNA formation are unclear. A mutant HBV cell line HepDES182G was established with a C2G mutation in the pgRNA sequence, altering the 3 TR sequence of the strand while the 5 TR remained wild type. Production of HBrc and ccDNA in HepDES cells was comparable to wild-type levels. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis revealed the positive strand of rcDNA and both strands of cc predominantly carried the nt residue, indicating the 5 TR serves as template during rc replication forming a duplex with the strand, while the 3 forms a flap structure, removed during cc formation. A survey of cellular endonucleases using loss-of-function study found 3 endonuclease Mus plays a role in cc formation in wild-type HB replicating cells alongside 5 endonuc F1. Mus and F cleavage sites within TR of DPrc were mapped by NG analyses. Overlapping between Mus and F1 in cc formation indicates the putative 5 and 3 formed TR are dynamically on rc precursor.
Researchers developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale model (mmEM) to study the adaptation of microbial communities in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned pineapple factory. The model included three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO). The study found that as organic loading rates (OLR) increased, the community shifted from SO-domin to METomin, with a decline in FC performance. The mmEM accurately predicted microbial abundance at low OL and high OL. Simulations revealed SO growth constraints under high OL due to reduced sulfate-sulf cycling and acetate crossfeeding with SR. More metabolites from SR were diverted to MET, facilitating their dominance. Cross-feeding dynamics under OL enabled scenario-based simulations to explore acidity impact on SO growth and FC. The study highlights the role of crossfeeding in shaping community response to OL. The findings will inform FC implementation in industrial environments.
Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in medicine, particularly in prioritizing promising molecules for drug discovery. ML models predict properties of biological systems, and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates for downstream experimental validation. However, when applied to unseen situations, these models can be overconfident and produce numerous false positives. To address this issue, quantifying model uncertainty and providing a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) specified by researchers is proposed. CPEC, a framework for FDR-controlled biological discovery, is proposed. It integrates a deep learning model with conformal prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled predictions for a protein function. Conformal prediction provides statistical guarantees to the model, ensuring the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. CPEC is demonstrated using enzyme annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery of functions for less-characterized enzymes. Experiments show C achieves reliable F control, better or comparable performance at lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for underrepresented in training. CPEC is expected to be a tool for discovery where high yield in experiments is desired but budget is limited.
Researchers have identified hyperphosphorylated T-43 as a hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in most patients. Mutations in the TARDB gene, which codes for T-43, cause some familial ALS cases, indicating T-43 dysfunction drives disease. Aggregated, phosphorylated T-43 may contribute to disease phenotypes or be a protective response sequestering toxic protein. The heat shock chaper H90 interacts with T-43 and stabilizes its conformation, but its role in neurotoxicity is unknown. Using a C. elegans model of mutant T-43opathy, loss of H90 protects against T- neuroxicity and neurodegeneration. This is accompanied by decreased total and phosphorylated T-43. H90 also upregulates stress responsive heat pathway genes, including H70 and H16.1, and normal H16.1 levels are required for H90 effects on T43. The neuroprotective effect does not involve proteasome regulation. This study demonstrates H90 chaper activity contributes to outcomes in T- proteinopathies using a whole animal ALS model.
Researchers have limited understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and cellular identity in the arthropod female reproductive system due to a focus on model systems like Drosophila and Daphnia, which do not reflect the diversity of morphologies, reproductive modes, and sex systems. To address this, a single-nucleus RNA ATAC sequencing was used to create a comprehensive atlas of the adult Artemia francana female reproductive system. The data was mapped to the Cell single-nucle dataset of Drosila melanogaster ovary, revealing conserved programs between distantly related arthrop species. Major cell types in the Artemia ovary were identified, including germ cells, follicle cells, and muscle cells. Germ cells were used to explore gene regulation and expression of the chromosome during meiosis, highlighting unique dynamics and the presence of meiotic chromosome silencing in this group.
Chronic pain is a widespread and debilitating condition, costing the United States approximately $600 billion in 2010. A common symptom of chronic pain is allodynia, where non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with variable presentations across individuals. The mechanisms of allody are unclear, but hypothesized to be caused by dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This study analyzes physiologically-motivated subcircuit structures common in laminae-II of the dorsal horn, hypothesized to mediate two types of allody: static and dynamic. Neural rate models describe activity of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within subcircuits, accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions. Parameters defining subcirc are specified to yield typical behavior under normal conditions. Sensitivity analysis identifies mechanisms likely cause allody-producing dysregulation of subc's E signaling. Disruption of E balance occurs due to downregulation inhibitory signaling, releasing excitatory from inhibitory control, or upregulation excitatory responses, allowing excit to escape inhibitory control. Mechanisms, subc involved, and proportion subcirc exhibiting vary depending substructure. Results suggest diverse mechanisms responsible for allody, offering predictions for interindividual variability and targets for experimental studies underlying chronic symptom.
Protein homeostasis relies on the accurate translation and folding of newly synthesized proteins. Elongation factor 2 (EF2) promotes GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome during translation. Recent studies have shown that EF2 is dependent on heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and its cochaperones H1, C1, and C7. This study examined the requirement for Hsp and cochones more closely and found that Hsp and cochones have distinct roles in regulating EF function. Yeast expressing one group of Hsp mutations or group cochone mutations had reduced steady-state levels of EF2. Growth of Hsp mutants affecting EF accumulation was also negatively impacted by deletion of the gene H1. Mutations in yeast EF mimicking disease-associated mutations in human EF were impacted by loss of H1 and one was partially rescued by overexpression of H1. In contrast, yeast expressing different Hsp mutations or cochone had altered sensitivity to diphther toxin, dictated by post-translational modification of EF. Results provide evidence that H contributes to homeostasis not only by assisting folding but also enabling translation of newly synthesized proteins. Additionally, results show that yeast H mutants have distinct in vivo effects correlating with defects in cochones.
Researchers investigated how individuals with lesions in the insula or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, brain regions involved in decision-making, made choices in a gambling task with and after observing others' choices. Participants in both groups showed impaired utility-based computations for risky options when making decisions alone. However, when making socially situated decisions, they conformed to others' choices, independent of utility-based computations. This suggests that in social contexts, others' choices may serve as a decision heuristic when utility-based risk processing is disrupted.
Researchers have re-examined Richard Dawkins' iconic model of morphological evolution, known as biomorphs, to demonstrate the power of natural selection in generating order from random mutations. However, they found that biomorphs can also illustrate how developmental biases shape evolutionary outcomes. Specifically, biomorphs exhibit phenotypic bias, where certain phenotypes are orders of magnitude more likely to appear through mutations than others. This bias favors simpler phenotypes with low description complexity. An information-theoretic principle formalizes this bias, likening evolution to random search in an algorithm space. Population simulations show that moderately variable phenotypes appear more frequently through mutations at the expense of more adaptive biomorphs that are less frequent. This result and other patterns in biom structure, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolvability and robustness, resemble molecular-phenotype maps. An analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained genome sections explains these patterns. The study postulates that simplicity bias and other biom patterns share with molecular-phenotype maps may be widespread in developmental systems.
Researchers investigated human ability to intuitively tune into dynamic systems and excite resonant motions in nonlinear systems. Previous studies supported this sensitivity in linear systems, but validation in complex nonlinear scenarios was challenging due to unpredictable dynamics. However, many nonlinear systems exhibit periodic orbits similar to linear systems' eigenmodes, known as nonlinear modes (NM). A numerical tool was developed to compute NM in energy-conservative systems. This study used the tool to compare human motions in nonlinear systems with predicted NM. Participants interacted with a virtual double pendulum through a joystick, hitting targets aligned with or offset from NM. In all experiments, participants intuitively applied control to excite and stabilize orbits near NM. Even with increased accuracy and offset targets, participants succeeded by adjusting arm stiffness to align resonant motions. This study extends research on human resonance sensitivity to nonlinear systems, demonstrating capabilities to control and exploit resonant motions in dynamic interactions, including shaping through muscle stiffness changes.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, transcriptional regulation plays a crucial role in developmental processes necessary for survival, particularly during the transition from exponential to stationary phase. A group of transcription factors called transition state regulators (TSRs) control gene expression, influencing processes such as biofilm formation, motility, genetic competence, and sporulation. However, the extent of TSR influence on bacterial physiology is not fully understood. This study demonstrates that two TSRs, Sco and Abr, along with Mar-family factor PR, negatively regulate iron chelator pulchimin production in B. subtilis. Genetic analysis shows that all three factors are necessary to limit pulchimin production during exponential phase, affecting rate and total amount produced. Expression of pulerr biosynthesis gene yC is controlled by Sco, Abr, and PR, correlating with pulerr amount produced. In vitro data indicate direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production with Abr and PR. Regulation by two distinct systems highlights pulerr importance in B. subtilis physiology.
After spinal cord injuries (SCIs) can result in detrusor-sphinct dyssynergia (DSD) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of injury. SD is characterized by the loss of coordinated control between the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination, and urethral sphincter and pelvic muscles, which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit emptying. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced SD and inence. A mathematical model was developed to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after SCI, incorporating additional neurophysiological features to replicate improvements in bladder function with lumbar T of patients with SCI. A computational model of the neural circuit of mictition was created based on Hodgkin-Hux equations, replicating normal bladder function. Interneurons and network complexity were added to reproduce dysfunctional mictition after SCI, increasing density and complexity of interactions of inhibitory and excitatory lumbar interneurons responsive to T. The model reproduced re-emergence of spinal voiding after SCI. Effects of monophas and biphas T at frequencies below 10 Hz were investigated, replicating improved coordination between detor and urethral spher activity. Low-frequency T (1 Hz) normalized voiding after SCI, whereas high-frequency T (30) enhanced storage.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to estimate fungal growth rates from easily obtainable optical density (OD) data, specifically for Aspergillus fumatus, a filamentous fungus. Current methods rely on time-course morphology data, such as hyphal length, which is impractical for large-scale collection in clinical labs. The proposed model uses OD600 as an indirect measure, accounting for its relationship with true growth, eliminating the need for new calibration data. This approach outperformed reference models in fitting OD growth curves and resolved discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD versus directly measured data in uncalibrated models.
Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals and harbor diverse karyotypes, with most species having XY sex chromosomes, but X0 sex determination mechanisms also present in some groups. A whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confus, with a neo-sex chromosome, was generated, and eleven additional beetle genomes were used to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera. Ancestral linkage groups, termed Stevens elements, were identified, sharing conserved genes across beetles. The ancestral X chromosome was maintained across beet, but autosomes were independently added to the sex chromosomes. Neo-sex chromosomes evolved stereotypical properties of sex, including dosage compensation and non-random gene distribution with sex-biased expression. Beet provide a novel model to understand diverse driving sex evolution.
In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the histone variant H2A Z, encoded by the non-essential HT1 gene, plays a role in chromatin structure and DNA accessibility. H2 Z is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR-C complex, and has been implicated in transcription regulation. However, ht1 mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. The growth defects of ht1 mutants are alleviated by deletion of SW-C subunits, suggesting SW-C may cause deleterious activity when missing H Z substrate. H Z mutants display significant growth defects in genotoxic conditions, and may play a role in gene regulation under stress. To explore this, mRNA profiles were generated for wild-type, ht1, sw, and ht mutants before and after hydroxyurea (H) exposure, which induces DNA stress. Data showed H Z plays a role in activation during H exposure and is important for upregulation of H-induced genes. Apo-SW-C contributed to defects in ht, particularly in phosphate regulation. H Z incorporation before and after H treatment revealed decreases at transcription sites correlated with upregulation during exposure. This study characterized the effects of Z during transcriptional response H.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) data plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology. However, classifying transcriptomic profiles from scRNA experiments into cell types and identifying individual cell lineages is challenging due to the accumulation of datasets and high dimensionality. To address this, automated classification methods are needed. Classical approaches rely on supervised learning, but obtaining annotated single-cell data is difficult. A partial learning framework is proposed, assuming a set of candidate labels for each data point, simpler than fully supervised. State-of-the-art multi-class methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype, and logistic regression, are extended to partial learning. The effect of label structure on methods is also studied, focusing on hierarchical labels in developmental processes. Simulated and real datasets show extensions enable learning from partially labeled data with high accuracy, particularly prototype-based methods. Performance with partially annotated data reaches fully supervised. Uncertainty in partially annotated data is studied, and its effect on accuracy derived. Findings demonstrate hierarchical and non-hierarchical label strategies solve single-cell classification, relying less annotated data than supervised.
Researchers investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) in the formation of nuclear compartments such as speckles, nucleoli, and lipid droplets, and its involvement in RNA polymerase II transcription. They found that PIP localization is dependent on RNA and explored whether it cooperates with RNA in establishing nuclear architecture. Using mass spectrometry, they identified the RNA-dependent PIP-associated (RD) proteome in human cells, revealing intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) with basic PIP-binding motifs are prevalent in RD proteins. These IDRs are enriched with phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. Bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) associates with PIP via electrostatic interactions in an RNA-dependent manner, and altered PIP levels affect BR4 foci number. The study proposes PIP orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RD proteins, affecting their ability to form foci via phase separation, suggesting a pivotal role in establishing functional nuclear architecture for gene expression.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, specifically the Scarabae clade, known for their diverse and nutrition-responsive development of cephalic horns. They generated chromosome-level genome assemblies for three Onthagini tribe species (Onophagus taurus, O. sagarius, and Digitophagusella) and compared them to seven other Coleoptera species, identifying changes in coding sequences associated with metabolic regulation and metamorphosis. Chromatin accessibility in developing horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females revealed distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition and sex-responsive development, including recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn determination. Binding of known and candidate transcription factors were enriched in nutrition-open chromatin regions. The study highlights the importance of chromatin regulation in mediating development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrating gene networks highly responsive to environmental and genetic signals.
Researchers investigated the pathogenesis of Lassa fever using a cynomolgus monkey model of Lassa virus (LAS) infection, aiming to understand the mechanisms that determine whether acute infection leads to controlled illness or death. Histological and transcriptomic studies were conducted to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and immune mechanisms associated with survival or death. Lymphoid organs were found to be a major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever, with LAS entering the cortical sinus of lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, subsequent viral tropism varied with disease severity, with limited dissemination to lymphoid organs and immune cells in non-fatal Lassa fever. In contrast, systemic dissemination of LAS to all organs and diverse cell types, leading to infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils and excessive inflammatory response, was associated with fatal outcome.
Research has identified disruptions in nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) as a common feature in various neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal temporal dementia and temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the role of these disruptions as a primary cause or consequence of disease is unclear. This study investigates the causal role of Import-β nuclear transport defects in disease onset using novel mouse models of neurodegeneration (Nemf86 and NemRg) that recapitulate cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. Results show Import- specific nuclear block, cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of proteins implicated in ALS/FT and AD/AD pathogenesis, including TDP, Importβ, Ran1, and Ran. Interaction between Importβ and mutant Nf86 protein in cytoplasm accumulations is observed. Transcriptional dysregulation in key neurogenerative disease genes is identified. Pharmaceutical inhibition of Importβ in mouse and human neuronal non-neuronal cells induces proteinopathies and transcription alterations seen in mouse models. Convergent results between mouse and human cellular biology provide evidence that mislocalized proteins and transcriptional events in neurogenerative diseases may arise from primary Importβ import defect. This has implications for investigating sporadic neurogener forms from genetic and environmental perturbations in Importβ function.
Bacteriophages have significant potential in medical and biotechnological applications, necessitating a thorough understanding of phage infection mechanisms. CRISPR-Cas offer a means to explore these mechanisms through site-specific phage mutagenesis. However, phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage through extensive DNA modifications like cytosine glycosylation, hindering mutagen efficiency. Our study utilizes the eukary enzyme NgET to temporarily reduce phage DNA modifications, facilitating Cas nuclease cleavage and enhancing mutagen efficiency. This enables precise targeting and seamless mutation, exemplified by deactivating ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. Temporarily removing modifications elucidated the effects of these on T4 phage infections without gene deletions. Our results present a strategy for investigating phage epigen functions and streamlining phages with cytosine modifications. Temporal modulation of the phage epigen is valuable for synthetic biology and fundamental comprehension of ph infection through mutant generation.
The genome of living cells is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication. Multiple mechanisms work together to ensure DNA repair, gene expression, and genome stability. Bulky DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV or DNA-damaging agents like 4-nitroquinoline, act as transcription and replicational roadblocks, posing a threat to cell metabolism. When located on the transcribed strand of genes, these lesions are handled by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCER), a poorly understood NER pathway. A genetic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified histone variant H2 as crucial for safeguarding transcription and DNA integrity following UV irradiation. In the absence of H2, repair by TCER is severely impaired and RNA polymerase II clearance is reduced, leading to increased double-strand breaks. H2 is necessary for proficient TCER and plays a role in maintaining genome stability upon irradiation.
Researchers investigated the impact of genetic variation on the evolution of regulatory architecture in closely related tissues during population divergence in Drosophila melanogaster. They analyzed gene expression and microbiome in the midgut, hindgut, and Malighian tub as well as microbiome in two tissues in four strains and their F1 hybrids from divergent populations: one from European and one African range. Results showed tissue and genetic-specific effects, with genetic background effects on overall tissue specificity. Tissue-specific effects were stronger than genetic-specific, with gut tissues more similar to each other than Malighian tubules. Examination of allele expression revealed cis and trans effects more tissue-specific in differentially expressed between populations than conserved genes, with trans effects more-specific than cis. Despite variable regulatory architecture, this was observed across tissues and backgrounds, suggesting trans variation can be fine-tuned as well as cis during population divergence. The study provides insights into cis and trans evolution.
Researchers have developed a new approach to estimate the timing of the emergence of emerging diseases, such as COVID-19, by analyzing early reported cases rather than genomic data. They used a stochastic population dynamics model to estimate the delay between the first infection and the nth case, and validated it on simulated data. The model was then applied to Alpha variant infections in the UK, estimating the first infection date as August 21, 2020 (95% interquartile range: July 23-September 5, 2020). The model was also applied to COVID-19 cases with symptom onset before January 2020, estimating the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan as November 28, 2019 (95% interquart range: November 2-December 9, 201). The results align with previous studies using genomic data. The model is flexible and can be applied to other outbreaks.
During meiosis, the pairing of homologous chromosomes (homologs) is essential for the formation of haploid gametes from diploid precursor cells, a prerequisite for sexual reproduction. Pairing during meiotic prophase I facilitates recombination and segregation of homologs during the subsequent reduction division. Mechanisms ensuring stable homolog alignment in the presence of non-homologous chromosomes have been elusive, but rapid movements appear to play a role in the process. Apart from homolog attraction, provided by intermediates of homolog recombination, dissociation of nonomous associations also contributes to homolog pairing, suggested by detection of stable nonom chromosome associations in pairing-defective mutants. An agent-based model for homolog pairing was developed from dynamics of naturally occurring chromosome ensemble. The model simulates unidirectional chromosome movements as well as collision determined by attractive and repulsive forces from close-range interactions. Chromosome number and size as well as movement and repulsive forces identified as factors in kinetics of homous pairing in addition to hom attraction. Dissociation interactions between nonom chromosomes contribute by crowding hom into limited area creating conditions for close hom attraction. Incorporating chromosome lengths, model accurately recapitulates efficiency and kinetics hom observed wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast and adaptable to dimensions and sets other organisms.
Li-Fumi syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. MicroRNA-34 (miR-34) is a target of the p53 gene and acts as a modifier. In mice lacking mi-34 exhibit normal p53 responses and no cancer development, but mi-34 deficiency promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-prone backgrounds. mi-34 genes are highly conserved between zebraf and humans. Zebraf mi-34 and mi-34/c have similar expression patterns during development, but mi-34 is more abundant. DNA damage by camptecin leads to p53 induction of mi-34 genes, while mi-34 mutants are viable and have normal damage-induced apoptosis. However, mi-34- mutants with gain-of-function tp53R217/217 or tp- mutants are more cancer-prone than tp mutants alone, confirming mi-34's tumor-suppressive function. Transcriptomic analysis at 28 hours post-fertilization (h) identified damage-induced genes, and at 8, 28, and 72h determined mi-34-regulated genes. At 72h, loss mi-34 enhances erythrocyte levels and upregulates my-positive hematopoietic stem. Overexpression mi-34 suppresses reporter, not p53 induction and sensitizes embryos to camptec but not γ-irradiation.
In the nematode C. elegans, sex determination is controlled by the master regulator OL-1 during embryogenesis. The expression of OL-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between XX hermaphrodites and males. In males, OL-1 is highly expressed, while in hermrodites OL-1 is expressed at low levels. OL-1 activity is critical for proper C. elegans male development, but its low expression was thought to be minimal in hermrodite development. This study reveals OL-1 plays a role in regulating developmental timing in hermrodogenesis. Using imaging and bioinformatics, hermrod embryos have accelerated cell division rate and advanced transcriptional program when OL-1 is lost. Further analysis shows OL- regulates X chromosome dosage compensation initiation and sex-based transcription in hermrod. OL-1 mutant embryos overexpress H3 methyltransferase MET-2, altering H3me landscape. Loss of MET-2 reverses some OL- effects. These findings demonstrate OL- regulates development in both sexes and MET- as OL effector in hermrod.
Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly important as genetics-based control strategies move from laboratory to field testing. Gene drive projects, in particular, require monitoring for unintended spread beyond field sites and emergence of alternative alleles, such as resistant or non-functional genes, within sites. This necessitates efficient distribution of traps to detect alleles of interest as quickly as possible, ideally before remediation. Insecticide-based tools, like bed nets, are compromised by resistance alleles, also requiring quick detection. To address this, a computational framework, Mosquito Gene Surveillance (MGS), optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance, minimizing time to detect alleles. MGS accounts for biological features of mosquitoes and landscapes: resources (e.g., food, breeding sites) distributed, mosquito movement (sex, gonotrophic state, resource), and trap attractiveness. Example analyses demonstrate optimal placement for Aedes aegyti in Queensland, Australia and Anopheles gambia on São Tomé Tomé Principe. MGS is a resource for field and computational researchers in mosquito surveillance.
Researchers studied the microorganism Symbonas scillans, a 1.4 μm heterotrophic eukaryote, to investigate the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum. Initially, the genus was named based on the presence of endosymb bacteria, but their identity and functional association with the host were unknown. Using amplification-free metagenomics and whole genome sequencing, they analyzed S. scill strains RCC257 and RCC24, but found no sequences from known endosymb bacteria. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis confirmed the absence of endobacteria. Instead, contigs from both strains were related to prasiniruses infecting green algae Ostreoccus lucarin, Bathoccus prinos, and Micromonas pus. Using the prirus genome as reference, they assembled a near-complete 190bp genome encoding hallmark prirus genes and two related viruses from RCC257 and three from RCC. A multi-gene tree showed the viruses branched with prirus, OlVs, and MpVs. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar to the endos originally reported in S. scill. The study concludes that S scill does not harbor an endymb bacterium but is associated with viruses.
Leiomodin (L) family actin-binding proteins play a crucial role in muscle function, as evidenced by the fact that mutations in three family members (MOD1-3) result in human myopathies. Mutations in the predominant isoform MOD2 lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations in the MOD gene are nonsense or frameshift, predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of disease, little to no MOD protein is expressed. This study investigated the mechanism underlying loss of mutant protein expression in two MOD2 disease-causing mutations. Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, a cellular process eliminating mRNAs with premature codons, was found to be responsible for loss of mutant protein. Steric-blocking oligonucleotides were generated to obstruct the exon complex, preventing nonsense-mediated decay of MOD2 transcripts, thereby restoring mutant expression. This study lays groundwork for potential intervention in MOD-linked myopathies.
Researchers investigated how different forms of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) influence the risk of Alzheimer's disease by examining changes in protein homeostasis in mice expressing human APO gene isoforms 2, 3, or 4. They measured protein turnover and abundance to identify 484 proteins with APO isoform-dependent changes in homeostatic regulation. In the brain, APO4 and A2 altered regulation of mitochondrial proteins compared to wild-type APO3. APO4 disrupted cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins, suggesting dysregulation of proteome and autophagy, reducing protein quality. A2 increased degradation of mitochondrial and membrane proteins, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, indicating coordinated replacement of the organelle. In contrast, the liver did not show these changes, suggesting APO effect on proteasis is amplified in brain relative to other tissues. The study highlights the utility of combining abundance and turnover to decipher proteome mechanisms and their role in biology.
Researchers have developed a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis (CRPRTRM) toolkit to knock out genes in specific tissues, including motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells in Drosophila, a powerful model organism for studying gene function during development. They validated the efficacy of CRTRM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue, demonstrating its compatibility with the Gal/UAS expression system and simultaneous knockout of redundant genes. CRTRM was used to reveal an essential role of SNARE components in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) maintenance. The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) pathway was found to suppress NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde G signaling. Additionally, axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESC-mediated intra-axonal trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ. The CRTRM approach was used to discover genes important for NM structural plasticity.
During the larval stages of Drosophila development, the lymph gland progenitors accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the blood-forming organ, which is essential for their differentiation. ROS triggers the activation of the JNK pathway, leading to upregulation of fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and progenitor differentiation. However, despite the presence of ROS, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in late larval stages. Using expression analysis, genetic, and pharmacological approaches, it was found that the Drosila NF-κ transcription factor Rel shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that induces differentiation by curtailing JNK activation. ROS serves as a metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, but its input is monitored by developmental TAK, regulated by Rel. This developmental circuit ensures the stock of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted. The study reveals how NFκ-like factors integrate with metabolic pathways to regulate cell fate during development.
Tay-Linder syndrome (TALS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, abnormal gyral pattern, severe growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNUATAC gene. A patient presenting with TALS features was investigated, but no pathogenic variants were found in RNUAC. Instead, a homozygous RTTN c.295G>A variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing. The impact of the variant on RTTN function was deciphered in RTTN-depleted RPE cells and patient fibroblasts, revealing cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities, aneuploidy, cycle arrest, and cell death. Neural stem cells (NS) derived from CRISPR/C9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells exhibited similar defects. Cortical organoids showed an additional function of RT in self-organisation of NS into neural roset, delayed apical polarization of NS. These defects contributed to delayed roset formation in RT-mutated organoids, impeding growth.
Escherichia coli, a non-sporulating bacterial species, can survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion by entering a state called long-term stationary phase (LT). Researchers conducted a set of experiments to characterize the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under LT. Populations of E. coli were grown on rich media, then deprived of external resources. Whole-genome sequencing of hundreds of clones at 12 time points over six years revealed novel aspects of adaptation. E coli adapts genetically up to six years under exhaustion through convergent accumulation of mutations. Upon entry into LT, long-lasting lineages are established, convergent with similar lineages across populations. Parallel adaptations occur under LT, combined with LT lineage structure enable screening for loci with significant mutation associations, suggestive of historical contingency. Associations are frequent, with third of convergent loci involved in at least one. Results demonstrate LT adaptation characterized by high parallelism and frequent contingency.
Researchers have reevaluated the classification of the male-specific abdominal (MSA) RNA from Drosophila melanogaster, previously thought to be a non-coding RNA, and found it codes for a micropeptide involved in determining mated females' sperm usage after mating. The MS transcript is a male-specific version of another transcript, iab-8 lRNA, produced in both sexes in the central nervous system from an alternative promoter. However, while MS produces a peptide, i-8 does not. Investigation revealed the absence of i-8 translation is due to a repressive mechanism involving unique 5' exons of i- lRNA. Cell and transgenic analysis showed this mechanism relies on upstream open reading frames in these exons preventing protein production from downstream reading frames.
Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are a group of diseases caused by mutations in glycosylation pathways, including N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, and GPI synthesis. These disorders typically present with seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delay, but exhibit large clinical variability affecting multiple body systems. The variability in symptoms suggests that modifier genes may influence phenotypes. Due to similar physiology and clinical symptoms, there are likely common genetic modifiers between CDG. This study uses evolutionary analysis to identify common modifiers between CDG glycosylation genes. Glycosylation is evolutionarily conserved from yeast to mammals. Evolutionary covariation (ERC) identifies proteins with similar evolutionary rates indicating shared functions and pathways. ERC identified strong signatures between proteins in same and different glyylation pathways. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing ERC with GPI synthesis revealed signatures with ncRNA modification and DNA repair proteins. Patterns of ERC based on cellular localization of GPI synthesis enzymes were also identified. Functional testing of top candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel modifiers of CDG genes. ERC of disease and biological pathways allows prioritization of potential modifiers, providing understanding disease pathophysiology and novel targets.
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein, HBc, has two distinct domains: the N-terminal domain (NTD) for capsid assembly and the arginine-rich C-terminal (CTD) for pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the HBCTD, specifically at Ser162 and Ser170, is crucial for nucleation with the polymerase (Pol) to initiate pg encapsation. As caps mature, HBCT undergoes deosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late encapsation stage. Using a C170-specific antibody, a transition from phosphorylated to deosphorylated HB-S170 was observed during pg packaging. Pol-dependent deosphory of HB-S170 was confirmed by substituting one amino acid Val782 in thease domain, which abolished deory of HB-S170. Immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry and protein analyses showed recruitment of the phosphatase PP1 is dependent on Pol-Val domain. This recruitment does not require HB but via RNA signal, suggesting Pol-pRNA plays a role in PP recruitment. Pol-pRNA-PP-mediated deory of HB-S170 is essential for pg encapsation and associated with endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVs). HB may play a dual role by bringing pg to phosphorylated HB and recruiting PP for completion of packaging into caps.
Researchers investigated the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to environmental change, using the closure of the Isthmus of Panama as a natural experiment. They sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbivalves from the genera Codak and Cten, collected on either side of the isthmus. The results showed that the lucid sister species hosted Candidatus Thiazropha symbts, with those from the Caribbean having genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the Tropical Pacific did not. Nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbion phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of nifDK operon revealed the common ancestor lacked n genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats acquired through horizontal gene transfer from Sedimentola lineage. The study suggests HGT facilitated diversification of globally distributed Ca Thiazpha species.
Taste2 receptors (TASRs) are a family of G-protein-coupled receptors that function as bitter taste receptors in vertebrates. Mammalian TASRs have been extensively studied, providing insights into their roles in taste perception and human physiology. However, the evolution and function of TASRs in other vertebrate lineages have been less explored. This study identifies 9,291 TASRs from 661 vertebrate genomes. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that frogs and salamanders have unusually high TASR content compared to other vertebrates. Most TASRs are found in clusters, with amphibians having more clusters and genes per cluster than other vertebrates. TASRs have one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, but total TASR count is stable across lineages. TASR count correlates with expression in extra-oral tissues. In vitro assays, many amphibian TASRs function as tissue-specific chemosensors detecting ecologically important xenobiotics.
Researchers have identified a protein complex composed of NICD, RBP, and MAML that binds to DNA as a monomer or dimer to regulate Notch transcription. Mice expressing Notch dimer-deficient (NDD) alleles of Notch1 and Notch2 are sensitive to environmental insults but develop normally. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids revealed no dimer-dependent gene regulation, impaired stem cell maintenance in vitro, and an epithelial immune response signature likely causing heightened sensitivity in NDD mice. 

Quantitative MS/MS analysis in human carcinoma cells expressing NOT2 or NOT2 showed an unbalanced interactome, reduced NOT2 interaction with transcription machinery, but preserved interaction with HD2, suggesting modulation via cooperativity. HD2 activity may contribute to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes, as HD inhibitor valpro acid (PA) prevented intestinal consequences of DD and gamma-secretase inhibitors (DB or DAPT) treatment in spheroids, suggesting synergy between HD activity and differentiation in intestinal stem cells.
Background selection by deleterious alleles reduces genetic diversity at linked sites, influencing total diversity (π) and genetic differentiation (F) in populations. The theory of background selection can be categorized into two regimes: the background regime with strong selection and low mutation rates, where deleterious alleles are at mutation-selection balance, and the interference regime with weak selection and high mutation rates, where deleter alleles accumulate and interfere. Previous studies have quantified background effects on π and F for deleterious alleles in the background regime. However, evidence suggests migration reduces background effects on F, which has not been fully explained. This study derives novel theory predicting effects of migration on background in subpopulations and extends interference regime to island model. Simulations show this theory predicts F and π. Additionally, background may increase F under high migration due to correlated fitness effects within subpopulations. However, background reduces π, particularly in metapopulations with large effective size. This work extends background theory into structured populations, suggesting background confounds locus-locus F scans.
Researchers emphasize the importance of increasing genetic and phenotypic data size for understanding disease determinants, but highlight methodological barriers to collaboration and data sharing among institutions, particularly with heterogeneous sample sizes requiring complex statistical approaches like generalized linear mixed models to correct for confounders. Additionally, privacy concerns around Protected Health Information (PHI) due to regulations like HIPAA limit data sharing, hindering high-powered studies. Federated approaches address these issues by keeping data local, enabling collaboration. To address these challenges, the authors developed FedGAT, a federated genetic testing tool using federated statistical approach for association tests correcting confounding and polygenic effects among sites. Data remains local, statistics encrypted. Using simulated and real datasets, FedAT achieves similar results to pooled analysis under privacy-preserving framework with practical requirements.
Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with ancestry-based incidence and mortality, and polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown promise in predicting disease risk, including prostate cancer. However, their accuracy continues to improve, research aimed at enhancing their effectiveness in African and Asian populations is crucial for equitable use. Recent algorithm developments for PRS derivation have led to improved pan-ancestral risk prediction for several diseases. This study benchmarks the predictive power of six widely used PRS algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts. The results show modest improvement in discriminatory ability compared to a method prioritizing variants, clumping, and polygenic scores. The study highlights the importance of refining risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts.
Researchers have identified a congenital disorder of glycosylation (CD) known as DPAG1CD, caused by mutations in the DP1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-glycosylation. A Drosophila melanogaster model of DP1CD exhibits an improperly developed, small eye phenotype. A drug repurposing screen of 1,520 FDA/EMA-approved small molecules identified 42 candidates that improved the DP1CD model. Notably, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DP1CD model. Loss of dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model, suggesting dopamine flux and binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DP1 deficiency. This links dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation as a potential therapeutic target for DP1CD. Genetic validation of other drug categories, including acetylcholine, COX, and NK1 inhibitors, revealed novel biology of DP1 mechanisms and potential therapeutic options for DP1CD.
Researchers investigated the representation of limb pose in the somatosensory cortex using a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topo-VA). The model was trained on a large dataset of natural movement data and reproduced two key observations from monkey center-out reaching experiments: the shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive fields in hand-centered coordinates without knowledge of arm or hand kinematics, and the distribution of preferred directions (PDs) from multi-electrode arrays. The model made several predictions: encoding across the cortex has a blob-pinwheel geometry of PDs and few neurons encode a single joint. This work provides a principled understanding of sensorimotor representations and theoretical basis for neural manifolds with applications to restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and control of humanoid robots.
Researchers have investigated the role of ethylene, a plant hormone involved in growth and stress responses, in plant-micro interactions from the plant perspective. However, the role of ethylene in microbes has been understudied. This study demonstrates that Azospirillum brasilense, a bacterium, contains a functional ethylene receptor called Azospirillum Ethylene1 (AE1), similar to those found in plants. AE1 binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant surfaces. RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics reveal widespread metabolic changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, including accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate.
The study investigated the role of the IN80 protein, the catalytic subunit of the IN80 chromatin remodeling complex, in regulating gene expression on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. Immunolocalization of IN80 at the XY body in pachene spermatocytes suggested its involvement in the meiotic body. Deletion of IN80 led to increased expression of sex-linked genes, while active RNA polymerase II on sex chromosomes in IN80-null pachene spermatocytes indicated incomplete inactivation of sex genes. Reduced recruitment of meiotic sex chromosome inhibitors (MSCI) suggested IN80-facilitated recruitment of DNA repair factors for sex gene silencing. This IN80 role was independent of common target H2A. Instead, IN80 absence reduced chromatin accessibility at DNA sites on sex chromosomes. Data indicate IN80 role in DNA factor localization, facilitating sex gene silencing during pachema.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the axon regeneration pathway is activated by SVH-1, a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasmin family. SV-1 has a dual function, acting as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and a protease to regulate development. The conversion of SV-1 from protease to growth factor for axon regeneration is crucial. This study investigates the role of cytidine deaminase (CDD) in the conversion of SV-1. CDD-2 is found to be involved in the conversion of SV-1. A codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad of SV-1 suppresses CDD-2 defect in axon regeneration. The hairpin structure around His-755 in sv-1 mRNA is required for activation of axon regeneration by SV-1. These findings suggest C-2 promotes regeneration by transforming SV-1 function from protease to growth through modification of sv-1 mRNA.
Researchers have used zebraf as a model organism to study collective behavior and its relation to physical and mental state, disease, genetics, and drug effects. Macroscopic phenomena can be represented by active matter models, where individuals are abstracted as self-propelling agents with parameters reminiscent of physical systems. In some cases, systems can be controlled at individual level, such as colloidal interactions or enzymatic protein behavior. However, collective behavior is typically influenced by environmental factors and cannot be changed. This study genetically modified zraf to control collective behavior at constituent level, rather than externally. The effect of lack of col11a gene in zraf, causing early onset osteoarthritis, was probed. Cola-/-raf exhibited compromised vertebral properties, bent bodies, and slower swimming, longer orientation changes. A group of 25 mutants showed more orderly motion than wildtype. Collective behavior of wild and cola/-raf captured by simple active matter model, self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise. This demonstrates possibility of tuning biological system, changing state with simple model.
Researchers have developed a hybrid model to simulate short-term in vitro capillary cultivation, a crucial for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The model combines the Cellular Potts model to predict cell migration, morphology, and continuum mechanics to quantify bioelastic deformation and VEGF dynamics. The model bridges mechanical and chemical stimulation, showing good agreement between predicted topology and experimental results, with elongated cells forming networks and cobblestone aggregates. Capillary networks develop in integrity when mechanical and chemical couplings work together, with morphology driven by soluble and bound VEG, respectively.
The Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) family of secreted peptides play crucial roles in cell, tissue patterning, and organism homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. In the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans, five TGFβ ligands have been identified, allowing for the study of ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates. These ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF/Activin subfamilies signaling through discrete pathways. In C. elegans, the BMP ligand DB-1 has been studied for its role in innate response. This study shows all five Tβ ligands play a role in survival against bacterial pathogens, with multiple Tβ ligands acting redundantly in this response. BMP-like ligands DB-1 and T-2 function independently, while T-2/B and T/Activin-like T-3 function together. Structural modeling suggests T-2 and T-3 form heteromers. T-2 and T-3 lack conserved cysteine for disulfide linking dimers. DB-1/BMP receptor and Smad transduce in response to pathogens, while D- T/Activ components do not play a major role. These results demonstrate BMP and T/Activ subfamilies interact, providing a mechanism for distinguishing developmental and homeostatic functions from acute responses like innate immunity to pathogens.
Researchers have investigated the role of the epigenetic enzyme N-terminal acetylase 4 (Nat4) in the DNA damage response (DDR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nat4 is known to acetylate the alpha-amino group of serine on histones H4 and H2. Yeast cells lacking Nat exhibit increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than wild-type cells. Upon DNA damage, Nat4 expression is elevated and the enzyme is recruited to double-strand breaks. The study found that Nat-deleted cells have lower levels of damage-induced H2AX phosphorylation (γH2) and reduced binding of checkpoint protein Rad9 to double-strand breaks. Additionally, Mec1 kinase recruitment to double-strand breaks, critical for HAX phosphorylation and Rad9 retention, is impaired in Nat4 cells. Consequently, Mec-dependent phosphorylation of downstream kinase Rad53, indicative of damage activation, is reduced. The effects of Nat in the damage cascade are mediated by its-terminal acetylase activity towards histone H4. This study establishes a novel link between histone-terminal acetylase Nat and DDR, implicating histone modification in genome integrity maintenance.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Orchard to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer cells within a tumor, known as a phylogeny, using genetic mutations detected through DNA sequencing. Current methods for reconstructing phylogenies become inaccurate with more than 30 mutations or fail to recover the phylogeny altogether. Orchard uses a novel approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogen, where each factor corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a built phyeny. It optimizes each factor sequentially, generating incrementally larger phylogenies to a complete tree with all mutations. Evaluations show Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing plausible phylogen across 90 cancers and 14 B-progen acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALL). Orchard accurately reconstructs phylogen up to 1,000 mutations. Large and accurate phylogen reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying somatic mutations and genetic variations among cancer subpopulations.
Researchers have developed Immugen, a modular language model for predicting immunogenicity of CD8+ reactive epitopes. Immunogenic epitopes are challenging to predict due to low reactivity rates and limited training datasets. Immugen consists of a pMHC encoding module trained on pMHC prediction tasks, an optional TCR encoding, and context-specific immunogenic prediction modules. Compared to state-of-the-art models, Immugen performs comparably on pM binding, eluted ligand prediction, and stability tasks. On pHC immunogenic prediction, Immugen outperforms all models with an Area under the receiver operating characteristic of 0.619 and average precision of 0.514, a 7% increase over the next best model. Immugen's performance improves with TCR integration. The model's performance is analyzed for interpretability, highlighting areas of weakness in existing models and biases in public datasets.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and whole-genome sequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feather chickens to identify genes related to meat color, specifically lightness and redness. A 6.24 QTL (quantitative trait locus) region on chromosome 15 (GGA: 629.34-630.58 kb) was mapped, and protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PPP1) was associated with color (p=8.65E-08). Mendelian randomization analysis validated the causal relationship between PPP1 expression and lightness (p<2.9E-12). Skeletal muscle-specific PPP1 knockout mice showed increased lightness, decreased myoglobin, and myofiber shift from slow-twitch to fastwitch. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed PPP inhibition decreased slow-twitch myofiber and myof-type genes and enhanced glycolysis. A plasm reporter assay showed a SNP (rs520, C>T) in PPP intron regulated transcription. Differences in meat phenotypes, myoglobin, rs520 variant, PPP expression, and fastwitch marker were detected between fast-growing and local chickens.
Researchers have discovered that retinal ganglion cells play a crucial role in various computations performed by the retina due to their nonlinear integration of signals from bipolar cells, forming functional subunits within their receptive field. These subunits can be inferred from ganglion cell activity, offering a new avenue for studying the retina's architecture. To efficiently leverage this knowledge, a new method was developed combining super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography, called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR). This technique allows for precise location of receptive subunits. Simulations showed STR can identify subunits across various variations, and experiments on primate ganglion cells validated its feasibility. STR can reveal subunit layouts in a few minutes, making it suitable for online and closed-loop investigations of retina recordings.
Researchers have developed a novel application of CRISPR (CRIS) technology to identify genetic interactions between chemicals and genes (CGIs) that occur when exposed to antibiotics, providing insights into drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance. The goal is to identify CRIS mutants whose abundance is suppressed or enriched in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted, indicating synergistic behavior. Single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) for a target can induce varying protein depletion and growth rate effects. The effect of sgRNA can be partially predicted by sequence features, but actual growth depends on cell sensitivity to target depletion. Essential genes' sgRNA efficiency is measured by quantifying growth rate effects. Efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs. sgRNA interacts non-linearly with drug sensitivity, producing an effect where concentration is maximized for intermediate sgRNAs and less for those inducing too much or little target depletion. A statistical method, CRPRDR (Dose-Response), incorporates sgRNA and drug concentrations in a dose-response equation to capture this interaction. CRPRDR was applied to a Mycobacterium tuberculosis data to identify interacting genes with antibiotics. This approach can be generalized to non-CG datasets, demonstrated with a CRPR dataset for E. coli on different carbon sources. CRPRDR performance is competitive with related methods, but noisier datasets generate more interactions, likely false positives, whereas CRDR maintains precision in empirical and simulated data.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to identify communities in gene-expression networks without assuming they are organized in assortative modules. Traditional methods expect genes to be grouped together based on similarity, but this assumption may overlook alternative organizations. The Weighted Stochastic Block Model (SB) is a community detection method that doesn't assume modules exist a priori, instead, it separates genes into hierarchically organized blocks using all co-expression information. Using RNA-seq data from Drosophila melanogaster tissues, SB found 10 times more groups than competing methods, some of which aren't modular. Non-modular groups are as functionally enriched as modular ones. This suggests the transcriptome is more complex than thought, challenging the assumption modularity drives gene-expression structuring.
Researchers investigated the role of cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) in yeast, a protein involved in post-transcriptional control, including translation initiation, termination, and mRNA decay. To understand its direct and indirect roles, they used mass spectrometry to assess the proteome abundance and RNASeq and RiboSeq to analyze transcript and translation changes in cells lacking the PAB gene. Results show PabΔ cells have drastic changes in proteome and transcriptome, and defects in translation initiation and termination. Defects in initiation and stabilization of specific mRNAs in Pab cells are partly due to reduced levels of initiation factors, decapping activators, and deadenylation complex components, in addition to P1's direct role. Cells without P1 have nonsense codon readthrough indicative of termination defect. Overall, loss of P1 is pleiotropic and disruptive to post-transcription regulation.
Researchers investigated the generation of slow brain rhythms, such as those occurring during slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures, and spreading depolarization, which are accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration. These rhythms typically have a lower frequency than action potential firing and are thought to arise from network mechanisms involving synaptic interactions, delays, or intrinsic bursting neurons. A new mechanism is proposed, applicable to all neurons with class I excitability, based on the interplay between fast-spiking voltage dynamics and slow extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase. Bifurcation analysis of the system reveals a hysteres loop around a bistable region emerging from a saddle bifurcation, a feature of class I excitable neurons. Depending on Na+/K+-Pase strength, bursts are generated from pump-induced bifcation, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolar block. The model suggests transitions between dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting Na+/P activity. A minimal model outlining the sodium-potassium pump's contribution to burst dynamics may contribute to understanding pathologies like epilepsy and inform therapeutic strategies.
Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for disease subtyping has overlooked the importance of clustering stability and prognostic relevance assessment, as well as the ability to compare data-driven and pathway clustering methods. To address this gap, the COPS package was developed for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway integration, some of which are accessible through R and others proposed as new approaches. The framework was applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and methylation data. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data and knowledge-driven multi-view methods and incorporates cross-validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using ARI, survival via Cox models including covariates, and stability of results. Survival and standard metrics varied across methods and datasets, necessitating multi-criteria evaluation. The Pareto efficiency concept was applied to gauge equilibrium metrics in each case. Affinity Network, Integrative Non-Matrix Factor, and Multiple Kernel-Mans with Pathway Kernels were most stable and effective in discerning groups with different outcomes in several studies.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the SoxC group transcription factor SEM-2 plays a crucial role in embryonic and postembryonic development. SEM-2 is essential for specifying the sex myoblast (SM) fate in the postembry mesoderm lineage and is involved in embryonic development. A novel loss-of-function SEM-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal of the conserved DNA-binding domain was identified. Analysis of mutant animals harboring this mutation revealed new functions of SEM-2 in the SM lineage. SEM-2 functions antagonizes LET-38, the C. elegans Fox/Forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the SM lineage. Additionally, SEM-2 is required for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage. SEM- also regulates the expression of hl-8, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor critical for patterning the SM. These findings, along with previous studies, suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. This work identifies new interactions in the gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying C. elegans postembry development, contributing to understanding the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins.
