Researchers have investigated the structure and function of electrical synapses, a type of cell-to-cell communication in nervous systems, in zebraf Mauth cells. They found that electrical synapses are not solely defined by the presence of gap junctions, a cluster of intercellular channels, but also require additional cellular structures. Using expansion microscopy, they mapped the distribution of proteins at single synaptic contacts where gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release. Multiple gap junctions of varying sizes were identified by molecular components. The majority of the synaptic surface was occupied by gap junction and adherens junction components, suggesting a close association between the two structures. Glutamate receptors were confined to small portions, indicating most of the area functions as an electrical synapse. The study revealed the organization of an electrical syn that operates with multiple gap junctions, in association with structural and signaling molecules of adherens junction. The relationship between intercellular structures will aid in establishing boundaries of electrical syn throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into structural and functional diversity of synapses.
Researchers have identified the pre-Bötzinger complex (preötC) as a key generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm, which contains neurons that project directly to the facial nucleus (7) motor neurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. To understand the identity of 7-projecting preöt neurons, a combination of optogenetic and viral approaches were used to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects facial pad activity with minimal effects on breathing. The effects were altered by the type of anesthetic and anesthetized and conscious states. The population of 7-projecting preöt neurons consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved in regulation of autonomic activity. Modulation of subgroups of preöt neurons based on axonal projections is useful to understand mechanisms that coordinate breathing with motor and physiological behaviors. This is fundamental given abnormal respiratory autonomic and orofacial behaviors associated with disease development and progression.
Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal an alarm to the brain. These neurons are thought to serve as a general alarm system, modulating both passive and active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude of the threat. However, prior research has primarily focused on the role of CGRP in passive responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active behaviors. To address this, the role of CGRP in active behavior was examined using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Electrophysiological results revealed CGRP encodes the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP during chasing elevated responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably amplifying the perception of threat as more imminent. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP exhibited reduced responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning.
Researchers conducted a study using diffusion-weighted MRI data from approximately 30,000 UK Biob participants to investigate the relationship between obesity and brain structure. They tested the hypothesis that waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is associated with differences in microstructural metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISO) and index of free water, and intra-cellular fraction (IC) index of neurite density. Significant associations were found in two distinct brain systems: prefrontal/temporal/striatal with ISO and medial/occipital/statal with IC. The ISO-WHR system co-located with genes for innate functions, glial density, and mu opioid (MOR) and neurotransmitter density, while the IC-WHR system co-located with genes for G-protein receptors and decreased MOR and other receptors. Genetic correlations were estimated between WHR and ISO (r=0.026, P=0.36) and IC (r=0.112, P<10-4) as well as between WH maps and equivalent CRP for ISO and IC (P<0.05). These results suggest a two-way mechanistic model where genetically determined neurite density in medial system may contribute to obesity and water in prefront system reflect consequence of obesity by innate activation.
Cancer stem cells (CSCs) undergo epithelial-mesymal transition (EMT) to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental models. However, tumor cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating in human tumor specimens, leaving the relevance to cancer uncertain. Researchers have identified EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers alongside mesenchymal Vimentin, identifying EMT CSCs in oral cancer lines. This study investigates the combination of these markers to identify disseminating EMTs in human tumors. Examining 12,000 fields from 74 oral tumors, a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD, and Viment co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumor in metastatic specimens was observed. An artificial network predicted metastasis with high accuracy (cross-validated 87%). This study observed disseminating EMTs in human cancer, highly predictive of metastatic disease.
Apoptosis and efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that play a crucial role in tissue repair. However, the mechanisms by which apoptotic cell recognition and clearance regulate repair are not fully understood. Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to map cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds and found that apoptotic pathways and efferytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including Ly6+ macrophages during inflammation. Human diabetic wounds upregulate mRNAs for eocytosis pathway and display altered eocyt signaling via receptor Axl and its ligand Gas. During early inflammation in mouse wounds, Axl is upregulated in dendritic and fibroblasts via TLR-independent mechanisms. In vivo studies revealed Axl is required for wound repair but dispensable for eocyt. In contrast, Tim4 inhibition in mouse wounds decreases eoc and abrogates repair.
Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have enabled the creation of transcriptomic cell atlases, providing insights into gene expression dynamics and cellular heterogeneity within tissues. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and identifying cell types corresponding to gene clusters in single-cell sequencing sets remains a challenge. Researchers have developed a genetic approach, Targeted Genetically Encoded Multiplexing (Ta-EM), utilizing Drosophila genetic tools for in vivo tagging defined populations. This method involves inserting a DNA barcode upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal-inducible UASFP construct, allowing the sequence to be read during single-cell sequencing, labeling a population of interest. By creating independently barcoded fly strains, Ta- enables identification of cell types in atlases, multiplet identification, and barcoding experimental conditions, replicates. Ta- barcodes can be read using next-generation sequencing, facilitating population-scale measurements. This approach has potential for large-scale behavioral screens and improving single-cell transcriptomic multiplexing and annotation.
Researchers have investigated the evolution of novel phenotypes in the Dendrobatidae family of frogs, which have developed the ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for defense at least three times. However, previous studies have focused on colorful species with alkaloids, neglecting inconspic ones assumed to be undefended. This has led to an incomplete understanding of chemical defense evolution in the group. New data shows that undefended dendrobats have measurable alkaloids, contradicting previous studies. Undefended dendrobats consume mites and ants, alkaloid sources. This suggests diet is insufficient to explain defended phenotype. Data supports a phenotypic intermediate between toxin sequestration and accumulation, differing from seque in no transport mechanisms, resulting in low toxin levels. The concept of passive accumulation is discussed and its role in origin of chemical defenses in poison and toxin-sequest organisms. Incorporating pharmacokinetic ideas and new data, an evolutionary model is proposed to explain acquired defenses in animals and molecular fate of ingested toxins.
Epithelial-to-mesymal transition (EMT) plays a significant role in chemotherapy resistance and is a challenge in treating advanced breast cancer. The complexity of EMT, involving multiple signaling pathways and its reversal process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), has hindered treatment development. Researchers used a triple-negative EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze EMT status in tumor cells. Findings showed elevated ribosome biogenesis (Ri) during EMT and MET phases. R and its nascent protein synthesis by ERK and mTOR signaling are essential for E/M completion. Inhibiting R genetically or pharmacologically impaired E/M capability. Combining R inhibition with chemotherapy reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal cells under chemotherapies. Targeting R presents a strategy for treating advanced breast cancer.
Pearl millet, a heat- and drought-tolerant cereal crop, is a vital food source in the sub-Saharan region. Its early root system features a fast-growing primary root, hypothesized to be an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Using modeling, drought is shown to be a significant constraint in agroecosystems in the Sahel where pearl millet was domesticated. Increased primary root growth in pearl millet is correlated with increased water tolerance in field conditions. A genome-wide association and quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies identified genomic regions controlling this trait. Combining gene expression, re-sequencing, and reannotation of these regions, a glutaredin-encoding gene PgXC9 was identified as a candidate for stress root growth regulator. Functional characterization of its Arabidopsis homolog AtXY revealed a role for glutaredin (GR) in regulating cell elongation. This study suggests a conserved function for GR genes in root elongation and resilience in pearl to the Sahelian environment.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes language in complex, dynamic contexts involving speech, faces, bodies, objects, and words, and their associated concepts. The study aimed to understand how words and concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing. The researchers examined the representation of concrete and abstract concepts during movie watching to see how brain responses change with context. 

Concrete and abstract concepts were shown to encode different information in separate brain regions. However, these differences decreased when multimodal context was considered. The response of abstract words became more concrete when processed in scenes related to their meaning. Conversely, when context was unrelated to word, activation resembled abstract processing. These results suggest concepts encode experiences, but neurobiological organisation is not fixed and depends on contextual information.
Researchers have identified a limitation in the application of cancer immunotherapy due to the scarcity of targetable antigens on tumor cells. A cellular pathway, nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), conceals neoantigens by destroying RNA products from genes with truncating mutations. A high-throughput screen based on rati analysis of transcripts identified mediators of N in human cells, implicating SM1's phosphorylation of UP1 as a disruptor of N. This led to the design of a SM1 inhibitor, KVS1, elevating expression of transcripts and proteins from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and in vivo. KVS increased presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I peptides from N-downregulated on surface of cancer cells.
Researchers investigated the relationship between aging and cancer risk, focusing on a new measure called "Phenotypic Age" (PhenoAge), which combines chronological age and biomarkers. They analyzed data from 374,463 participants in the UK Biobank study, using Cox regression models to examine the association between PhenoAge and cancer incidence. PhenoAge was calculated by subtracting the effect of chronological age from biomarkers and an incidence-weighted cancer polygenic risk score (CPRS) based on 20 site-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS). Results showed that older participants had a higher overall cancer risk, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.22 (95% CI 1.18-1.27) in men and 1.26 (1.22-1.31) in women. A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAge was observed on overall risk, with HRs of 2.29 (2.10-2.51) for men and 1.94 (1.78-2.11) with high genetic risk and oldereno compared to low risk youngereno. Pheno was negatively associated with healthy lifestyle factors (Beta=-0.01 in men, p<0.001; Beta=-0.98 in women, p<0.001). Within genetic groups, oldereno was related to increased cancer risk, adjusted for age. Adhering to a healthy lifestyle could retard the aging process.
A new mobile application, Biome, has been launched in Japan to gather species observations from the public using species identification and gamification elements. Since its launch in 2019, the app has amassed over 6 million observations. However, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Species distribution models (SDMs) estimate species distribution while accommodating such bias. This study investigated the quality of Bi data and its impact on SD performance. Species identification accuracy exceeded 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but plants, mollusks, and fishes scored below 90. SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Bi data into traditional data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional data required over 200 records for accurate (Boyce ≥ 0.9), while blending the two sources reduced to around 300. The coverage of urban-natural gradients by Bi data compared to traditional biased towards natural areas may explain this improvement. Combining multiple sources better estimates species distributions, aiding protected area and ecosystem assessment. Establishing a platform accumulating community-sourced data contributes to conserving and monitoring ecosystems.
Researchers investigated the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1 (BMPRA) signaling in the mesenchyme during lung development and its impact on the formation of congenital pulmonary cysts. Using mouse models, they found that abrogation of mesymal MPRA disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle and subepithelial fibers were found in cystic airways of mesym MPRA knockout lungs. Ectopic mesym expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of Sox-9 proximal-dist axis were detected in mesym MPRA lungs. Deletion of Smad/5, major BMP downstream effectors from the mesyme, did not phenoc the cystic abnormalities in mes MPRA lungs, suggesting a Sm-independent mechanism contributes to pulmonaryic lesions.
Researchers investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF) activity in living cells. Using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy, they visualized EG and PI(4,5)P nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. Before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), EG and PI(4,5)P nanodomains aggregated through transient visits of EG to PI(4,5)P nanodomains. The degree of co-aggregation decreased after EGF stimulation depended on phospholipaseγ, the EG effector hydrolyzing PI(4,5)P. Artificial reduction in PI(4,5)P content of plasma membrane reduced dimerization and autophosphorylation of EG after EGF stimulation. Inhibition PI(4,5)P hydrolysis after EGF decreased phosphorylation EG-Th654. EG kinase activity and PI(4,5)P around EG molecules were found to be mutually regulated.
Stramenopiles are a diverse group of eukaryotic organisms that include multicellular algae, fish, and pathogenic oomycetes such as Phytophthora and Blastocystis. Unlike most eukotes, Strameniles have a branched glycolytic pathway, where enzymes of the pay phase are located in both the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix. Researchers have identified a mitochondrial carrier in Blastocyst that transports glycol intermediates, such as dihydroxyone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the inner mitochondrial membrane, linking cytos and mitochondrial branches of glycol. This carrier is distinct from the phylogenetically related human oxoglutar carrier SLC25 and dicarboxyl carrier S10, which transport malate and oxutar. Blastocis lacks key components of oxidative phosphorylation, including complexes III, IV, ATPase, and AD/ATP carriers. The glycol phase in the matrix generates ATP, powering processes such as macromolecular synthesis and NAD, used by complex I to generate proton force for protein and molecule import. The glycol intermediate carrier has unique specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism, making it a potential drug target for Stramenile pathogens, which are economically important.
Researchers have proposed a new framework for genetic association studies that uses a deep learning model to calculate a genomic score for each haplotype in an individual, known as the Haplotype Function Score (HFS). This score replaces the traditional genotype in association studies. The FS framework was applied to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank dataset, identifying 361 independent FS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10^(-8). Fine-mapping revealed 269 causal associations, a median of 63 per trait compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis. The FS-based analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait and 153-tissue associations with biological interpretability, including circadian pathway and arachid acid intelligence. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression integrated FS score with SNP-based polygenic scores, improving cross-ancestry prediction by 16.1-39.8%. The study concludes that FS is a promising strategy for understanding complex trait genetics.
This study investigated the impact of three different types of mental training modules on hippocampal organization and stress regulation in healthy adults. The modules focused on attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective, and socio-cognitive skills. Researchers used structural and resting-state functional MRI to evaluate changes in hippocampal subfield volume and connectivity in 332 participants over three months. They also measured diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. Results showed that the socioffective module increased bilateral cornu ammonis (CA-3) volume compared to socio-cognitive and wait-list groups. Functional connectivity of CA-3 also increased with socioffective compared to socio-cognitive. Changes in CA-3 structure and function correlated with cortisol reductions. A multivariate analysis found other subfields contributed to cortisol changes. The study found a link between socio-emotional intervention, hippocal structure and function, and cortisol in healthy adults.
Researchers investigated the role of large-effect alleles and inversions in local adaptation in three species of sunflower: Helianthus annu, Helthus argyllus, and Helthus petolar. These species harbor numerous species-specific inversions that suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between locally adapted loci. The study aimed to determine the fraction of adaptive response attributed to inversions and large-effect alleles and whether loci within inversions could drive adaptation in the absence of recombination-suppression. Genome-wide association studies were conducted to explore patterns of local adaptation in the three species. Results showed significant genome-wide repeatability of association signatures to phenotypes and environments, particularly within regions harboring inversions in one species. This suggests inversions facilitate local adaptation, but some loci can contribute substantially without recombination suppression in species lacking inversions. Many genomic regions showed repeated adaptation, but strongest associations were species-specific, indicating substantial genetic redundancy for local adaptation in species.
Aging in single cells is heterogeneous, but at the organ and tissue level, aging phenotypes tend to exhibit stereotypical changes. The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Mam luminal epithelia exhibit stereotypical changes with age, as these cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers. Researchers hypothesized that aging effects on lineage maintenance increase cancer susceptibility. They analyzed transcriptomes from luminal epithelial and myepithelial cells from younger (30) and older (55 women. Age-dependent changes in gene expression were observed, along with increased transcriptional variance contributing to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent responses were common to both lineages, while directional changes were exclusively in luminal and involved regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SAT1. Epithelial expression of gap protein G6 increased with age, and modulation of G6 in co-cultures revealed it provided communication from myepith to lum cells. Age luminal transcriptomes comprised a signal detectable in tissue aging and transition into cancers. A classifier based on lum-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer and was highly predictive of breast subtype. Luminal are the site of variant responses in surrounding tissue, emergent phenotype endows with ability to become cancer-cells and represents presages susceptibility.
Researchers have explored the possibility of using non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing as a proxy for phenotyping in studying plant resistance to pests. They analyzed whole-genome and epigenome sequencing data from 207 lines of Pennycress (Thlaspi arse) grown in a common environment with aphids, mildew, and microbes. Results showed that non-target reads assigned to pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP heritability, and were associated with climate origin and glucosinolate content. Lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, less favorable to aphids, had higher aphid load, indicating decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide analysis identified genetic variants in defense genes and novel regions associated with aphid and mildew load. Differentially methylated regions were found associated with pathogen loads, particularly transposons and hypomethylation in a gene promoter involved in stomatal closure.
Researchers investigated the concept of collateral sensitivity in malaria treatment, where resistance to one drug increases sensitivity to another. They focused on Plasmodium falciparum dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme targeted by various inhibitors. The study profiled cross-resistance and collateral phenotypes of DHH mutant lines to a panel of inhibitors. One compound, TDC-125, showed activity against all mutants, including DH C276, which emerged with clinical candidate DSM265. Selection with TDC-125 led to copy number variation in the dhod locus, except for mutation DH263, resistant to TDC-125 but not DSM. Selection of DH276 with TDC-125 yielded additional dh locus changes. Double mutants showed decreased sensitivity to TDC-125 and increased resistance to DSM. Combination treatment with DSM and TDC-125 selected DHV mutants resistant to both, as fit as wildtype in vitro.
Malaria drug resistance varies significantly across different geographic regions, with most cases occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, yet resistant strains emerging in low-transmission areas. Current models of resistance lack consensus on the relationship between transmission intensity and resistance, possibly due to neglecting interactions between antigen diversity, host immunity, and selection for resistance. A novel compartmental model was developed to track sensitive and resistant strains, as well as host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. Results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant data supports this trend. Discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-trans regions, while decreasing in high-divers, high-trans regions. This study highlights the critical role of malaria diversity in geographic patterns of resistance.
Cannabis, the most widely consumed illicit psychoactive substance worldwide, is increasingly used by pregnant women, despite the presence of cannabinoid receptors in the embryo. However, the impact of phytocannabinoids on early embryonic development is not well understood. This study investigates the effects of the most abundant phytocannabinoid, Δ-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ-THC), on early embryonic development using a stepwise in vitro system that captures the embryonic cascade. 

Δ-TH increases proliferation of naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but not their primed counterparts. This effect is dependent on CB receptor binding, associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ-TH enhances ESC metabolic capabilities by increasing glycolytic and anabolic rates. This metabolic rewiring is retained during differentiation to Primordial Germ-Like Cells in the absence of exposure, associated with altered transcriptional profile. 

Δ-TH exposure increases ESC glycolytic and anabolic rates by 1.5 and 2.5 fold, respectively, while decreasing oxidative phosphorylation by 1.3 fold. Metabolic rewiring is associated with altered expression of genes involved in glycolysis, anabolism, and oxidative phosphorylation.Δ-TH exposure alters transcriptional profile of Primordial Cells, increasing expression of genes involved in glycol, anabol, and decreasing those in oxidative phosphorylation.Δ-TH exposure is associated with increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression and decreased expression of those in cell cycle arrest.Δ-TH alters transcriptional profile of Primordial Cells, increasing expression of genes in glycol and anabol and decreasing those in oxidative phosphorylation.Δ-TH exposure is associated with increased expression of genes in cell cycle and decreased expression those in cell arrest.Δ-TH alters transcriptional profile of Primordial, increasing genes in glycol and anabol and decreasing oxidative phosphorylation.
Researchers have investigated the genetic variation of NLR (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat) genes in the zebraf fish (Danio rerio), a species with hundreds of NLR genes, making it an ideal model for studying this phenomenon. Through sequencing 93 zebraf from multiple wild and laboratory populations, a total of 151 NLRs were identified, exceeding the previously known 400. Approximately half of these NLRs are present in all wild populations, while 4% were found in 80% or more of individuals. Wild zraf have up to twice as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLR per population as laboratory strains. In contrast, nucleotide diversity in zraf NLR genes is low, with half being monomorphic and the remaining having few polymorphisms, indicative of purifying selection.
Researchers have discovered a new species of ancient ovules, Alenia tria gen. sp. nov., in the Famennian of the Late Devonian period in Xinhang, Anhui, China. These ovules, which are the precursors to seeds, possess three integument wings that extend outward and fold inward along the abaxial side, enclosing the nucellus, and are borne on dichotomous branches without a cupule. This finding suggests that the earliest ovules without a cupule may have evolved for photosynthetic and wind dispersal functions. The discovery indicates that seeds with wings originated before other dispersal mechanisms such as plume and papp, and that three-winged seeds were followed by seeds with fewer wings. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two, or four wings under the same conditions.
Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia is a type of hematological malignancy characterized by the presence of the BCR-ABL fusion gene. Despite the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in prolonging patient survival, intolerance and relapse, as well as TK resistance remain significant issues. Researchers have identified a novel leukemogenic process where RSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph leukemia, with RSY mediating the neddylation of B-ABL. Neddylated BABL enhances its stability by competing with CBL-mediated degradation. Furthermore, SRC phosphorylates RSY to activate its NEDD8 ligase activity, promoting BABL stabilization and disease progression. In contrast, in vivo PROTAC-based degraders are ineffective, depletion of RSY expression or its ligase activity decreases BABL stability, inhibiting tumor growth.
Researchers have identified a new strategy to discover peptidogly hydrolases, enzymes that break down peptoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls, using antimicrobial peptides as a starting point. This approach, called antimicrobial-primed screening, was tested on the proteome of Acinetobacter baumannii, a common pathogen. Five peptogly hyrolases were found, with PH10 and PH11 showing potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after heat treatment at 100°C for 1 hour. The other three were thermosensitive. Crystal structures of PH8, PH10, and PH11 were solved, revealing PH10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme through dimeromer transition, while PH8 formed a monomer. In mouse models of bacterial infection, PH10 demonstrated safety and efficacy.
Researchers conducted a retrospective study using data from the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) and electronic health records to investigate pancreatic cancer symptoms and disease correlations. The study included 6.9 million patients from 1994 to 2018, of whom 23,592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Danish Cancer Registry included 18,523 of these patients. To complement the registry data, a text mining approach was used to extract symptoms from clinical notes in electronic health records of 3,078 cancer patients and 30,780 controls. Both sources were used to generate and compare symptom trajectories to uncover patterns prior to pancreatic diagnosis in the same patients. The study found that text mining clinical notes captured more symptoms before diagnosis than registry-based analysis, including 'blood pressure without diagnosis', 'abnormal heartbeat', and 'intestinal obstruction'. Combining trajectories identified two groups with median survival <90 days: 'Cough→jaundiceintestinal' and 'painjaiceabnormal function'. The study provides a comprehensive comparison of pancreatic symptom trajectories, leveraging data to detect early risk factors for cancer.
Researchers investigated the synchronization of fast spindle activity (12.5-16 Hz) and slow oscillations (0.5-1 Hz) during sleep in children and adolescents aged 5-6, 8, 11, and 14 years, and adults 20-26 years. They used individualized detection of single events to characterize age-specific patterns of slow and fast spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling. The study found that the predominant type of fast spind was development-specific and nested in a range below the canonical spindle for majority of children, while the slow oscill-spindle pattern was evident for spind in the adult canonical range in all groups, but less precise in children. Measures of spindle maturity indicated similarity to adult canonical spind and oscill maturity showed frontal dominance, with oscill-spindle patterns. Importantly, spindle maturity was associated with oscill-sp coupling strength and precision across groups. The results suggest that generating adult-like fast spind enables precise oscill-sp patterns from childhood to young adulthood.
Despite the advancements in high-throughput technologies since the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, recent publications on human genes primarily feature genes that were already identified prior to this milestone. This phenomenon persists despite the discovery of novel genes associated with biological processes and diseases. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the bias in gene selection for research targets, but their explanatory power remains untested. Our analysis reveals that understudied genes are systematically favored over better-stud genes in the completion of omics experiments and reporting of results. Conversely, understud genes remain abandoned in studies citing omics experiments. Notably, publications on understud genes receive a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological factors proposed to affect gene selection, 33 are significantly associated with the choice of genes in titles and abstracts of omics studies. To promote understud gene investigation, we develop a tool, find understud genes (FM), enabling scientists to identify bias during selection. FM is demonstrated through identification of underst genes in vertebrate aging. FM is developed and available for download at fm.amal.northwestern.edu as MacOS/Windows app.
Artificially sweetened beverages containing non-caloric monosaccharides have been proposed as a healthier alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages, but their effects on blood vessel function are not well understood. Researchers developed a zebraf model that exhibits excessive angiogenesis in response to high glucose, similar to that seen in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Using this model, they found that glucose and non-caloric monacides induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels (ISVs). Excessively branched vessels were formed by ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells (ECs) into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of ECs exposed to high glucose showed increased capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and upregulated pro-angiogenic genes. Further experiments confirmed that fox1 mediated excessive angiogenesis by monacides via upregulating marck1. This study provides evidence of negative effects of nonoric monacides on vascular system and underlying mechanisms.
Researchers investigated how the human brain processes and stores multiple sequences of information in working memory, specifically focusing on the capacity limitations of working memory (WM) and the use of relational structures to reorganize and compress information. In an experiment, participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and locations, then reproduced the full sequence of colors and locations in order. The study manipulated the consistency between location and color trajectories, creating two conditions: sequences with consistent trajectories and sequences with inconsistent trajectories. Results showed that sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrated improved memory performance and a correlation between color and location sequences. Additionally, sequences with consistent trajectories showed neural reactivation of common trajectories and spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Furthermore, neural reactivation correlated with WM behavior. The study suggests that a shared structure is used for storing multiple sequences through encoding and replay, facilitating efficient organization in WM.
Mutations in the human PURA gene have been identified as the primary cause of neurodevelopmental PURA syndrome, a genetic disorder characterized by a range of neurological and developmental abnormalities. Unlike many other genetic disorders, mutations in the nucleic acid-binding protein PUR result in full penetrance, meaning that nearly all individuals with the mutation exhibit symptoms. This study investigated the impact of mutations on PUR's localization and function, revealing that they impair its association with processing bodies. Specifically, mutations either destroyed the protein's folding, RNA binding, or dimerization capabilities. 

Structural analysis of the N- and C-terminal domains of human PUR was conducted using X-ray crystallography, combined with molecular dynamics and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. Results showed unusually high dynamics and promiscuity in PUR, indicating susceptibility to structural disruption. This may explain why even conservative mutations in PUR result in full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PUR syndrome. 

The study's findings suggest that PUR's unique properties make it particularly vulnerable to mutations, leading to disease manifestation in nearly all individuals with the mutation. This contrasts with other genetic disorders, where mutations often result in variable expression or incomplete penetrance. Further research is needed to fully understand PUR's role in neurodevelopment and the mechanisms underlying PUR syndrome.
Researchers have identified a potential interaction between the transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) and anoctamin 1 (AN1) channels in the regulation of water efflux in exocrine glands, suggesting a role in perspiration. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed colocalization of TR4 with cytokeratin 8, AN1, and aquaporin-5 (AQP5) in sweat glands of mouse foot pads. TR4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases were observed, inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type, but not TR4-deficient mice, and inhibited by menthol in wild-type and TRPMKO mice. Basal sweating without acetylcholine was inhibited by AN1 inhibitor. Sweating may be crucial for friction in mouse foot pads, as wild-type mice climbed a slippery slope more easily than TR4-deficient. TR4 expression was higher in normidrotic skin from patients with acquired generalized anhidrosis (A) than anidrotic skin from A. TR4 is likely involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with AN1, and the TR4/ANO complex may be targeted for agents regulating pers.
Researchers have developed a universal description of the primate cortices, despite their diverse shapes and sizes across species. They found that all cortices can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes, with neighboring folds merging to form a common scale-free morphometric trajectory in 11 primate species, overlapping with 70 other mammalian species. This indicates that all cortices approximate the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of 2.5. This understanding enables precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. A scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology was observed, with a more than fourfold increase in size from two to eight standard deviations at a scale of approximately 2mm compared to standard morphological analyses. This new understanding may generate biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future.
Researchers investigated the role of the NF-κB transcription factor REL in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors, a type of pancreatic cancer. REL is a key regulator of immune and stress responses and was found to be upregulated in PDAC tumors. The study used live-cell imaging to observe REL dynamics in PDAC cell lines and found that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNα) induces rapid and sustained non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of REL. Analysis of single-cell datasets revealed REL heterogeneity in PDAC cells is dependent on actin dynamics. RNA sequencing identified distinct REL-regulated gene expression in PD cells, including TNα-induced upregulation of actin regulators NU2 and ARHG31. Depletion of ARHG31 and NU2 altered TNα-stimulated REL dynamics in PD cells, establishing a negative feedback loop regulating REL activation by TNα. The study also characterized NF-κ pathway in PD cells, showing NF-κ/Iκ proteins interact with REL in presence or absence TNα. The findings support interdependence between actin network and NFκ pathway REL translocation in PD.
A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is crucial for proper brain function, and disruptions in the GABAergic system, which alter this equilibrium, are common in various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in Phosphase Tensin Hom (PTEN), the main regulator of the phosphatidyinositol 3-phosphate/Akt pathway, are associated with ASD. However, it is unclear whether PTEN can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, both excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (GABA) inputs regulate muscle activity, d-18/PT mutations impact GABA but not cholin development and function. This results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. Defects in the GABA system d-18/PT mutants are due to reduced D-FOX activity during development. Ketogenic diets (KDs) have proven effective for disorders with E imbalances. A diet enriched with ketone body-hydrobutyrate during development induces D-FOX, improving GABA development in d-PT mutants.
Innate immune responses triggered by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19, with pro-inflammatory cytokines being critical for viral containment. Researchers used quantitative and qualitative models to discover that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-induced cell fusion in infected cells. Through cytokine screening, interleukin-1 (IL-1) was identified as a key mediator that inhibits syncytia formation by various SARS-CoV strains. Mechanistically, IL-1 activates Rho/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor pathway, driving actin enrichment at cell junctions, preventing syncytia formation. In vivo experiments in mice confirmed IL-1 restricted SARSV-2 spread in lung epithelium.
In Drosophila melanogaster insulin-producing cells (IPCs) are functional analogues of mammalian pancreatic beta cells and release insulin into the circulation, playing a key role in metabolic homeostasis. To investigate the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity, electrophysiological recordings were used to quantify the effects of nutritional and internal state changes on IPCs. Results showed that nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity, with activity decreasing during periods of starvation. Refeeding with glucose or fructose, two nutritive sugars, significantly increased IPC activity, whereas non-nutritive sugars had no effect. In contrast, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect where glucose ingestion drives insulin release more than intravenous application. Contrary to IPC, Drosophila hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerealis (DH44s) responded to glucose perfusion. Functional experiments demonstrated that DH44s do not affect IPC, while other DHNs inhibit them. Hence, populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain homeostasis. Activating IPC had a satiety-like effect on food-search behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activating DHNs increased hyperactivity.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to visualize proteins in live cells using endogenous tags, which are genetically encoded within the cell's genome. However, generating human cell lines with endogenous tags is challenging due to low homology-directed repair efficiency. To overcome this limitation, an engineered protein called splitNeonGreen was used to create a large-scale endogenous library in HEK cells. This breakthrough has the potential to study protein function in various cell types, including healthy and differentiated cells. The team engineered an induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) line to express a fragment of the splitNeGreen protein (NG-10) and demonstrated efficient endogenous tagging with a short fragment (NG). Furthermore, neural network-based image restoration enabled live imaging of dynamic processes such as cytokinesis in iPSCs. This study marks the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous library in human cells.
Researchers have developed a novel method for creating electrolytic lesions in the brain using chronically implanted intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology. A custom-built current source provides stable and controlled current for repeatable lesions in awake animals. The performance of this lesion technique was validated through histology ex vivo and in vivo, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesion. This method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submill precision the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining population after lesion. The technique can be used in many areas cortex, several species, and theoretically any multielectrode. The low-cost device can easily be adopted into existing electrophiology setup. This is expected to enable causal investigations of the population's role in neuronal function while providing insight local reorganization after loss.
Bees play a crucial role in pollinating agricultural crops, but their populations are threatened by the use of pesticides. One of the main risks they face is poisoning from neonicotinoids in floral nectar and pollen. Studies on the detection of neonicinoids have yielded conflicting results regarding whether bees can taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and avoid them. This study aimed to investigate whether the mouthparts of the buffailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution mimicking the nectar of oilseed (Brassica nap). An assay of food aversion combined with single-sens electrophysiology was used to test the mouthparts of the bees. The results showed that bees did not avoid solutions containing concentrations of imacloprid, thiamox, clothin, or sulfox spanning six orders of magnitude, even when these contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations altered spiking in gustatory neurons through slight reduction in firing or change in rate. These findings provide evidence that bumblees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant pesticides using their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact nectar with other body parts, it is predicted that they are at risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in nectar of pesticide-treated crops.
Researchers have investigated the dynamics of Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria parasite, in non-human primates (NHP) in Southeast Asia, where it poses a significant barrier to malaria elimination efforts. A meta-analysis of 632 NHP from 148 sites revealed heterogeneous prevalence across the region, with low overall prevalence and high estimates in Malaysian Borneo. Regions with higher NHP prevalence overlap with human infection hotspots, indicating a link between wildlife and human transmission. Land conversion and fragmentation is associated with parasite transmission in both wildlife and humans. By combining remote sensing data and statistical models, researchers identified relationships between P. know in NHP and forest fragmentation, suggesting higher prevalence contingent on habitat complexity, explaining geographic variation in parasite burden. These findings address gaps in regional P know epidemiology and indicate simian reservoirs may drive human spillo risk.
The rise of angiosperms to dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic era marked significant transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To understand how trophic interactions were influenced by host shifts and paleogeographical events, researchers integrated molecular and fossil data to construct a phylogenetic tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the family Belidae. The results indicate that the crown group Belidae originated approximately 138 million years ago in Gondwana, associated with Pinops (conifer) host plants, with larvae developing in dead/decaying branches. Belids tracked their hosts as major movements occurred during Gondana's breakup, surviving on distant disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to angiosperms and cycads when conifers declined, evolving new troph interactions including broodoll mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous paras angperms. Extant radiations bel in the genera Rhin (Australian region) and Prohin (Hawaiian) have relatively recent origins.
Researchers have investigated the evolution of hepatocellular carcinomas, a type of liver cancer, by analyzing hundreds of samples taken from two and three dimensions. They used spatial metrics to track the growth of tumour cells within the tumour, finding that they predominantly grow uniformly throughout the volume rather than at the surface. The study also examined how mutations are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to overall growth. The findings provide insight into early tumour evolution in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the field of spatial biology.
Researchers have discovered a novel neuroendocrine mechanism underlying the seasonal polyphenism in the insect Copsa chinensis, a species that exhibits distinct morphological changes between summer and winter forms. Previous studies have shown that temperature and the receptor CTR regulate the transition from summer to winter form, affecting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underlying neuroendocrine mechanism remained unknown. This study reveals the function of Burs, a hormone responsible for hardening and darkening the cuticle, in the transition from summer to winter form. Two subunits of Burs, CBα and CBβ, were identified in C. chinensis, regulated by low temperature and CTR. CBα and CBβ formed a heterodimer mediating the transition by influencing cuticle chitin and thickness. CB-R was found to act as the Burs receptor, regulating the upstream signaling of chitin biosynthesis, controlling the transition. Additionally, miR-2 targets CB-R, regulating Burs signaling in seasonal polyism of C. chin. These findings provide insights into the neuroendocrine mechanism of seasonal polyism and insect B and its receptor.
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are resistant to current treatments. A mutation of the lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27M) is a driver in DMGs, reshaping the epigenetic landscape to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27 gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. To find an effective treatment, the therapeutic potential of dual targeting histone deacetylases (HDs) and MYC in these tumors was examined. Treatment of H-K27 patient-derived cells with Sop, an inhibitor of MY-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with HD inhibitor Vorin, resulted in decrease in cell viability. Transcript and epigen profiling revealed synergistic effect of this combination in downregulation of oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. In vivo studies of patient-derived orthopic xenograft showed significant tumor reduction in mice treated the combination. These results highlight combined with HD and inhibitors as a promising approach for these aggressive tumors.
The white-footed deermouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is a long-lived rodent that serves as a reservoir for several zoonotic diseases in North America, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and viral encephalitis. Despite persistent infection, the deerm shows no apparent disability or diminished fitness. To understand the immune response elicited by various pathogens, the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to compare genome-wide transcription in blood of P. leopus, Mus musculus, and Rattus norveicus and adjusted for white cell concentrations. The deerm was distinguished from mice and rats by LPS profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages L-treated. P leopus, in contrast to mice and rats, displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These characteristics of P leopus were noted in Borrelia herms infection. The phenomenon was associated with reduced transcription endogenous retroirus and cytoplasmic pattern receptors in deerm.
Caspases (CASP) are a family of proteases involved in the cleavage and activation of gasdermin, a executor of pyroptosis. In humans, CAS3 and CAS7 recognize the same consensus motif DD, present in gasdermin E (GME). However, GME is cleaved by CAS3 but not CAS7. This study identified pyrotic puffer GME that was cleaved by puffer CAS/7 and human CAS/7. Domain swapping between puffer and human CAS and ME showed the ME C-terminus and CAS7 subunit determined cleavage of ME by CAS. CAS7 contains a key residue that governs CAS discrimination. This residue is conserved in vertebrate CAS and most vertebrates except mammals. In mammals, it is conserved in non-primates but not primates. Mouse CAS cleaved human ME but not ME. These findings revealed the mechanism of CAS discrimination and divergence of CAS7-mediated ME activation in vertebrates. Results also suggested mutation-mediated alteration of CAS enabled divergence and specialization of CAS members in regulation of cellular activities in mammals.
Researchers conducted a single-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the neural and behavioral effects of ketamine in 40 healthy participants. Participants received an initial ketamine bolus of 0.23mg/kg and a continuous infusion of 0.58mg/hr. Resting-state functional connectivity was quantified via global connectivity and related to ketamine-induced symptom variation and gene expression. Results showed that ketamine's effects are multi-dimensional, reflecting inter-individual variability. The principal neural effect of ketamine matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbum (PB) cortical expression in humans, while the mean did not. Behavioral symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine resolvable at the single-subject level.
The RNA world hypothesis proposes that early life's primordial genomes consisted of self-replicating units in the form of RNA-like polymers, which autonomously replicated without enzymes. However, this non-enzymatic replication poses a problem: the formation of hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication kinetics, leading to parabolic growth with competitive coexistence, maintaining diversity. This study investigates the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in multispecies models under constant population size and chemostat conditions. Results show that large population sizes and small replication rate differences favor stable coexistence of most replicator species, alleviating the error problem of exponential amplification. Sequence properties (GC content) and resource competition rate determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting fluctuations in availability favored cycles of exploration and exploitation. Stochastic parabolic growth may have played a role in preserving sequences generated by abiotic synthesis, providing genetic material to early evolution of ribozymes.
Nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp) of the SARS-CoV virus is a protease that cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication. Research has shown that Nsp binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TR1), a host enzyme required for post-transcriptional modification of tRNAs. In cells infected with SARS-CoV, levels of TR1 protein and TR1-catalyzed tRNA modifications decrease, indicating TR cleavage by Nsp. Nsp cleaves TR1 at a specific site matching the consensus SARS-CoV polyprotein cleavage sequence, and a mutation in this site inhibits Nsp-dependent cleavage of TR1. Cleaved TR1 fragments exhibit altered RNA binding and cannot rescue tRNA in TR1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type human cells, TR1-deficient cells infected with SARSV exhibit reduced intracellular viral RNA.
Many disease-causing microbes are not obligate pathogens, but rather environmental microbes that take advantage of ecological opportunities. The existence of microbes whose life cycle does not require a host and are not normally pathogenic, yet are well-suited to host exploitation is an evolutionary puzzle. A hypothesis posits that selection in the environment favors traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in host. An example of such trait is surface adherence. To experimentally test the idea of 'accidental' virulence, populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were evolved to attach to plastic for hundreds of generations. Along with adherence, two multicellular phenotypes - biofilm formation and flor-formation increased; another, pseudohyph growth responded to nutrient limitation. Thus, selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hypericellular strains. Wax larvae injected with hyperic strains were significantly likely to die than those with nonic strains. Selection on adherence incidentally led to evolution of multicellularity and increased virulence. Our results support that selection for trait in open can generate opportunistic 'accidental pathogens.
Proteins containing prion-like domains (PLDs) play a crucial role in the formation of biomolecular condensates and are susceptible to misregulation due to amino acid mutations. Researchers used a residue-resolution coarse-grained model, Mpipi, to investigate the impact of amino mutations on the stability of PLDs from six proteins: hnRNP A1, TDP-43, FUS, EWS1, RBM14, and TIA. Simulations revealed the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in critical temperature of PLDs as a function of number and type of amino sequence mutations. These laws are consistent with physicochemical properties of mutations and extend across the tested family, suggesting scaling can be used to predict changes in stability of PL condens. The study provides a quantitative insight into emergent behavior of PL solutions in response to physico changes of single PL molecules.
Researchers have proposed a new approach to predict an individual's cognitive traits or clinical conditions using brain signals, focusing on the dynamic patterns of brain activity over time, which is often overlooked in current methods that rely on structural or time-averaged measures. This approach uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to describe functional connectivity and amplitude, combined with a Fisher kernel that can be used for prediction. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled way, preserving the model's structure. In a study using fMRI data, the H-Fisher approach was found to be accurate and reliable. It was compared to other methods, including time-vary and time-aver functional connectivity models. The new approach leverages information on individual's timeary amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction, with potential applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine.
Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK) variants associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Crohn's disease have been shown to lead to increased phosphorylation of its substrates. However, the mechanisms regulating LK activity have remained poorly defined. A targeted siRNA screen identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LK-dependent phosphorylation of its substrate, Rab10. Imaging and immunopurification methods isolated lysosomes, demonstrating Rab12 is recruited to damaged lysosomes, leading to LK-dependent increase in Rab phosphorylation. PD-linked variants, LK R144G and V35D, increased LK recruitment to lysosomes and lysosomal pT Rab levels. These data suggest a conserved mechanism where Rab, in response to damage or PD-associated variants, facilitates LK recruitment and phosphorylation of its substrates at lysosomes.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the cell cycle of non-adherent cells, which is crucial for understanding cellular biology and cancer research. Current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, but non-adherent cells remain challenging. To address this gap, the researchers combined a specialized surface-enhanced cell attachment, FUCCI (CA2) sensor, automated image analysis, and machine learning algorithm. This enabled precise measurement of cell phase durations in non-adherent cells. The method was validated in myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi, which have unique cycle characteristics, and tested the impact of cycle-modulating drugs on NB cells. The system is also compatible with adherent cells, fully automated and freely available, providing insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions.
Researchers investigated the relationship between social and ecological factors in the evolution of cognition in primates using an interdisciplinary approach combining cognitive neuroscience and ecology. Brain imaging data from 16 primate species was used to measure the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole (FP) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DFC), involved in metacognition and working memory. The size of these regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily distance traveled (an index of ecological constraints), and population density (index of social). The influence of ecological constraints on FP and DFC volumes suggests that metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. FP volume was more sensitive to social constraints than DFC, in line with laboratory studies implicating FP in complex social interactions.
Researchers investigated the effect of mechanical loading, such as that occurs during exercise, on muscle growth, specifically the increase in cross-sectional area of muscle fibers. Muscle fibers are primarily composed of myofibrils, and it was unclear whether growth was due to an increase in size of myofils (myofibril hypertrophy) or number of myils (myillogenesis). To address this, a novel method was developed for visualizing myils using a standard microscope, fluorescence imaging myils with deconvolution (F-ID). This method provided high-resolution images with contrast, enabling automated measurements of myil size and number. After validation, the method was applied to mouse and human models of increased loading. Results showed that radial growth of fibers was largely mediated by myogenesis, an increase in number of myils.
Researchers investigated the role of SNAP25, a neuronal SNARE protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and its mutations associated with epileptic encephalopathy. Three mutations, V48, D166, and I67, in the synaptagmin-1 (Sy1) binding interface and I67, which destabilize the SNARE complex, were studied. These mutations reduced Sy1-dependent vesicle docking to SN-carrying liposomes and Ca2-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and in mouse hippocampal neurons. The V48 and D166 mutants, with D166 > V48, led to reduced readily releable pool (RP) size due to increased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mSC) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the fusion energy barrier and increased release probability, gain-of-function not found in Sy1 knockout (KO) neurons; mSC release rates were higher D166 >48 in Sy1 KO. These mutations D166 >48 increased association partner SNs resulting unregulated membrane. In contrast, I67 decreased mSC and evoked amplitudes due increased energy fusion barrier, RP size unaffected. This be partly compensated lowering barrier. Pathogenic SNAP25 mutations altered priming and fusion energy landscape.
A global analysis of research data from 30 countries reveals a significant correlation between the proportion of women in a discipline and the perceived quality of research, as well as funding success rates. The study found that disciplines with higher proportions of women tend to be evaluated as lower in quality and receive lower funding. This disparity affects both men and women, and is consistent across various metrics, including number of research outputs and bibliometric data. The findings build upon previous research indicating that women's work is undervalued, regardless of who performs it. 

The study analyzed data from 30 countries, including the US, UK, Canada, and Australia, and found that in disciplines with higher proportions of women, such as humanities and social sciences, were rated lower in quality and received less funding. Conversely, disciplines with lower proportions of women, such as physics and engineering, were rated higher and received more funding. This pattern held true for both men and women authors, and was consistent across various metrics, including number of research outputs and citations. 

The study controlled for age, number of research outputs, and bibliometric measures, and found that the correlation remained significant. The findings suggest that women's work is undervalued, regardless of who performs it. This is consistent with previous research indicating that women's work is undervalued in academia. The study's results have implications for policy and practice, highlighting the need to address undervaluation of women's work in research.
Researchers in the field of synthetic biology aim to design molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs that process information in a predictable manner, similar to electronic circuits, within living cells. Genome editing is a key component of these circuits, enabling the modulation of gene expression or recording information to DNA. However, programming protein-protein interactions or proximity triggers for genome editing remains challenging. A new strategy, termed 'P3', links protein-protein proximity to CRISPR-Cas9 dual guide RNA formation. By engineering crRNA:acrRNA interaction, various protein-protein interactions and chemical dimerization of domains activate editing in human cells. This approach enhances controll of CRPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic circuits in living cells.
The KCNQ/KC1 channel complex plays a crucial role in mediating the slow-rectifier current (IK) during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential in cardiomyocytes. Mutations in IK are associated with Long QT (LQ) syndrome, a condition characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Targeting IK channels to restore function and normalize the QT interval is a potential therapeutic approach for LTS. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PAs) activate KCN channels and IK by binding to two distinct sites: one in the voltage sensor domain, shifting voltage dependence to more negative, and the other in pore, increasing maximal conductance (G). However, the mechanism by which PAs increase G is unclear. Additionally, IK channels have low single-channel conductance and open probability, and whether PAs affect these properties is unknown. Research suggests the selectivity filter in KCN is unstable, contributing to low probability, and P-induced increase in G caused by stabilization of selectivity in open state.
Vitamin B6 deficiency has been associated with cognitive impairments in various brain disorders for decades, yet the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B supplementation improves cognition is unclear. Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate phosphatase (PDX), an enzyme controlling pyridal 5'-phosphate (PL) levels, the coenzymatically active form of vitamin B, may represent an alternative entry point into B-associated pathologies. However, pharmacological DXP inhibitors to test this concept are lacking. Researchers identified DXP-dependent decline in PL levels in the murine hippocampus, providing rationale for DXP inhibitors development. Using small-molecule screening, crystallography, and biolayerometry, they discovered 7,8-dihydroflavone (7,8HF) as a direct DXP inhibitor. 7,8HF binds reversibly inhibits DXP with micromolar affinity and submicrom potency. In hippocampal neurons, 7,8HF increases PL in DXP-dependent manner. These findings validate DXP as druggable target. Notably, 8HF is well-stud in brain disorder models, its mechanism debated. Discovery 8 as DXP inhibitor offers mechanistic insights surrounding 8-mediated effects brain.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the development of the gonad requires the production of diverse cell types and their proper positioning/migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SG; Z1 and Z4). The polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by redundant functions of the LIN-17/Fizzled receptor and Wnt proteins (WN-1, WN-2, and EGL-20) with distinct functions. In LIN-17 mutants, WN-2 promotes normal polarity in Z1 and Z, while WN-1 promotes normal polarity in Z and Z, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits polarization of Z and Z. In LIN-17 EGL-20-WN-2 mutants, polarity of Z is reversed, resulting in frequent mismigration of DTCs to the posterior. Our analysis demonstrates that mispositioning of Ds in the gon due to polarity reversal of Z leads to mismigration. Similar misigration was observed in C-1 RNAi animals producing ectopic Ds. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating production and migration of Ds to establish mirrorymmetric organ.
Researchers have been exploring the concept of multidrug therapies that exploit tradeoffs to combat resistance, where resistance to one drug leads to sensitivity to another. However, the reliability of these tradeoffs and whether mutants that provide resistance to a drug suffer similar tradeoffs remains unclear. Observations of drug-resistant mutants in clinics and laboratory settings are often biased towards those with large fitness benefits, suggesting that mutations and mechanisms providing resistance may be more diverse than current data indicates. To address this, experiments were conducted using lineage-tracking to capture a broader spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells an advantage against fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. The fitness of 774 mutants across 12 environments was quantified, grouping them into classes with characteristic tradeoffs. Unique tradeoffs imply that each mutant affects fitness through different mechanisms. Some groupings were unexpected, such as mutants that resist single drugs but not combinations, and mutants of the same gene have different tradeoffs. These findings demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent tradeoffs for multidrug treatments. However, they also show that hundreds of mutations can be reduced to few with characteristic tradeoffs, enabling multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. By grouping mutants that affect fitness through similar mechanisms, this work guides efforts to map phenotypic effects of mutations.
Researchers have investigated the phenomenon of central bias, or contraction, where the perceived magnitude of items in working memory appears to be biased towards the average of past observations. This bias is thought to be an optimal strategy employed by the brain to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. However, recency biases, such as serial dependence, are also observed and believed to reflect working memory content. A study using delayed auditory tasks in rats found that silencing the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) reduced both short-term and central biases. A proposed model suggests that working memory susceptible to shifting past sensory experience produces short-term biases, leading to contraction. Errors in individual trials are from the full stimulus distribution, not a gradual shift towards the mean. Results are consistent with behavioral findings and predictions across distributions, timings, intervals, and dynamics in working areas. A set of human psychophysics experiments validated the model on auditory parametric working memory.
Researchers investigated the role of PD-LIM-containing protein 2 (PIM2) as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer and its potential as a target for cancer therapy. They found that PIM is repressed in lung cancer and contributes to chemotherapy and immunotherapy resistance. Using human samples and a mouse models, they studied PIM genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer and the efficacy of systemically administered PIM expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPIM) combined with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Results showed PIM repression in lung cancer is due to genetic and epigenetic alterations. NanoIM showed low toxicity, high specificity, antitumor activity, and improved efficacy of PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in remaining mice by triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoIM increased major histocompatibility complex I (MHC) expression, multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR) induction and survival and tumor-related genes in cells, and enhanced lymphocyte infiltration, turning tumors hot and sensitive to ICs and chemotherapeutic and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (IL) unleashed by IC. These studies established a clinically applicable PIM-based therapy for lung and possibly other cancers.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms that regulate an animal's ability to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior in challenging environments. They developed a low-quality food assay using heat-killed E. coli (HK-E. coli) and low-sugar food, which triggered an unfolded protein response (UPR) and immune response in animals, causing them to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPR (IRE-1/XBP-1) innate immunity (p38MAPK) axis, particularly neuronal function, regulating feeding behaviors. This system is crucial for survival in natural environments. Animals can adapt to low-quality food through sugar supplementation, inhibiting UPR-p38 regulated response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. The study reveals the role of cellular stress pathway in physiological evaluation of nutritional deficiencies in food, enhancing survival.
Researchers investigated the role of carbohydrates in modulating G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), specifically the P2 purinoceptor 14 (P2Y14), which plays a crucial role in inflammation and immune responses. Using molecular dynamics simulations and functional studies, they identified a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugar binding site on P2 and found that UDP-glucose activates the receptor by bridging transmembrane (TM) helices 2 and 7. A conserved salt-bridging chain (K2.60-D.64-K7.35-E.36KD) was identified, distinguishing UDP-sugars including UDP-glucose, UDPgalactose, UDPgluronic acid, and UDP-acetylglucamine. The KD chain was found to be a conserved motif for sugar binding in P2 and P purinoceptor 12 (P2), leading to the design of sugar nucleotides as agonists for P2. This study expands understanding of purergic receptor activation and provides insights for carbohydrate-based drug development for GPCs.
Researchers have investigated the role of glial cells in regulating the behavior of Drosophila neural stem cells, specifically Neuroblasts (NBs), which are encased by glial cells. The study reveals that glial cells produce ferritin, which cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for energy production, essential for self-renewal and proliferation. Knockdown of glial ferritin genes leads to energy shortage in NB via downregulation of aconitase and NAD+ levels, resulting in low proliferation and premature differentiation of NB mediated by Prospero entering. Ferritin is a potential tumor suppressor. Glial ferritin levels are affected by NB status, establishing a cellular iron homeostasis. This study demonstrates glial cells are indispensable for NB self-renew, unveiling a novel role of glial niche in brain development.
Researchers investigated the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 mortality in the US population during the pandemic. They analyzed mortality data from multiple causes of death for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease, accounting for potential changes in coding practices. Nationally, cancer mortality rose by 3% in 2020 compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, resulting in approximately 13,600 excess deaths. Mortality was higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematological) than poor survival cancers (lung, pancreatic). In contrast, diabetes and Alzheimer's deaths increased by 37% and 19, respectively. To understand these differences, the researchers simulated expected mortality for each condition using COVID-19 rates, life expectancy, population size, and age of individuals with each condition. The observed differences were primarily explained by life expectancy, with risk of death from deadly cancers exceeding COVID-19 risk.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loops, a type of transcriptional byproduct, from eukaryotic genomes. R-loops consist of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA, and their effects on health and disease are well established. However, the cellular processes responsible for their removal were not fully understood. The study found that the Smc/6 complex, a regulator of chromosome architecture, plays a key role in removing R-loops formed during transcription. Yeast mutants lacking the Sm/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution showed synthetic lethality and high levels of RNA-DNA structures in their chromosomes. The Sm/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrids in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by RNase in vitro. The results reveal a crucial role for Sm/6 in removing R-lo at highly transcribed genes and telomeres.
Researchers investigated the relationship between preserved cognitive abilities and age-related sensory decline in hearing loss, specifically focusing on whether preserved attentional neural filtering can compensate for the loss of sensory acuity in older adults. They analyzed electroencephalographic and behavioral data from 105 individuals aged 39-82 years to examine the longitudinal stability of this compensatory brain-behavior link and its predictive power for individual change in listening behavior. 

Results showed that despite expected decline in hearing-derived sensory acuity, listening performance remained stable over 2 years. However, neural and behavioral measures were correlated only at separate time points, not longitudinally. This suggests that attention-guided neural metrics are not reliable predictors of individual trajectories in listening behavior, as neither filtering at baseline nor its 2-year change could predict 2-year behavioral change under combined modeling.
Researchers investigated the role of chemosensation, the combination of taste and smell, in the perception of flavor, in relation to the use of medicinal plants in ancient Greece and Rome. Chemosensation enables animals to detect high-value foods and avoid toxins, and humans have learned to use unpalatable and toxic substances as medicines. However, the importance of chemosensation in this process is poorly understood. The study generated taste panel data for drugs and applied phylogenetic generalized linear models to test whether intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities, as well as tastes, can predict ancient Greek and Roman drug use. Results showed chemos to be strongly predictive of therapeutic use: drugs with high versatility have simple tastes and intense flavors, and 21-22 chemosens qualities predicted at least therapeutic use. In addition to bitter, musky, sweet, and soapy drugs associated with versatility. Ancient Greeks and Romans believed illness arose from imbalance bodily humors, yet study suggests uses based on observed effects consistent with modern chemesthesis and taste pharmacology.
Bacteria of the Enterobacteriaceae family, including non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, Escherichia, and Citrobacter, are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and bacteremia and are a leading cause of death from sepsis in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. These bacteria are prone to entering the bloodstream, but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Researchers used an injection-based microfluidics device to simulate GI bleeding and found that femtoliter volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction to the source. This response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and chemoattract L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum recognized by chemoreceptor T. Crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimium Tsr with L-ser were identified, revealing a conserved amino motif for L-ser among Tsr orthologs. Tsr is conserved among Enterobacteraceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens with bloodstream infections. Enterobacteraceae use serum as a nutrient source for growth and chemaxis and chemore T provide a competitive advantage for migration into hemorrhagic lesions.
Male cells across different animal species share a common origin and likely retain a conserved genetic program that defines their cellular identity. However, the unique dynamics of male cells and their widespread leaky transcription make it challenging to identify the core spermatogenic program. Researchers analyzed the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species to describe the conserved origin of metazoan male cells at the molecular level. They found that the average metazoan male cell requires the expression of approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes, a third of which are deeply conserved genes retained throughout evolution. A set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene regulators represents a core of the conserved program of metazo spermatogenesis. Interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male cell identity revealed 161 previously unknown sperogenesis genes and three potential causes of human infertility.
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model organism for studying flagellate motility, employs synchronous, breast-like flagellar beating to swim and modulate beating amplitudes to steer. This strategy relies on inherent flagellar asymmetries, such as differential responses to chemical messengers and asymmetries, effectively coordinated in synchronous beating. The synchrony of beating in C. reinhardtii is supported by a mechanical connection between flagella, but how flagellar asymmetries persist in synchrony remains elusive. It has been speculated that one flagellum leads beating, as its dynamic properties appear to be copied by the other. This study combines experiments, computations, and modeling to elucidate the roles of each flagellum in synchronous beating. A non-invasive technique selectively loads each flagell, showing coordinated beating only responds to load on flagellum; asymmetry derives from unilateral coupling between flagella. Results highlight distinct role each flagell in coordination and implications for biflagellates' tactic behaviors.
Researchers investigated the underlying mechanisms behind the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting and found that it promotes the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22) by type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3), leading to the browning of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of IL3 cells increased the browning of white adipose tissue in diet-induced obese mice. Exogenous IL-22 also increased the browning of subcutaneous whiteose tissue. Deficiency of IL-22 receptor (ILR) attenuated the browning induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of intestinal cells revealed intermittent increased aryl hydrocarbon signaling in IL3. Analysis of cell-cell receptor interactions indicated intermittent stimulated IL3 with dendritic and macrophages.
Researchers investigated the role of associative and non-associative mechanisms in defensive responses in mice using a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm. Mice were exposed to a compound stimulus (S) consisting of a tone and white noise (WN) paired with footshock. The paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone and jumping and darting during WN. In contrast, unpaired and reversed S groups showed less tone-induced freezing and rarely jumped or darted during WN. During extinction, the paired group's tone-induced freezing decreased and shifted to a combination of freezing and darting, while unpaired, unpaired, and shock-only groups displayed tail-rattling and darting with minimal jumping. The reversed group did not jump to WN and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction.
Insects navigate their environment by tracking their orientation, and previous research has shown that they encode direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding is an evolutionary coincidence or offers a functional advantage. To address this question, the study establishes the mathematical requirements for direction encoding and shows it can be performed by various circuits with different patterns. Among these patterns, the sinusoidal is the most resilient when coupled with sinusoidal connectivity between neurons. The optimal pattern is compared with anatomical data from locust and fruit fly head circuits, agreeing with evidence. The circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying connectivity not encoded in genetic program but emerges during development. The eight-column organisation of head circuits across species is not a chance but explained by evolutionary principles.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations in the PTEN kinase 1 (PINK) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which play crucial roles in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CIS1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulf-binding protein, is a target of Park-mediated ubiquitination. Research has shown that CIS1 forms dimers in Pink mutant flies and dopaminergic neurons from PINK patients. These dimers consist of two monomers covalently linked by a disulfide, rendering CIS unable to coordinate the iron-sulf cofactor. Overexpression of Cisd, the Drosophila ortholog of CIS1, and a mutant incapable of binding the ironulf cluster, resulted in reduced Dophila climbing ability and lifespan. This effect was more pronounced in Cisd and Pink mutant flies. Conversely, complete loss of C rescued detrimental effects of Pink mutation on climbing ability, posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure.
A study investigated the role of the virulence protein SAP54 produced by the parasitic phytoplasma in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP54 is responsible for inducing leaf-like flowers in phytopma-infected plants, but previous research showed that insects were attracted to leaves, not the leaf-like flowers. This study found that exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction, suggesting a response that distinguishes leafopper sex in the presence of SAP. In contrast, phytopma effector alongside leafopper discourages female colonization. SAP suppresses biotic stress pathways in leaves exposed to males. The host MADS transcription factor vegetative phase (SVP) emerges as key in leafopper preference for exposed plants to SAP, with SAP promoting SVP degradation. Preference extends to colonization of male-exposed SVP mutant plants over not exposed. Research demonstrates dual role of phytopma effector SAP in host alteration and attraction integral to phy cycle. SAP targets SVP, heightening leafopper vulnerability to males, facilitating attraction and subsequent colonization by insects. SAP acts as molecular'match', helping leafoppers locate mates by degrading S-containing leaves. This study provides insights into parasite extended phenotypes and transcription factors regulating plant processes intersecting with plant-insect interactions.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen, poses a significant threat to health and socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments fail, in part, due to C. albicans' ability to initiate a drug tolerance response, allowing some cells to grow at concentrations above minimal inhibitory. To characterize this cytoprotective program at single-cell level, a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics was used to profile thousands of fungal cells and establish subpopulation characteristics in absence and presence of antif drugs. Untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression correlating cell stage with metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days-fluconazole exposure, when tolerance measurable, cells bifurcate into two subpopulations: Ribo-domin (Rd) and Stressomin (S) states. R-d state characterized upregulates ribosomal proteins, RNA machinery, and mitochondrial capacity, while S state enriched stress responses and processes. Bifcation persists 3 and 6 days-treatment. Ribosome stress response (RR) activated in subpopulations may facilitate survival.
The Neutral theory of molecular evolution suggests that the effectiveness of selection varies among species. In an idealized models, population size determines the minimum selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be purged and neutral diversity. Empirical estimates of effective population size are often based on putatively neutral genetic diversity and assumed to capture species' effectiveness. A direct measure of selection effectiveness is the degree to which selection maintains codons. However, past metrics comparing cod bias across species are confounded by variation in GC content and amino acid composition. A new Codon Adaptation Index Species (CAIS) is proposed, based on Kull-Leibler divergence, correcting for confounders. CAIS and Effective Number of Codons show protein domains of highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher structural disorder.
Seps is a leading cause of millions of deaths worldwide, declared a global health priority by the WHO, resulting from dysregulated immune responses. Inflammation plays a key role, with extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an important mediator, released by inflamed host cells and bacteria in a strain-dependent manner. This study investigates bacterial ATP release mechanisms using Escherichia coli (E) mutants, demonstrating ATP synthase-dependent release within the inner membrane and outer membrane integrity contributing to release, associated with bacterial death. In a mouse sepsis model, local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using E. coli with an arabin-inducible periplasmic apyrase, hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abating bacterial release shows ATP suppresses local immune responses, reducing neutrophil counts and survival. Additionally, ATP has systemic effects via outer membrane vesicles (OMV). ATP-loaded OM are distributed throughout the body, upregulating degranulation genes in neutils, potentially exacerbating seps severity.
Researchers investigated the relationship between psychotic-like experiences (PLE) in children and the risk of developing psychosis and other mental disorders, as well as the role of genetic and environmental factors in mediating this relationship. They used large-scale longitudinal data from 6,602 children in the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Study to examine the impact of genetic and environmental factors, such as family and neighborhood environment, on cognitive abilities and PLE. The study found that lower intelligence and higher PLE were associated with lower polygenic scores for cognitive phenotypes, lower family socioeconomic status, neighborhood, and less supportive environments. Intelligence mediated the effects of these factors on PLE, with positive parenting and school environments showing the strongest impact in reducing PLE. The study highlights the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLE through their effects on intelligence. The findings suggest that improving school and family environments and promoting economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children.
Researchers used human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiP)-derived cerebral organoids as an in vitro model to investigate the role of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) signaling in early telencephalic development. They found that F8 treatment increased cellular heterogeneity, leading to the formation of distinct telenceph and mesencephalic domains within multi-regional organoids. In the telenceph regions, F8 affected the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, impacting spontaneous network activity. F8 also modulated key regulators associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders.
Researchers have investigated the development of circadian rhythms in Drosophila, specifically focusing on the role of nutritional status in sleep-wake patterns. In the early stages of life, sleep and feeding behaviors are not synchronized, but by the 3rd instar larval stage, a daily pattern emerges. Forcing 3rd instar larvae to adopt 2nd instar feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and long-term memory (LTM) ability. The development of the clock circuit is influenced by larval nutritional environment. Arousal neurons (Dh44) drive daily sleepake through glucose metabolism.
Researchers investigated the energetic benefits of collective movement in a school of fish, specifically the giant danio (Devarioequipatus), by measuring both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions. The study found that schools exhibit a concave-shaped metabolism-speed curve, with a minimum metabolic cost at approximately 1 body length per second. Compared to solitary fish, schools reduced total energy expenditure (TEE) per tail beat by up to 56%. When swimming at maximum sustained speed, fish in schools showed 44% higher aerobic performance and 65% less anaerobic energy, resulting in a 53% decrease in TEE and cost of transport, the lowest recorded in aquatic organisms. Schools also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish.
Human alveolar macrophages (AM) are the predominant immune cells in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection, making them a target for host-directed therapy. Macrophage effector functions are associated with cellular metabolism. This study examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. Human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong glycolytic response to IF-γ stimulation. IF-γ enhanced energetics in both AM and M by upregulating glycol and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon stimulation, AM did not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike M which shifted to 'Warburg-like' metabolism. IF-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycol with 2-deglucose reduced IF- driven cytokine production in AM, indicating IF- induces plasticity in AM mechanistically mediated by glycol. Direct comparing macroages, AM were more responsive to IF-priming and dependent gly for cytokine secretion than M. TNF was under control of gly in AM and not M. M exhibited glycol-dependent upregulation HLA-DR and CD40 whereas IF- up HLA and CD on AM independently gly. These indicate human are functionally plastic and respond IF- in manner from M. Data provide that human are tractable target for inhalable immunomod therapies respiratory diseases.
Researchers have discovered that nocturnal bull ants use the polarized pattern produced by the moon for navigation. Unlike the sun, which can be obstructed by clouds or the horizon, the moon can still provide directional information through its polarized light. The sun produces polarized light across the sky as it enters the atmosphere, and polarized light is a known cue for navigating animals. The moon produces a similar pattern, albeit much dimmer than sunlight. The study shows that polarized moonlight is part of the nocturnal ants' celestial compass. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely on solar polarization to navigate. However, when the sun cannot guide them, they return home at night using polarized moonlight. The research demonstrates that ants use polarized moonlight to navigate by rotating the overhead pattern, altering their headings in response. Ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar cycle, even under crescent moons with low polarized levels. The study also shows long-term incorporation of moonlight into ants' path integration for homing, as sunlight is incorporated during the day.
Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, with early pterosaurs possessing long tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin vane that would compromise aerodynamic efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane was crucial for early pter flight, but how this was achieved has been unclear, as vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and absent in birds and bats. Researchers used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence to reveal a cross-link lattice within the vanes of early pter. The lattice supported a dynamic tension system to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the tail to augment flight control and v function as display.
During adolescence, significant changes occur in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making, which are essential for transitioning into adulthood but also increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. The reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie these changes and increased vulnerability. This study used fast cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine dopamine release and mechanisms in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) core of adolescent (28-35) and adult (70) male rats. Baseline differences were found between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release in rats, as well as opposite effects of α nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACh) on dopamine release. The α-selective blocker, α-conoto, increased dopamine in adolescent rats but decreased in adult rats. Blockade of GABA and GAB receptors revealed α-mediated increase in adolescent release requires N GABA signaling. In vivo microdial confirmed the role of αA and G in mediating this effect. A multisynaptic mechanism unique to adolescence involves acetylcholine at α-containingA to inhibit GABA on dopamine release.
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by distinct behavioral traits, suggesting shared underlying pathogenic mechanisms. However, its vast clinical and etiological heterogeneity indicates diverse phenotypes. Recent studies using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have found that individuals with two distinct ASD subtypes, idiopathic and 16p.2 deletion, exhibit reduced neural precursor cell (NPC) neurite outgrowth and migration, despite no genetic overlap between datasets. To identify contributing signaling differences, an unbiased phospho-proteome screen was performed. Surprisingly, hundreds of shared peptides were identified between subtypes, including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling was confirmed in NPCs across ASD subtypes and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and autism-associated NPC phenotypes in controls. This study demonstrates that distinct ASD subtypes have common neurite outgrowth and migration defects driven by shared pathogenic mTOR dysregulation.
Researchers have investigated the neural diversity of afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) in the cochlea, a key components of the auditory system responsible for sound processing. The study aimed to bridge the gap in understanding between synaptic heterogeneity and neural diversity by recording IHC and postsynaptic SGN boutons in a controlled conditions mimicking in vivo conditions. 

 Results showed that synapses with high spontaneous release rates (SR) were predominantly located on the pillar side of IHC, characterized by larger and more temporally compact excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), lower thresholds, tighter coupling of calcium channels and vesicular release sites, shorter latencies, and higher release rates. This indicates that synaptic heterogeneity in IHC directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGN.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Micchidia (MOR) protein in the lifecycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This protein has been implicated in chromatin compaction and gene silencing in various organisms. The study used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and molecular genomics to demonstrate that PfOR modulates chromatin structure and heterochrom formation throughout the erythrocytic cycle and is essential for parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) showed PfOR binds to subtelomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation. Protein knockdown followed by chromatin capture (Hi-C) studies showed downregulation of PfOR impairs histone marks and collapses heterochatin structure leading to parasite death. These findings confirm PfOR plays a role in chromatin and gene regulation, making it a candidate for antimalarial strategies.
Researchers investigated the impact of tumor-infiltrating nerves on mental health changes in cancer patients, using a mouse model of head and neck cancer. They found that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas and activate neuronal circuitry, leading to altered behaviors such as decreased nesting, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced running. Tumor-infiltrating nocicept neurons exhibited heightened activity and brain regions receiving these projections showed increased Fos and calcium compared to non-tumor counterparts. Elimination of nocicept neurons decreased Fos and mitigated behavioral alterations induced by tumor presence. Analesic treatment restored nesting and cookie behaviors, but not wheel running, indicating pain is not sole driver of behavioral shifts.
Researchers analyzed the genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact on the multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. They found that variations in the physicochemical properties of its intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) allow for plasticity, but also impose functional constraints similar to those in coronaviruses. Experiments with N-protein species carrying mutations associated with variants showed that point mutations in IDRs can modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid separation. In the Omic variant, distant mutations in IDRs have compensatory effects, shifting the balance of interactions controlling assembly and creating a new protein-protein interface through the P13 mutation. The study reveals significant variation in biophysical characteristics of Nprotein species, particularly in IDRs.
Researchers investigated the changes in skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency during hibernation in small and large mammal species to optimize energy utilization. They isolated muscle fibers from hibernators, Ictomys trcematus and Eliom quinus, and larger hibernators Ursus arctos and Ursus american, and conducted Mant-AT chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure myos dynamics and ATP demand. Proteomics analyses were also performed. Results showed preservation of myos structure in Ursus arct and american during hibernation, but changes in myos metabolic states in I trcematus and quinus led to higher energy expenditure in type II, fast-twitch muscle at 20°C. Loaded-ATP chase experiments at 8°C revealed reduced myos ATP in type II fibers by 77-107% during torpor compared to active periods. My2-hyperphosphorylation was observed in trcematus during tor, stabilizing the myos molecule. This may mitigate myos-associated increases in muscle expenditure during tor in response to cold. Myos is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to changes in ATP consumption.
Researchers have investigated the role of chondrocy columns in bone elongation, which are a hallmark of growth plate architecture, in mouse embryos and postnatal mice. Chondrocy columns are formed through clonal expansion and rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells parallel to the growth direction. A 3D imaging and morphometric analysis of hundreds of confetti clones in growth plates revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. 

Morphological analysis showed that embryonic clones were elongated but formed clusters perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of postnatal growth plates revealed complex columns composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks and small disorganized clusters at the edges. The correlation between temporal dynamics of ratios between clusters and columns and bone elongation expansion suggests clusters promote expansion while columns elongation. The findings support the idea that modulation of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocy determines formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design regulating morphogenesis throughout pre and postnatal growth.
Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are a class of proteins of great interest in pharmaceutical research due to their promiscuous substrate binding site, which has been linked to improved bioavailability of several drug classes. Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogen kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the electrochemical gradient. Recent cryo-EM and alpha-fold models have provided new insights into conformation states of mammalian POTs SLC15A1 and SLC2. However, these studies left open questions regarding mechanism of proton and coupling, while providing opportunity to investigate using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study employed unbiased enhanced-sampling MD to map SLC2 conformation cycle and thermodynamic forces. Conformation free landscapes were computed in proton states in presence or absence of peptide, identifying sequence protonation steps driving inward access. Simulations revealed differences extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POT, validated in cell-based assays. Results from constant-P MD and absolute free energy (ABE) calculations established mechanistic link between binding and recognition, revealing details secondary active transport POT. This study advances understanding proton-coupled peptide transport in mammals, integrating knowledge solute biology with drug design to target and bioavailability.
Researchers investigated the neural responses in the auditory cortex during vocalization across various species, including humans, to understand the hypothesis that suppression of auditory responses enables detection of vocal errors. This hypothesis was previously confirmed in non-human primates, but not in humans. To address this, intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were obtained from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production. The study characterized the topography of auditory suppression in the superior temporal gyrus (ST), which varied across participants. A delayed feedback (DF) task was performed to determine if suppressed sites were sensitive to auditory alterations. Results showed overlapping sites with enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity. A strong correlation was found between suppression and feedback sensitivity, suggesting suppression may underlie speech monitoring. When participants produced speech with auditory feedback, posterior ST was selectively activated in the DF paradigm, indicating attentional load modulated feedback sensitivity.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive census of McrBC systems, a type of prokaryotic IV restriction systems, and performed phylogenetic analysis, revealing their abundance and diversity in prokaryotes and genomic associations. They focused on a previously uncharacterized branch, denoted as coiled-coil nuclease tandems (CoNuTs), characterized by extensive coiled structures and nucleases. Three types and subtypes of CoNu were identified, with predicted interactions with translation components, such as OB-fold domains resembling SSB protein binding to tmRNA, Y-like domains recognizing methylated tmRNA, tRNA, or rRNA, and RNA-binding Hsp chaper homologs, and RNases like HEP domains, suggesting CoNu target RNA. Some CoNu also target DNA via McC nuclease homologs. Restriction systems like Type I, RM, BRE, and Type III are encoded in same superons. Many superons contain CoNu regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly RNA fragments with cyclic termini binding CAR (CRIS-Associated Rosann Fold) domains. The authors hypothesize CoNu, with ancillary factors, employ an echoned defense strategy, similar to Type CRIS-C systems, eliminating DNA/RNA first, then aborting infection via host cleavage.
Calcineur, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase, plays a crucial role in various cellular processes in Caenorhabditis elegans. Research has shown that inhibiting calcineur extends the lifespan of C. elegans through multiple pathways. To investigate calcine's role in innate immunity, its involvement in the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) of C. elegans was examined. Calcine is required for the DMP, and its inhibition leads to defects, resulting in intestinal bloating, gut colonization by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to infection. Intestinal bloating caused by calcine inhibition mimics calorie restriction, enhancing lifespan. The TF ortholog, HL-30, is necessary for lifespan extension mediated by calcine inhibition. NHR-8, a nuclear receptor, is upregulated by calcine inhibition and required for increased lifespan. This study reveals calcine's role in C. elegans DMP and a mechanism for calcine inhibition-mediated longevity.
Researchers investigated how the brain resolves conflicts between task-relevant and task-irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior. Conflicts can arise from various sources, such as sensory or internal representations, and a limited set of cognitive processes can effectively address diverse conflicts remains a challenge. According to the cognitive theory, conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a low-dimensional space, which can be resolved by a set of control processes along dimensions. This leads to the hypothesis that conflicts with similar sources are also represented in space. A task was designed with five types of conflicts that can be conceptually parameterized. Human performance and fMRI activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supported that types of conflicts are organized based on similarity, suggesting space as a principle for representing conflicts.
Preterm birth is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, with most cases occurring spontaneously due to preterm labor with intact (preterm labor) or ruptured (pre rupture of membranes). The prediction of spontaneous preterm birth remains underpowered due to its complex nature and lack of understanding of the host immune response. This study investigated the vaginal immune mediators, referred to as the immunoprote, in a population at risk for preterm birth. Vaginal swabs were collected across gestation from pregnant women who underwent term, preterm labor, or preterm rupture of membranes. Cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides were quantified via specific and sensitive immunoass. Predictive models constructed from mediator concentrations.

Throughout uncomplicated gestation, the immunrote harbors a cytokine network with homeostatic profile. However, the immunrote is skewed towards a pro-inflammatory in women who experience preterm and preterm rupture of membranes. This profile includes monocyte chemoatants, cytokines indicative macrophage and T-cell activation and reduced antimicrobial peptides. The immunrote has predictive value over maternal alone identifying at risk for early preterm birth. The immunrote undergoes changes throughout gestation and deviations associated with preterm. Furthermore, the immun can be leveraged as biomarker early preterm, subset associated adverse neonatal outcomes.
Researchers have developed a computational model, known as the "Hernandez-Hern model," to study the electrical and calcium (Ca2+) signaling in smooth muscle cells lining the walls of mammalian systemic arteries and arterioles. This model is based on experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female myocytes from murine resistance arteries. The model reveals the fundamental mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling during the development of myogenic tone in arterial vessels. 

The model suggests that the Kv1.5 current is the dominant regulating membrane potential in male myocytes, while Kv.2.1 channels play a primary role in female myocytes due to their larger expression and longer activation time constants. Over the physiological range of membrane potentials, a small number of voltage-gated K+ and L-type Ca2 channels drive sex differences in intracellular Ca+ and excitability. The model also predicts that female arterial muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used Ca2 blockers compared to male. 

The Hernandez-Hern model provides a framework to investigate the sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs.
Researchers investigated the relationship between litter decomposition and precipitation, considering the varying moisture dependencies of decomposers of different sizes. They hypothesized that macrodecomposers' tolerance to aridity would counterbalance the effect of smaller decompos, leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients. To test this, they placed litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a precipitation gradient and characterized macrocomposer assemblages using pitfall trapping. Decomposers responded differently to precipitation based on size, with microbial decomposition increasing with precipitation in winter and macrodecomposition peaking in arid sites during summer. This resulted in similar decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyperarid sites. Macrocomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a type of pancreatic cancer, has a poor prognosis with high rates of metastasis and limited treatment options. Activation of the KRAS gene in most tumors drives RAC1 activation, leading to increased migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropocytosis. Macropocytosis is known as a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but its role in trafficking of signaling receptors is not well understood. Research found that CY-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumors in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of Cy, the gene encoding CY-B protein, accelerates tumorigenesis, leading to ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancer lesions, indicating a role as a buffer of RAC activation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CY inhibits metastasis. CY-B depleted tumor cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysosphatidic acid, a driver of tumor spread, due to impaired macinocytic uptake of lysosphatidic receptor. Overall, implicates CY-B as mediator of growth and signaling in pancreatic cancer, providing insights into controlling metastasis.
Researchers have identified 145 HERV-HML-2 proviruses in rhes macaques, including a clade of young, rhes-specific insertions. The age, open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions suggest recent or ongoing activity in macques. The provuses form a clade characterized by ~750 sequence between env and 3 long terminal repeat (LTR) derived from ancient recombination with HER-HML-8-related virus. This clade found in Old World (OW) but not great apes, suggesting it originated after ape/OW split. Similar provuses found in white-cheek gibbons, gibbon insert cluster within OW recombinant cl, indicating interspecies from OW to gibbons. LTR of youngest provuses deletions U3, disrupt Response Element (RE) for nuclear export unspliced RNA. H-8 region functions as Rec-independent constitutive transport (CTE), indicating ancestral–RE export system replaced by CT mechanism.
Researchers investigated the role of Enterococcus faecalis in wound infections, which can lead to delayed or failed healing and significant morbidity. They used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to compare infected and uninfected wounds in a mouse model, examining over 23,000 cells. The study created a comprehensive atlas of the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of wounds, revealing unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds. The analysis showed distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to normal healing process. Keratinocytes and fibroblast transcriptomes were dysregulated in response to infection, creating an anti-inflammatory environment. Enterococcus faalis prompted premature epithelial-mesymal transition in keratinocytes. It also modulated M2 macrophage polarization, inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro and in vivo. The RNA-seq atlas showed macrophage cstalk with neutrophils, regulating chemokine signaling and promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of volatile communication between herbivore-att-attacked and undamaged plants using a custom-built high-throughput proton transfer time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) system. The study focused on maize plants exposed to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles and found that neighboring plants exhibited a temporal response characterized by an induced terpene burst on the second day of exposure. This burst was not due to terpene accumulation during the night, but coincided with jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The burst occurred independently of day-night transitions and could not be fully explained by sender dynamics. Instead, it resulted from a memory of volatile exposure during the first day and secondary to bioactive volatiles on the second. The study revealed that prolonged exposure to natural stress-induced volatiles resulted in a response integrating priming and induction into a distinct temporal pattern.
Researchers have investigated the vocalizations of wild orangutans to determine if they exhibit recursive structures similar to those found in human language and music. They found that male orangutans produce rhythmic call sequences within rhythmic call sequences, forming a hierarchical structure with two strata. The lower stratum contains distinct rhythms not related to the overarching rhythm of the higher stratum, indicating that these structures are not the result of non-hierarchical processes or anatomical constraints. This is the first evidence of recursive vocal combinatorics in a non-human species without syntax, semantics, phonology, or music. The study suggests that hierarchical and cyclic vocal structures in ancient hominids may have preceded the evolution of recursion in modern human language.
A study on the interaction between the MDA receptor and 5'pp-RNA virus in the lower vertebrate Miichthys mii reveals insights into the evolutionary arms race between hosts and viruses. The loss of RIG-I in vertebrates led to the search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation (HDCR) being the primary pathway. Analysis showed that MDA in Miichys and Gallus, a homolog of R-I, can replace R-I in recognizing 5'pp-R virus, potentially leading to R-I loss from the genome during evolution. The study also found that 5pp-R virus utilizes the m6A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA and weaken its antiviral ability, promoting its replication and immune evasion. This research provides a snapshot of the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, highlighting ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to the diversity of the immune system.
A study investigated the relationship between follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and body composition changes in men undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (AD) for prostate cancer. Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in a phase IV study from 2017 to 2019 and received luteinizing hormone-releasing antagonist degare. Body fat mass (FBM), lean mass (LBM), and bone density (BMD) were measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptometry at baseline and after 12 months of AD. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months.

At baseline, a weak, non-significant relationship was found between FSH levels and FB in arms and legs. However, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FB, fat in arms, and fat trunk after 12 months. An inverse relationship between FSH and appendicular lean index/FBM was observed. This study suggests FSH levels after AD may impact body composition, particularly FB. FSH could be a marker for monitoring sarcopenic obesity and guiding clinicians in evaluating body composition in patients undergoing AD.
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on targeting sarcolem ion channels, none have proven effective in preventing SC. Sarcasmicoplasmic ryanine receptor 2 (Ry2) Ca+ release channels, downstream of sarlem ion channels, are underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive species (ROS)-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of Ry2 in pathophysiology of SC. This study tested hypothesis that Ry2 inhibition in failing hearts reduces sarcasmic Ca+ leak and repolarization, mitigates VT/SCD and improves contractile function. Guinea pig model replicates clinical aspects of nonchemic HF, such as prolonged QT, high arrhythmic SC, and Ca+ via hyperactive Ry2. Animals were randomized to dantene (DS) or placebo in early HF. Primary outcome was incidence VT/SC, ECG heart rate and variability, echocardi left ventricular (LV) function, immunohisto LV fibrosis and sarcasm Ry2 oxidation. DS prevented VTSC by decreasing repolar and vent arrhythmias, lowered heart rate, preserved chronotropic during β-adnergic challenge, improved heart variability and function. Inhibition Ry2 with dene mitigates vicious cycle sarcasm Ca+ leak increases diolic Ca and ROS Ry oxidation, reducing repolar and protecting VTSC. Consequent increase sarcasm Ca+ improves contractile function.
Researchers have investigated the transcriptional responses of cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF) family, specifically the conserved bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the BMP2 ortholog DB-1 regulates body size through a receptor-Smad signaling cascade. This study identified functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcription partner SMA-9/Sur based on ChIP-seq peaks and RNA-seq analysis of mutants. SMA-3 and SMA-9 have overlapping and unique target genes, with SMA-3/Sm acting as a transcriptional activator and SMA-9/Sur targeting both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sm-9 partially suppress the body size phenotype of sm-3, suggesting antagonism between factors. Functional analysis of targets revealed a role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and endoplasmic retic (ER) secretory pathway, including disulf reductase-11. The study indicates Smads and SMA-9/Sur have complex interactions regulating secretion of extracellular components like collagen into cuticle mediating body regulation.
Researchers have identified the embryonic transcription factor DUX as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation, which is aberrantly expressed in a subset of primary tumors. DUX expression is found in approximately 10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers. In a cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients, DUX expression is associated with immune exclusion and decreased response to PD-1 blockade. DUX expression is a significant predictor of survival, even accounting for tumor mutational burden and clinical features, with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year.
Livestock abortion is a significant disease affecting livestock productivity and public health in Africa, with various pathogens associated but limited surveillance data on its causes and impacts. To address this knowledge gap, a surveillance platform was established in Tanzania to investigate causes and impacts of abortion in pastoral, agro-pastoral, and smallholder systems. Livestock abortion events were reported by farmers to livestock field officers (LFO) and investigated by research teams within 72 hours. Samples and data were collected to investigate (a) determinants of attribution, (b) patterns of events including species, breed, previous history, and seasonality, (c) determinants of reporting and attribution, and (d) zoonotic cases. Between 2017-2019, 215 events in cattle (n=71), sheep (n=44), and goats (n=100) were investigated. Attribution was achieved in 19.5% of cases, significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to sample deterioration. Vaginal swabs provided practical material for pathogen detection. This study demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system through community-based field officers, sample collection, and molecular platforms.
Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for the development and progression of various diseases, with nicotine (NIC) being a major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, the mechanisms underlying NIC's regulation of stem cell functions are not well understood. This study demonstrates that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. NIC induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcriptional coactivator with PDZ motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISC via α-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and protein kinase (PKC) activation, but not in Paneth cells. Inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzine (DB) nullifies NIC's effects on ISC. NIC enhances in vivo tumor formation from ISC loss of tumor suppressor APC, DB inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. This study identifies NIC-activated pathway regulating stemness and tumorigenicity ISC and suggests dibine as potential therapeutic for intestinal tumors.
Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) plays a crucial role in counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, which is associated with stress, aging, and disease. It facilitates protein solubilization and refolding through substrate binding and release, regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). This study elucidates the collaborative impact of Hsp NEFs and different JDP classes on H70-dependent aggregate processing. Results show that H70 plays a major role in initial stages of disaggregation, determining its efficacy. NE catalyzes the recruitment of H70 onto aggregate surface, modifying aggregates into smaller species processed by chaper. H70 stimulation by H is stronger with class B than A JDP and requires interaction between B and H70 EE motif. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that H disrupts J-H interaction, destabilizing chaper complexes at aggregate surface, improving disaggregation but inhibiting substoichi H optimum. The interplay between coaper and H70 is critical to unlock disaggreg potential.
Researchers have explored the use of digital insoles to analyze gait in patients with musculoskeletal conditions, such as osteoarthritis, as a potential alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis. Clinical gait relies on visual observation, but is limited by the need for expensive equipment, large facilities, and trained staff. Digital insoles offer a solution to these challenges. A machine learning model was trained on force plate data from participants with osteoarthritis and controls, achieving high accuracy in predicting force data from a validation set (AUROC=0.86, AUPR=0.90) and an independent insole dataset (AU=0.83,AR=0.86). This demonstrates digital insole-derived gait characteristics are comparable to traditional g measurements. Further, a single stride of sensor data was accurately assigned to each subject, indicating individuals can be identified by g characteristics. This work provides a framework for alternative clinical g methods, contributes to wearable technology pipelines, and supports at-home assessments, potentially improving ease, frequency, and depth of monitoring.
Researchers have identified a potential non-opioid therapy for managing post-surgical pain using a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, Clarix Flo (FLO), which attenuated post-surgical hypersensitivity without opioid side effects in mice. LO inhibited nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DR) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. The major component, heavy-chondrocytic acid/paxin 3 (HCAX), was purified from AM with higher purity and solubility than LO. HCAX replicated LO-induced neuronal pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HCAX-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements inhibited sodium and high-voltage activated current on nocice DR neurons.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the pigmentation of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and their function by analyzing the color intensity of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE (iPSC-R) and their gene expression profiles at the single-cell level. To achieve this, they utilized the Automated Live and Picking System (ALPS), which enabled photographing each cell before RNA-sequencing to analyze the gene expression of each cell. The results showed that iPSC-R cells were categorized into four clusters based on gene expression, but color intensity did not correlate with specific gene profiles. This suggests a lack of direct correlation between color and gene expression that defines pigmentation level, leading to the hypothesis that R cell color may not strongly indicate functional characteristics of PE.
Researchers in the field of neuroscience have increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in their natural environments to gain a deeper understanding of ethologically relevant processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmet (Callithrix jacch) has emerged as a key model for this effort due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans. However, traditional research methods often fail to capture the nuances of marmet social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this gap, a novel apparatus, the Marmet Apparatus for Automated Pulling (MAAP), was developed to study cooperative behaviors in commonmets. MAAP enables high-throughput, detailed behavioral outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more comprehensive analysis in naturalistic settings. Its flexibility in task manipulation accommodates a range of behaviors and animal capabilities. MAAP also provides a platform for investigations of neural activity underlying social behaviors. MAAP is a versatile tool for advancing understanding primate behavior and cognitive processes, bridging the gap between ethologically relevant animal studies and neural investigations, enabling future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using mets as a model.
Researchers investigated the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure (PA) on the developing genome of offspring using a physiologically relevant murine model. Moderate PA was found to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborns without altering behavioral outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with perturbations originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested effects on metastable genes linked to disease-relevant traits, including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In the murine model, a diet high folate and choline protected against some damaging effects of early PA on DNA methylation.
Researchers have found that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is effective in silencing a wide variety of genes, making them potential targets for RNA interference (RNAi). However, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, loss of RNAi regulators can selectively impair silencing of some genes. This study shows that this selectivity can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in RNA metabolism. The Maelstrom domain protein RDE-10, intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and Argonaute proteinNR-3 work together to silence somatic genes, but each is required for silencing a different gene. NR-3 requirement can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing.

 Quantitative models and exploratory simulations led to three key findings: (1) cis-regulatory elements of the target gene reduce dependence on NR-3, (2) animals recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and (3) cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with U dinucleotides, which are templates for amplifying RNAs, are enriched in 'UG' zones' matching dsRNA. Similar pathways and amplification result in selective silencing by endogenous RNAs.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the underlying mechanisms of tuberculous meningitis (TBM) pathogenesis and mortality. They analyzed whole-blood RNA sequencing data from 281 adults with TBM, 295 with pulmonary tuberculosis (PT), and 30 healthy controls. Weighted gene co-expression analysis identified genes and pathways associated with TBM severity and mortality, revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. Multivariate Cox regression selected candidate predictors of death, and logistic regression and bootstrap validation chose the best predictors. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T cell activation were linked to TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality was associated with angiogenesis, while HIV-negative showed elevated TNF signaling and extracellular organization. Four genes (MMP1, N2, Z, C, and CD) were strong TBM predictors. The study found TBM induces a systemic response similar to PT, highlighting genes and pathways related to death, offering potential therapeutic targets and a four-gene biomarker for outcomes.
A study was conducted to assess the performance of 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 human proteins related to neuroscience, using a standardized approach with parental and knockout cell lines (Laam et al., 2019). The results showed that more than 50% of antibodies failed in one or more applications, yet ~50-75% of proteins were covered by at least one high-performing antibody depending on application, indicating significant coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies. Recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Hundreds of underperforming antibodies were found in published articles, raising concerns. More than half were reassessed by manufacturers, with alterations to usage or removal from market.
Researchers have identified the need to control gene expression in multiple tissues within the same animal, particularly in inter-organ studies. To achieve this, they combined the GAL4/UAS system with a binary system such as LexA or Q. This study presents a resource for using GAL/UAS and binary in Drosophila, focusing on genes with characterized GAL expression patterns. Over 40 LexA-D and Q2 insertions were generated by CRISPR knock-in and verified in larvae. Constructs encoding Q2 and Lex-A transcription factors were created in a single vector. These were integrated into the genome and FLP/F recombination used to isolate lines expressing Q2 or Lex-A. Using shRNA vectors, both Lex and Q systems were evaluated for in vivo knockdown, generating a library of RNAi lines as a resource. The Lex and Q system and fly lines provide tools for researchers to activate or repress different genes orthogonally in the same animal.
The transcription factor B11 (B11) has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Research has shown that B11 is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy-CA synapses. However, the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which B11 regulates mossy-CA synapse function. The researchers found that the synaptic organizer molecule C1 (C1) is a direct target of B11 and regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at moss-CA synapses in vivo and vitro. C1 exerts its functions through interaction with a specific variant of neurexin (N), N3 (25). Interruption of C-N interaction by expression of a non-binding C mutant or deletion of N in dentate gyrus granule neurons recapitulates parts of B and C phenotypes. This study identifies a C-N dependent pathway which B controls moss- synapse function, contributing to the understanding of neurodevelopment disorders by synaptic dysfunction.
Researchers have investigated the role of the zinc finger protein S1 (S1) in regulating the transcription of proliferation-related genes. They found that S1 can regulate transcription by binding to promoters, similar to known transcription activators, or to transcribed gene bodies via RNA polymerase II (Pol II). The study focused on the mode of S1 activity and found that after binding to promoters, S1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol II, causing dissociation or conformation change of its Rpb subunit and increased backtracking. S1 also binds a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between S1 and mRNAs is controlled by their promoters and coincides with S1 dissociation from chromatin. S1 dissociation from chromatin correlates with extent of backtracked Pol. After promoter recruitment, S accompanies Pol and regulates backtracking. Backtracked Pol is compatible with S relocation to nascent, where S accompanies mRN to cytoplasm and regulates stability. S co-transcription binding imprints mRNA fate, serving paradigm cross-talk between synthesis and decay mRN and paradigm dual-role zincinger proteins.
Researchers investigated the relationship between programmed cell death during development (PCD) and fungal colonization in Arabidopsis thalian roots, focusing on the root-specific transcription factor ANAC/SMB and senescence nuclease B1. Mutations in both PC regulators increased colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendita, primarily in the differentiation zone. SMB mutants exhibited hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and delayed S-induced root growth promotion. This suggests that root PC and post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Reporter and transcriptional analysis revealed B1 expression is downregulated during S colonization in mature epidermal cells, indicating a transcriptional control facilitating beneficial microbes in roots.
Researchers have investigated the role of large vesicle extrusion from neurons in the development of neurodegenerative disease, specifically focusing on the factors that regulate this process in Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that mechanical force significantly potentiates exopher extrusion from proteressed neurons, with production peaking at day 2-3, coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of germline, sperm, oocytes, or early embryo production strongly suppressed exopher from the AL neuron during this period. Conversely, restoring egg production through mating or genetic interventions that block egg-laying increased AL exopher production. Interventions promoting AL exopher production were associated with expanded uterus lengths, while those suppressing it were linked to shorter lengths. Fertilized eggs, oocytes, dead eggs, or fluid in the uterus enhanced AL exopher production, with distention rather than presence of fertilized eggs constituting the stimulus. The study concludes that mechanical uter occupation potentiates exopher from proximal maternal neurons, highlighting the importance of mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.
Recent studies suggest that the Wnt signaling pathway plays a significant role in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research has shown that the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) is found in amyloid plaques in AD patients. This study investigates the contribution of DKK to synapse integrity in healthy and AD brains. Findings indicate that DKK is upregulated in AD brains and DKK levels increase early in the disease. In AD mouse models, extracellular DKK is increased and DKK accumulates around dystrophic neuronal plaques. Functionally, DKK triggers excitatory synapse loss through Wnt/GSKβ blockade and inhibitory syn increase via W/JNK. In contrast, DKK knockdown restores synapse and memory in AD mice.
Researchers have identified iron-chelating pyoverdines, a type of siderophore produced by Pseudomonas bacteria, as a potential new class of antibacterial compounds. These compounds inhibit bacterial growth by inducing iron starvation in pathogens. A screen of 320 Pseudas isolates against 12 human pathogens revealed several pyoverines with strong antibacterial properties and distinct characteristics. The most potent pydine reduced growth of Acinetobacter baumann, Kleiella pneumonia, and Staphlococcus aureus in a concentration-dependent manner. Pyd also increased survival of infected Galleria mellella larvae and showed low toxicity to mammalian cell lines and erythrocytes. Whole-genome sequencing of evolved pathogens showed limited resistance to pyd compared to antibiotics.
Researchers investigated the relationship between synaptic disruptions in the prefrontal cortex and network failures in schizophrenia, aiming to understand how genetic and environmental factors contribute to the disorder. A recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal circuits was developed to explain the link between NMDA receptor synaptic and spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological model of prefrontal failure in schizophrenia. The model analyzed the balance between AMPA and NMD components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition on oscillatory spike synchrony to inform biological data. Results showed that reducing NMD synaptic currents prevented the network from shifting to an oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs, such as during behavior. Findings paralleled dynamic modulation of spike synchrony between neurons in prefront cortex during behavior and suppression by NMD antagonists. The model provided a plausible mechanism linking NMD synaptic and spikey deficits in pharmacological model prefront failure schizophrenia.
Angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, typically occurs in hypoxic environments. The initial steps of angiogenesis rely on the differentiation of oligotent endothelial cells into Tip and Stalkotypic cell fates, controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell-cell communication. However, the dynamics of spatial patterning this cell specification are not fully understood. Researchers used a controlled angiogenesis model combined with mathematical and computational analysis to study Tip-Stalk cell patterning. They found that at high levels of proangiogenic VEGF, Tip-Stalk patterning undergoes an order-disorder transition, resulting in robust but temporally unstable cell differentiation, with only a subset of Tip cells leading sprouting extensions. Sprouts form in a manner maximizing mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model dependent on fibronectin enrichment. NOTCH signaling enables cell differentiation but not instructs subsequent angiogenic morphogenesis, requiring additional cues and self-organization.
Researchers investigated the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) projections to the hippocampus in learning and memory, focusing on the timing of LC-hippocampus communication and the involvement of LC-derived neurotransmitters in memory formation. The LC is traditionally thought to modulate neural activity through norepinephrine release, but recent studies suggest it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other regions. This study aimed to characterize the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace conditioning in mice. 

 The LC and its projections to the hippocampus responded to task-relevant stimuli, with optogenetic stimulation enhancing long-term memory formation. LC activity increased both norepinephrine and dopamine in the dorsal hippocampus, with dopamine release timing similar to LC activity. Hippocampal dopamine was crucial for fear memory, while norephrine was not. These findings suggest LC projections to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory, particularly through dopamine release.
