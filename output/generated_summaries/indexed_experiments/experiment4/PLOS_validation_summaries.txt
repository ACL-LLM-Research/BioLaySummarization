Researchers conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblast cells from genetically distinct human individuals to investigate the role of RNA 3'-end processing in gene regulation. They found that transcript positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions, but rather preferentially flanked locations of 3' regulatory elements, including miRNA sites. The usage of transcript forms and motifs varied across individuals, and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and 3' motifs were significant predictors of gene expression levels. Single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyaden variants on steady-state expression and validated the regulatory function of 3 cis-regulatory elements. The study focused on the immune regulator IRF, establishing the effect of variation in RNA 3-end on response to antigen stimulation. The results highlight the importance of mechanisms in genetics of 3-end variation: usage of distinct 3-processing signals and 3 elements determining transcript fate. The study suggests integrating 3-positions with 3 motifs will be a tool in interpreting human variation.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of the SIVΔne vaccine, a live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine that provides strong protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. Using deep sequencing and CD8 cell epitope mapping, they analyzed the CD8 T cell response in SIVne-vaccinated animals, identifying regions of immune pressure and viral escape. The initial CD8 response in the acute phase of SIVne infection targeted variable epitopes, followed by widespread viral sequence evolution and escape. Epitope escape expanded the CD8 repertoire to target conserved epitopes, defined by anropic specificity, and generated new responses to escaped variants during vaccination. These findings correlate SIVne-induced protection with anropic specificity and increased response depth.
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a crucial role in coordinating the neutrophil response to Candida albicans in oral mucosal infections. In a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC), IL-1 receptor (IL-R) signaling is essential for controlling the onset of infection through its impact on neutrophils at two levels: recruiting circulating neutrophils to the site of infection and mobilizing newly generated neutils from the bone marrow. IL- deficient mice display impaired chemokine production at the site of infection and defective secretion of granocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in circulation in response to C. albicans. Endothelial cells are the primary source of G-CS during OPC, responding to IL-α released from keratinocytes in infected tissue. IL-dependent crosstalk between hematopoietic subsets confirmed in vitro using a murine-derived kerocyte line and endothelial line. This establishes a link between IL and granopoies in fungal infection context. Two mechanisms coordinating neutil response in mucosa critical for preventing growth dissemination and host disease protection identified.
Between 2000 and 2007, the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) administered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals annually via mass drug administration of anti-filar drugs (albendazole, iverectin, diethylcarazine) to at-risk for 4-6 years. The economic benefits of this achievement were quantified by calculating the number of clinical manifestations averted and associated with disease prevention in the context of direct costs, indirect labor, and healthcare costs to affected individuals. Reviewing multiple sources, including the World Health Organization, International Fund, and Labour Organization, estimated $21.8 billion in economic benefits over 31.4 million treated during the first 8 years of GLEF. $2.3 billion was realized by protecting nearly 3 million from lymphatic filariasis due to being born in areas of transmission. Additionally, 28 million infected with LF benefited from GELF halting disease progression, resulting in $19.5 billion lifetime benefit. At-risk individuals decreased services with LF morbidity saved health systems $2.2 billion. The Programme offers significant economic benefits, with favorable implementation largely due to donated drugs from the pharmaceutical industry. The return on GLEF is high, proving an excellent investment in global health.
Researchers have created a mouse model of neuronopathic Gaucher disease by introducing a nonsense mutation in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene, leading to a complete deficiency in glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity. In contrast to humans and mice lacking GCase activity, these mice survived for months, allowing for the study of disease progression. The model displayed phenotypes of human neuronopathic Gaucher disease, including infiltration of Gaucher cells into the brain, progressive neuronal loss, and microgliosis. Detailed analysis revealed lysosomal abnormalities in neurons and accumulation of alpha-synuclein (α-s) in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. Unexpectedly, disruption of α-syn did not improve lifespan, axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflammation in the model.
Listeria monocytogen, a facultative intracellular pathogen, induces a robust cell-mediated immune response upon sublethal infection. However, its ability to escape the phagosome and enter the host cytos is crucial for long-lived CD8 T cellmediated immunity. Research reveals that the T response to L monocogen confined within a phag is not solely due to inefficient antigen presentation, but direct suppression of the adaptive response. This suppression affects not only the response to vacole-confined L monocogen, but also negates the response to within cytosolic infection. Co-infection with phosome-confined and cytos L monocogen prevents acquired immunity and antigen-specific T cell expansion relative to cytos L monocogen alone. Bacteria confined phag suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production, leading to MyD-dependent IL-10 production. Blocking IL-10 or MyD during primary infection restores immunity.
Researchers have identified six variants in the SIX gene associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Genome-wide association studies previously linked the SIX locus to POAG, with a significant odds ratio of 1.32 and a p-value of 3.87×10^-11. The SIX gene plays a role in ocular development and optic nerve morphology. The study sequenced SIX coding and regulatory regions in 262 PO cases and 256 controls, identifying six nonsynonymous variants, five rare and one common, AsnHis (rs12345), associated with PO (OR=1.27, p=4.2×10^-10) in the NEIGHBOR/GLUGEN datasets. Variants were tested in vivo Danio rerio (zebrafish) complementation to evaluate ocular metrics such as eye size and optic structure. Five variants, primarily in PO cases, were hypomorphic or null, while the sixth, only in controls, was benign. One variant in SIX enhancer increased SIX expression and disrupted regulation. The study found a clinical feature in PO patients dependent on SIX genotype: those homozygous for SIX risk allele (His) have a thinner retinal nerve layer than homozyg for non-risk (As). Results, combined with previous SIX work, suggest SIX variants disrupt retina development, reducing retinal ganglion cells, increasing glcoma vision loss risk.
Researchers have identified a genetic switch, known as the "flagellar switch," that controls the production of flagella and glucosyl toxins in Clostridium difficile, a human intestinal pathogen. The flagella facilitate adherence to intestinal epithelial cells, while glucosyl toxins contribute to diarrheal disease. The flag switch, located upstream of the flB operon containing early flagellar genes, is a 154 base pair invertible sequence flanked by 21 base pairs of inverted repeats. Bacteria with the switch in one orientation express flagellar genes, produce flagella, and secrete toxins (fl phase ON), while those with the inverse orientation are attenuated for flagellar and toxin expression, aflagellate, and show decreased toxin secretion (fl OFF). The switch orientation is reversible in vitro. Gene regulation via the flag switch occurs post-transcriptionally and requires a C. difficile specific factor to destabilize or degrade early flagellar mRNA when the switch is OFF. Mutagenesis and characterization of flag phase locked isolates revealed tyrosine recombinase RecV, which catalyzes inversion at cV switch, is also responsible for inversion at flag switch in both directions. Phase flagellar motility and toxin production suggest these virulence factors have both advantageous and detrimental effects during infection.
Researchers investigated the sporulation pathway in Clostridium difficile, an obligate anaerobic pathogen that relies on endospores for infection. In contrast to the model organism Bacillus subtilis, where sporulation is governed by cell-specific RNA polymerase subunits σF in the forespore and σE in the mother cell, Clostridium difficile's sporulation is regulated by σF, σE, σ, and σK. Using morphological characterization and fluorescence reporter gene expression analysis, the researchers found deviations from the B. subtilis paradigm. While σ periods of activity are conserved, σE is partially independent of σ, σ is dependent on σ, and σ does not require σ. σ is not required for heat-resistant spore formation. The results indicate reduced temporal segregation between early and late sigma factors and reduced requirement for σ-to-σ, σ-to-σ, and σ-to-cell signaling pathways. However, the study supports conservation of the sporulation network with sigma factors as key regulators, established 2.5 billion years ago in the Firmicutes Phylum.
Researchers have developed a framework to model the response of allosteric multisite proteins using a single variable, which closely replicates the steady-state behavior of detailed multisite systems such as the Monod-Wy-Change allosteric model and Hill-based models. Optimal ultrasensitivity is achieved when alloster protein activation by individual sites is concerted and redundant. This reduction makes the framework useful for modeling and analyzing biochemical systems where multisite proteins interact simultaneously.

The framework was applied to a newly discovered checkpoint pathway in yeast, proposed to measure cell growth by monitoring signals at plasma membrane growth sites. Components of this pathway form a hysteretic switch, incorporating a signal proportional to bud size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an-or response triggered when signal reaches threshold indicating sufficient growth.
Researchers have employed a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches to investigate the quorum sensing (QS) system in E. coli, specifically focusing on the autoinducer-2 (AI-2) quorum sensing circuit. The study aimed to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of genetic switching phenomena in QS, which enable bacterial populations to communicate and gain a selective advantage. The researchers separated the network into sub-networks to examine negative and positive feedback mechanisms, revealing a previously unreported negative feedback interaction. A mathematical model was developed to test the hypothesis, and the importance of the Lsr regulator and its role in the E. coli QS switch was uncovered, previously masked by regulatory loops. The model provided a mechanistic understanding of the interplay among regulatory substructures and their contributions to the overall network functioning. This "bottom-up" approach to understanding gene regulation is expected to unravel complex QS architectures and lead to the coordination of emergent behaviors.
In a study conducted in rural areas of Gabon, researchers investigated the effect of Schistosoma haematobium, a soil-transmitted helminth (STH), on Plasmod falcum infection in school-age children. The study found that 30.23% of children were infected with S. haobium, 23.9% with P. falcum, and 9% co-infected with both parasites. Results showed that S. haob infection increased the risk of P. falc infection, especially when combined with Trichuris trichi or hookworm infection. The incidence of malaria was 0.51 per-year in S-infected children compared to 0.43 in non-infected, with a significant delay in time to first malaria event in children aged 6-10 years infected with S. haob. The study suggests that STH enhances risk for P. falc infection in S-inf children and increases susceptibility to malaria in young children but not older children.
IRF-5-Mediated Inflammation Limits CD8+ T Cell Expansion by Inducing HIF-1 and Impairing Dendritic Cell Function during Leishmanial Infection

Infection with Leishmania donovani triggers an inflammatory response mediated by the transcription factor IRF-5, which activates genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF. This study investigates the role of IRF-5-mediated inflammation in regulating CD8+ T cell responses during L. donani infection. Results show that IR-5-induced inflammation limits CD8 T cell expansion and induces HIF-1 in dendritic cells. Blocking HIF-1 in dendritic cells leads to increased frequency of short-lived effector cells, CD8 T expansion, and IL-12 expression by splenic dendritic cells. Mice with H-1-depleted dendritic cells have lower splenic parasite burden, suggesting H-1 induction may be an immune evasion mechanism used by L. donani to establish persistent infection.
A systematic review was conducted to identify prognostic factors for adverse outcomes in American visceral leishmanias (VL) in Latin America. Fourteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed for methodological quality using a research tool. Prognostic variables were synthesized through meta-analysis, grouped by strength of evidence, heterogeneity, and multivariate analysis. The strongest predictors were jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age <5 and >40 years, neutropenia, dyspnea, and bacterial infections. Edema and low hemoglobin concentration were also associated with unfavorable outcomes. The main limitation was the absence of validation for prognostic models. Integration of studies over 10 years identified consistent prognostic variables for recognizing patients at risk of unfavorable outcomes. Development of externally validated prognost models is prioritized in future research.
Researchers in Algeria investigated the susceptibility of Leishmania isolates to antimony over a 30-year period. The study aimed to determine the level of antimony susceptibility amongst Leish transmitted in Algeria, which is crucial for public health policy development. A total of 106 isolates were analyzed, including 88 collected between 1976-2013 from humans, dogs, rodents, and phleomines, and 18 from dogs in France. All Algerian isolates were from endemic areas. The 50 inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of potassium antimony tarate (Sbivalent) and sodium stiboglucon (pentavalent) were determined in promastigotes and intramacroph amastigotes, respectively. The epidemiological cutoff (EFCO) differentiated Leish species causing cutaneous or visceral leishmanias susceptible (S+) or insusceptible (S) to trivalent antimony. The IC50 values were 23.83μg/mL and 15.91μg for VL and CL, respectively. A trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in VL isolates was observed over the 30-year period. In contrast, an increase in S-phenotypes isolates causing CL was noted during the same period. The emergence of S-phenotypes correlated with L. kili (L. tropica) isolates causing cutaneous leishiasis, which emerged in Algeria last decade. The study provides insight into spatiotemporal Leish antimony dynamics in Algeria, highlighting the need for effective methodology to detect ant susceptibility and prevent dissemination of resistant strains.
Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory condition with a complex etiology. Research has shown that exposure to foodborne pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis increases the risk of developing CD in the post-infectious period, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. To investigate this relationship, two models were developed to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacterium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIE), a bacterium linked to CD. The study found that disease activity in the post-infect period after gastroenteritis is driven by the expansion of resident IE in the tissue, accompanied by increased immunology defects, barrier defects, and delayed mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance. This was due to IE resistance to host defense peptides and amin inflammatory response to enteric pathogen. The results suggest individuals colonized by IE at the time of acute gastroenteritis may be at higher risk for CD onset. The study identifies IE as a tractable disease modifier, a finding that could inform therapeutic interventions following gastroenter in at-risk individuals.
In flowering plants, the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis is composed of two gametic cells, the egg and central cell, surrounded by five accessory cells, all of which are essential for fertilization. However, the mechanisms governing the formation of gametic versus accessory cell fate are unclear. A screen for regulators of egg cell fate led to the identification of the lach (lis) mutant, which produces supernumerary egg cells. In lis mutants, accessory cells adopt gametic fate, indicating LIS is involved in a mechanism preventing accessory cells from adopting gametic fate. LIS expression is temporally and spatially restricted to gametic cells, suggesting this mechanism is generated in gametic cells. LIS is homologous to yeast splicing factor PR4, indicating components of the splice apparatus participate in cell fate decisions.
A qualitative study was conducted in a rural highland Ethiopian community to explore the barriers to footwear use and its implications for neglected tropical disease (NTD) control. The PRECE-PRO model was used to assess social, behavioral, environmental, and educational, and ecological factors influencing shoe-wearing among children. Data was collected from 242 respondents through focus groups, semi-structured interviews, and case studies. The study found that shoe-wearing norms were changing, with going barefoot increasingly seen as shameful, and shoes associated with dignity and protection against injury and cold. However, practical and social barriers prevented the desire to wear shoes from being translated into practice. Limited financial resources meant people could not purchase more than one pair of shoes, ensuring longevity or afford quality shoes. As a result, shoes were reserved for special occasions and not provided for children until a certain age. Some barriers, such as fit and fear of labeling, were specific to certain diseases, while structural barriers like poverty, price, unsuitability, and low perception were relevant to multiple NTDs. Using health behavior adoption models, several barriers to shoe-wearing amenable to intervention were identified, which could benefit NTD prevention through shoe distribution.
Pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us protein plays a crucial role in targeting viral glycoproteins to axons of dissociated sympathetic neurons, with Us null mutants defective in anterograde transmission in vivo. The mechanism of Us-mediated axonal sorting of viral proteins is unclear. Glycoproteins B, C, D, and E are associated with lipid microdomains on infected cells and directed into axon in Us-dependent manner. This study investigated Us association with lipid rafts and its role in viral protein sorting. Non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a ratheochromocytoma line with sympathetic characteristics in NGF, were used. Us is enriched in detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Reducing Us lipid raft affinity inhibited antograde transmission from neurons to epithelial cells in vitro. Association of Us with lipid rafts is key for targeting structural proteins to axons and directional PR spread from pre-synaptic to postyn neurons in mammalian nervous system.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibits phenotypic variation under constant conditions, a phenomenon known as nongenic heterogeneity, which has clinical implications in tumors and microbial infections. This study investigates the genetic basis of nenic heterogeneity in growth rate and stress tolerance in yeast. Researchers used genetic perturbations and high-throughput single-cell assays to show that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein A (PKA) pathway and target factors M2 and M4 underlies nenic heterogeneity. Lower cAMP levels correspond to slower growth, as shown by direct comparison of cAMP in subpopulations enriched for slower vs faster cells. A reporter of pathway activity correlates with growth in cells. Paralogs M2 and M4 differ in nenic heterogeneity roles, demonstrating slow growth and stress are not linked. M2 is required for heterogeneity growth, whereas M4 is for expression of T1, a subunit trehalose synth contributing to acute stress. Perturbing nenic heterogeneity by mutating pathway genes or culturing with cell-perme cAMP 8-bromoAMP or PK inhibitor H89 impacts acute stress survival. Perturbations increase cAMP reduce slower subpopulation and increase acute stress, whereas PK slows growth and decreases stress. Loss M2 reduces but not eliminates correlation between growth and stress, suggesting M2 role inenic heterogeneity with residual slow growth.
Researchers conducted a whole-genome sequencing analysis of the Chikungunya virus (CHV) during the 2013 outbreak in the Caribbean to understand its genetic diversity and evolution. CHV, an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, causes severe fever in humans and rapidly spread from Asia to the Americas in 2013. The study focused on infected individuals in Guadeloupe and Martinique, central to the epidemic, using deep-sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines. The analysis revealed changes in consensus sequences and minority variants at different levels, with reduced diversity after cell passages. An infectious clone was constructed from the outbreak and a novel 3' untranslated region (UTR) structure was identified, increasing replication in insect cells. Intrahostasis analysis of the new CHV outbreak in the Caribbean found novel variants and 3'UTR, indicating rapid evolution in a short time in the naive population.
Researchers have identified a previously unannotated gene, UOR, as a functional regulator of the mTOR signaling pathway, which plays a crucial role in cell growth and is involved in multiple human diseases. In cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells, reducing UOR function promotes neurite outgrowth. Conversely, UOR depletion activates mTOR signaling and enhances cell growth, while UOR overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. Studies in zebraf models show that UOR inhibits mTOR by stabilizing the m complex component DEPT, and UOR disruption results in higher m activity and aggravates HRAS G12-induced neoplas. In zraf. Furthermore, UOR depletion promotes tumor growth and m signaling in xenograft mouse models.
Researchers have created a comprehensive map of protein interactions in the procyclic stage of Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite responsible for African trypanosomiasis. Using biochemical fractionation, they identified 128 high-confidence complexes involving 716 proteins, including 635 with unknown functions. These complexes correlate with known pathways and co-expressed proteins across the T. brucei life cycle, providing insights into previously uncharacterized proteins. Novel proteins associated with RNA editing machinery were validated, including a candidate involved in post-transcriptional regulation of T. bruce. The study provides an unprecedented view of T. bruce protein complex and serves as a resource for further characterization of tryosomatid proteins.
Lymph nodes (LN) are a common sites of extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, with thoracic LNs frequently infected in humans. However, the dynamics of Mtb infection in LN and its effect on structure and function are understudied. This study analyzed thoracic LNs from M-infected cynolgus andhes macques using PET scans, bacterial burden, LN structure, and immune function. FDG avidity correlated with live bacteria presence in LNs at necropsy. Results show that LNs have different trajectories (increasing, decreasing PET activity over time) within same animal. Rhes macques are more susceptible to M infection than cynolg macques due to extensive LN pathology. Mtb grows to same level in cynolg andhes mac LNs, but cynolg mac control M at later post-infection whilehes do not. LNs are poor at killing M, even with treatment, compared to lung granulomas. Granulomas in L lack B-rich lymphoid structures, disrupt LN structure, push out T and B cells, introduce macrophages as M niches, destroy vasculature. Data indicate L are not only antigen presentation and immune activation sites, but also significant M persistence.
Researchers have identified 47 new species of microsporidia, a type of fungus that infects animals, and studied their interactions with the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans and other related nematodes. Microsporidia are intracellular pathogens that can infect virtually all animals, but are poorly understood. Caenorhabdis elegans has been used as a model to study microidia through its natural pathogen Nematida paris. However, the prevalence and diversity of microidia in Caenorhabdis and other nematodes in the wild were unclear. The study isolated and cultured 47 nematodes with microidian infections, finding Nematida to be the most common infecting Caenor in the wild. Six new species in the Nemat genus were described, and phylogenetic analysis identified two subclades distinct from Nemat, named Entersect and Ptospora. Unlike Nemat, these genera belong to the clade of microidia that includes human pathogens. All microidia are horizontally transmitted and infect intestinal cells, except Ptos that replicates in epidermis of Caenorhost. At the cellular level, infected spores of Entersect show apical distribution and exit via budding, unlike Nemat that exit via exocytosis. Host specificity varies among microidia, with some broad and others narrow. Some microidia infect Osche but not Os, and vice versa. Naus fails to induce Caenor transcription of genes induced by Nemat species, suggesting mechanisms to prevent host response.
Chemokine receptors, a subclass of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), play crucial roles in the human immune system and are involved in cancer metastasis as well as HIV infection. Studies have shown that homo- and heterodimers of chemokine receptors CXCR, CCR, and C2 modulate receptor function. Cholesterol also affects chemokine receptor activity. However, structural information on homo and heterodimers formed by chemine receptors and their interaction with cholesterol is limited. This study reports homodimer and heterod configurations of chemine receptors CXCR, C, and C at atomic detail from molecular simulations. Homodimer patterns were similar for closely related chemine receptors, yet differed between CCR and CX4. Cholesterol modulated homod interfaces in subtype-specific manner. Chemine heterod display distinct dimer patterns CX4/5 and CX/2. Associations between CX and C reveal increased cholesterol-sensitivity compared CX/ heterodimer patterns. This study provides comprehensive overview interaction between chemine and indicates heterod and interaction with environment diversifies function related GPC.
Systemic leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease caused by Leishmania parasites, typically presents with symptoms such as fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting. However, a subclinical and atypical forms have been identified, characterized by the absence of one or two of these symptoms, replaced by lymphadenopathy and anemia. This study reports a new, unsuspected form of systemic leishiasis, referred to as "atypical". Patients with suspected immune deficiency were referred to an immunology laboratory for specialized tests, including microscopic examinations and cultures of biopsies on specialized media. 19.4% of 160 patients had normal laboratory profiles, but macrophages laden with Leish parasites. Findings revealed presence of atypical systemic leishias, presenting as masquerading condition with non-functional immune system. This predisposes patients to recurrent infections with various signs and symptoms. Findings indicate systemic leishias presents wider spectrum of symptoms than suspected and is more common than diagnosed. Among 31 patients, adults were included, showing systemic leishias not limited to pediatric group. Diagnosis of atypical systemic leishias recommended in patients with unexplained immunity and no obvious immunologic defect.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide analysis to investigate the relationship between disease-causing variants and their locations in paralogous proteins. They analyzed a collection of known disease-causing variants from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD) to identify pairs of variants occurring at homologous positions within paralog proteins. The study found that locations of variants in paralog proteins are correlated, and if one member of a variant pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. This suggests that information about variant pairs can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend existing procedures for polymorphism prioritization, and provide candidates for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
Researchers analyzed the transcriptome of Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria, in patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria in Papua. The study aimed to understand how the parasite responds to or is selected by the host environment in severe malaria. They used RNA sequencing (RNAseq) to analyze gene expression in 44 parasite isolates from patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria. The results showed that parasite isolates associated with severe malaria had decreased glycolysis and activation of compensatory pathways, altered chromatin structure and transcriptional regulation through histone methylation, reduced expression of PfEMP1 surface antigens, and downregulated chaperone proteins. The study also identified novel associations between disease severity and Pf1 transcripts, domains, and sequence segments, and confirmed previous associations between expressed Pf1 sequences and disease.
Researchers used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) intramuscularly to rhesus monkeys. The goal was to achieve long-term delivery of broadly-neutralizing antibodies for HIV-1 prevention. High levels of delivered mAb (up to 270 μg/ml) were achieved, but host responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of 12 monkeys, limiting the concentration. This resulted in a wide range of delivered mAb concentrations (1-270 μg). After repeated intravenous challenge with the difficult-to-neutralize SIVmac, the AAV-Delivered IgG1Ab group showed protective effects despite no detectable neutralizing activity against the virus. Effects included lower peak viral load, lower viral set point, and delay in time to peak load from exposure. All were statistically significant. The monkey with highest delivered m resisted six SIVmac challenges, including a final 10 i.v. units. The study demonstrates continued promise for HIV-1 prevention. However, antibody responses need to be understood for this approach to be effective.
Researchers have challenged the long-held assumption that protein molecules respond linearly to thermal or structural perturbations, such as ligand binding or detachment, by analyzing the conformational motions of two motor proteins: myosin and kinesin KIF1. Using a coarse-grained elastic network approximation, they found that this linearity is deficient for ligand-induced conformation motions and even thermal fluctuations. The nonlinearity is pronounced in KIF1, where normal mode description fails to describe mechanochemical motions. The study suggests reevaluation of protein dynamics theory assumptions, as neither single mode nor superposition of modes approximates nonlinear dynamics accurately.
Researchers have investigated the interactions between clathrin-independent endocytic pathways and identified caveolae, specialized domains involved in endocytosis. They found that specific caveolar proteins, cavin-1 and cavin-3, but not cavin-2 or cavin-4, act as negative regulators of the clathrin-independent/GPI-AP enriched endosomal (CL/GEE) endytic pathway. This regulation occurs independently of caveola formation. Caveolin-1 and cavin-3 inhibit the CL/GEE pathway through overexpression. Electron microscopy analysis revealed reduced CL/GEE carrier formation upon caveolar expression. Conversely, the CLEE pathway is upregulated in cells lacking cavin-1/cavin-1 or reduced cavin-3. Caveolin inhibition can be mimicked by the caveolin scaffolding domain, associated with perturbed lipid diffusion, as shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies. Without caveins and caveae, cavin-1 is endocytosed through the CLEE pathway, but loses polarization and sorting, affecting membrane and endytic dynamics in migrating cells and muscle tissue. Non-caveolar cavin-1 modulates the activity of the CLEE regulator, Cdc42. This study reveals regulation of non-cave clrin endocyt by caveolar proteins, illustrating crosstalk between pathways.
Two-component signaling systems are widespread in bacteria and archaea, playing crucial roles in sensing and responding to environmental stimuli. These systems typically employ a histidine kinase that phosphorylates a conserved aspartate (Asp) residue on a Receiver (REC) domain. However, some REC domains lack this residue, raising questions about the number of divergent REC domains, their functions, and regulation in the absence of the conserved aspart. This study compiled REC domains missing the phosphorylatable aspartate, renaming them Aspart-Less (AL) domains. Results show AL domains are common and enriched with rare effector outputs. Analysis of informatics and AL structures, combined with biochemical and genetic data on AL archetype Rit from Streptococcus pneumoniae, suggest AL reorganized active sites for constitutive regulation or accommodate signals other than phosphorylation, while retaining canonical post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimer interface. This defines AL as atypical REC subclass, providing insights into activation mechanisms between AL and REC domains.
Researchers have developed a new type of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (HSV) that is fully virulent and specifically targets cancer cells with the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. Unlike previous oncolytic HSVs, this virus does not have deletions or mutations that make it less effective against the host immune response. Instead, it selectively replicates in cancer cells with HER2 expression while sparing other cells in the tumor. The study investigated the efficacy of this new virus in immunocompetent mice with HER2-positive lung cancer. Both the unarmed and IL-12-armed versions of the virus inhibited the growth of the primary tumor, with the IL-12-armed version being more effective. All mice that survived the primary tumor treatment were protected from growth of contralateral tumors. Long-term survivors were also protected from a second contral tumor, indicating an abscopal therapeutic effect. Analysis of the response showed that the IL-12-armed virus unleashed an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, inducing immunomulatory cytokines and promoting Th1 polarization. Tumor-infiltrating cells, such as CD4+ and CD335, were increased in all responders, while CD8, Foxp, CD, and CD11 were increased in IL-12-treated mice. The response included break of tolerance to both HER2 and wt cells, indicating a systemic immunotherapeutic response.
Researchers investigated the susceptibility of CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccines to HIV infection, following concerns raised by excess infections in Ad5-based vaccine trials. They found that Ad5-specific CD4 cells were susceptible to HIV, but ALV-specific CD4 cells from the RV144 trial were less susceptible to R5 and X4 HIV in vitro. Lower susceptibility was associated with reduced CCR5 and CXCR4 expression on ALV-specific CD4 cells. Phenotypic analysis showed ALV-specific CD4 cells had a Th1 phenotype with high IFN-γ and CCL4, but low IL-17. ALV and Ad vectors induced distinct CD8 and CD4 responses, with ALV inducing CD8 and Ad CD4 proliferation. Depletion of ALV CD8 cells increased HIV infection of AL-specific CD4 cells, suggesting a protective role of ALV CD8 cells. The study highlights distinct susceptibility of CD4 cells by different vectors and the importance of evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination.
X-chromosome inactivation, the process of silencing one X chromosome in female somatic cells, is a universal among therian mammals. However, the choice of which X to silence varies among species. X-inactivation strategies range from paternal X-inherited inactivation (PX), rendering females haploid for maternal alleles, to random X-inactivation (RX), equalizing expression of maternal and paternal alleles in each tissue. A theoretical population genetic analysis of X-inactivation evolution was conducted, considering conditions of dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection. Results indicate a critical interaction between allelic dominance and sexifferential can select a broad range of X-in strategies, including unequal inactivation between maternal and paternal X. RX is favored over PX as long alleles deleterious to females are recessive, and criteria for RX evolution is more restrictive when variation is sexually antagonistic. Evolution from PX to RX increases female fitness at expense of male. A framework for predicting chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes is provided, leading to predictions for future studies of allele-specific expression variation.
Researchers investigated the antiviral potential of the host protein ZAP against three flaviviruses, specifically Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIK). They found that overexpression of ZAP blocked JEV infection, but not DENV or ZIK, and depletion of endogenous Z enhanced JEV replication. Z hampered JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3-5 exosome-mediated degradation. The zincinger motifs of Z were essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity. The 3-UTR, particularly the region with dumbbell structures and high content of dinucleotide, was mapped to bind Z and confer sensitivity to Z.
Rift Valley fever virus (RVV) is a significant human and animal pathogen causing severe disease, including hemorrhagic encephalitis. The virus is endemic in parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, but there is concern regarding its introduction into non-endemic regions and potential devastating effects on livestock and human populations. This study investigated the host response to wild-type and vaccine strains of RVV and its correlation with pathogenesis. C57/6 mice were infected with live-attenuated MP12 or wild-type Z501. Animals with MP12 survived productive infection with minimal disease and cytokine response. In contrast, Z501 infection was lethal, causing lymphocyte and platelet depletion and strong cytokine response correlating with high virus titers and tissue pathology. Lymphopenia and platelet depletion indicated disease onset, with lymphocyte recovery correlating G-CS production. RVV is hepatotropic, with significant clinical and histological data supporting findings. However, a pro-inflammatory response in the liver was not apparent, instead a chemokine response indicating neutrophil infiltration, supported by histological data. Brains of Z501 infected mice showed chemokine and pro-inflammatory response with little pathology meningoencephitis. Data suggest RVV pathogenesis in mice is associated with liver loss due to necrosis and hepatitis, yet long-term disease is neurologic, supported by human and BAL/c model.
Chemotherapy resistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) poses a significant challenge to improving patient survival rates. Researchers investigated the mechanisms of taxane chemoresistance in TNBC and found that C motif chemokine ligand 20 (C20) was significantly elevated in patients with non-pathologic response to taxane-containing chemotherapy. C20 promoted self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells (BCS) through protein kinase Cζ (PKζ) or 38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP)-mediated activation of 65 factor B (NF-κ) pathway, increasing taxane resistance of BC. Additionally, C20-promoted NFκ activation ATP-binding subfamily member 1 (ABCB1)/multidrug 1 (DR) expression, leading to extracellular efflux of taxane. Chemotherapy-induced C20 mediated chemoresistance via upregulation of AB1. Furthermore, NF-κ activation C20 increased, forming a positive loop between NFκ and C pathways, sustaining chemores in cancer cells. The study suggests C20 as a predictive marker for taxane response and blockade of C or its pathway may reverse tax resistance in breast cancer.
Toxoplas gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, infects nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals by transporting "GRA" proteins from dense granules into host cells. GRA proteins manipulate host functions, such as cell cycle and p38 MAP kinase. Some GRAs, like GRA16 and GRA24, are secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole (PV) and transported across the PV membrane (PVM) into the host, but the process is not understood. TMY1, cleaved by T5, localizes to PVM and is essential for GRA transport into host. To identify additional effectors, Toxopla mutants were screened for ability to export GRA16 and GRA24 to host. Novel MY2 and MY3 play role in GRA transport into host. MY2 and MY3 are secreted into PV and co-localize with PVM. Consistent with transmembrane domains, all are membrane-associated, MY3 but MY2 stably with MY1, N-terminal and C-terminal disulfide. Fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to structured DH domain blocks transport, consistent translo model effector.
Human papillomavirus (PV) and bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) E2 proteins bind to the origin recognition complex (ORC) component ORC2, but OR2 is not detected at the viral origin of replication. Depletion of OR2 enhances PV replication in a transient replication model in keratinocytes, maintaining episomal viral genomes, while having no effect on copy number in a cell line with integrated HPV genomes. Occupancy of E1 and E at the viral origin increases following OR2 silencing. This suggests OR2 is not necessary for activation of the PV origin by E and E, but suppresses E replicative function. Over-expression of HPV2 decreases OR2 occupation at known mammalian origins of replication, indicating E restricts pre-OR assembly that could compete for host replication necessary for viral amplification. The OR2 complex with E restricts viral replication in the maintenance phase of the viral program and elevated E levels occur during differentiation amplification subvert OR loading and DNA synthesis at cellular origins.
A study was conducted to investigate the presence of Brucella in bovine milk in the urban and periurban area of Dush, Tajikistan. Bruc DNA was detected in 10.3% of 564 milk samples using IS-based real-time PCR. This is concerning due to the common consumption of unpasteurified dairy products in the region. Bruc DNA was found in the milk of seropositive cows, but also in 8.3% of seronegative cows. Sequence analysis of the rB gene revealed one cow infected with B. abortus and another likely infected with B. melensis. Discrepancies between serology and real-time PCR highlight the need for complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false negatives in Bruc surveillance and control. Vaccination of cattle with S and small ruminants with Rev may be necessary to control Bruc infections, but further research on Bruc isolation is needed to understand circulating species in the region.
Researchers investigated the role of histone H3 lysine methylation in maintaining chromosome stability in the pathogenic fungus Zoseptoria trici, which has eight accessory chromosomes that are unstable during meiosis and mitosis and transcriptionally repressed. They deleted the genes encoding methyltransferases responsible for H3me9 and H27, Kmt1 and K6, respectively, and generated a double mutant. Experimental and genomic analyses were used to determine the impact of these deletions on chromosome and genome stability in vitro and in planta. Whole genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq were used to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure and differences in gene expression between mutant and wild-type strains. In H9-deficient strains, chromatin reorganization was observed, with H27me mostly localized to regions enriched in H9 in wild-type. Genome rearrangements and new chromosome formation were found in the absence of H9, accompanied by activation of transposable elements. In contrast, loss of H27 increased stability of accessory chromosomes under normal conditions in vitro, without large changes in gene activity. H9 is crucial for maintaining genome stability by preventing H27 in constitutive heterochromatin. In this system, H27 reduces overall stability of accessory, creating a metastable state for quasi-essential genome regions.
Evaluation of Cost-Effective Strategies for Rabies Post-Exposure Vaccination in Low-Income Countries

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a crucial in preventing the onset of rabies in individuals exposed to the virus. However, life-saving rabies vaccines and biologicals are often inaccessible and unaffordable, particularly to the poorest sectors of society who bear the largest burden of rabies. To address this issue, we analyzed post-exposure vaccination regimens and their costs and benefits to victims and healthcare providers. Results show PEP is an extremely cost-effective intervention, with a cost of less than $60 per death averted. Switching from intramuscular (IM) to intradermal (ID) administration of P regimens resulted in significant savings in vaccine volume required to treat patients, mitigating shortages and reducing costs. We propose financing mechanisms to make P more accessible, subsidize costs for those in need, and support existing rabies prevention programs. A universal switch to ID delivery would improve affordability and accessibility of P, reducing human rabies deaths and costs for healthcare providers.
Toxoplas, an obligate intracellular parasite, replicates within mammalian cells in a parasitophorous vacuole (PV) that does not fuse with host organelles. One mechanism for nutrient acquisition is attraction of host organelles to PV. Toxoplas exploits host lipid droplets (LD), ubiquitous fat organelles, for nutrient acquisition. Tooplas replication is reduced in cells depleted of LD or impaired lipolysis or fatty acidolysis. In infected cells, LD number and host-associated genes (ADRP, DG2) increase until parasite replication onset. PV are surrounded by LD. Tooplas accesses LD lipids, incorporating them into membranes and LD. Exogenous oleic acid stimulates LDogenesis, resulting in large LD accumulation inside parasite. To access LD lipids, Toop intercepts and internalizes LD within PV, some associated with Rab7, wrapped by intravacolar network (IV) membranes. Mutants impaired IV display diminished lipid uptake from LD. Parasites lacking IV-localized phospholipase2 are less proficient in salvaging lipids from LD PV. IV contributes to LD processing and lipid release. Lipid gavage reveals endocytic structures containing lipid material from PV. This study highlights Tooplas reliance on LD for intracellular development and lipid scavenging from LD.
Researchers investigated a library of flavonoid derivatives to identify inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica cysteine proteases, specifically Fh3 and Fh1. Chalcones with phenyl and naphthyl groups emerged as potent inhibitors, interacting with two putative binding sites within the active site of the enzymes. One compound, C34, bound to juvenile Fh3 with an IC50 of 5.6 μM. C34 is a slow-reversible inhibitor that interacts with the Cys catalytic dyad and S2 and S3 residues, determinants of substrate specificity for this cystine protease family. In vitro, C34 induced a reduction in the ability to migrate through the gut and loss of motility, leading to death within a week, without cytotoxicity to bovine cells. This is the first report of non-peptide inhibitors of Fasciola hepatica catheps in vitro. Chalcones were identified as novel inhibitors of the main catheins secreted by juvenile and adult liver flukes. Compound C34 is highly active against the juvenile, reducing larval ability to penetrate the gut and decreasing viability in vitro. These findings open avenues for novel agents to control fluke infection and helminthic diseases.
In the visual system, information about fast and slow changes in light intensity are transmitted through distinct neural pathways. Researchers used in vivo imaging to investigate how bipolar cells convey these signals to the retina. They found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to temporal filtering. Bipolar cells transmit signals through terminals of varying sizes, with smaller terminals generating faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher gain, followed by more adaptation. Smaller terminals transmit higher frequencies more effectively. Modeling calcium dynamics of vesicle release indicated that variations in presynaptic compartments directly contribute to differences in response. These results show how neurons can transmit different temporal components of the signal through terminals with varying geometries and adaptation properties.
Researchers have developed a novel probabilistic method for detecting synapses from fluorescence microscopy (FM) images, which complements electron microscopy (EM) in studying the brain's synaptic networks. FM offers high-speed and low-cost molecular discrimination, but struggles with distinguishing synaptic and non-synaptic signals. In contrast, EM provides reliable synapse identification but limited molecular discrimination and is slow and costly. To address this, the researchers used correlative array tomography (CAT), combining FM and EM images of individual synapses. They proposed an unsupervised probabilistic method for synapse detection from multiplex FM (mux) data, evaluated against EM-annotated data and cortical syn distributions. The probabilistic synapse detector accepts morphological models, delivering a volumetric probability map of synapse presence. Using EM-annotated CAT data as ground truth, the algorithm detected synapses from FM data as accurately as human annotators, reproducing known cortical syn features. This approach enables data-driven discovery of new synapse types and density. The probabilistic detector is also applicable to standard and super-resolution FM, where EM-validation is impractical.
Zinc is an essential trace element crucial for the proper functioning of approximately 3,000 cellular proteins, involved in various physiological processes such as nucleic acid metabolism, gene regulation, signal transduction, cell division, immune and nervous functions, and wound healing. Impairment of zinc homeostasis disrupts cellular functions, leading to various pathologies. Mammalian zinc transport occurs via two transporter families, ZnT and ZIP. However, the mechanism of ZnT, responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and secretion during lactation, is unknown. This study investigated the mechanism of ZnT and demonstrated computationally and experimentally that ZnT is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter. Bafilomycin A, a vacuolar ATPase inhibitor, abolished ZnT-dependent transport into intracellular vesicles. Lyso Red and Ly-pfluorin showed that ZnT overexpression in intracellular vesicles and exogenous zinc caused vesicular alkalization, due to proton-zinc antiport, reversed by TP, a specific chelator. Computational calculations propose Zn functions as an antiporter with 2+/Zn+ stoichiometry, driven by proton force, concentrating zinc in vesicles at expense of cytoplasmic proton extrusion.
14-3 Proteins Regulate Exonuclease 1-Dependent Processing of Stalled Replication Forks

Replication fork integrity is crucial for maintaining genome stability, and is monitored by checkpoint-mediated phosphorylation events. 14-3 proteins, which bind to phosphorylated proteins, have been shown to play a role in DNA replication stress. Exonuclease 1 (Exo) processes stalled forks in checkpoint-defective yeast cells. This study identifies 14-3 proteins as in vivo partners of Exo, in yeast and mammalian cells. Yeast 3-3-deficient cells fail to induce Mec1-dependent Exo hyperphosphorylation and accumulate Exo-dependent ssDNA gaps at forks, revealed by electron microscopy. This leads to persistent checkpoint activation and recovery defects. DNA bi-dimensional electrophoresis shows 3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations. This suggests 3 proteins assist controlling phosphorylation of Exo and unknown targets, promoting fork stability and restart in response to replication stress.
Researchers investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) in human immunodeficiency type 1 (HIV-1) infection and pathogenesis using a humanized mouse model. HIV-1 infection led to persistent infection and immunopathogenesis, including type I interferon (IFN) induction, immune activation, and depletion of leukocytes, including CD4 T cells. A monoclonal antibody was developed to deplete pDC in lymphoid organs of humanized mice. When pDC were depleted prior to HIV-1, induction of IF and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were abolished during acute HIV-1 infection with either highly pathogenic CCR5/CX4-tropic or standard C5ropic HIV-1 isolate. Consistent with antiviral role of IF, HIV-1 replication was upregulated in p-depleted mice. Cell death by highly pathogenic HIV-1 was reduced in p-de mice. During chronic HIV-1, depletion p also reduced induction of IF and IS, associated with elevated HIV replication. Surprisingly, HIV depletion of human cells in lymphoid, not blood, was reduced despite increased replication. Increased in lymphoid was associated with reduced HIV-induced death human leukocytes, including CD T cells. p play opposing roles in suppressing HIV replication and promoting immunogenesis. Findings suggest p-depletion and IF blockade provide novel strategies for treating HIV non-responsive patients with persistent activation despite antiretrov treatment.
Sulforaphane (SF) Inhibits HIV Infection in Macrophages through Nrf2

Researchers have investigated the impact of Sulforane (SF) on HIV infection in macrophages, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in the body's defense against pathogens. SF, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, has been shown to mobilize nuclear erythroid-related factor 2 (Nrf2) to reprogram cellular gene expression. This study found that SF blocks HIV infection in primary macrophages, but not in primary T cells. SF also inhibits HIV infection in differentiated promonocytic cell lines, but not in other cell lines. RNA-mediated depletion of Nrf increased HIV infectivity in macrophages and reduced the anti-viral effects of SF treatment. This suggests that SF's anti-viral activity is mediated through Nrf mobilized by SF. SF treatment blocks HIV infection after entry, but before formation of 2-L circles, similar to type interferon-induced antiiral proteins SAM1 and MX. However, SAM and MX were not upregulated. This study demonstrates that Nrf can potently block HIV infection, highlighting a novel mechanism for inhibition.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in rural western Kenya to investigate geohelth infections among pregnant women. The study found that 76.2% of 390 participants who provided a stool sample were infected with at least one geelth species, with Ascaris lumicoid (52.3%), hookworm (39.5%), and Trichuris trichi (29%) being the most common. Infection with at least geel species was associated with use of unprotected water source (adjusted odds ratio 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3) and lack of treated drinking water (adjusted ratio 1.8, 95 CI 1.1-3). Geelth infections were not associated with clinical symptoms or body mass index. Hookworm infection was associated with lower upper arm circumference (adjusted decrease 0.7 cm, 95 CI 0.3-1). Hookworm infection with egg count ≥100/gram was associated with lower hemoglobin (adjusted decrease 1.5 g/dl, 95 0.3-2.7). Among gravid 2 and 3 women, Ascaris lumicoid was less likely to have malaria (OR 0.4, 95 CI 0.2-0.8) compared to without Asis lumic.
Mycolone, a macrolide produced by the pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, has been shown to possess cytotoxic, analgesic, and immunomodulatory properties. This study investigated its effects on the inflammatory responses of nervous cell subsets involved in pain perception and transmission, as well as neuroinflammation associated with chronic pain. Sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia were isolated from mice for ex vivo assessment of mycolone cytotoxicity and immunomod activity. Prolonged (>48h) exposure to myone induced cell death at concentrations >10ng/ml, while nanolar concentrations suppressed pro-inflammatory mediator production without affecting viability. Notably, myone prevented pro-inflammatory polarization of microglia, which contribute to neuroflammation. In a rat model of neuropathic pain induced by sciatic nerve constriction, myone was injected daily in the spinal canal for 3 days. This treatment failed to prevent injury-induced neuroflamm but decreased local inflammatory cytokine production without cytotoxicity. The study demonstrates myone suppresses inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schw cells, and microia without affecting viability.
A study was conducted to investigate the association between candidate gene polymorphisms and the clinical outcomes of African trypanosomiasis (AT) in populations from Guinea. The disease, caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambense, has varying outcomes in humans in West Africa, ranging from acute to chronic forms and spontaneous regulation of parasitemia at low levels. Samples from 425 individuals, including 232 AT cases, 79 long-term seropositive but parasitology negative, and 114 controls, were analyzed. 28 SNPs in eight genes passed quality control and used for association analysis. Results showed that IL6 rs1819 allele was associated with lower risk of progressing from latent to active disease (p=0.001, OR=0.39, CI[0.24-0.63], BF=0.003). MIF36071 allele seemed associated with increased risk (p=0.023, OR=1.65, CI[1.07-2.53], BF=0.669) but not significant after Bonferr correction. MIF459 allele associated latent infections (p=0.007, OR=1.86, CI[1.18-2.95], BF=0.215). AP1G2 allele DEL associated higher risk (p=0.001, OR=2.70, CI[1.49-4.91], BF=0.01) and AP1 polymorphism lower risk (p=0.000, OR=0.45 CI[0.29-0.7], BF=0.012). No associations found with other genes. The study shows host genes modulate Tryosoma bruce gambense infection in infected individuals from Guinea, with IL6 rs1819 associated lower risk progressing to AT.
Researchers conducted whole-genome sequencing on 38 individuals from the South Asian population in Singapore, descendants of Dravid-language-speaking states in India, as part of the Singapore Sequencing Indian Project (SSIP). The genetic diversity of these samples was compared to the Sequencing Malay Project and Phase 1 of the 1,000 Genomes Project (KGP) populations. Results showed higher intra-population genetic diversity and heterozygous-to-homozygous ratio in SSIP compared to other Asian populations. The genetic makeup of SSIP samples was closely related to South Indians, but distinct from Europeans in autosomal SNPs. Eight samples belonged to mitochondrial haplogroups predominantly found in Europeans and had higher European admixture than others. Analysis of relatedness to archaic homins (Denisovan, Neanderthal) showed higher ancient admixture in East populations than SSIP.
Researchers investigated the molecular basis of aminoglycoside susceptibility in Burkholderia pseudallei isolates from Thailand, specifically strains 708, 218a, and 379a. These strains are intrinsically resistant to aminoglycos and macrolides due to the expression of the AmrAB-OA efflux pump. Quantitative PCR revealed the absence of amr transcripts in 708 and reduced levels in 218 and 379. Increasing gentamicin concentrations led to the emergence of resistant mutants in 218 and 379, but not 708. Transcript analysis showed resistance in 218 and 379 was due to upregulation of amr-opA expression by unknown mechanisms. PCR revealed the amr-opA operon was missing in 708, associated with a 70 kb deletion. Rescue of the amr-opB region from a 708 fosmid library showed a 131-141 kb deletion in 708 compared to K43 and 10. This deletion removed amr-op, malleactin, and cobal synthesis genes, anaerobic arginine deiminase, type 1 fimbria, and secreted chitinase. Whole genome sequencing confirmed absence of these genes in 708. Despite missing virulence genes, 708 was virulent in murine model. Strain 708 may be a candidate for genetic manipulation with antibiotic selection and validation of Δamr-opA mutants.
Researchers investigated the early differentiation of naive CD4 T helper (Th) cells into Th1 and Th2 states by analyzing single-cell transcriptomics and immunofluorescence data. Contrary to the expectation of mutually exclusive expression of antagonistic transcription factors, they found co-expression of these factors in individual cells at high levels distinct from basal levels during priming. Cytokines were expressed in a small subpopulation of cells, independent of transcription factor expression in these cells. Cell-to-cell variation in cytokine expression during early T cell differentiation was larger than in fully differentiated state. Inhibition of cytok signaling led to mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors, revealing an intracellular network overruled by extracellular signals. This suggests CD4 T cells acquire a mixed Th1/2 state early, instructed by extracellular cytokines. The interplay between extracellular and intracellular components in Th2 differentiation may be a strategy to buffer cytokine expression.
C. elegans PAQR-2, a homologous to mammalian insulin-sensitizing adiponectin receptors, plays a crucial role in adaptation to 15°C, a low temperature for the organism. Screening for PAQR-2 suppressors revealed mutations in genes involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis (cep-1, cpt-1, and s-1) and fatty acid metabolism (ech-7, hac-1, m-15, n-49 and sb-1). The study demonstrates that PAQR-2, phosphatidcholines, and Δ9-desaturases form a cold adaptation pathway regulating increase in unsaturated fatty acids to maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. This is supported by observations that PA-2 suppressors normalize saturated fatty acid levels, and low detergent concentrations that increase fluidity rescue PA-2 mutant.
Researchers have studied the structure of Herpes Simplex Type-1 (HSV-1) virus, a common human pathogen, to better understand how its genome is packaged and released from the virus capsid. Although much remains unknown about this process, similar mechanisms are well understood in bacteriophages, which share a common origin with Herpesviruses. Bacterophages release their genome through a portal and a tail apparatus at the vertex. Using electron cryo-microscopy, researchers found a new feature at the HSV-1 vertex, connecting the capsid to the viral membrane through the tegument layer. This structure suggests it plays a role in releasing the genome into the nucleus and maintaining virion architecture.
Researchers investigated the effects of Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA) and recombinant Omega-1 (r-1) on HIV-1 infection in vitro. They found that SEA, specifically kappa-5, potently binds to DC-SIGN, blocking DC-S mediated HIV-1 transfection. DCs exposed to SEA under Th2 conditions induced T-cells that were less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection compared to unexposed DCs, while HIV-4 infection was unaffected. This was not observed in DCs exposed under Th1 or Th/Th2 conditions. T-cells induced by SEA-exposed DCs showed reduced IFN-γ and M-β production. The infection profile of T-cells with HIV-1 R was not associated with downmodulation of CCR5 surface expression. Recombinant r-1 demonstrated similar functions to natural-1, inducing T-cells less susceptible to HIV-5 infection, but not X virus. This was associated with reduced IF-γ and M-β, and CCR expression. The study suggests that parasite antigens, specifically r-1, modulate HIV-1 infectivity, potentially influencing disease course in coinfected individuals.
Researchers have investigated the phenomenon of neural activity-induced shrinkage of the extracellular space (ECS) between neurons and astrocytes in grey and white matter. They found that neuronal stimulation causes a 30% shrinkage of the ECS under experimental conditions. A dynamic model was developed to account for this phenomenon in wild-type and gene knockout individuals. The model suggests that neuronal release of potassium and uptake of sodium during stimulation, astrocyte uptake of potassium, sodium, and chloride, and action of the Na+/K+ pump, and osmotically driven water transport through the astrocyte membrane are sufficient for ECS shrinkage. However, considering ECS and astrote ion concentrations with neuronal stimulation, the actions of Na+/Cl (NK1) and NaH (NBC) cotransporters are critical for achieving observed ECS shrinkage levels. The model is sufficiently detailed and constrained to guide future experiments and pave the way for comprehensive astroglia-neuron models in normal and pathophysiological situations.
Arabidopsis thalian genomes contain significant amounts of transposons and repetitive DNA elements, which, if transcribed, can be detrimental to the organism. The expression of these elements is suppressed by the establishment of repressive chromatin modifications. In Arabidopsis thalian, they are silenced by the siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing pathway, where non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) produced by RNA Polymerase V (Pol V) guide ARGONA4 (AGO) to chromatin and attract enzymes that establish repressive chrom modifications. It is unknown how chrom modifying enzymes are recruited to chromatin. Researchers used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to show that SPTLTF1, a silencing factor and homolog of SPT elongation factors, binds chromatin at loci subject to transcription silencing. SPTLTF binding occurs downstream of Polymer V but independently of the presence of 24-nt siRNA. SPTLTF and AGO are recruited to chrom in parallel and independently of each other. Using methylation restriction enzymes, binding of AGO and SPTLTF is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications of loci.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Rpo regulon in the tick-to-mamm transmission phase of Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. The Rpo-dependent genes have been extensively studied in the mammalian host, but their contribution to the tick phase of the Borrelia burgorferi life cycle has not been examined. This study demonstrates that Rpo-dependent gene expression is necessary for spirochete transmission by nymphs. In the absence of Rpo, spirochetes are confined to the midgut lumen and transform into an unusual morphotype, round bodies during the later stages of the blood meal. Round body formation is reversible and appears to be partly due to reduced Coenzyme disulf reductase levels, which provides NAD for glycolysis. Data suggest spirochet default to an Rpo-independent program for round formation when transmission energetics are unfavorable.
Researchers investigated the relationship between gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) in controlling stamen development in Arabidopsis. They found that GA-dependent stamen-enrich genes, MYB21, MY24, and MY57, are involved in stamen filament growth. Loss-of-function of DELLA and RGL2 restored the expression of these MY genes and stamen growth in GA-deficient plants. The myb21my24my57 triple mutant exhibited a short stamen phenotype and male sterility. Genetic analysis showed that GA suppresses DEL to mobilize the expression of JA biosynthesis gene DAD, consistent with lower JA content in GA-deficient flower buds. The study established a hierarchical relationship between GA and JA, where GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control MY21, MY24, and MY57 expression, a prerequisite for normal stamen development in Arabidopsis.
Researchers investigated the role of hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) in modulating lifespan extension due to dietary restriction (DR) in Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that H-1 deficiency resulted in extended lifespan, similar to inhibition of the RSK-1/S6 kinase, a component of the target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway. A modified DR method using varying bacterial concentrations on agar plates showed that H-1 modulated longevity in a nutrient-dependent manner. H- loss-of-function mutants extended lifespan under rich conditions but failed to show extension under DR. Conversely, a mutation in egl-9, increasing H- activity, diminished lifespan under DR. This effect was rescued by tissue-specific expression ofegl-9 in neurons and muscles. Increased lifespan by H- was dependent on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress regulator inositol-requiring-1 (I-1) and associated with lower ER stress levels.
Human epidermal keratinocytes, a type of skin cell, can transition between two states: differentiation and migration. Researchers investigated how chromatin, the complex of DNA and proteins, changes during these transitions. They found that when keratinocytes differentiate or migrate, new enhancers and super-enhancers form, unique to each state. Enhancers are linked to genes that confer specific functions to each state. These enhancers are enriched with genetic variants associated with skin diseases. GR3, a transcription factor, promotes differentiation and migration, binds to enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes, but to promoters with REST during migration, repressing migration inhibitors. Epidermal differentiation factors, including GR3, are in enhancers and bind to regulate them. GR3 represses formation of progenitor and non-keratin superenhancers in differentiating keratinocytes. Chromatin GR3 binding and enhancers regulate irreversible commitment to differentiation and reversible migration of keratinocytes.
Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are remnants of ancient retroviral infections that are transmitted vertically from generation to generation in the host genome. Research suggests that some ERVs may be used by the host as factors to block the infection of pathogenic retroviruses, with some ERs efficiently interfering with the replication of exogenous retroviruses. However, evidence that these mechanisms have influenced the coevolution of endogenous and exogenous retroviruses and their hosts has been difficult to obtain. Sheep are an interesting model to study retrovirus coevolution due to the coexistence in this species of exogenous (horizontally transmitted) oncogenic retroviruses, Jaags sheep retrovirus and enzootic tumor virus with related and biologically active endogenous retrovir (enSRVs). This study isolated and characterized the evolutionary and molecular virology of 27 enSRV proviruses. SRVs have been in the host genome for 5-7 million years. Two SR proviruses, SR1 and SR20, which entered the genome within 3 million before and during speciation of genus Ovis, acquired distinct G polyprotein resulting in dominant phenotype block replication of exogenousviruses. Both dominant proviruses fixed in genome before or sheep domestication 9,000 ago. A provirus escaping dominant SR has emerged recently, likely within 200. This study indicates distinct events during evolution antagonism between endogenous exogenous retrovir.
Researchers evaluated the effectiveness of real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for diagnosing schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease caused by Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma haematobium. Current diagnosis relies on microscopic examination of stool or urine samples and serological assays, but these methods have low sensitivity. The study tested two in-house real-time PCRs targeting S. mansoni and S. haematobium in urine, stool, biopsy, and serum samples from 412 patients suspected of having schistosiasis before antiparasitic treatment. Results were compared to microscopic examination and serological assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indirect hemagglutination, and Western blot). Real-time PCRs increased sensitivity from 4.5% to 10.5% and 33.7 to 48.8% for S. haobium and S. mansoni in urine and stool, respectively. Serum PCR sensitivity was 72.7 and 94.1% in patients with positive microscopy. Specificity was 98.9%. After treatment, PCR positivity declined from 93.8% at 30 to 8.3% at 360 days, while antibodies remained positive 1 year. Real-time PCRs outperformed microscopy in stool and urine and could be used with Western blot-based serology, the gold standard for diagnosis. When serology is positive and microscopy negative, PCRs provide information for further exploration. DNA and antibodies are limited for early monitoring, but PCR useful 1 year post-treatment to confirm cure.
Researchers have applied machine learning techniques to estimate the conformational energies of large, structurally complex molecules, such as the natural product Archazolid, a potent inhibitor of vacuolar-type ATPase from the myxobacterium Archium gephy. This approach leverages information from previous calculations via Gaussian process regression to predict energies of new conformations. Predictive variance is used to determine if a conformation is within the interpolation region, allowing a balance between accuracy and computational speed. Results show mean absolute errors of less than 1 kcal/mol for energies of relaxed conformations at the density functional theory level (DFT/BP-disp/2-TZVP). This demonstrates the feasibility of machine learning models for structurally complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, enabling significant speed-ups in simulations of larger structures.
Researchers have developed a non-invasive method to detect antibodies against Ebola virus (EBOV) in wild ape feces, enabling the identification of gorillas with antibodies to EBO at a prevalence rate of 10%. This suggests that EBO exposure or infection is not uniformly lethal in this species. Evidence of antibodies was also found in gorillas previously thought to be unexposed to EBO, protected by geographical barriers of transmission. The new approach will aid in protecting apes from future EBO infections by detecting increased incidence of exposure, identifying immunologically naïve at-risk populations for vaccination, and tracking vaccine efficacy. Since human Ebola virus disease (EVD) is linked to contact with infected carcasses, identifying ape outbreaks may impact public health in local communities where EBO causes 88% case-fatality rates.
Researchers have identified a novel type III effector protein, XopL, from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, which exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and in planta. This activity induces plant cell death and subverts plant immunity. The E3 ligase activity is associated with the C-terminal region of Xop, which interacts with E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and mediates K11-linked polyubiquitin formation. The crystal structure of the Xop C-terminal domain revealed a novel fold, termed XL-box, not present in any characterized E3 ligases. Mutation of amino acids in the central XL-box disrupts E ligase activity and prevents Xop-induced cell death. The XL-box lacks cysteine residues, suggesting non-thioester ubiquitin-E ligase intermediates and a non-catal mechanism. The N-terminal region of Xop contains a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, potentially a protein-protein interaction module for target recognition. While E ligase is required for cell death, suppression of PAMP responses depends solely on N-terminal RR.
Researchers investigated the role of circulating follicular helper T (cTfh) cells in HIV infection and the impact of antiretroviral treatment (ART) on T and B cell function in a cohort of HIV-infected individuals in early (stage 1 and 2) and late (stage 3). The study found impaired cT cell function in individuals in stage 3 compared to stage 1/2, with lower B cell survival and IgG secretion in cT/B cocultures. This coincided with increased IL-10 and RANT and TN-α, suggesting inflammation altered cT and B responses. Elevated viral load in stage 3 correlated with decreased cT-mediated B Ig production, indicating viremia's role in cfh impairment and humoral response. Phenotypic perturbations were observed in the B compartment, with decreased resting cells in stage 3 compared stage 1/2, coinciding higher viremia. The coculture assay suggested intrinsic B defects contributed to impaired response despite lower level. cfh B responses were significantly altered in stage 3 compared stage 1/, coinciding increased inflammation and reduction B cells. Data suggest early ART for HIV-infected individuals could prevent dysregulation while preserving cfh function and cell memory.
Researchers have developed a miniaturized screen for a Schistosoma mansoni serergic protein-coupled receptor (Sm5-HT) to identify novel parasite-selective inhibitors for the treatment of schistosomiasis, a disease affecting over 200 million people worldwide. Current therapy relies on a single drug, praziquantel, with suboptimal features, necessitating next-generation anthelmintics. Despite 25% of human therapeutics targeting G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), no Schistosoma GPCR library has been reported. This study pharmacologically profiled Sm-HT as a modulator of praziquel efficacy in a miniaturized assay with high-content screening. A luciferase-based biosensor measured cellular cAMP levels, resolving proximal GPCR kinetics in intact. Data showed divergent pharmacological signature between Sm-HT and human homolog H-HT, supporting parasitic pharmacores optimization. New ligands and series with potency and selectivity for Sm-HT over H-HT were identified in vitro and validated in vivo against schistosules and adult worms. Sm-HT displayed irreversible inactivation, enhancing its appeal as a target for anthint ligand design. These data demonstrate feasibility of flatworm GPCRs in high-throughput screening to resolve GPCR modulators and Sm-HT as a chemotherapeutic node for next-generation anthint development.
During embryonic development, the formation of the three primary germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) is crucial for the organization of the metazoan body. In some organisms, such as flies, fish, and amphibians, the ectodermesoderm boundary not only separates the layers but also serves as a substrate for mesoderm migration, requiring compatibility with cell attachment and detachment. This study reveals that contact-induced detachment at the boundary is key to ectodermeserm segregation. Cells alternate between adhesion and detachment, mediated by Ephrin/Eph signaling. Multiple Ephrin ligands and Eph receptors are expressed on both sides of the boundary, with separation dependent on forward signaling in both directions, involving redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and Rho.
Researchers analyzed blood samples from 83 individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and 76 age-matched neurotypical peers to identify biochemical markers of the disorder. Metabolite concentrations of folate-dependent one-carbon and transulfuration pathways were measured. Discriminant analysis classified participants as ASD or neurotypical, correctly identifying 96.1% of neurotyp and 97.6% of ASD. Partial least squares regression predicted adaptive behavior, measured by Vineland Adaptive Composite score, using 5 metabolites, with R2 of 0.45 after cross-validation.
Researchers applied Bayesian geostatistical modeling to analyze the incidence of cutaneous and visceral leishmanias in Brazil over a 10-year period (2001-2010). The study focused on spatial and temporal patterns of the diseases, which are endemic in 98 countries and affect approximately 350 million people, with 2 million cases annually. Brazil is one of the most affected countries. The models used integrated Laplace approximations for fast Bayesian inference and variable selection to identify climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic predictors. Results showed precipitation and socioeconomic factors were significant for both cutaneous and visceral leishiasis. Predicted cases for 2010 were 30,189 (SD:7,676) for cutaneous and 4,889 (SD:288) for visceral. Maps identified Minas Gerais and Para as high-risk states for visceral and cutaneous leishias, respectively. Spatial maps highlighted areas for targeted control efforts to reduce incidence.
A study of 1,528 deng cases admitted to a hospital in southern Vietnam found differences in clinical features between adults and children. Adults had more severe thrombocytopenia and bleeding manifestations, while children had more vascular leakage and shock. Adults also had more organ involvement. Thrombocytopenia was associated with secondary infection and serotype, but age had a smaller effect. Adults had lower platelet counts than children both during and after recovery.
Researchers identified a novel CCR5 mutation in sooty mangabeys (SM) that results in a truncated protein not expressed on the cell surface and unable to support SIV entry in vitro. This mutation, denoted as CCRΔ2, was found at 26% frequency in a large SM colony, alongside 3% for CCR5Δ24, which also ablates surface expression. 8% of animals were homozygous for defective C5 alleles and 41% were heterozygous. The mutation was also present in wild SM in West Africa. CD8 and CD4 T cells showed a C5 expression gradient across genotype, significant for CD8 cells. Notably, SIVm infection prevalence was not different in animals lacking C5 compared to heterozygous and wild-type. Animals lacking C5 had robust viral loads, modestly lower than wild-type. SIV primary isolates infected homozyg mutant and wild PBMC in C5-independent manner, and Envs from C-null and wild used CX6, G15, G1 in addition to C5 transfected cells. These data indicate Ssm relies on C-independent pathways in SM homo for C5, while alternative use in SM with C5 is uncertain, suggesting S tropism and cell targeting in vivo defined by distribution and use of pathways in addition C5. S entry through alternative in vivo raises possibility of C-negative cells may be more expendable C+ and enable virus replicate without disease in face restricted C expression SM and other natural species.
Researchers have investigated the role of the transcription factor MEF2 in cancer development and found that it can have both pro-oncogenic and tumor-suppressive activities depending on its interactions with co-activators or co-repressors. MEF2 influences histone modifications associated with gene activation or repression, such as H3 methylation and H3 acetylation. Class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) are critical for generating a repressive M2 environment. In leiomyosarcoma (L), a type of cancer, M2 has a dual role in tumor aggressiveness. Class II HDs are overexpressed in 22% of L, where high levels of M2, HD4, and HD9 inversely correlate with overall survival. Knocking out HD9 suppresses the transformed phenotype of L cells by restoring transcriptional proficiency of M2-target loci. HD9 coordinates demethylation of H3me3 at promoters of M2 genes. Class II HDs do not bind regulatory elements bound by M2. M2-target genes can be both transcribed and repressed. However, repressed M2-targets are poised in chromatin signature.
Hydrophins are a class of proteins produced by filamentous fungi that play a crucial role in their interaction with their environment and have potential applications in biotechnology. This study used a combination of protein docking, molecular dynamics, and cryo-electron microscopy to investigate the atomic structure of films composed of two class II hydrophins, HFBI and HFB, produced by Trichoderma rei. The results suggest a unit cell composed of six proteins, with computational simulations indicating P6 symmetry and experimental results showing P symmetry with a unit size of 56 Å. An alternate structure with three protein cell P symmetry and smaller unit size was also proposed computationally possible. A Monte Carlo simulation of a spin model representing the hydroph film showed the alternate structure may increase the rate of surface coverage by hydrophin films, suggesting a mechanism relevant to both biology and nanotechnology.
Researchers have identified and characterized the threonine tRNA synthetase (LThrRS) enzyme of Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite causing visceral leishmaniasis. Recombinant LThr (rThr) was expressed in E. coli and purified, and its kinetic parameters were determined. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed subcellular localization of Thr to both cytosol and mitochondria. Heterozygous mutants of Thr were generated in Leish promastigotes, which showed restrictive growth and attenuated infectivity, and increased sensitivity to the Thr inhibitor borid. An in silico structural model of LThr was compared to human Thr, displaying considerable similarity. Recombinant Thr displayed aminoacylation activity and was inhibited by borid with IC50 0.06 μM. Borid also inhibited promastig stage parasites with IC50 21 μM. Data suggests Thr is essential for L donani survival and a potential target for drug discovery.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is recognized as non-self by the innate immune receptor RIG-I through the presence of a 5'-triphosphate (5'-pp) on viral RNA associated with a 3' poly-UUC tract. The study defines the HCV pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) and criteria for R-I non-discrimination of HCV by examining RNA-function attributes that impart PAMP to the poly-UUC tract. A 34 nucleotide polyuridine core of the sequence is essential for R-I activation, and interspersed ribosine nucleotides between poly sequences in RNA are required for optimal R-I induction. 5-pp poly-U RNA variants stimulate R-I efficiently and bind purified R protein in vitro, and interaction with repressor and helicase domains of R is required for signaling. Appended to 5-pp RNA lacking P activity, the-U core sequence confers non-recognition and innate signaling by-I. Importantly, H poly-U variants strongly activate-I triggered potent responses in vitro and hepatic immune in vivo using a mouse model. These studies define a multi-mot P signature of non-recognition-I that incorporates 5-pp with uridine composition and length. The H motif drives potent-I to induce the response to infection.
Eosinophils and IL-4 Support Larval Growth Coincident with Innate Response to Tissue Injury

Eosinophils, previously known for their roles in host defense and allergy, have been found to play a significant role in tissue regeneration and metabolism. This study investigated the mechanism by which eosophils promote growth of Trichella spiralis larvae in skeletal muscle. Results show that IL-4 and eosophils are necessary for normal larval growth, and eosoph from IL-4 competent mice are sufficient to support growth. The eosophil effect operates in the absence of adaptive immunity. Following invasion by larvae, host gene expression in muscle is consistent with a regenerative response and shift in energy source in infected tissue. The presence eosoph suppresses local inflammation and influences nutrient homeostasis in muscle. Redistribution of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and phosphorylation of Akt are observed in cells, consistent with enhancement of glucose and glycogen storage by larvae. Data indicate eosoph promote larval growth by IL-4 mechanism that limits interferon-driven responses that alter metabolism in muscle. A novel interaction between parasite and host is documented, where worms co-opt an innate cell response to facilitate growth.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide analysis of DNA replication kinetics in human cells, contradicting the view that mammalian chromosomes consist of megabase domains of coordinated origin firing separated by large originless regions. In HeLa cells, sorted into four temporal phases of S, replication origins were found to be spaced 40 kilobases apart, firing in small clusters with increasing synchrony during S phase, and replication velocity remaining constant at 0.7-2 kilobases per minute. Multi-scale analysis of genome-wide replication profiles revealed broad timing gradients with no regions larger than 100 kilobases replicating at less than 2 kilobases per minute. HeLa cells lacked large regions of unidirectional fork progression. Temporal transitions were replicated by sequential activation of origins at increasing rate during S, and timing set by delay between successive firings rather than single fork velocity. Activation of internal origins in a temporal region was demonstrated by combing the IGH locus in HeLa. Analysis of origin maps in He and published timing comb data in other cell types corroborated findings, except embryonic cells with unidirectional fork regions more abundant.
Researchers investigated how the "temporal stability" or "slown" approach, which enables the nervous system to recognize objects despite changes in contextual variables such as perspective or lighting, can be implemented using biologically realistic learning rules. They proposed a slow feature analysis algorithm based on slown, which can be implemented in continuous neurons using a modified Hebbian learning rule, linking it to the trace rule, another implementation of slown learning. For Poisson neurons, slown can be implemented by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with a specific window. Analyzing STDP, they found that the learning window alone is not sufficient, but the convolution of the window with postsynaptic potential is crucial. They derived STDP windows implementing slow analysis and the trace rule, compatible with physiological data in shape and timescale. The analysis showed the window can be split into reversible and irreversible components sensitive to input statistics. Irreversible statistics favor oscillatory weight dynamics, not stable distributions. The study offers a novel interpretation of ST's functional role in neurons.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism of resistance to chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL) called cooperative adaptation therapy (CAT), where cancer cells induce resistant phenotypes in neighboring cells when exposed to therapy. Using a CRISPR/Cas9 toolkit, they engineered phenotypically diverse NSCL cells with mutations in Dicer, a type III cytoplasmic endonuclease involved in non-coding RNA genesis. In a three-dimensional growth dynamics, fluorescently-labeled mutant and wild-type cells were cultured individually or co-cultured in a substrate-free system under stimulated or drug conditions. Mathematical modeling with flow cytometry characterized growth patterns of mono- and co-cultures using a model of intra- and interspecies competition. Parameters were estimated from flow cytometry data, revealing co-cultures allowed growth in previously sensitive cells despite drug pressure via cell transitions described by cooperative game-theoretic change in fitness. An ex vivo human tumor model predicted clinical response through drug sensitivity, correlating cellular heterogeneity to prognostic failure of multiple-approved and off-label drugs in NSCL patient samples.
A cross-sectional seropreval study was conducted in the Mbeya region of South Tanzania to estimate the serrevalence of IgG antibodies against Spotted Group (SFG) ricketiae and assess socioeconomic and environmental risk factors. A total of 1,228 participants aged 5 years were randomly selected from nine communities, stratified by age, altitude, and ownership of domestic mammals. Serology (indirect immunofluorescence) was performed at a dilution 1:64. SFG-serositivity in the cohort was 67.9% (range 42.8-91.4%). Multivariable analysis revealed associations with age (PR 1.08; 1.06-1.10), warmer temperatures (1.38;1.11-1.71), male (1.08;1-1.16), and lower population density (0.96;0.94-0.99). At higher elevations, cattle density was associated with higher serreval. SFG ricketial infection is common in rural Mbeya population. Spread limited by temperature and elevation. Examination of S contribution to febrile illnesses warranted in prospective study to estimate disease burden and causative pathogens.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate in the innate immune response of the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans. Through an RNA interference (RNAi) screen of regulators of innate defense genes, two stearoy-coenzyme desaturases were found to synthesize oleate in C. elegans. The synthesis of oleate is necessary for pathogen-mediated induction of defense genes, as C. elegans deficient in ole production are hypersusceptible to infection with diverse pathogens, which can be rescued by addition of exogenous oleate. However, oleate is not sufficient to drive immune activation on its own.
Researchers have identified a novel compound, pyrimidine (PC), which selectively inhibits guanine-related metabolic pathways in bacteria by binding to guanine ribwitches, a regulatory elements that modulate gene expression in response to specific metabolite binding. Guanine ribwitches are involved in purine transport and biosynthesis, crucial for nucleotide cellular pools. Upon guanine binding, these ribwitches stabilize 5'-untranslated mRNA, causing transcription attenuation of downstream reading frames. Targeting guanine ribwitch with agonists can repress gene expression when cells are starved for guanine. Antibiotics binding ribwitches provide novel compounds that can be rationally designed from ribwitch structures. PC binds guanine ribwitch, showing bactericidal activity against a subgroup of bacterial species, including nosocomial pathogens. Selective killing is achieved when guA, coding GMP synthase, is under ribwitch control. Multiple drug-resistant strains were inhibited, suggesting PC targets different pathway. A mouse model demonstrated direct correlation between PC administration and Staphylococcus aureus infection reduction in mammary glands. This establishes possibility using existing knowledge to design gu ribwitch-targeting antibiotics as antimicrobial compounds. A new gu ribwitch target is crucial as community-acquired infections emerge.
Researchers investigated how gaze influences the construction of mental space during navigation in primates by examining behavior, visual exploration, and hippocampal activity in macaque monkeys navigating a virtual reality maze for a reward. The study found that cells sensitive to place responded to one or more variables like direction of head, point of gaze, or context. Many cells fired at the sight and in anticipation of a landmark in viewpoint or task-dependent manner, encoding the animal's situation within a set of actions leading to the goal. Hippocampal activity was best described by a fine-grained space comprising current position, view, and context. The results indicate that place cells in primates embody multidimensional task-situated knowledge to the target of gaze, supporting self-awareness in construction of space.
Researchers have conducted a spatial analysis of gene expression patterns at the mid-hind boundary (MHB) in vertebrate development to understand the regulatory network of transcription and secret factors involved in its establishment and maintenance. They employed Boolean logic minimization of functions to identify key interactions in the network and found that fibroblast growth factor 8 (Fgf8) has a maintaining rather than inducing effect on Wnt1 expression, contrary to previous data. Using mouse neural plate explant cultures, they confirmed that F8 maintains but does not induce ectopic W1 expression. Combining this with previously validated interactions, they constructed a regulatory network of key transcription and secret factors at the MHB. Analysis of Boolean and reaction-diffusion models of this network showed it can explain the stable maintenance of M as well as expression patterns under wild-type and knockout conditions. The study demonstrates that spatial expression patterns can be used to infer regulatory networks, revealing the maintenance of M boundary on a systems level.
Theileria annulata, an apicomplex parasite, infects host cells, inducing uncontrolled proliferation and clonal expansion of the parasitized population. After sporozoite entry, the host cell membrane dissolves and an array of host microtubules (MTs) surrounds the parasite, transforming into a schizont. The schizont remains tethered to host MTs during mitosis and cytokinesis, engaging cell's astral and central MTs for distribution between daughter cells. The mechanism of schizont stabilizing host MTs is unknown. MT minus ends are anchored at the organizing center, while plus ends explore space, switching growth and shrinkage phases (dynamic instability). The schizont recruits schizont end-binding protein 1 (EB1), a key regulator of host MT dynamics. 

In vitro experiments show T. annata p104, a polymorphic antigen on schizont surface, functions as EB-binding protein, recruiting EB without other parasite proteins. Binding depends on a consensus SIP motif in disordered C-terminal p104. Interaction with host EB is cell cycle regulated. This is first pathogen-encoded protein interacting with EB via SIP. Findings provide insight into Theia-host cytoskeleton interaction.
In yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, broken replication forks are typically repaired through homologous recombination or break-induced replication (BIR). However, a mutation in the replicase Cdc9 gene leads to a population of cells with persistent DNA damage, likely due to broken forks, and constitutive activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. This results in longer telomeres. Telomere length requires functional telomerase, the DNA damage signaling cascade Mec1-Rad-Rad53, and BIR pathway components Rad51, Rad52, Pol32, and Pif. The Mec-Rad53 phosphorylation of Pif, necessary for inhibiting telomerase at double strand breaks, is also crucial for Pif's role in BIR and telomere elongation in cdc-1 cells. Mutants c44 and r3, with impaired replication, exhibit a similar long telom phenotype dependent on Pif phosphorylation. Passage of B forks through telomeres promotes telom activity, leading to telom lengthening.
Researchers investigated the use of luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) as a rapid and specific diagnostic tool for Onchocerca volulus infection. Four recombinantly produced Onocerca volulus antigens (Ov-AR-1, Ov-1, Ov-MS-1, and OvPI-1) were tested on a large cohort of sera from uninfected controls and patients with proven parasitic infections, including Onoc volulus, Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Strongloides steralis. Antibody responses to the four antigens allowed differentiation between infected and uninfected sera with 100% sensitivity and 100 specificity. Analysis of antibody titers to each antigen in infected sera revealed they were different and did not correlate with each other. Compared to infected, patients with W, L, S, and other conditions had lower geometric mean antibody titers to each antigen. A mixture of the four antigens in standard or 15-minute format showed 100 sensitivity and specificity distinguishing infected from unected sera. The 15-minute format had best performance with sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing from W, L, and S-infected sera. The multi-antigen IPS can be used as rapid, high-throughput tool to diagnose individual infections and sensitive point-of-care for early detection recrudescence in areas control and new transmission.
A 54-month iron-folic acid supplementation and deworming program was implemented in a rural population of women in northern Vietnam to evaluate its effectiveness in reducing anemia, iron deficiency anemia, and soil-transmitted infections. The study used a prospective cohort design and enrolled 389 participants prior to the intervention. After 54 months, 76% of participants were taking ironolic acid supplements and 95% had received deworming treatment. Hemoglobin levels increased from 122 g/L to 131 g and anemia prevalence fell from 38% to 18, with significant differences between ethnic groups. Iron deficiency decreased from 23% to 8 and iron deficiency anemia from 4%. Hookworm infection prevalence reduced from 76 to 11 and moderate to heavy soil-transmitted helth infestation to less than 1.
Epstein-Barr Virus Glycoprotein gp150 Forms an Immune-Evasive Glycan Shield at the Surface of Infected Cells

Epstein-B virus (EBV), a prototypic herpesvirus, encodes a novel immunoevasion protein, gp150, expressed during the late phase of viral replication. This protein inhibits antigen presentation by HLA I, H II, and non-class lipid-presenting CD1 molecules. The mechanism of gp150-mediated T-cell escape does not depend on degradation of antigen-presenting molecules nor does it require gp's cytoplasmic tail. Through abundant glycosylation, gp creates a shield that impedes surface antigen presentation. This is an unprecedented immune evasion mechanism for herpesviruses. EB gp has a broader target range and could impact beyond T-cell activation. B cells infected with a gp-null EB displayed rescued levels of antigen presentation by H I, II, and CD, indicating an important role for NKT cells in fighting EB infection. The results indicate EB gp prolongs the lifespan of viral offspring at the most vulnerable stage of the life cycle.
Researchers have identified a conserved actin-binding domain in the translocated actin recruiting protein (Tarp) among pathogenic Chlamydial species. Previous studies have shown that a specific proline-rich domain in Chlamydia trachomatis' Tarp is required for actin nucleation. A peptide antibodies targeting the Tarp actin-binding domain inhibited actin polymerization in vitro and Chydia trachatis entry in vivo, indicating Tarp's essential role in Chlamydial pathogenesis. Sequence analysis of Tarp orthologs from additional Chydial species and Chydia serovars revealed multiple putative actin-binding sites. To determine if the identified actin domains are functionally conserved, GSTarp fusions from Chydial species were tested for their ability to bind and nucleate actin. Results showed that Chyd Tarp harbored variable numbers of actin sites and promoted actin nucleation in vitro. The study suggests that T-mediated actin binding and nucleation is a conserved among Chyd species and plays a critical role in bacterial invasion of host cells.
A novel procedure for precise quantification of Schistosoma japonicum eggs in bovine feces has been developed. Schistosomiasis japon is a zoonosis with multiple mammalian hosts, including buffaloes, which contribute to 75% of human transmission in the People's Republic of China. Determining prevalence and intensity of Schosoma japon in mammalian hosts is crucial for calculating transmission and environmental contamination. A new technique, formalin-ethylate sedimentation-digestion (F-SD), is described for visualizing S japon eggs in bovine fec. It involves filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation prior to microscopy. This technique removes 70% debris from fecal samples, rendering remaining debris translucent, allowing microscopic visualization of S japon eggs and accurate estimation of infection in boines and ruminant hosts. The F-SD technique is valuable for surveillance of S japon reservoirs, particularly in areas with low to high intensity or suspected schos elimination.
Mutations in the genes encoding cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) and proly 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1), encoded by LEP1, were first identified as causes of recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). These proteins, along with cyclophilin (encoded PPI), form a complex that 3-hydroxylates a proline on the α1(I) chain (Pro986) and has cis-trans isomerase (Pase activity essential for collagen folding. Recent data suggest proly 3-hydrolation of Pro is not required for collagen stability; however, absence of post-translational modification may disrupt protein interactions for proper folding and lead to collagen overmodification. PH and CRTAP stabilize each other, and absence one results in degradation of other. Hypomorphic or loss of function of either gene causes loss of complex and associated functions. The contribution of this complex's 3-hydrolysis versus Pase and chaperone activities to OI phenotype is unknown. To distinguish, knock-in mice carrying single amino substitution in catalytic site PH (Lep1H662) were generated. This abolished PH activity but retained ability form complex CRT and chaper function. Knock mice showed absence proly 3ydrolation Pro of α(I) and α(I) collagen but significant overmodification other residues. They normal appearance, no growth and cartilage plate histology normal but trabecular bone mass decreased. This model recapitulates O bone but not cartilage phenotypes caused loss proly 3ydrolation complex. Observations suggest tissue consequences selective inactivation PH versus ablation proly 3ydro complex.
Researchers have identified a phenomenon of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila simulans, a species closely related to Drosila melanogaster, caused by the invasion of the P-element, a selfish genetic element. This element was horizontally transferred from a distant species to D. melanogaster, causing hybrid dysgenesis, a syndrome of abnormal phenotypes including sterility, and spread globally in a few decades. Until recently, its sister species, D simul, remained P-element free. However, a survey of 181 D simul strains shows 20% induce dysgenesis. Genomic and transcriptomic data reveal dys-inducing phenotype associated with P-element invasion. To characterize temporally and geographically, 631 D simul strains on three continents over 27 years were surveyed for P-element presence. Results show D simul P-element occurred rapidly and simultaneously in regions, with strains containing P-elements rare in 200 and common by 201. Strains from latter invasion phase have adapted to suppress P-element effects, evidenced by resistance to dys phenotype.
Researchers have developed a method to use rhodamine B to mark the bodies and seminal fluid of male Aedes aegypt for mark-release experiments and estimate the efficacy of sterile male releases. Rhodamine, a thiol-reactive fluorescent dye, was administered via sugar-feeding to stain the tissue and seminal fluid of the insects. The study adapted this technique for Ae. aegypt to assess mating success during field releases. Marking was achieved by feeding males on 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8% rhamine (w/v in 50% honey solutions during flight. All concentrations >95% transferred to females and marked the body after 4 days, with 0.4 and 0.8 solutions producing the longest marking. Rhamine had no effect on male competitiveness. Field releases demonstrated transfer of marked fluid to females and recapture of marked males. Rhamine is a potentially useful method for male-based S/I control and a viable marking technique for male-release experiments without negative effects of traditional methods. It is less expensive than PCR paternity analysis and stable isotope labelling and less time-consuming than fertility assays to assess sterilized males.
Bacterial superantigens, a diverse family of toxins, induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock. The CD28 homodimer, expressed on T cells, functions as the principal costimulatory ligand in the immune response through interaction with its B ligands. However, superantigens must bind directly to the dimer interface of CD28 to elicit inflammatory cytokine expression and toxicity. Preventing superigen access to CD28 suffices to block lethality. Mice were protected from superigen challenge by peptide mimetics of the CD28 dimer and peptides competing with superigen for binding site CD. Superigens use a conserved β-strand/α-helix domain to engage CD28. Mutation of superigen domain abolished cytokine induction and lethality. Structural analysis showed superigen binds to T receptor on T and major histocompatibility class II on antigen-presenting cell, CD28 accommodated as superigen receptor in ternary complex, with CD dimer oriented towards β-str/α domain superigen. Our findings identify CD28 interface as critical for superigens. The role of28 as receptor for microbial pathogens, superigens, broadens pathogen recognition mechanisms.
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have a fast cell cycle with a short G1 phase due to the lack of cell cycle inhibitors, maintaining naïve pluripotency and preventing differentiation. The Wnt/β-caten pathway controls ESC pluripotency via Wnt-effector T3, but its role in cell cycle regulation is unknown. This study reveals that W-eff Tcf1 is recruited to activate the Ink/Ar tumor suppressor locus, restoring G1 phase and reducing ESC proliferation without affecting pluripotency. T1, not T3, is recruited to palindromic motifs in p15k, p16, and p19 promoters, mediating Wnt anti-proliferative effect in ESCs. βaten or T1 ablation impairs W-dependent cycle regulation. W signaling controls ESC pluripotency and proliferation through distinct T functions.
Researchers investigated the role of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in the immune response to deng virus (DENV) infection. pDCs are innate immune cells that secrete interferon-alpha (IF-α) and express tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in response to virus exposure. The study aimed to characterize pDC activation in deng patients and their function under DENV-2 stimulation in vitro. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that pDC from mildeng patients had higher frequencies of TRAIL expression compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma levels of IF-α and soluble TRAIL were increased in mild compared to severeeng patients, correlating with p activation. In vitro exposure to D-2 induced TR expression on p. Three-dimensional microscopy showed TR was relocalized from intracellular to plasma membrane. Chloroquine inhibited D- induced TR localization and IF- production by p. Endosomal degradation by chloro allowed viral detection inside p. Data suggest endocyt pathway activation by D in p. Coculture p/D- infected monocytes showed antigen reduction by flow cytometry. Antigens in monocytes were also observed after exogenous IF- treatment. p effect on viral load was dependent on IF- production This study characterizes DENV infection of p in vivo and antiral in vitro. TR-expressing p may have role in disease outcome.
Researchers have investigated the role of tumor necrosis factor (TN) in the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. TN plays a crucial role in host defense against Mtb in both active and latent phases of infection. TN-neutralizing drugs, used to treat inflammatory disorders, have been linked to increased risk of tuberculosis (TB) in animal studies. This study used a computational approach to characterize TN's role in protection against the tubercle bacillus in active and latent infection, extending previous models to investigate soluble (sTN) and transmembrane TN (TN) production. The effects of anti-TNF therapy in clinical trials were simulated, analyzing two commonly used therapies, anti-T antibody and TN receptor fusion, to predict differences in TB reactivation rates. The study found that bioavailability of TN following anti-T therapy is the primary cause of latent infection reactivation and that even low levels of sTN are essential for infection control. A mathematical model distinguished the mechanisms of action of anti-T treatments and TN's role in TB pathology. The study suggests a TN-modulating agent could balance reduction of inflammation with resistance to infection and disease. Alternatively, anti-T therapy dose and timing could be modified. Anti-T therapy may lead to primary TB incidents in areas with high exposure.
Recent studies have revealed the presence of retroduplication variations (RDVs), a class of polymorphisms where a retrocopy is present or absent in individual genomes, resulting from recent retroduplications. This study investigates variation in loss of ancestral retrocopies among human populations using Phase 1 data from the 1000 Genomes Project and RNA-Seq data from Illumina Body project and lymphoblast cell lines from Geuvis Consortium. A new approach was developed to detect novel retrocopies absent from the human reference genome, experimentally confirmed in 17 populations, detecting 193 RDVs, mostly from retro deletion. Most were previously unreported. Expression of 11 ancestral retrogenes deleted in individuals was experimentally confirmed, with low frequency, except one. Conservation and low deletion rate of remaining retro suggest functionality. Aside from presence/absence of retrocopies, differences in expression levels between populations were searched, finding 9 retro statistically differentially expressed.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the location of Taenia solium cysticerci in the brain and the inflammatory response to praziquel treatment in porcine neurocysticercosis. The study analyzed 196 histological specimens from 11 pigs infected with Taenia solium cysterci, sacrificed at 2 and 5 days after a single dose of prazantel, and 3 without treatment. Pigs were intravenously injected with Evans blue to assess blood-brain barrier disruption. The degree of inflammation was estimated using a histological score (ISC) based on pericyst inflammation in photomicrographs at 40 amplification. Results showed that parenchymal cystic provoked higher peric inflammation (ISC) after antiparas treatment compared to meninge and corteningal cystic. Mingeal cystic ISC was not affected by treatment. Corteningal cystic ISC increased with cyst extent adjacent to parenym. Blood-brain disruption associated with treatment in parenym tissue. Inflammatory response meningeal cystic decreased compared parenymal.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in two districts of Ghana where azithromycin mass administration for trachoma control had previously taken place. The study aimed to investigate the presence of yaws, caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies perten, following mass distribution of azithrom at a lower dose for trach control. A total of 90 children aged 5-17 years with ulcerative lesions compatible with yaws were enrolled from 30 communities. Treponemal serology and PCR samples were collected from all children, and syphilis serology was negative in all. PCR for T. pallum subspecies perten was negative in all, but Haemophilus duyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. The study found no evidence of ongoing y transmission in communities previously treated for trach. H. duyi was associated with a proportion of skin lesions, but majority remained unexplained.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism to inhibit the seeding and maintenance of the HIV reservoir, a major challenge in HIV treatment, by targeting the Jak-STAT pathway, a key regulator of T cell homeostasis. This pathway is crucial for memory T cells, the hub of the HIV reservoir. Two FDA-approved Jak inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxitin, were evaluated for their ability to block reservoir seeding and maintenance in vitro. Results show that Jak inhibitors reduce the frequency of CD4+ T cells harboring integrated HIV DNA and block viral production from infected cells, inhibiting IL-15-induced reactivation of latent virus and transmission to bystander T cells. The study demonstrates the Jak-STAT pathway's role in HIV persistence in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro, with STAT5 correlating with integrated viral DNA levels. Inhibitors also reduce the magnitude of HIV in all CD4 T subsets in vitro and ex vivo. Dysregulation of the Jak-STAT pathway is associated with viral persistence, and inhibitors target key events downstream of cytokine (IL-2, IL-7, IL-15) receptor ligation, impacting the reservoir. These findings suggest Jak inhibitors as a therapeutic modality to prevent key T cell activation events regulating persistence and may be integrated into future curative strategies.
Researchers investigated the effects of baculovirus infection on the immune response of Spodoptera exigua larvae using microarray analysis. Contrary to the expected transcriptional shutdown during baculirus infection, S exigua cells exhibited a balanced up- and down-regulation of genes in the first 36 hours post-infection. Immune-related genes, including pattern recognition proteins, signaling pathways, and effectors, and melanization proteins were down-regulated. This downregulation was confirmed in the larval gut, affecting immune gene expression in the gut, which influences gut microbiota, responsible for growth and development. The study hypothesized that downregulation after baculirus infection increased gut microbiota. An increase in bacterial load was observed, attributed to viral infection. Subsequent experiments with baculirus in presence and absence of microbiota revealed bacteria enhanced bacul virulence and pathogenicity.
Researchers have identified a novel gene that regulates the transition from meiosis to mitosis in apomix, a form of asexual reproduction in plants. This gene, when mutated in combination with others affecting meiotic processes, resulted in a genotype Mi, where meiosis is replaced by mitosis. Plants with this genotype produce diploid gametes identical to their mother.
Researchers have developed a new approach to prioritize disease-causing genes by incorporating tissue-specific information into protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Current methods rely on the observation that genes causing similar diseases are close to each other in P networks, but use a static view of human PIs. This study integrates tissue-specific gene expression data with P information to create tissue-specific P networks for 60 tissues and assesses their prioritization power. Tissue-specific networks improve prioritization results compared to generic networks and predict novel disease-tissue associations, indicating subclinical effects that may be missed.
Researchers have developed a two-locus model to study the evolution of insecticide resistance in mosquito species that transmit human diseases such as malaria. The model accounts for differential exposure of males and females to high or low concentrations of insecticide and varying selection pressures and dominance values based on insecticide concentration. The model was applied to investigate the effectiveness of sequential versus mixed insecticide deployment to minimize resistance spread. Results showed that in 56% of runs, resistance spread to high levels by 500 generations, while 44% favored mixed and 24% sequential use. Mixture favored when insecticide effectiveness is high and exposure is low. If insecticides do not kill homozygous genotypes, sequential is more robust. Resistance spreads slower with mixture, but may not outperform sequential. For example, mixture lasts 5 years while individual insecticides last 3 and 4, giving 7 years lifespan for sequential.
Rhodnius neglectus, a species of triatomine bug, is a hematophagous insect vector of Chagas disease, a significant public health concern in the Americas. The insect's saliva contains bioactive molecules that modulate host hemostatic, inflammatory, and immune responses. To investigate the composition of R. neglectus saliva, next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based protein identification were employed. A total of 4,230 DNA sequences were deposited in GenBank, and 636 coding sequences of putative secretory proteins were extracted from assembled reads, 73 confirmed by proteomic analysis. Characterization of R. neglectus saliva revealed serine protease transcripts and presence of ubiquitous protein families, including lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, antigen-5 metalloproteases, disintegrins, and odorant binding proteins. These findings enhance understanding of hematophagous arthropod saliva and interplay among vectors and vertebrate hosts.
Researchers used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism to study the interaction between nematodes and soil bacteria. They employed transcriptional profiling to identify genes differentially expressed in response to bacteria isolated from grassland nematodes and grass soils. The study aimed to determine if differential expression is predictive of functional importance in the environment where induced. Candidate genes were predicted to affect metabolism and immunity, suggesting influence on nemode community dynamics. Mutations in 21 identified genes showed contribution to lifespan and fitness in specific bacterial environments. Although bacteria are not a natural food source for C. elegans, changes in food source due to environmental disturbance affected gene expression and fitness. Regression analysis demonstrated that degree of differential expression between environments predicted magnitude of gene loss of function on life traits in those environments.
A critical event in mammalian embryo development is the formation of an inner cell mass surrounded by a trophoblast, a shell of cells that later form extraembryonic structures. Researchers used multi-scale modeling to investigate the principles responsible for robust establishment of these structures. The study made three predictions, supported by quantitative imaging data. First, stochastic gene expression of critical genes promotes cell plasticity in the developing blastocyst. Second, asymmetry in levels of Cdx2 and Oct4 expression variation provides a means to benefit from noise-mediated plasticity while reducing detrimental effects of stochasticity. Third, the embryo temporally modulates plasticity by controlling timing and pace of cell specification, creating a window for cells to continually read environment and adjust fate.
Researchers have investigated the ability of germline-encoded antibodies to bind to diverse antigens and their potential for polyspecificity. They found that germl-encoded antibodies can bind to multiple antigens due to structural flexibility in the germl gene, which allows for promiscuous binding. The affinity and specificity for a particular epitope increases as the antibody acquires somatic mutations in antigen-stimulated B cells. To determine the basis for recognition of diverse antigens by germl-encoded antibodies, researchers computationally redesigned antibodies encoded by VH segments to bind multiple antigens. The Rosetta multi-state process predicted antibody sequences for the entire heavy chain region, including framework, CDR, and CDR mutations. The predicted sequences matched germl gene to a remarkable degree, revealing residues that enable polyspecific binding. In contrast, designing antibodies to bind a single antigen returned a similar sequence to mature sequence, mimicking natural maturation. The computational algorithm captures aspects of antibody-antigen recognition. The CDR region often mediates specificity, but VH CDR, CDR, and immunoglobulin framework contribute to polyspecificity in germl antibodies. Designing antibodies to bind multiple antigens may allow rational design of polyspecific for diverse epitope binding.
Locusts exhibit two distinct behavioral phases: solitar and gregar. Solitar individuals are repelled by other locusts, while gregar insects are attracted to conspecifics and form large aggregations, such as marching hopper bands. Biological experiments at the individual level have shown that crowding biases towards the gregar form. To understand hopper band formation, we study phase change at the collective level, using a quantitative framework. A partial integrodifferential model is constructed, incorporating interplay between phase and spatial movement at the individual level to predict hopper dynamics at the population. Stability analysis reveals conditions for an outbreak, characterized by a large transition to gregar. The model enables quantification of temporal dynamics of each phase, proportion of the population that gregarizes, and time for this to occur. Numerical simulations describe aggregation's structure, revealing transient clumps of gregar insects.
Researchers have characterized an intermediate structure in the fusion process of flaviviruses, a type of virus that causes diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis. The fusion process involves conformational changes in viral glycoproteins, called fusion proteins. High-resolution images of these proteins in their initial and final stages are available, but the intermediate steps in between have been difficult to define due to their transient nature. Flaviruses have a class II fusion protein (E) that mediates fusion at acidic pH, changing from a dimer to trimer with a hair-like structure during fusion. Exposing tick-borne encephal virus particles to alkaline instead of acidic pH traps them in an intermediate state where dimers dissociate and interact with membranes via fusion peptide without merging. Further exposure to low pH leads to fusion, indicating these monomers correspond to an elusive intermediate converting prefusion dimer to postfusion trimer. Using non-physiological conditions, researchers dissected the flavivirus process and identified two steps: membrane insertion of multiple E monomers precedes formation of hair-like trimers. This sequence provides new insights into viral membrane fusion dynamics.
The study investigates the drivers of extinction risk in plants, focusing on the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot, and compares Red List data for British and South African floras. The results show that taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs between regions, inconsistent with a trait-based model of extinction. A phylogenetic analysis of the Cape flora reveals a phylogenetic signal in extinction distribution, but most threatened species cluster at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to mammals. The distribution of threatened species across 11 exemplar clades suggests mode of speciation explains the phylogenetic structure of risks. The study finds that extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages, not explained by simple biological traits, and most vulnerable species are marching towards extinction at a rapid pace, independently of anthropogenic effects. The results have implications for conservation and question the utility of Red List criteria in regions with rapid speciation, aiming to preserve the tree-of-life.
Researchers have identified two new proteins, Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (TK) and Vav, that interact with the phagocytic receptor Dectin-1 in macrophages to facilitate the phagocytosis of Candida albicans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen. Dect-1 is crucial for anti-fungal immunity. TK and Vav are recruited to phagocytic cups containing C. albicans yeasts or hyphae, but absent from mature phagosomes. TK and V localize to regions surrounding hye while Dect- lines phag phosome. TK and V colocalize with lipid (3,4,5)P3 and actin at phag cup, not diacylglycerol (DAG) marking mature phag membranes. Using a TK inhibitor, TK contributes to DAG synthesis at phag cup and PKC recruitment. TK or V-deficient peritoneal macrophages display defect in C. alb phocytosis. Bone-derived macrophages lacking TK or V show reduced C. alb uptake, similar toect-1 deficient. TK or V-deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic C infection than wild-type mice.
In Madagascar, Rift Valley Fever (RV) is a vector-borne disease affecting ruminants and humans, with a significant outbreak occurring in 2008-2009. To optimize resource allocation for RV surveillance, identifying at-risk environments is crucial. This study aimed to identify environmental and human factors favoring RV transmission in cattle and humans. Environmental characteristics of Malagasy communes were analyzed using Multiple Factor Analysis (FA), while cattle and human serological data were analyzed using Generalized Mixed Models, with serological status as response and FA and risk factors as explanatory variables. Results showed cattle and human seroprevalence positively associated with humid environments (p<0.001) and high cattle density (p<0.01, OR=2.6). Frequent contact with raw milk contributed to human infection (OR=1.6). Eastern, western, and northwestern areas were high-risk for RV transmission in cattle. The study integrated analysis of environmental and human datasets provided new insights into RV transmission patterns in Madagascar. The association between serrevalence, humid, and high cattle density suggests conitant and direct transmissions are critical for RV enzootic transmission. In at-risk environments, western, northwestern, and eastern areas, suitable Cule and Anophe mosquitoes vector transmission occurs in cattle and humans.
Researchers have investigated the transmission of prions, self-propagating protein conformations, between non-identical proteins, such as between homologous proteins from different species, and found that transmission is frequently inefficient. This inefficiency is attributed to differences in the prion protein sequence, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. A yeast Rq1[PIN]-based system was used to explore the nature of transmission barriers. Rq1[PIN, the prion form of R1, is common in wild and laboratory yeast strains, facilitating the appearance of other prions. R1's prion domain contains four Q-rich regions. The study found that R1 encompasses multiple prion determinants that independently drive amyloid formation in vitro and transmit the R1[P] prion in vivo. Analysis of R[P] transmission between R1 fragments with different prion determinants revealed that one Q-rich region is required and sufficient for transmission, but transmissions are impeded by barriers of different strength. The existence of transmission barriers in the absence of amino mismatches in regions indicates that prion multiple determinants cooperate to attain the prion conformation, and transmission is determined by cooperative fold.
Researchers have developed a novel, likelihood-free framework for inferring complex genetic models from genomic data using deep learning, a powerful machine learning technique. This approach leverages multilayer neural networks to learn a feature function mapping from input data (e.g., hundreds of summary statistics) to output (e.g., genetic parameters of interest). The method is demonstrated to be effective for population inference and feature learning from data. A concrete application focuses on jointly inferring natural selection and demography (population size history) in Drosila melanogaster. The method separates global demography from local selection without sequential steps for these factors. Demography and selection are studied jointly motivated by Drosila, where selection confounds demographic analysis. The method is applied to 197 Dila melanogaster genomes from Zambia to infer demography and regions of genome under selection. Results show many regions experienced hard sweeps and soft or balancing selection. Sweeps and balancing occur more frequently closer to chromosome centers. Demographic inference suggests previously estimated bottlenecks for Dila melanaster are extreme.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) oncogenes disrupt the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway by impairing FANCD2 localization and deubiquination.

 Persistent expression of high-risk HPV oncogenes is necessary for the development of anogenital and orophngeal cancers. Research has shown that E6/E7-expressing cells are hypersensitive to DNA-damaging agent cisplatin and have defects in repairing interstrand crosslinks (ICL). This study elucidates how E6/E disrupts the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. E6 activates the FA pathway by increasing FAN2 monoubiquination and foci formation, but inhibits completion of repair through multiple mechanisms. E impairs FAN2 localization with double-strand breaks (DSB), hindering downstream protein Rad51 recruitment to DS in E cells. Further, E causes delayed F2 deubiquination, crucial for effective ICL repair. Delayed F2 deubination is associated with chromatin retention of F, hindering US1 deubiquinating activity and persistently activating ATR/CHK-1/pS F signaling. E mediated p53 degradation does not affect cell cycle-specific F2 modifications but abrogates repair by disrupting F deubination. Additionally, E reduces Pal2 expression and foci formation, a protein downstream of F2. These findings reveal mechanisms by which HPV oncogenes contribute to genomic instability and response to cisplatin therapies.
In the Southern Chiapas region of Mexico, one of the major onchocerciasis foci in Latin America, 559 communities have undergone semi-annual ivermectin treatment since 1998. In 50 communities, iverectin frequency was increased to twice a year in 2003, and an additional 113 communities were added to the quarterly regimen in 2009 to achieve rapid suppression. Epidemiologic and entomologic assessments were conducted in six communities with 2 rounds of iverectin per year and three with 4 rounds per year. No Simulium ochraceum s.l. collected during the 201 dry season were found to contain parasite DNA by PCR-ELISA, with an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of infectivity of 0.06/2,000 examined. Serological testing on 4,230 children under 5 revealed 2/4,230 exposed to O. volulus (0.05%). The epidemiologic and entomologic findings meet the criteria for interruption of transmission by the international community.
Listeria monocytogen, a Gram-positive facultative intracellular pathogen, invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate within the host cytos. The transcription activator PrA regulates gene products for intracellular growth and bacterial spread to adjacent cells. However, the signal stimulating PrA activation has not been defined. This study identifies L monocytogen secretion of a peptide pherone, pPpl, enhancing escape from host vacoles and facilitating PrA activation. Ppl is generated via proteolytic processing of P lipoprotein signal. P is dispensable for pathogenesis, but bacteria lacking P are attenuated in virulence and reduced vacole escape efficiency in nonphagocytic cells. Mutational PrA restores virulence and eliminates P-dependent signaling. Experimental evidence suggests P may signal monocogen presence within vacole, stimulating expression contributing to escape and PrA promoting cytos growth.
Researchers investigated how the bacterium Vibrio cholera, which causes cholera, adapts to the hostile environment of the host's small intestine and combats reactive oxygen species (ROS) during infection. They used whole-genome transposon sequencing (T-seq) to compare gene requirements for colonization in mice with and without antioxidant N-acetyl cystine treatment. Mutants of the methyl-directed repair system, such as MutS, showed advantages in untreated, ROS-rich mice but not in N-treated mice. Further analysis revealed accumulation of catalase-producing and rugose variants in N-treated mice was due to Mut mutant enrichment by oxidative stress during infection. Rugose variants reverted to smooth colonies in aerobic in vitro. Mutation rate of wildtype colonized in N-treated mice was higher than in N+ mice. These findings suggest Vibrio employs a temporal strategy to battle ROS during infection, resulting in enriched phenotypes. ΔS passage and complementation can model hypermutation in diverse pathogens to identify stress mechanisms.
Researchers investigated the role of Mlh3 in meiotic recombination and mismatch repair (MMR) in baker's yeast by analyzing 60 new Mlh alleles. Five alleles disrupted MMR, while one (Mlh-32) specifically disrupted meiotic crossover. Mlh-3 representatives from each class were purified and characterized. Both Mlh-3-32 (MR+, crossover-) and Mlh-45 (MR-, crossover+) displayed wild-type endonuc activities in vitro. M2SH, an M complex that acts with Mlh in M, stimulated the enduc activity of M-32 but not M-45, suggesting M-45 is defective in interactions. Whole-genome recombination maps were constructed for wild-type MR+, MR-, MR+, enduc defective and M mutants in S288/Y789 background. Compared to wild-type, all M mutants showed increases in number of nonc events, consistent with recombination intermediates resolved through alternative pathways.
A study investigated the impact of host population structure on the reversion to drug sensitivity after discontinuation of antibiotic treatment for diseases such as tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, and gonorrhea. The use of intense antibiotics has led to increasing drug resistance, necessitating a switch to new drugs and discontinuation of older ones, which often results in slow or persistent resistance decline. Researchers found that host population heterogeneity, particularly in the number of contacts, influences reversion dynamics. During treatment, host structure leads to non-random distribution of resistant strains among infected individuals, and after drug discontinuation, affects competition dynamics, mitigating fitness advantages. This results in lower reversion rate and probability on population level after treatment stopped. Simulations showed host heterogeneity's impact is maximal in biologically plausible range when resistance costs are small.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are highly heritable and characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. Although several highly penetrant ASD variants have been identified, there is evidence supporting a role for combinatorial effects from contributions of multiple loci. Researchers examined synaptic and circadian phenotypes resulting from dosage variants of human-fly orthologs in Drosophila, observing synergistic interactions between pairs of candidate genes orthologs affected by de novo copy number (CN) variants. These CNs were found in genomes of individuals with autism, including one carrying 22q11.2 deletion. Dosage alterations of Dophila orthologs of candidate genes from CNs with single gene display neurological defects similar to previously reported Doph models of ASD variants. Pairwise changes of ortholog candidate genes affected by single CN showed significant synergistic effects following simultaneous change. Phenotypic variation at Dophila synapse results from interacting variants supports concordant outcome across interacting pairs gene direction human copy change. Specificity and transitivity observed between interactors within and between CN candidate sets shared distinct genetic etiologies. Interactions divergent synaptic processes demonstrate molecular etiologies. Study illustrates synergistic effects large variation contribute human disease.
Researchers have investigated the role of brain-infiltrating CD8 T cells in the development of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) caused by Plasmodium berghei AN infection in C57/6 mice. They found that these cells accumulate in the perascular spaces of the brain during both ECM-inducing (P. berghei AN) and non-inducing (P. berghei NK) infections. However, perascular CD8 T cells displayed arrested behavior specifically during P. berghei AN infection, despite comparable activation phenotypes of brain-accumulating CD8 T cells during both infections. The cells formed long-term interactions with CXCR1-bearing antigen-presenting cells within the brain during P. berg AN infection, but depletion of these cells did not prevent ECM development. Pathogenic CD8 T cells localized with apoptotic cells expressing CD31, a marker of endothelial cells, within brain during ECM. Apoptosis was rare and did not result in loss of vasculature or disruption.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 21 villages in 3 sub-locations of Viga County, Kenya to determine the burden of tungias, a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tungaans. A total of 437 participants aged 5 years and above were clinically examined for the presence of tungias after consenting to participate. Diagnosis was made using standard methods and a semi-structured questionnaire assessed socio-demographic factors, housing, presence of animals, and knowledge related to tungias. The overall prevalence was 21.5% (95% CI 17.7-25.3). Cases were visualized in a map. Multivariate analysis showed occurrence of tungias associated with low economic status (monthly income ≤ Ksh 100, adjusted OR 27.85, 95% CI 4.13-187.59), floor (0.36, 0.13-1.024), lack of toilet facilities (4.27,0.82-22.34), age ≤14 (27.414,10.02-74.99), no use of closed footwear (1.98,0.987-3.97), and resting inside house (1.93,0.96-3.89).
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the interaction between auxin and cytokinin hormones in Arabidopsis root patterning. Auxin is positioned along the xylem axis, and its pattern depends on feedback between aux and cytokinin, mediated by PIN and AHP proteins. The model considers hormonal regulation of aux transport in a spatial context, accounting for cell shape and polarity and walls. Analysis reveals that cytokinin pattern by diffusion is unlikely and not required for auxin patterning. Instead, aux modifies cytokinin response, not levels, allowing feedback that amplifies and stabilizes auxin. Simulations show importance of aux efflux regulation for robustness. PIN's role in patterning is established, but AUX and LAX aux influx transporters' involvement is predicted and verified. Local PIN generates an aux circuit stabilizing aux in xylem and allowing accumulation in xylem-pole cells, an early lateral initiation step. Pericycle cells on xyle poles compete for aux accumulation, consistent with lateral roots not initiated opposite each other.
In a study on the migratory locust Locusta migratoria, researchers have identified a key mediator in the neuropeptide F (NPF)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway that regulates phase-related locomotor plasticity. The conserved transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein B (CRE-B) plays a crucial role in this pathway, mediating the transition between solitary and gregarious phases of locomotor activity. CRE-B directly activates brain nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression by interacting with its promoter region. Phosphorylation of serine 110 on CRE-B changes in response to population density and is negatively controlled by N2. RNA interference and behavioral assays validate CRE-B involvement in N2-regulated locomotor plasticity. Protein kinase mediates the effects of N on CRE-B phosphorylation and OS transcription.
Researchers investigated the role of the zinc-finger protein Zelda (Z) in the early development of Drosophila melanogaster embryos, specifically during the maternal-to-zyotic transition (MT), a period when the zygotic genome is transcriptionally activated after fertilization. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (IP-Seq) was used to map regions bound by Z before, during, and after the MT. Prior to mitotic cycle 10, only a few genes are transcribed, but thousands of regions are bound by Z, most of which remain through mitotic 14. Early Z-bound regions include promoters and enhancers of transcribed at this stage, as expected. Unexpectedly, Z is also bound to promoters of approximately 1,000 genes first transcribed at the MT and virtually all known enhancers bound by cycle 14 transcription factors that regulate gene activation during MT. The association between Z binding and MT is strong, allowing Z to identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with specificity. This early association suggests Z is not only required for earliest transcription but also plays a role in activating genome at MT.
Researchers have identified 109 novel protein-protein interactions (PPI) among circadian clock proteins using a yeast-two-hybrid approach. The interaction between protein phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL resulted in BMAL1 destabilization. A dynamic circadian protein-protein interaction network was constructed using circadian expression data to predict PI timing. Systematic circadian phenotyping via RNAi and overexpression revealed crucial roles for components in dynamic interactions. Analysis of the global network in liver showed interacting proteins are expressed at similar times, restricting interactions to specific phases. Circadian PIs dynamically connect many cellular processes, including signal transduction, cell cycle, contributing to temporal organization of physiology in an unprecedented manner.
Researchers have solved the three-dimensional structure of ABA-1, a repeating unit of the nematode polyallergen protein (NPA) from Ascaris su, using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The protein adopts a novel seven-helical fold, consisting of a central helix surrounded by two four-hel bundles on either side. Two discrete hydrophobic ligand-binding sites are located in the N-terminal and C-terminal bundles, with specific amino acid residues involved in fatty acid binding identified. Recombinant A-BA1 contains a tightly bound ligand of bacterial origin in one of its binding sites. This is the first structurally characterized, post-translationally processed unit of a tandemly repetitive protein from any source, belonging to a new class. Nematode polyallergens are unique lipid-binding proteins found in nematodes, synthesized as large, repetitive polyproteins cleaved into small binding proteins with identical fatty acid and retin (A) characteristics. They play roles in transport and distribution of hydrophobic compounds, nutrient scavenging, immunomodulation, and IgE responses. In some species, units are diverse, but in ascar and filarial nematodes, many are identical or near-ident. A-1 is common unit of NPA Ascar su, similar to Ascar lumicoid, large roundworm of humans. Immune responses NP associated with acquired resistance in humans, under genetic control.
Between 1998 and 2008, a significant number of cases of ciguatera poisoning were reported in the Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PITCs). Ciguatoxin-contaminated fish consumption led to acute neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac symptoms in individuals, with some experiencing chronic neuro symptoms lasting weeks to months. A questionnaire was sent to health and fisheries authorities in PCs to quantify the extent of cigater. Data analysis revealed 39,677 reported cases from 17 PCs, with a mean annual incidence of 194 per 100,000 people across the region, compared to 104/100,000 from 1973-1983. There was a 60% increase in annual cigater incidence between the two periods in PCs. Accounting for underreporting, an estimated 500,000 islanders may have suffered cigater in the last 35 years. This incidence exceeds global and local cigater estimates, elevating its status to a major public health concern.
A study investigated the impact of benznidazole treatment on the functional response of Trypanosoma cruzi-specific CD4+CD8+ T cells in Chagas disease patients. Thirty-eight patients with chronic Chagas disease (20 asymptomatic and 18 symptomatic) and twelve healthy controls were enrolled. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with soluble T cruzi antigens to analyze cytokine and cytotoxic molecule production by CD+CD+ cells before and after benidazole treatment. Expression and co-expression of inhibitory receptors in patients after treatment were studied using multiparameter flow cytometry. CD+CD+ cells were higher in Chagas patients compared to healthy donors, with higher ratio CD+CD/CD+ subpopulations. CD+ cells expressed co-expressed higher inhibitory receptors in proportion to pathology severity. Benidazole reduced CD+CD cells and decreased ratio CDCD/CD subpop. Co-expression inhibitory was reduced after treatment with multifunctional capacity CD+ cells. Treatment increased frequency T cruzi-specific CD+CD expressing IL-2 and TN-α. CD+ cells produced effector molecules for parasite control. Benidazole partially reversed T cruz infection exhaustion in cells with improved T cruz-specific CD+CD response.
Researchers have identified Arabidopsis thalian phosphoinide-specific phospholipase 2 (AtPLC2) as the primary enzyme responsible for phosphoinide metabolism and its role in seedling growth and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. Lipid profiling of PLC2 mutants revealed increased levels of its substrates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, indicating impaired phosphide metabolic pathway. PLC2 displayed distinct tissue-specific expression and localization at the plasma membrane in various cell types where phosphide signaling occurs. Seedlings of PLC2 mutants showed growth defects complemented by heterologous expression of PLC, indicating phosphide-specific phospholipase activity by PLC is required for seedling growth. The PLC2 mutant exhibited hypersensitive response to ER stress, evidenced by changes in phenotypes and gene expression profiles. This study reveals the primary enzyme in phosphide metabolism, its involvement in seedling, and a link between phosphide and ER stress.
Researchers challenge the assumption of reductionism in causation, which posits that causation occurs at the micro level, excluding emergence at the macro level. They employ a measure of intrinsic cause-effect power-integrated information (Φ) to demonstrate that macro-level causation can surpass micro-level causation. Systems are evaluated across spatial and temporal scales, considering all possible "black boxes" consisting of one or more micro elements over one or more updates. Cause power is evaluated based on inputs and outputs of boxes, ignoring internal elements supporting input-output functions. Results show that black boxes can have more inputs and outputs than micro elements, revealing emergent mechanisms and constraints not apparent at micro. Macro-box systems can have higher Φ than constituents with more mechanisms and interconnected. For a given system, local maxima of Φ can be identified across spatial-temporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a biological system, the Boolean model of fission yeast cell cycle, identifying local maxima during simulated function. These max correspond to levels of organization where emergent cause properties come into focus, providing a vantage for scientific inquiry.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) play a dual role in modulating cellular adaptation to the environment and causing damage under conditions of hypoxia/reoxygenation relevant to various diseases. To investigate the role of ROS in cell survival, a detailed understanding of ROS production mechanisms and determinants is required. An extended model of complex III was developed to account for electron transport in the RC coupled to proton translocation, transmembrane electrochemical potential, TCA reactions, and substrate transport to mitochondria. Measurements of respiratory flux in rat mitochondria fueled by succinate, pyruvate, and malate, and dynamics of NAD+ reduction by reverse transport from succinate through complex I were analyzed. Fitting of measured data provided insight into mechanisms governing free radical formation and superoxide generation. Analysis revealed association of ROS with specific electron transporters and combinations in complexes I and III. Bistability of complex III was found to be valid for the whole RC. Conditions for high radical content in III were predicted and confirmed. These findings provide insight into ROS production mechanisms in RC.
Motor proteins play a crucial role in intracellular transport by converting chemical energy into kinetic energy, enabling unidirectional and bidirectional transport of cargo over long distances. Disruptions in transport mechanisms, often caused by mutations altering motor characteristics, lead to neurodegenerative diseases. Phosphorylation of the kinesin motor domain at serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, with phosphorylated phosphim serine residues lowering motor stalling forces. This study investigates the effects of mutations on transport properties of cargo carried by wild-type and mutant motors. Results show that mutants with altered stalling forces determine average velocity and run-length, even when outnumbered by wild-type motors in the ensemble. Mutants gain a competitive advantage and increase run-length when the load is near the mutant's stalling or multiple of stalling. A semi-analytical method is developed to analyze transport by multiple motors of types, determining transition rates between configurations using transition rates. This enables computation of biologically relevant quantities, such as velocity and run-length, without Monte Carlo simulations. The method allows introduction of single parameter alterations to model mutation and deduce effects on transport by multiple motors. The method is implementable and a software package is provided for use.
Researchers investigated the role of the CAC1 gene in operant learning by selectively ablating the gene in mice and analyzing their behavior on an operant discrimination task. The study found that CAC1 knockout did not impair learning in general, but had a specific effect: most knockout mice increased reward across trials by adapting an outcome-based strategy, while controls adopted the experimentally intended cue-association. This suggests a specific role of the CAC1 gene in learning and highlights the importance of examining response patterns in a repertoire of behavioral strategies. The study used a detailed individual-level analysis of learning and Bayesian computational models to estimate data, showing that C1 knockout mice used a different strategy than intended by the experimenter. The results may have implications for treating psychiatric disorders associated with altered expression of Cav1.2 channels and CAC1 gene, which are linked to synaptic plasticity and calcium influx through high-voltage-gated Ca+ channels.
Aedes aegypt mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria are being released worldwide for arbovirus suppression. Their ability to invade and persist in populations depends on interactions with environmental conditions, particularly temperature fluctuations. Researchers reared Ae. aegypt larvae with different types of Wolbach (wMel, wAlB and wMel-CLA) under diurnal temperatures. Results showed that rearing Mel and wMel-CLA-infected larvae at 26-37°C reduced cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive manipulation by Wolbach, and Wolbach density in adults. Mel and wMel-CLA infections were not transmitted to next generation when exposed 26-37°C across life stages. In contrast, wB infection maintained high density, exhibited cytoplasm incompat, and transmitted to offspring with high fidelity under this cycle.
Researchers isolated and characterized adenoviruses from the gastrointestinal tracts of non-human primates, including great apes (chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans) and macaques. The study aimed to understand the natural history of adenirus infections in these species and found that healthy populations shed substantial quantities of infectious adeniruses in their stool. In contrast, asymptomatic shedding in humans was less frequent compared to previous reports. Thirty adeniruses were purified and sequenced from apes and three from macques. Analysis of the new adenirus sequences, along with previously reported chimpanzee adenirus and 22 adenirus genomes, revealed that ape adeniruses corresponded to human adenirus species B, C, and E. Intraspecies recombination between adeniruses was also observed. The high phylogenetic relatedness of adeniruses across primate hosts suggested cross-species transmission events in the history of B and E viruses. Asymptomatic shedding of adenirus in non-human primates and zoonotic transmissions warrant caution for primate handling. Persistent and latent adenirus infections in the gut should be considered in human and non-primate adenirus vector studies.
Researchers have investigated the process of unwrapping the outer helical turn of nucleosomal DNA using molecular dynamics simulations with enhanced sampling. The nucleosome, the fundamental unit of chromatin, is a protein-DNA complex where 146-147 base pairs of DNA wrap 1.75 times around a histone core. To function in cellular processes, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped, but the details of this process at an atomic level were not well understood. The simulations calculated a free energy change of 11.5 kcal/mol for unwrapping the outer helical turn, consistent with values from single molecule experiments. The study revealed various conformational states indicating multiple paths to unwrapping the outer helical turn, with a dominant asymmetric path. Unwrapping initiated at one end of DNA with five base pairs unwrapping, followed by a second five base unwr at the same end with increased energy. Unwrapping then started at the other end of DNA with ten base unwr. Further unwrapping 15 base, unwr progressed at one end, then the other end unwr completed the unwrapping the outer helical turn.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which protects lysosomes from damage caused by oxidative stress. Lysosomes are sensitive to damage due to their dependence on acidic pH and membrane gradients. Lipocalin Apolipoprotein D (ApoD), an antioxidant protein, is secreted by astrocytes to help neurons cope with oxidative stress. The role of Apo is known at cellular and organismal levels, but its mechanism was unknown. This study analyzed Apo's intracellular traffic and role in lysosomal homeostasis during paraquat-induced stress. Single-lysosome pH measurements and immunodetection showed Apo is endocytosed and targeted to vulnerable lysosomes in a stress-dependent manner. Apo is stable in acidic environment and necessary for lysosomes to recover from oxidation-induced alkalin in astrocytes and neurons. Apo prevents lysosomal permeabilization. Two lysosomal processes, myelin phagocytosis by astrocytes and neurodegeneration-triggered autophagy in Drosophila model, require Apo-related lipocalins. Results uncover a new Apo function, member of conserved extracellular lipocal family. Lipoprotein regulation of lysosomal integrity is a mechanism for cellular functions in neurodegenerative diseases.
This study investigated the biology and susceptibility of Phlebotus orientalis sandflies to Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, from two geographically distant localities in Ethiopia. Two colonies of P. orientalis were obtained from a non-endemic site in the lowlands of Melka Wer (MW) and an endemic focus of human visceral leishmanias in the highlands of Addis Z (AZ). Life cycle parameters differed between the two colonies, with distinct requirements for larval food and humidity during pupation. However, genetic analysis using Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAP) PCR and DNA sequencing of cytB and COI genes revealed no genetic differences. F1 hybrids exhibited higher fecundity than parental colonies. Susceptibility of P. orient to L. donani was studied by experimental infection. Even the lowest infective dose (2x10^3 per ml) was sufficient for successful establishment of L. donani infections in 50% of P. orient females. Using higher infective doses, infection rates were 90% for both colonies. Leish development in P. orient was fast, with metacyclic promastigotes in thoracic midgut and stomal colonization by homonads recorded in P orient females by day 5 post-feeding. Both MW and AZ colonies of P orient were highly susceptible to Ethiopian L. donani strains. Average blood-meals taken by P orient females were 0.7µl, infective dose lowest was one or two L promastigotes per sand-meal. Development of L don was similar in P orient colonies, hence absence visceral leishias non-endemic Mel Wer attributed to susceptibility local orient populations donani.
Researchers conducted a study to quantify the quality of life and disability of patients with advanced schistosomiasis japonica in a schistosoma japonicum-endemic county in the People's Republic of China. The study aimed to provide data for the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, as schistosiasis is listed as a priority by the Chinese government due to its significant health and economic impacts. A patient-based quality of life evaluation was performed on suspected and confirmed cases of schistosias japonica using a questionnaire and physical examination. Disability and morbidity were assessed using the European Quality of Life questionnaire with additional dimension (EQ-5D), ultrasonography, and laboratory testing. Age-specific disability weights for schosias japonica were estimated from patients' self-rated scores on a visual analogue scale. Relationships between health status, morbidity, and disability were explored using multivariate models. Of 506 candidates, 215 cases were confirmed as schias japonica and evaluated. Most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, such as pain or discomfort (90.7%), usual activities (87.9%), and anxiety or depression (80%). Overall disability weight was 0.447, and age-specific weights ranged from 0.378 among 30-44 years to 0.510 ≥60 years. Disability was associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and albumin were protective for quality of life.
In sub-Saharan Africa, Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Animal Trypanosomiasis (AT) are prevalent parasitic diseases caused by the tset fly-borne protozoan Trypanosoma brucei (Tb). spp. spp. Humans acquire H through tset bites, with T. b. gambiense in West and Central Africa and T. rhodesiense in East and Southern Africa. A retrospective study used 1999 census data to estimate vulnerability and disability in Kenya's tset belts, assessing H infection potential in areas. A multilevel design estimated disability likelihood in individuals, households, and tset fly habitats with varying poverty levels. Residents and migrants aged 15-49 were studied. Tset's impact was conceptualized through two pathways: direct bites leading to H infection or indirect, A affecting agricultural production and livestock, leading to morbidity and mortality, nutritional deficiencies. Tset belts with increased disability prevalence were identified, direct and indirect pathways evaluated. Incorporating census data, surveillance may enhance H programs in sub-Saharan Africa. H and A burdens, and agricultural costs contribute to disability in tset areas. Future research will assess relationships between tset infestation and disability post-2009 census.
Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) is a potent inducer of cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells. Researchers investigated the mechanism of action of HMBA and found that it activates the PI3/Akt pathway, leading to the phosphorylation of HEXIM protein. This phosphorylation results in the release of positive transcription elongation factor (PTEF) from its transcriptionally inactive complex with HEXIM and 7 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). The released PF is then recruited to the HIV promoter to stimulate transcription and viral production. However, the released PF rapidly reassociates with 7snRNA and HEXIM in the presence of HM. A mutant HEX protein that cannot be phosphorylated and released PF and 7sn via PI/Akt pathway antagonizes HM-mediated induction of viral production.
Researchers have identified a link between the presence of Leishmania virus (LRV) and aggressive forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), including mucosal (ML) and disseminated cutaneous (DCL). LRV is associated with elevated parasitemia, hyperinflammation, and disease exacerbation. Studies on LRV in other Leish strains and species would benefit from improved detection and quantitation methods, independent of viral sequence knowledge. This study presents techniques for LRV detection, including an anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody J, which recognizes dsRNA sequence-independently. Applications of J include immunofluorescence, ELISA, and dot blot, complementing nucleic acid purification and real-time PCR. Methods were evaluated and demonstrated LRV detection by J in several strains, patient samples, and infected mouse biopsies.
Enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EPEC and EHE) are closely related pathogens that adhere to intestinal epithelial cells, efface microvilli, and induce cytoskeletal rearrangements into protrusions called actin pedestals. PEC employs the tyrosine phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir, while EHE relies on the multivalent scaffolding protein EspF. The formation of pedestals correlates with bacterial colonization in animal models, but the function of pedest in infection is unclear. This study investigated the colonization of PEC and ECE during polarized epithelial cell infection. Both formed distinct bacterial communities, "macrocolonies", encompassing multiple host cells. Tir and EspF, as well as the Arp2/3 complex, were critical for colony expansion over time. Unexpectedly, EspF accelerated colony formation compared to PEC, as Esp-mediated actin assembly drove bacterial motility to junctions, where bacteria formed a pedestal on a neighboring cell and divided, allowing one daughter to disengage and infect the second. Data reveal Esp enhances epithelial colonization by actin-based motility and efficient cell-to-cell transmission.
Researchers compared two methods for purifying extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the excretory-secretory products of the helminth pathogen Fasciola hepatica: differential centrifugation (DC) and size exclusion chromatography (SEC). DC is the most commonly used method for EV purification, but SEC has been used for other pathogens. The study found that EVs purified by SEC were smaller and less diverse than those by DC, as shown by transmission and atomic force microscopy. Protein quantification and Western blotting showed SEC yielded a higher purity of EV to excretory-secretory protein (ESP) ratio compared to DC, with reduced soluble cathepsin proteases in SEC EV. Proteomic analysis revealed DC contamination from ESP, with increased protein identifications and peptide hits in DC EV compared to SEC. SEC EV contained less tegument proteins than DC EV. The study suggests DC and SEC do not isolate equivalent EV populations and caution is needed when choosing purification methods, with DC including free proteins and tegument artefacts. SEC is proposed for EV purification before downstream studies.
Researchers employed a reverse engineering approach to study post-transcriptional regulation in Drosophila melanogaster, focusing on the gap genes Krpp, knir, and giant. This method involves fitting models to data to infer and analyze regulatory mechanisms, requiring rigorous methods to determine parameter identifiability in complex biological contexts. Quantitative datasets of mRNA and protein expression were used to fit a post-transcription regulation model, establishing its structural and practical identifiability. Results show post-transcription is not required for patterning in this system, but necessary for protein control levels. The study demonstrates model uniqueness and specificity can be rigorously determined in spatio-temporal formation, increasing reverse engineering potential for development and complex biological processes.
Researchers investigated the age-dependent mechanisms of the intestinal epithelial immune response to rotavirus infection in a mouse model. They found that Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) expression was low in the epithelium of suckling mice but increased during the postnatal period, inversely correlating with rotavirus susceptibility, viral shedding, and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in TLR3 or the adaptor molecule TRIF (TRIFL2) exhibited higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial pro-inflammatory and antiviral gene expression compared to wild-type animals. In contrast, neonatal mice deficient in TLR or TRIF did not display impaired stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. Using chimeric mice, a major contribution of non-hematopoietic cell in TRIF-mediated antiral response was detected in adult. A significant age-dependent increase of TLR expression was also detected in human intestinal biops. Upregulation of epithelial TLR during infancy might contribute to age-dependent rotavirus susceptibility.
Researchers conducted a whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis of 1,039 individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and 870 controls from the National Human Genome Repository (NH) with similar ancestry to the cases. Two sequencing centers used different methods to produce and call variants from the data. To ensure similar distribution of rare variation, variants were filtered by fraction of missing data, read depth, and balance of alternative reads. Seven samples were sequenced at both centers, and results were evaluated by association study. The goal was to determine how to combine data and results from centers. Gene-based association analysis was chosen, but whether to combine statistics across centers (meta-analysis) or data and then analyze (mega) was debated. Due to many gene-based tests, mega-analysis was shown to have better power than meta-analysis. Before analysis, the impact of population structure on rare variants in data was explored. Population structure was found to confound case-control studies by clustering variants in ancestry, but principal-based analyses controlled for ancestry and produced appropriate distributions. Using gene tests and both meta and mega-analysis, no new ASD risk genes were found. Results suggest gene tests require larger samples and controls for discovery, even for a disorder like ASD.
Researchers conducted a retrospective study to investigate the association between polymorphisms in the chitriosase gene and the risk of mycetoma due to Madure myetatis in a Sudanese population. Madure myet is the most prevalent causative agent of eumetoma in Sudan, characterized by the formation of grains, but only a small number of exposed individuals develop infection. The fungus contains chitin in its cell wall, which can trigger the human immune response. Polymorphisms in genes encoding chitin-degrading enzymes chitriosase and AMCase were identified, resulting in altered chitin activity. The study analyzed 112 eetoma patients and 103 controls for polymorphisms, including a 24-b insertion in the chitrios gene (rs1317) leading to impaired chitin activity and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in AM (617) resulting in decreased AM activity. Additionally, SNPs (41292) and 10-b insertion in 5'UTR of AM (143) were studied, resulting in increased AM activity. DNA from blood was isolated and genotypes determined using PCR-RP. Histological staining confirmed chitin presence in fungal grains. The polym resulting in decreased chitrios activity was associated with increased eoma risk (odds ratio 2.9; p=0.004). No association was found for polymorphisms in genes AM (all>0.05).
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has traditionally been studied as a model for viral latency with distinct acute and latent phases. However, recent evidence suggests that the latent phase may not be as quiescent as previously thought, with lytic genes being transcribed during this state. Immunological studies have shown that activated T cells persist in the nervous system during latency, but translation of these transcripts has not been confirmed. This study uses a highly sensitive Cre-reporting model to show that lytic and latent phases are not as distinct as previously thought. Firstly, half of the viral spread to latently infected sites occurs beyond the initial infection. Secondly, direct evidence shows that lytic promoters drive protein expression during latency.
Misfolding and aggregation of proteins are key features of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, frontotemporal dementia, and prion diseases, where misfolded proteins accumulate through seeded polymerization. In prion diseases, host protein misfolds to a pathogenic, protease-resistant PrP, which accumulates in neurons, astroglia, and microglia in the CNS. A study using dual-staining immunohistochemistry compared PrSc accumulation in early post-infection in three scrapie strains differing in brain pathology. Pr from each strain had distinct cell specificity: Strain 22 with astroglia, ME with neurons and neurop in thalamus and cortex, and RML similar to 22 in substantia nigra. Expression of neuroinflammatory genes was studied using mRNA from thalamus pre-infection. Surprisingly, despite PrSc differences, upregulated genes were similar for all strains, with small differences correlating with disease tempo. Gene upregulation correlated with astrogl and microia activation before vacu pathology or clinical signs. Prion profile differed from viral CNS diseases Larosse and polytropic retroirus with similar gliosis levels.
Researchers have developed a new approach to model the 3D organization of chromosomes using coarse-grained models of self-avoiding polymers on a lattice. Chromosomes are long, densely packed, and topologically constrained polymers, making it challenging to investigate their multi-spatio-temporal scales. The proposed strategy accounts for polymer entanglement and volumic density, capturing steady-state and dynamical properties, as well as dynamics at different coarse-graining scales. This method offers a significant numerical efficiency gain and a systematic way to define coarse-grained models for chromosomes, overcoming current limitations by studying chromosomes over extended periods with good statistics. The approach was used to investigate the 3D organization of chromosome 3 (20 Mbp) in Drosophila during a cell cycle (20 hours). A combination of coarse-graining with a one-parameter copolymer model integrating epigen-driven interactions quantitatively reproduces experimental data at chromosome-scale and predicts chromatin is dynamic during the cycle.
Researchers conducted an integrative analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and cis-regulatory elements to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cell specificity of QTL. They analyzed QTL data from 11 studies across 7 cell types and integrated it with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project. A set of classifiers was built to predict cell specificity of QTL, revealing associations with hundreds of cell-specific CRE classes, including enhancers, promoters, repressive chromatin marks, open chromatin, and DNA-binding proteins. These associations provide insight into molecular mechanisms generating cell specificity of QTL and regulation. A random forest classifier with CRE-SNP overlap features demonstrated predicting cell specificity QTL feasibility. CRE from trait-associated cell types were used to annotate GWAS in absence of QTL data for that type. The study aims to improve understanding mechanistic basis of human phenotypic variation through integrative predictive modeling of specificity.
Researchers have developed a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line that limits glycosylation to mannose-5 (Man5) or earlier intermediates using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system. This was achieved by inactivating the Mannosyl Alpha-1,3-Glycoprotein Beta-2-N-Acetylglucosyltransferase (MGAT1) gene. The resulting cell line, MG1-CHO, produces monomeric gp120 with improved binding to glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (NAb) directed to the V1/V domain (e.g. PG9) and V3 stem (e.g. PGT and 10-107) while preserving glycan-independent epitopes (e.g. V01). The MG-CHO cell line's ability to limit glycosylation to early intermediates without impairing doubling time or growth at high cell densities suggests it will be useful for biopharm production of HIV-1 immunogens. The development of this cell line addresses the challenge of producing vaccine immunogens displaying glycan epitopes that are intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. This pathway alters the mass and net charge of envelope proteins compared to those with mature, sialic-containing carbohydrates. Many broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 recognize epitopes consisting of both amino and glycan residues, with glycans required for binding being intermediates in the N-linked glycosylation pathway. Cell lines suitable for biopharm production that limit glycosylation to Man5 or earlier intermediates are not readily available.
Researchers have identified trehalose-6-phosphatase (TPP) from the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi as a potential target for anthelmintic drugs. This enzyme is essential for the nematode's survival, as accumulation of trehalose-6-phosphate is toxic in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. T6 has also been shown to be essential in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The X-ray crystal structure of T from B. malayi revealed a stabilizing N-terminal MIT domain and a catalytic C-terminal C2-type H phosphatase fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analyses with competitive inhibitor trehal 6-sulf identified five residues crucial for binding and catalysis. A model of the T6-trehalose-phosphate complex was proposed, indicating a substrate-binding mode driven by shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions. This differs from sucrose-6-phosphatase, which relies on extensive hydrogen-bond interactions. The results suggest high-affinity inhibitors will bind by exploiting substrate-like binding to the phosphoryl pocket while utilizing non-native binding to trehal pocket. Conservation of key residues enforcing the substrate shape in TPP enzymes implies broad-range anthelmic and antibacterial therapeutics may be developed using this platform.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to simulate blood and interstitial fluid transport in heterogeneous tumors, taking into account their unique vascular architectures. The model combines Poiseuille and Darcy equations to describe vascular and interstitial flow, respectively, and incorporates spatially heterogeneous vessel and interstitial permeabilities to accurately predict tumor fluid dynamics. This platform enables controlled experiments to investigate how tumor vascular heterogeneity affects fluid transport. The model was applied to an orthotopic murine glioma and human colorectal carcinoma, and sensitivity analysis revealed key mechanisms determining fluid transport. Modifying vascular and interstitial parameters showed that realistic vasculature is crucial for contrasting fluid response between tumors. Contrary to literature, reducing interstitial pressure does not increase perfusion; instead, therapies should target interstitial pressure gradient. Stabilizing vessel diameters and permeabilities are not responses to normalization, but may alter conductivity. Normalizing interstitial environment may increase perfusion within tumors.
Researchers investigated the role of cell-to-cell transmission in HIV-1 infection and its susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors. They developed experimental strategies to distinguish between cell-free and cell-to-cell transmission and found that the efficacy of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and entry inhibitors varied depending on their mode of action. Monoclonal antibodies targeting the gp41 region remained active against cell-to-cell transmission, while those targeting the CD4 binding site (CDbs), including the potent neutralizing mAb VRC01, showed reduced potency. This suggests that CDbs mAbs preferentially block free virus transmission, allowing HIV to spread through cell-cell contacts.
Researchers have proposed a new model to explain the diverse effects of attention on neural firing rates and receptive field structure in the visual system. The model suggests that top-down attentional modulation on higher visual areas, such as V4 and MT, can produce the observed effects on neural responses. The model requires the existence of feedback connections between areas and short-range inhibition within each area. Feedback redistributes top-down modulation to lower areas, altering inputs to higher cells, including those not initially modulated. This produces firing rate modulations and receptive shifts. Simultaneously, short-range inhibition between neighboring cells produces competitive effects scaling receptive field size. The model reproduces attentional effects on rates (response gain, input, gain, competition scaled receptive size) and receptive structure (shifts, resizing spatial, feature) without modifying parameters. It also predicts attentional response curves shift from gain to contrast as focus drifts from cell.
In Drosophila, a group of specialized cells called the posterior signalling centre (PSC) plays a crucial role in controlling blood cell homeostasis in the larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, similar to the microenvironment of hematopoietic stem cells in vertebrates. The SC acts non-autonomously to maintain janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators (J/STAT) signalling in hematietic progenitors (proocytes), preserving their multipotency for differentiation into lamlocytes, a dedicated immune cell type required to fight specific threats such as wasp parasism. A study using a knockout generated by homologous recombination found that a type I cytokine-related receptor CG142/Lat is required to switch off J/STAT signalling in proocytes, a prerequisite for lamlocyte differentiation upon wasp parasism. In vivo and cell assays showed Lat forms heteromers with Domeless, a Doph type cytokine signalling related to mammalian GP130, and antagonizes Dome activity in a dose-dependent manner. Analysis revealed a primary response to wasp parasism is a decrease in cytok mRNA in the gland, followed by an increase in Lat/Dome ratio. This sequence culminates in complete inhibition of J/STAT by Lat. J/STAT is associated with human diseases including leukaemia, while knockout mice studies indicate a central role in hematopoies and immune regulation. Doph Lat function is the first in vivo example of a nonsignalling controlling a dedicated response, raising whether nonsign also control vertebrate cellular immunity.
Genetic recombination is a significant process in the evolution of various species, particularly among begomoviruses in the single-stranded DNA family Geminiridae. Non-random recombination distributions within begovirus genomes sampled from nature result from variations in basal recombination rates across genomes and overall viability of recombinant genomes. Factors influencing basal recombination include sequence similarity between recomb genomes, nucleic acid structures, and genomic sensitivity to nucleases. Viability of recombinant genomes is influenced by co-evolved protein-protein and nucleotide interactions disrupted by recombination. This study investigates recombination patterns in 120-day experimental infections of tomato plants with begoviruses Tomato yellow curl virus and Tomato curl virus. Sequence exchange between viruses is complex, with evidence that local sequence similarity, not genomic structure, influences recombination breakpoints. Selection against recombinants with disrupted intra-gen interactions, such as protein and nucleic folding, is observed. Strong selection preserves co-evolved protein-protein and DNA interactions, allowing identification of sequence tracts involved in interactions.
Nucleosomes, the fundamental units of eukaryotic chromatin, have been implicated in the evolution of eukotic genomes through their influence on DNA mutation propensity and selection. Contrary to the notion that nucleosomes are unique to eukotes, histone proteins have been found in archaeal genomes. However, archaeal nucleosomes differ significantly from eukotic counterparts in histone composition and assembly. This study investigates the relationship between nucleosome footprints and evolution in humans and the archaeon Haloferaxii. Despite differences in nucleosome structure, the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence is conserved between the two species. The study examines whether mutation or selection can explain concord substitution patterns, but finds neither model sufficient to explain the observed association. Instead, nucleosome substitution patterns are consistent with a model where sequence divergence leads to frequent nucleosome repositioning during evolution. Nucleosome reposition is shown to be both necessary and sufficient to explain the association between current nucleosome positions and biased substitution. This finding highlights the importance of considering causality between genetic and epigenetic change.
Researchers have investigated the role of conformational diversity in protein function and its modulation by ligand binding. They propose that different ligands shift the conformation equilibrium through high-affinity conformers, and intramolecular vibrational dynamics facilitate conformation transitions, which may be associated with evolutionary conserved traits. A novel method was developed to identify key positions sustaining conformation associated with ligand binding, applied to a dataset of 188 protein structures in bound and unbound forms. Normal modes involved in conformation change were selected based on overlap with ligand-induced distortions, and a subspace defined to analyze mutation effects on conformation diversity. A negative correlation was found between mutation effects on normal subspaces and ligand-binding and evolutionary conservation. Positions altering these subspaces were identified as key, mediating ligand-conformation change, mostly conserved, buried aliphatic residues in regular regions like β-sheets and α-helix.
Researchers investigated the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by engineering a strain with regulated FBA levels using anhyrotacycline. Depletion of FBA led to clearance of M in both acute and chronic phases of infection in vivo and loss of viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. However, consistent with M's ability to co-catabolize multiple sources, viability could be restored when cultured on mixtures of glycolytic and gluogenic sources, enabling generation of F knockout (Δ). In vitro studies of Δ revealed lack of F could only be compensated by specific balance of glucose and butyrate, with butyrate metabolism determined by M's ability to coatabol glucose. These findings evaluate F as a potential target in both replicating and persistent M, and expand understanding of conditions defining M's F in vivo.
Researchers investigated the role of the mitochondrial 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (TXNPx) in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that lacks catalase and selenium-glutathione peroxidases. A gene replacement strategy was used to create TXNP null mutants (txn−), which were indistinguishable from wild-type promastigotes, but unable to thrive in a murine infection model. Unexpectedly, the avirulence of txn− was not due to lack of peroxidase activity, as TXx behaved like controls when exposed to exogenous oxidants or generated by macrophage phagocytosis in vivo. txn− were also avulent in hosts unable to mount an oxidative phagocyte response (B6.47ox/− and B.R2/−IF− mice). The perase activity of TXx is not required for parasite survival in mice was shown by rescuing the non-infect phenotype of txn with a peraseinactive version of the protein. A novel function is proposed for TXx as a molecular chaperone, which explains impaired infectivity of mutants. This is based on suppression of citrate synthase aggregation in vitro. txn− were more sensitive to temperature shift from 25°C to 37°C, reminiscent of organisms lacking chone genes. The findings change the paradigm of trypanoid 2-cyste peroxins as peroxide-eliminating devices and demonstrate 2-cyst peroxins can be determinant for pathogenic independently of perase activity.
Researchers conducted a multicenter, prospective diagnostic study to evaluate the accuracy of Histoplas urine antigen (HAg) for diagnosing disseminated histoplasis (PD) in HIV patients. The study included 288 patients with suspected PD from two secondary and tertiary care facilities in Mexico. The reference standard for diagnosis was Histlas capsulatum growth in blood, bone marrow, and tissue cultures or histopathologic examination. Results showed that 29.5% of patients had PD. The sensitivity of HAg was 67.1% and specificity was 97.5.5. The positive likelihood ratio was 27.2. In 10.5% of patients with PD, a co-infection was diagnosed, mostly disseminated Mycobacterium complex. The study found high specificity but low sensitivity of HAg. The test may be useful for starting antifungal treatment, but a culture-based approach is necessary since co-infections are frequent and a negative result does not rule out PD.
Diarrhea is a leading cause of significant morbidity and mortality in children worldwide, with approximately 1.8 million deaths annually and millions of non-fatal episodes. In up to 40% of cases, the etiologic agent remains unidentified. Metagenomic analysis offers a systematic and unbiased characterization of microbial populations, enabling the detection of novel viruses in stool specimens. This study employed a metagenomic approach to characterize viral communities in diarrhea specimens from 12 children using a "micro-sequencing" strategy requiring minimal sample quantity (<100mg), minimal purification, and limited sequencing (384 reads/sample). Known enteric viruses were detected, as well as multiple putatively novel sequences with limited similarity to GenBank.
A comparative analysis of Zika and deng outbreaks in the Dominican Republic was conducted using national surveillance data. The study aimed to investigate the transmission dynamics of these flaviviruses following a large deng epidemic in the country. Retrospective datasets were used to collect information on populations at risk, and descriptive statistics were applied to describe the outbreaks on a national scale. Results showed that 75% of deng cases were reported in individuals under 20 years old, while Zika infections were more dispersed among the population. Dengue rates were higher among males (25.9 per 10,000 population) compared to females (21.5 per 10,000). Zika infections were highly clustered among females (73.8%, 95% CI 72.6, 75.0; p<0.05), with adjusted rates 7.64 per 10,000 among females and 2.72 per 10,000 among males. Stratification by sex revealed higher rates among females (1.84, 1.82,1.87; p<0.05) compared to males (1.72 1.69,1.75; p0.05). However, GBS rates stratified by sex showed higher risk in males (0.62) compared to females (0.57 per 10,000). The study found little impact of existing deng immunity on Zika attack rates at the population level. Confounding of R and incident calculations by sex-specific reporting may alter reliability of epidemiological metrics, which could be addressed using proxy syndromes or conditions to explore sex-skewed incidence. Findings suggest awareness campaigns influencing short-term health behavior increased reporting among women of reproductive age, although biological susceptibility cannot be ruled out. Media and screening are recommended for women of reproductive age during Zika outbreaks. Future research should focus on Zika outcomes among deng seropositive individuals.
Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARs) are enzymes that catalyze the transfer of poly(ADP-ri) units onto target proteins. In Arabidopsis thaliana, PAR2 (Atg0230) is the predominant poly(ADP-ri) polymerase in response to DNA damage and genotoxic stresses caused by bleomycin, mitomycin, or gamma-radiation. In contrast to humans, where PAR1 accounts for 90% of cellular PAR activity, PAR2 makes the greatest contribution to PAR activity and organismal viability in Arabidopsis. PAR2 has SAP binding motifs rather than zinc finger domains common in plant and animal PAR1 proteins. PAR2 contributes more than PAR1 to plant immune responses, including restriction of Pseudomonas syringae growth and reduction of infection-associated DNA-strand breaks. Poly(AD-ri)glycohydrolase (PARG) enzymes show Arabidopsis P1 and not P2 are major contributors to poly(AD-ri) removal from acceptor proteins. PAR2 activity is influenced by PAR1 and P1, and PAR2 and PAR physically interact with P1 and P2, suggesting regulatory interactions among mediators of poly(AD-rib). Plant PAR and P proteins are structurally distinct from animal counterparts, indicating substantial differences in regulation.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the PHR protein RPM-1 regulates synapse formation and axon termination through its ubiquitin ligase activity, inhibiting the DLK-1 and MLK-1 MAP kinase pathways. Research has identified a new MAP kinase pathway that suppresses synapse formation defects in mechanosensory neurons of rpm-1 mutants, but not axon termination defects. This pathway includes M-15 (MAPK), NSY-1 (MAPK), JKK-1 (MAPK), and JNK-1 (MAP) kinases. Overexpression of these kinases in the M-15/J-1 pathway impairs synapse formation in wild-type animals. The M-15/J-1 pathway functions autonomously in mechanensory neurons and localizes to presynaptic terminals, indicating a role in synapse development. Loss of M-15/J-1 signaling suppresses habituation to repeated mechanical stimuli in rpm-1 mutants, a behavioral deficit linked to impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. Habituation is consistent with M-15/J-1 functioning as a parallel pathway to RPM-1, indicating M-15/J-1 restricts glutamateric synapse and short-term learning.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary changes in the bipotential switch that controls the sperm/oocyte decision in hermaphroditic nematodes. They confirmed that the sex-determination protein TR-1 (TRA-1) is bipotential, capable of activating or repressing the same target gene in response to upstream signals. A co-factor was identified and used to explore the structure of the bipot switch during evolution. Null mutants revealed that C. brigae TR-1 is required for spermatogenesis, and RNA interference showed it works as part of the Histone Acetylase complex. RT-PCR data demonstrated it promotes C-f-3, a gene needed for spermatogenesis. Epistasis tests showed TR-1 works through TR-1 to activate C-f and control the sperm/oocyte decision. Since TR-1 can also repress-f, these observations demonstrate it bipotential. TR- regulates the male tail development. C-tra C-tr- double mutants resemble C-null mutants, two branches control TR- activity. Differences in the relationship between branches have arisen during evolution. C brigae TR- null prevent hermroditic sperogenesis, but C-f null, which disrupt the other half. On the other hand, C null prevent spermatogenesis but C-tr. Synthetic interactions confirm both halves exist each species.
Researchers have proposed two new measures, ΦE and ΦAR, to quantify the integrated information generated by a system as it transitions between states, addressing the limitations of the existing measure ΦDM, which is defined for discrete Markov systems and rarely applicable in biology. The new measures can be applied to time-series data. Simulations demonstrate their practicality and explore properties. The results provide opportunities to examine integration in real and model systems, and implications for relations between integrated information, consciousness, and neurocognitive processes. The findings challenge theories attributing physical meaning to measured quantities.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the spread of Rhodesian African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uganda, focusing on environmental and climatic factors influencing its distribution. A previous study used logistic regression to examine the relationship between HAT prevalence and social, environmental, and climatic variables in two affected districts, suggesting the disease spread was due to infected, untreated livestock movement. This study extended the analysis to account for spatial autocorrelation, uncertainty in data and model parameters, and predictive mapping of future H prevalence. A Bayesian generalized linear geostatistical model was used to account for spatial autocorrelation and uncertainty, resulting in more accurate parameter estimates and increased predictive accuracy. The analysis supported the theory that H was introduced via untreated, infected livestock movement from endemic areas. Health care accessibility and land temperature effects on H distribution were also confirmed. Predictive mapping showed increased H risk in areas surrounding livestock markets, highlighting the importance of trading in disease spread.
In the 1970s, the consensus that complexity leads to stability in ecosystems was challenged by ecologically-inspired approaches, which assumed the existence of a feasible equilibrium with positive abundances. However, this assumption has not been tested. Analytical results and simulations show that equilibrium vanishes in species-rich systems, leaving the existence of a feasible equilibrium in stability criteria far from granted. The study extends the analysis by changing interaction structure and intensity, finding that feasibility and stability are warranted regardless of species richness with weak interactions. Dynamical behavior of ecologically-inspired architectures differs from unstructured systems. Results suggest understanding ecosystem dynamics requires interplay between interaction strength and architecture.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Western Kenya to assess the epidemiology of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever, in humans and cattle. Serum samples from 204 humans and 955 cattle in 416 households were analyzed for C. burnii antibodies, along with questionnaires on demographic, socio-economic, and husbandry information. Data were linked to environmental datasets on geographical locations, such as land cover. Correlation and spatial correlation analyses were applied to assess the link between cattle and human seroprevalence. Multilevel regression was used to assess relationships between socio-economic, demographic, and environmental factors and seropositivity in humans and animals. The overall seroprevalence of C. burnii was 2.5% in humans and 10.5% in cattle. No correlation was found between cattle and human serreval within households or spatial proximity to other households. Multile modelling indicated several factors for exposure to organism cattle from market as opposed to homestead and residing areas with lower precipitation had highest serreval. For humans, the youngest age group had highest odds of serositivity, variations between ethnic groups, and frequent livestock contact (grazing and dealing material) was a factor.
Researchers have sequenced the genomes of the blood flukes Schistosoma japonicum, S. mansoni, and S. haematobium, and used functional approaches to identify the role and importance of newly described schistosome genes. A genetic model system for Schistosoma has been established, enabling gain-of-function and loss-of-function, vector-based RNA interference, and forward genetics for insertional mutagenesis screens. To expedite routine transgenesis in Schistosomes, germ cells need to be reliably cultured. Vasa, a member of the ATP-dependent DEAD-box helicase family, is a primordial germ cell marker in Metazoa. Bioinformatics identified 33 putative DEAD-box helicases in S. mansoni with conserved motifs. Three helicases exhibited Vasa-like sequences, phylogenetic analysis confirmed three Vasa-like genes Smv1, Sm2, and Sm3 as members of the Vasa/10 DEAD subfamily. Transcripts Sm1, Sm2, and Sm3 were cloned from adult cDNAs, and real-time PCR showed presence in S. mans stages with elevated expression in sporocysts, females, eggs, miracidia, and undeveloped eggs. Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) revealed Sm1, Sm, and Sm3 transcribed in the ovary oocytes. Germ-specific expression of schist Vasa-like genes provides a landmark for Schist germ line transgenesis, etiologic agents of major tropical diseases.
Heart valve disease is a significant clinical concern worldwide, necessitating precise regulation of cardiac valve development and homeostasis. The Hippo signaling pathway is crucial for organ and tissue development, but its role in valve formation and maintenance is unclear. VGL4, a transcriptional coactivator in vertebrates, is predominantly expressed in valve interstitial cells at the post-embryonic stage and persists into adulthood. Tissue-specific knockout of V4 in cell lineages revealed that loss of V4 in endothelial cells resulted in valve malformation and increased expression of YAP targets. Further, semi-knockout of Y in V4-ablated hearts constrained hyperproliferation of valve interstitial cells.
Recent studies have reported the presence of soft sweeps in various organisms, including humans, Drosophila, and HIV, with large-scale analyses suggesting their pervasiveness across different population sizes and mutation rates. However, others have questioned the relevance of these models to natural populations and their identifiability from other processes, suggesting sweeps are likely rare. This study reconciles opposing results by evaluating three recent studies and their methodologies. Using population theory and simulation, it is found that all three are prone to high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying sweeps under both hard and neutral models. Additionally, it is demonstrated that demographic histories combined with hard sweeps provide a more parsimonious explanation. The findings address the tendency to invoke parameter-heavy, assumption-laden models of positive selection, neglecting proper demographic model construction.
Female Aedes aegypt mosquitoes, the primary vector for dengue fever, exhibit inhibited host-seeking behavior for three days following a blood meal due to a hemolymph-borneal factor, Peptide. The mechanism of this suppression and the receptor involved are unknown. Peptide shows similarity to Neurope-F (NPF) peptides, which signal through Neurope Y (PY)-Like Receptors (PYLR). Eight PYRs were identified in the Ae. aegyti genome and screened in a cell-based assay for sensitivity to a panel of peptides. Four PYRs responded to one or more ligands, with NYR1 responding to Peptide and NPF. Two PYR homologs in the Lyme disease vector Ix scularis were also sensitive to Peptide. Injection of synthetic Peptide and NPF inhibited host-seeking in non-fed females, while buffer or inactive Pe[C10 had no effect. To determine if PY1 is necessary for host-seeking inhibition, zinc-fingerases generated five npy1 mutants, which displayed normal behavior in locomotion, egg, sugar, feeding, blood, and host-seeking, but not host-seeking after meal. This study identified four Ae.egi PYRs and PY1 as a candidate NPF receptor sensitive to Pe. However, PY1 is not required for host-seeking, suggesting other receptors, peptides, or both regulate this behavior.
A study was conducted to model the risk of schistosomiasis transmission in Akure Local Government Area, Ondo State, Nigeria, using satellite-derived environmental data. The research aimed to identify areas with suitable conditions for schistosomias transmission based on physical and environmental factors from satellite imagery and spatial analysis. A multicriteria evaluation (CE) using Sa's Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was employed to determine the weight of importance of each schosiasis factor. Temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, and land use/cover were identified as controlling factors in schosias incidence in the area. These factors were reclassified and overlaid to identify areas vulnerable to schosias. Weighted analysis was done after each factor was given weight through the hierarchical process. The prevalence of schias in the area was determined by parasitological analysis of urine samples through random sampling. Results showed varying schias risk, with 82% of the area falling under high and very risk category. Community O I had the lowest schias risk, while risk increased in communities I, Igoba, It Ogb, and Ogb. Predictions by the model correlated with observations from study. High zones corresponded to endemic communities. Environmental factors were used in identifying and predicting schias transmission as well as monitoring disease in rural and agricultural communities.
Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumoc) meningitis, a bacterial infection of the brain, is characterized by the presence of cholesterol-dependent cytolys pneumolys, a key factor in determining neuropathogenic potential of pneumoc. Post-mortem brain samples from individuals with pneumoc meningitis show selective loss of synapses in superficial layers of frontal cortex. Similar effect observed in mice with pneumoc meningitis when bacteria express pore-form cholesterol cytol pneumolys. Mouse brain slices exposed to pore-compet pneumol at disease-relevant concentrations exhibit dendritic swelling, spine elimination, and synaptic loss. NMDA glutamate receptor antagonists MK801 and DAP reduce this pathology. Pneumolys increase glutamate levels in brain slices. In astrocytes, pneumol initiate glutamate release in calcium-dependent manner. Pneumol play significant role in pneumoc mening by initiating glutamate release from astrocytes, leading to glutamate-dependent synaptic damage.
Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are DNA viruses associated with major human cancers, and developing new prevention methods such as vaccines and microbicides requires understanding their life cycle. The HPV life cycle is linked to the state of the stratified epithelium it infects, with progeny virus made in the terminally differentiating supasal compartment. It has been recognized that HPV first establishes infection in the basal layer of stratified epithelium, but the reason is not understood. This might reflect specificity of entry receptors, but not fully explain differentiation of infection, as many cells can be infected in monolayer culture. We used biology to reveal that cell progression through mitosis is critical for HPV. Using HPV16 particles with intact genome, synchronized human keratinocytes as hosts, and viral expression as read for infection, cells must enter M phase for infection to take place. Late phase inhibitors had no effect, whereas G, S, G, and M phase inhibitors prevented infection. Cells need to pass prophase for successful transcription of encapsated genes. These provide reason HPVs establish in basal compartment of epithel. Only this compartment contains cells through cycle, and only in these HPVs can establish. Defining susceptibility to HPV, results have implications for control.
Researchers have identified microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) in the dimorphic fungus Penicillium marffei, a common cause of systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia. While miRNAs play a crucial role in gene regulation in animals and plants, their function in fungi is less understood. Using high-throughput sequencing, milRNAs were found to be more abundant in mycelial than yeast phase, with 24 potential candidates identified, including 17 in mycel and 7 yeast. Two genes, d-1 and d-2, encoding Dicer-like proteins, and q-2 encoding Argonaute, were found in P. marffei. Phylogenetic analysis showed d-2 of P. marffei is closely related to homologs in other dimorphic pathogenic fungi, suggesting co-evolution. d-2 among thermal fungi. d-2 demonstrated higher expression in mycel than yeast by 7-fold (p<0.001). Northern analysis confirmed expression of milRN PMil-M and PMil-M only in mycel. Deletion mutants showed biogenesis of milRN dependent on d-2 but not d- or q-. mRNA levels of predicted targets of PMil-M were upregulated in knockdown PMilKD, supporting regulatory function milRN. This study provides first evidence for differential mil expression in growth phases of dim fungi and sheds light on evolution of proteins in mil biogenesis and post-transcriptional control in dimorphism.
Zika virus (ZIK) emerged in French Polynesia in 2013 and spread through the Pacific region between 2013 and 2017. Several Aedes mosquitoes may have contributed to ZIK transmission, including Aedes aegypt, the main vector in the region, and Aedesynensis, vector of lymphatic filariasis and secondary vector dengue. This study analyzed the ability of these vectors to transmit ZIK at a regional scale by comparing the competence of Ae aegi and Aynesis populations from Pacific islands for ZIK strain circulated during 2013-2017 outbreak. Field Aeegi (three populations) and Ayn (two) from Pacific were collected. Female mosquitoes were exposed to ZIK (107 TCID/mL) isolated in 2014. At 6, 9, and 21 post-infection, bodies, thorax, abdomen, and heads were analyzed for infection, dissemination, transmission, and transmission rates, respectively. Results showed ZIK infection rates were heterogeneous between Aeeg populations, but dissemination rates were moderate and homogenous between these. For Ayn, infection rates were less heterogeneous between two populations. Transmission efficiency revealed low competence for ZIK of different Ae populations. Results indicated low Z transmission by Aeeg and Ayn from Pacific. This suggests other factors, such as vector density, lifespan, or immunologically naive fraction of population, contributed to rapid spread of ZIK in Pacific during 201-2017.
Researchers have developed a new method called Targeted StructureSeq to study the structure of the long non-coding RNA (lnc) Xist, a key regulator of X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. Xist and other lncRNAs rely on thermodynamically stable secondary and higher-order structures formed in cells. Targeted StructureSeq combines chemical probing of RNA in cells with massively parallel sequencing, enriching for signals from the RNA of interest to achieve high coverage with few reads, providing a scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells. This method was used to probe full-length Xist lRNA, revealing new models for functional elements within Xist, including the A element in the 5'-end of X. Analysis also identified conserved structural elements Xist, a new proximal to repeats important for X function.
Researchers have identified numerous genetic variants associated with complex diseases, raising questions about the clinical utility of risk prediction based on genomic profiles. To evaluate the performance of genetic prediction models, appropriate statistical measures are needed. Previous studies primarily used the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) curve, but it has limitations and should be complemented by other measures. This study develops a unifying framework connecting various predictive indices. Given disease probability and heritability explained by genetic variants, it is possible to analytically estimate multiple metrics, including AUC, mean difference between cases and non-cases, net reclassification improvement, proportion of cases by specific population percentile, variance of predicted risks, and risk at any percentile. The framework also enables visualization of model performance through ROC curve, risk density, and predictiveness curve. Simulations match theoretical estimates. The methodology is applied to nine diseases, evaluating predictive power of genetic tests on known variants for each trait.
Researchers evaluated the accuracy of a new rapid diagnostic test for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection, the parasite causing African trypanosomiasis, using recombinant antigens. The study compared the new test, SDOL HAT 2.0, with a rapid test using native antigens, SDOLAT, and the traditional Card agglutination Test for Trypanosomias (CATT). A total of 57,632 individuals were screened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 260 cases confirmed by parasitology. SDOLAT 2.0 had the highest sensitivity at 71.2%, followed by CATT 62.5% and SDAT 59%. CATT had the highest specificity at 99.2%, while SDOLAT and SDOL 2.0 had 98.9% and 98.1% respectively. Sensitivity was lower than expected due to cases from overlapping populations. All tests were more sensitive in passive than active screening. Combining tests increased sensitivity: SDAT with SDOL 2.0 reached 98.4% in passive and 83% in active. The recombinant-based test was as sensitive and specific as SDAT, but less specific than CATT.
In a region of Guatemala with persistent Triatoma infestation, Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of Latin Americans, has been effectively controlled through multiple rounds of indoor insecticide spraying (IRS). However, a few foci remain, including the municipality of Comapa, Department of Juti, where interventions appear less effective. Three cross-sectional entomological and serological surveys were conducted in Comapa to evaluate a decade of vector control activities. Baseline serological (1999) and entomological (2001-2) surveys were followed by three rounds of insecticide applications (2003-2005) and intermittent spraying of infested houses until 2012. Household inspections determined entom indices and materials in 200, 2007, and 201. Serological surveys were conducted in school-age children 199, 2007, and 201, and women of child-bearing age 15-44 in 201. After IRS, infestation decreased from 39% (200-2) to 27 (201). Household materials predicted <10% infested houses. Chagas seropreval in school children declined 10-fold from 10 (199) to 1 (201). However, serreval in women of child age remained >10. A decade of control in Comapa shows reduced transmission, but continued risk vector-borne and congenital transmission threatens the 202 Chagas elimination goal.
Citrobacterium is a natural pathogen that causes attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions in mice, sharing virulence strategies with human pathogens Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). The complete genome of Citrobacterium strain ICC168 was previously sequenced, revealing characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen. This study used PFGE sequencing of isolates, whole-genome transcript analysis, and mobile genetic elements to confirm the hypothesis that Citrobium's genome is unstable due to repeat-mediated large-scale recombination and active transposition of mobile elements, such as prophages. An additional Citrobium strain EX-33 was sequenced, revealing that ICC168 is representative of the species and most inactivating mutations common to both isolates occurred early in the pathogen's evolution.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to analyze stochastic fluctuations in gene expression, which result in varying protein levels across cell populations. Despite existing theoretical models, a robust and assumption-free approach to infer underlying mechanisms was lacking. The proposed method infers biochemical constants for chromatin modification, transcription, translation, RNA, and protein degradation from stochastic protein expression. It was determined if these rates can be estimated from protein distributions without assumptions. The approach involved: (1) deriving analytical solutions for protein distribution moments, (2) showing moments capture distribution shape, and (3) developing an algorithm for inferring rate constants from moments. The algorithm found most distributions consistent with multiple rate sets. Despite degeneracy, the constant space always informs mechanism. For example, it distinguished transcription bursting from constitutive production. The method agreed with standard approach in restrictive regime and identified previously unobtainable rates. Without assumptions, estimates were obtained in 91% of cases, and all constants in some cases. The framework will deduce molecular contributions to gene expression patterns.
Researchers have developed a new vaccine strategy to protect against monkeypox, a viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus (MPV), using a recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 (Bo-4) vector. MPV is an emerging zoonotic disease in tropical Africa, primarily in the Congo Basin and sporadically in West Africa, with no FDA-approved therapies and limited vaccines due to safety concerns. The study aimed to investigate the efficacy of Bo-4 vectors expressing MPV glycoproteins A29, M1, and B6 in protecting against lethal MPV challenge in STAT1 knockout mice. Three recombinant Bo-4 vectors, Bo-4-CMV-A29g106ΔTK, Bo-4-E1-MR106TK, and Bo-4-E-BR106TK, were constructed and demonstrated to express their transgene. A small-scale study showed no adverse effects after intraperitoneal administration. Bo-4-E1-MR106TK alone or in combination with Bo-4-C-A29 and Bo-4-BR protected 100% and 80% of STAT- mice from mortality and morbidity, respectively. This demonstrates the efficacy of Bo-4 vectors as a vaccine platform.
In trypanosomes, the major mRNA decay pathway is 5'-3' decay, which involves deadenylation followed by decapping and 5'-3' exonuclease activity. Unlike other eukaryotes, trypanosomes lack homologs of the decapping complex subunits. This study identifies ApH-like phosphatase TbPH1 (AL1) as the major mRNA decapping enzyme in trypanosomes. AL1 was previously identified as a trypan stress granule protein involved in mRNA binding, and co-localizes with 5'-3 exonuclease X to a granule at the cell's posterior. RNAi depletion of AL1 is lethal, causing increased deadenylated mRNAs without 5'- decay. This suggests AL acts downstream deadenylation and upstream degradation, consistent with decapping function. In vitro, recombinant N-terminally truncated AL1, but catalytically inactive, sensitizes capped trypan spliced RNA to X1, but only with 5' polyphosphase. This indicates decapping mechanism differs from D2, leaving more than one phosphate at 5' end. This is the first eukotic ApH phosphatase function, a bacterial-derived class in all eukotic phylogenetic groups. Eukotic ApH phosphat substrates unknown, but bacterial Ap diadenine tetraphosphate resembles eotic cap.
Researchers have discovered that inactivating the Arx gene in pancreatic α-cells triggers their conversion into β-like cells. Using a combination of conditional loss-of-function and lineage tracing approaches, they found that inhibiting Arx in α-cells promotes the conversion of adult α-cells into β-like cells at any age. This process involves the mobilization of ductal precursor cells to adopt an endocrine fate, with glucagon cells being converted into β-like cells upon Ar inhibition. Analysis of Arx and Pax4 double mutants revealed that Pax4 is dispensable for these processes, indicating Ar as the main trigger for α-cell β-cell neogenesis. Loss of Ar in α-cells regenerates functional β-cell mass and reverses diabetes-induced β-cell depletion.
In eukaryotic cells employ a range of mechanisms to prevent the initiation of DNA replication at thousands of origins in their genome, as uncontrolled initiation can lead to genomic alterations. These global mechanisms reduce the activity of replication proteins, suggesting that all origins are inhibited identically. However, origins initiate with diverse efficiencies when these mechanisms are disabled, and this cannot be explained by differences in efficiency or timing of initiation during S phase. This suggests an additional layer of control regulating initiation at distinct origins. Novel elements are necessary for preferential initiation of two origins and sufficient to confer preferential initiation on heterologous origins when control is partially deregulated. These elements do not enhance S phase or efficiency of adjacent origins, acting as initiation promoters (RIPs). Two RIPs are mapped to ∼60 bp AT-rich sequences acting in distance-dependent manner. During replication, Mc2 associates with origins that preferentially initiate and those that do not, indicating RIPs can overcome initiation block imposed by Mc2 association. Our findings reveal a level of control to initiation. This control creates a genomic landscape of replication potential when global mechanisms are compromised. If replication contributes to alterations, as speculated in cancer, some regions may be more susceptible than others.
Invasive amebias caused by Entamoeba histolytica is a growing concern among men who have sex with men and co-infection ameba and HIV-1 in East Asian countries. A study of 170 HIV-1-infected patients with invasive amebias was conducted to characterize clinical and epidemiological features. Clinical presentation of invasive amebias in HIV-1 patients was similar to non-HIV hosts, with fever, leukocytosis, and high CRP associated with extraintestinal ameb diseases. Two patients died from amebic colitis due to intestinal perforation and bleeding, and three from unrelated causes. Metronidazole or tinazole treatment was successful in 165 cases. Luminal treatment was provided to 83 post-metronidazole tinazole, but amebias recurred in 6, similar to non-luminal patients. Recurrence was more frequent in HCV-antibody positive and syphilis acquired during follow-up. Various E histolytic genotypes were identified, no correlation with clinical features. Metronidazole tinid treatment of uncomplicated amebias was excellent in HIV-1 individuals. Luminal post-metronid tinazole did not reduce recurrence in high-risk populations due re-infection.
In the Mandouli area of South Chad, a persistent focus of Gambian sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis) caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, a global efforts aim to eliminate the disease as a public health problem by 2020 and stop transmission by 203. Prior to 2014, control relied solely on case detection and treatment, resulting in a gradual decrease in cases due to annual screening. To assess the impact of adding vector control to detection and treatment, 'tiny' targets' that attract and kill tset were deployed in riverine habitats in 2014, 2015, and 2016. A census of the population and settlements was conducted, and pre-intervention surveys of tse distribution and abundance were implemented. The population of 74 inhabitants lived in the vicinity, with Glossina fuscipes fipes and a mean catch of 0.7 tset/trap/day. After deployment, catch declined to 0.005set/trap. Modelling attributed 70.4% (95%:51-95) of reduction in cases 2015 to vector control, 62.8% (95:59-66) to tset control, and 8.5 (95:8-9) to passive detection. Predictions anticipate elimination by 2018 if control and screening continue, with virtually no transmission since 201.
A retrospective observational study was conducted on 124 cases of strongyloidiasis registered in the +IV Collaborative Network from 2009 to 2017. The study aimed to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological characteristics of patients with imported strongloidis in Spain. The majority of patients (66.9%) were immigrants, with South America being the most frequent area of origin. Detection of larvae in stool samples was observed in 21.9% of patients, while serological tests made the diagnosis in the remaining cases. Eosinophilia was present in 82.2% of cases. Treatment with ivermectin compared to albendazole was the most strongly associated factor to achieve cure (OR 2.34).
Researchers have investigated the impact of the inoculum dose, or amount of antigen or attenuated pathogen, on host immunity and morbidity in vaccine design. A higher inoculum doses stimulate a stronger immune response but may cause more severe side effects and limit vaccine availability during shortages. Determining the optimal inoculum dose is crucial for rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models and experimental data can determine the inoculum's impact. The study used a mathematical model to fit data from influenza A virus (IAV) infection in mice and human parainfluenza (HIV) infection in rats at different inoculum doses. The model mapped inoculum to immune protection and morbidity levels, exploring a framework for determining optimal inoculum. The framework combines models with data to study inoculum's impact on outcomes like protection and morbidity. Findings show inoculum's impact on protection and morbidity depend on the pathogen, and protection and morbidity don't increase monotonically with inoculum. Once protection and morbidity levels are specified, the framework helps rational vaccine design and optimal inoculum determination.
Researchers investigated the expression of the HetR gene, a transcription factor essential for heterocyst differentiation in the cyanobacterium Anabaena, under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-deprived conditions. Using a chromosomally-encoded translational hetR-gfp fusion, they analyzed fluctuations of HetR expression at the individual cell level in wild-type and mutant filaments. Results showed that HetR fluctuations in nearby cells are coupled, with a spatial range of circa two to three cells, indicating cellular interactions along the filament. Correlations arise from intercellular molecular transfer and less cell division. Fluctuations after nitrogen-down build on those under nitrogenplete conditions. Under nitrogen-rich conditions, basal HetR expression is influenced by the septal protein Sep and Het auto-regulation. A comparison of Het-gfp expression under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-poor conditions highlights differences between Het inhibitors Pat and Het, as well as sept proteins Sep and Fra/Fra. Activation and cell communication are key to developmental processes. Results show that proteins involved in these mechanisms combine with stochasticity in expression to control fluctuations, giving rise to a one-dimensional pattern in this organism.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype has shifted from genotype III (GIII) to I (GI) in China, as demonstrated by molecular epidemiological surveillance. A serological survey in non-vaccinated pigs confirmed this shift at the seroepidemiological level, with an average GI/GIII ratio of 1.87, indicating co-circulation of GI and GIII infections, with GI being more prevalent. To investigate this shift, replication kinetics of seven isolated JEV isolates, including three GI and four GIII strains, were compared in C6/36 cells, chicken fibroblast (DF-1), and porcine artery endothelial (PIE) cells. GI strains replicated more efficiently in DF-1 and PIE cells, with titers 22.9-225.3 fold higher than GIII in DF-1 cells. This suggests enhanced replication of GI in avian cells. In vivo, young ducklings were inoculated with GI and GIII at 2 days post-hatching. GI-inoculated ducklings developed higher viremia and displayed longer vmic duration than GIII-inoc ducklings. These results support enhanced efficiency of GI in birds. Thirty-six amino acids differ between GI and GIII, some may be responsible for replication efficiency of GI in birds. Enhanced replication of GI in birds may result in higher exposure and infection in mosquitoes, increasing transmission in birds-mosquito-bird enootic cycle, contributing J genotype shift.
Candida albicans biofilm formation is a critical aspect of its pathogenicity and is regulated by a complex network of transcription factors, including Crz1, Brg1, Efg1, N80, Rob1, and Tec1. To elucidate how these factors interact to regulate biofilm formation, researchers generated all possible double heterozygous mutants of the network and quantitatively analyzed genetic interactions between them. The network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbation, with six heterozygous mutants showing alterations in biofilm formation (haploinsufficiency). Many double heterozygous mutants are as severely affected as homozygous deletions. The network exhibits a highly interconnected "small-world" topology, being efficient but not robust. Genetic data indicate Tec1 is a component whose expression is sensitive to perturbations in other TF functions. Rob1 expression is dependent on auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other TFs. N80 heterozygous deletion is hyperfilous under bio and hypha-inducing conditions in Tec-dependent manner. This study provides insights into individual TF functions and overall network topology in function.
Researchers investigated the role of asparagine synthase A (AS) in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis, a disease. AS is an enzyme responsible for converting aspartate to asparagine using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source. There are two types of AS: AS-A, which uses ammonia, and AS-B, which uses glutamine. AS-A is absent in humans but present in trypanosomatids, making it a potential drug target. A previous study suggested AS-A is essential in Leishmania donani, a related parasite. This study found that Leishmania infant AS can use both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen sources, similar to Trypanosoma spp. and Leish donani. The researchers created AS-A null mutants in Leish infant by gene replacement and found no significant growth or infectivity defects. However, severe growth impairment was observed in aspar limiting conditions. The results show that while AS is important under aspar limitation, it is not essential for parasite survival or infectivity in normal in vitro and in vivo conditions. Therefore, AS is not a suitable target against Leish infant parasites.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between toxocariasis and epilepsy. The review included 11 case-control studies from 13 countries, totaling 474 participants (215 with epilepsy and 259 without epilepsy). The pooled odds ratio (OR) was 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.01), indicating a positive association between Toxara spp seropositivity and epilepsy. A positive association was consistently reported in subgroup analyses of confirmatory diagnostic tests, younger populations, and population-based studies. Meta-regression showed no significant association between covariates and outcome. The meta-analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between Toara seropitivity and epilepsy, mainly supported by population studies.
ATM-dependent miR-335 targets CtIP and modulates the DNA response to double-strand breaks (DSBs). Irradiation (IR)-induced DSBs activate ATM, leading to the downregulation of miR-335, a microRNA that targets CtIP, a trigger of homologous recombination repair (HRR). CREB is responsible for a large portion of mi-335 expression by binding to the promoter of mi-335. CREB binding is reduced after IR, consistent with previous studies that IR-activated ATM phosphorylates CRE to reduce its activity. Overexpression of mi-335 in HeLa cells results in reduced CtIP and post-IR survival and BRCA foci formation. In patient-derived lymphoblast cell lines with post-IR survival radiosensitive phenotype, mi-335 is elevated, Ct reduced, and BRCA foci. Colony survival, BRCA, and Ct are partially rescued by mi antisense oligonucleotide-mi-335 treatment. ATM-dependent CRE-mi-335-CtIP axis influences selection of HRR for DSB repair.
Researchers investigated the role of mentalizing, or attributing mental states to others, in learning during social interactions. Participants played games against artificial agents with varying levels of mentalizing sophistication, including recursive beliefs such as "I think you think I think." Results showed that participants performed better against sophisticated mentalizing agents in a social context, but not in a non-social context. In the social context, participants' choices were best explained by sophisticated mentalizing models, but not in the non-social context. The study demonstrates the added value of mentalizing in social learning and shows that deciphering behavior requires attributing mental states to others.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called FastGM for inferring Gaussian Graphical Models (GM) in biological networks. GM is a statistical model that describes the conditional relationships between a set of random variables as a graph, useful for analyzing biological networks, such as inferring interactions or comparing networks. Current methods are either statistically unsound or inefficient for high-dimensional data with thousands of variables. FastGM is based on a recent proposal by Ren et al. (2015) and estimates GM and p-values with confidence intervals for each edge in the graph. Simulations show FastGM is faster by several orders of magnitude than the current algorithm by Ren et al without loss of accuracy. FastGM is applied to real data: transcriptomics from childhood asthma and proteomics Alzheimer's disease studies, estimating gene and protein networks for disease and healthy samples. Results reveal interesting interactions and differential networks between cases and controls relevant to diseases. FastGM is a computationally efficient and statistically sound procedure for GM inference with high-dimensional biological data, implemented in R package "FastGM".
Researchers investigated the optimal balance of striatal medium spiny neuron (MSN) network activity in the basal ganglia, a structure crucial for learning and executing movement sequences. They found that MSN population firing rates vary coherently on behaviorally relevant timescales. A model of the MSN network with realistic connectivity and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPs) showed emergent activity. The study examined how MSN population activity interacts with temporally varying cortical activity, as in a behavioral task. At high connectivity, a "winner-takes-all" regime was found, where activity separates into stimulus-dependent firing and quiescent components, with few population rates interacting with cortical variations. Around this, a transition to a more dynamic regime occurred, where cells switch between activity and quies. In this regime, MS components wander and are independent of cortical variations. Only in this regime, cortical changes interact with many components, allowing sequential assemblies to be reproducibly activated for hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset. Peristimulus histograms display strong stimulus specificity. This activity is maximized at striatal realistic connectivities and IP sizes. The MS network is neither too stable to respond dynamically to cortical variations nor too unstable to respond consistently. It is optimized to generate stimulus-dependent patterns long after cortical excitation.
Polarized exocytosis, a process that transports membrane components to specific locations on the cell cortex, and endocyt, which retrieves these components before they can diffuse, are generally considered separate events. However, research reveals a link between the two pathways. Yeast GTPase Sec4 couples polarized exocyt with cortical actin polymerization, inducing endocyt. After polar exocyt to the plasma membrane, Sec4 binds Las17/Bee1 (yeast WASp) in complex with S1 and S2 during actin assembly. Mutations in Sec4 or its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec2 inhibit actin formation, while activating Sec4L accelerates assembly. In vitro assays, Arp3-dependent actin polymerization shows GTP-Sec4 overrides S1 inhibition of Lasp actin nucleation. These results support a model where Sec4 relocates along the membrane from polar exocytic sites to endocytic sites. Activated Sec4 promotes actin polymer and triggers compensatory endyt, controlling surface expansion and refining cell polarization.
Acetamin-induced liver injury in mice is a model for drug-induced liver injury in humans, and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to prevent or reverse damage. The phenomenon of necrosis in mice begins near the central vein (CV) of the liver lobule and progresses outward, but the mechanism remains elusive. Research suggests that differences in NAPQ (reactive metabolite) formation within hepatic lobules (NQonation) are necessary and sufficient to explain this phenomenon, proposing the NZech hypothesis. However, this hypothesis is challenging to test in mice due to uncontrolled variables and the need for intracellular measurements at different locations within the same mouse.

Virtual hepatocytes exhibit location-dependent behaviors using peri-portal-CV gradients, and employing NZ-mech achieved validation for acetamin clearance but not the phenomenon. To achieve the phenomenon, at least one additional feature exhibiting zonation in the CV direction is required. Two alternatives were explored: glutathione depletion in the CV direction and mitochondrial damage repair in the CV. Including one feature failed, but including both enabled achieving the phenomenon. The merged mechanism provides a multile, multiscale explanation of acetamin hepatotoxicity in mice. Variants of the mechanism explain variation in 24-hour necrosis among 37 diverse mouse strains after a single acetamin dose.
Researchers investigated the diagnosis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in congenitally infected children, focusing on the relationship between conventional diagnosis methods and quantitative DNA amplification. According to Chagas congenital transmission guidelines, diagnosis relies on detecting parasites by microscopy or specific antibodies at 10-12 months of age. Parasite levels were quantified by PCR in T cruz-infected children, grouped by one-year follow-up diagnosis results. Three groups were identified: A) neonates diagnosed by microscopy at birth (n=19) with median parasitemia 1,700/mL, B) infants requiring second parasitological diagnosis at 6 months (n=10) with median parasitem 20/mL and 500/mL at 1 and 6 months, and C) undetectable parasitem by microscopy but diagnosed by specific T cruz serology at 1 year (n=22) with parasitem 5/mL 800/mL and 20/mL. T cruz parasites were isolated by hemoculture from 19 congenally infected children, 18 genified as DT Tc (lineage TId) and 1 as Tc. This study quantified parasitemia in over 50 congenally infected children at 3 diagnostic controls post-delivery. Parasite burden in 22/51 was below microscopy detection limit. Current trypanidal treatment cured T cruz-infected children; sensitive methods should be developed for early diagnosis.
Researchers have developed a coarse-grained biophysical model of Escherichia coli that predicts growth rate and cellular composition based on a simplified representation of its genome. The model assumes the bacteria are in a state of balanced exponential growth in a temporally and spatially constant environment with abundant resources. The model was applied to measurements of growth and rRNA-protein ratio in seven E coli strains with varying rRNA operon copy numbers from one to seven, the wild-type number. Results showed growth decreased in strains with fewer than six copies. The model reproduced these measurements and suggested that the volume of macromolecules inside E coli is fixed regardless of r operon copy number. It also predicted that increasing copies beyond seven leads to cytoplasmic overcrowding with ribosomes and proteins. Assuming weakened binding affinities due to prolonged diffusion, the model predicted growth won't increase beyond wild-type rate, consistent with experiments. The model suggests changing r operon number in wild-type E coli in a constant environment doesn't increase growth rate. Other observations, such as nucleoid compaction and operon feedback, are qualitatively consistent. The model proposes design principles and experiments to test its validity.
Arabidopsis thaliana MYB protein R1 (RSM) interacts with HY5/HY to modulate seed germination and seedling development in response to abscisic acid and salinity. MYB transcription factors are involved in various biological processes, including metabolism, development, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. RSM, a member of the MYB-related subfamily, plays roles in plant development, stress, and hormone signaling. Downregulation or upregulation of RSM expression alters sensitivity of seed germination and cotyled greening to abisic acid (ABA), NaCl, and mannitol in Arabidopsis. RSM expression is dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl. Transcription factor ELONG HY5 (HY) and HY HOMOLOG (HY) regulate RSM via binding to R1 promoter. Genetic analyses reveal RSM mediates multiple functions of HY in responses seed germination postgermination to ABA abiotic stresses and seedling to salinity. RSM interacts with HY/HY in vitro and in vivo. R1 and HY/HY function as a module in responses A and abiotic stresses. R binds ABI5 promoter, regulating its expression, while R interaction stimulates HY binding ABI promoter. However, dual-luciferase transient assay does not support R enhances activation ABI by HY. HY/HY and R may converge ABI promoter independently or dependently regulate ABI and ABI-down ABA abiotic-responsive genes, improving plant adaptation environment.
Mitochondrial Complex I, the largest and most complex component of the respiratory chain, transfers electrons from NADH to ubiquinone while pumping four protons from the matrix to the intermembrane space. In humans, defects in Complex I are linked to various degenerative disorders. Recent X-ray analysis of prokary and eukotic Complex I revealed that redox reactions occur in the hydrophil peripheral arm, distant from the membrane domain. This suggests proton pumping in the membrane arm is driven by long-range conformation coupling. The mechanism, number, identity, and localization of pump sites are unclear. A study deleted the gene for a small subunit of Complex I, a stable sub (nbmΔ) was formed, lacking the distal membrane domain. Single particle analysis showed nbΔ lacks the distal part of the domain. Subunit composition of holo and nbΔ was analyzed by proteomics, revealing two subunits (ND4 and 5) with bacterial Na+/H antiporter homology, candidates for proton sites. Despite this, nbΔ pumps protons at half the stoichiometry of the complete enzyme. Results indicate two distinct pump modules in the membrane arm, connected by a helical element.
Researchers investigated the effect of fever on the binding affinity of antibodies to malaria antigens in vitro. They used isothermal titration calorimetry and ELISA to study the interaction between monoclonal antibodies and malaria antigens at different temperatures: 37°C (physiological), 40°C (febrile), and 42°C (pathological). The results showed a significant increase in affinity of the antibody-antigen complex at 40°C compared to 37 and 42°C. Thermal equilibration of the protein partners at these temperatures prior to measurements further increased binding. The study suggests a positive role for fever in modulating immune responses to infection and highlights the potential of thermal priming in enhancing protein-protein interactions with limited availability.
Actomyosin cortical flow is a crucial for cellular morphogenesis, generated by cross-linked actin filaments and myosin motors, where motor activity is opposed by network resistance to deformation. Continuous flow requires local remodeling through cross unbinding and/or disassembly. A computational model of cross-linked network with active motors was developed to study production and dissipation of contractile stress. Asymmetric compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor activity, reversible cross-links, and filament turnover were considered. Production and dissipation of network stress depend on cross dynamics and filament turnover, determining overall cortical flow rates. Filament turnover is required to maintain stress against resistance and steady flow in response to external stress. Steady stress increases with lifetime up to a time τ, then decreases above τ. Effective viscosity increases with lifetime up to τ, then becomes independent of lifetime and dependent on cross dynamics. Dependencies of stress and viscosity define multiple regimes of steady flow. When lifetimes are shorter than τ and τ, dependencies of viscosity and steady stress on turnover cancel, flow is insensitive to turnover and dependent on activity and dynamics.
A quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed on a Col-0/C24 population of Arabidopsis thaliana to identify genetic loci that overcome seedling growth inhibition on high sugar media. A glucose and fructose-sensing QTL, GS11, was mapped through selective genotyping and confirmed in near-isogenic lines in Col and C24 backgrounds. Allelism and transgenic tests showed GS11 lies within the ANAC060 gene. The AN060 allele confers sugar insensitivity was dominant over sugar-sensitive C24. Genomic and mRNA analysis revealed a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in AN060 affects splicing, adding 20 nucleotides to the mRNA, creating a stop codon and truncated protein lacking transmembrane domain (TMD) present in C060. The absence T results in nuclear localization AN060. Short AN060 is found in 12% natural Arabidopsis accessions. Glucose induces GS/AN expression requiring abisic acid (ABA) signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR and transient analysis showed ABI binds GS/AN promoter to activate transcription. AN060 reduced ABA sensitivity and Gl-induced ABA, and ABI was reduced in AN lines. Sugar-ABA induces AN expression, but truncated AN attenuates ABA and signaling, resulting in insensitivity.
Researchers have investigated the role of cyclic di-GMP (c-G) signaling in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that forms biofilms and exhibits motility. c-G is a second messenger molecule involved in various bacterial behaviors, including the transition from planktonic cells to biofilm communities. The complexity of c-G control over cellular functions raised the question of signaling specificity: is c-G signaling dependent on a central hub or can be localized? This study shows how c-G signaling gains specificity in P aeruginosa. A c-G synthase gene, hD, is located near the hB and flagellar genes. The hB pathway controls biofilm and motility involving hD and anti-sigma factor hA. Rewiring c-G signaling into h involves interaction between h and h and control of h localization at cell poles.
Researchers investigated how humans learn and generalize visuomotor mappings, which are associations between visual stimuli and motor responses, in the presence of contextual information. They found that participants can learn multiple mappings when feedback is provided, but little is known about the relationship between cues and visomotor mapping and generalization to novel conditions. Participants performed a targeting task with varying visual feedback offsets and shapes, requiring different visomotor mappings for each shape. Shapes were morphed between spiky and circular. After training, performance was tested without feedback on unseen shapes. Two hypotheses were tested: explicit extraction of linear relationship between shape and visom mapping and generalization, and an implicit Bayesian model predicting generalization based on categorization. Results showed that learning requires awareness of cues' role, but participants applied mapping to trained shape most similar to current, consistent with Bayesian model. The model predicts slowing with increased training pairs, confirmed. A correspondence between model and results indicates it as a mechanism for multiple visomotor learning.
Researchers investigated the relationship between climbing fiber activity and subthreshold oscillations in the inferior olivary nucleus, a key input to the cerebellum. Climbing fiber activation is thought to be involved in motor timing and learning, leading to all-or-none action potentials in cerebellar Purkin cells, silencing them for a brief period. Empirical evidence suggests climbing fibers can transmit bursts of spikes triggered by olary somatic spikes, increasing information transfer to the cerebellum. A previous in vitro studies indicated the climbing burst size is related to the spike's timing relative to subthreshold membrane oscillations in olary cells. This study used a three-compartment model of the inferioriv cell to explore factors determining climbing burst size. Findings show the phase dependency of burst size is present but limited, and charge flow between soma and dendrite is a major determinant of climbing burst. Dendritic gapunction between olary cells can affect burst size through ensemble synchrony.
A computational model of liver iron metabolism has been developed to understand the complex regulation of iron levels in the body. Iron is essential for life due to its redox properties, but can be toxic in excess. The liver plays a key role in regulating iron levels, and misregulation is linked to various diseases. Recent research has improved knowledge of iron's fate in the body, but a detailed understanding of its metabolism remains elusive. A mechanistic model of human liver iron metabolism, including core components, has been constructed based on known regulation mechanisms and kinetic properties. The model was validated by comparing results with published data, reproducing multiple findings. A simulation of an oral iron dose was compared to a clinical study, recreating dynamics and scale of response. A disease simulation of haemochromatosis was created by altering a reaction mimicking a mutation. The model provides understanding of iron overload in this disease. The model supports the liver's role as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modelling, simulations to identify targets and design experiments to improve knowledge.
Researchers have developed a coarse-grained model of the nuclear pore complex (NPC) to simulate nucleocytoplasmic transport. The NPC regulates molecular traffic across the nuclear envelope, with selective transport occurring on the order of milliseconds and tens of nanometers. The model accounts for the polymeric nature of FG-repeats on the NPC's structure and the kap-FG hydrophobic affinity. Brownian dynamics simulations were used to establish the model's methodology and biophysical rationale. The model predicts the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex to be 2.6±0.13 ms with an inverse Gaussian distribution. The cargo-com is primarily attached to the channel, interacting with the FG-layer as it passes through. Kap-F hydrophobic interaction is dynamic and fast, ensuring efficient transport through the NPC. Almost all hydrophobic spots on kapβ are occupied during transport. Cytoplasmic filaments play a crucial role in selectivity, as fil-deficient NPCs show high permeability to cargos.
Researchers have developed a method to determine the optimal infectious dose of a pathogen for nonhuman primate (NHP) models, which are commonly used to test interventions against human pathogens such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. In these models, a limited dose of the infectious agent is used, where only a fraction of animals become infected upon challenge. Determining this dose is crucial for experiment success, as too high or low a dose can lead to false results and excessive animal use. A protocol is proposed to define the dose infecting 50% of animals (ID50), and other doses like ID80 can be calculated from same data. This minimizes animal and resource use while estimating ID50 within 1.5-fold true value. The method involves selecting a range of doses, infecting a group of animals, and calculating the proportion infected. The dose that infects 50% of animals is the ID50, which can be used to calculate other doses like ID80 and ID20. This approach is more efficient and accurate than traditional methods, reducing animal use and cost.
Researchers have discovered a new form of adaptation in the auditory neuron AN2 (AN) of crickets, a first-order interneuron that responds to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli. The neuron's response curve shifts towards higher intensities with a time constant of 1.5 seconds for adaptation and recovery, reducing responses to low-intensity sounds. The study investigates whether this adaptation improves signal representation and compares it to two hypotheses: infax, which maximizes information across the signal range, and selective coding, which enhances foreground while suppressing background signals. The researchers tested adaptation's effect on input-response curves with signals having two or three peaks in amplitude, which infax and selective coding predict conflicting changes. Bayesian analysis quantifies measured curve shifts and finds reduced slopes with higher absolute thresholds than infax predictions. Contrary to infax, adaptation decreases encoded information across the input range. Response changes do not align with selective coding as loudest signal information does not increase but remains constant, while lower intensity signals transmit less.
Researchers investigated the role of polybasic domains in the prion protein (PrP) in the context of full-length cellular prion protein (PC) in prion propagation. They used prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sCA) reactions. After ∼5 rounds of sCA, prions lacking the central poly domain (Δ) were formed. Surprisingly, in contrast to wild-type prions, Δ-prions could bind and induce conversion of poly domain mutant substrates into pr molecules. Remarkably, Δ-pr and poly domain pr displayed diminished or absent biological infectivity relative to wild pr, despite seeding normal brain homogen sCA reactions. Δ-pr interact with PC through a novel mechanism, expanding substrate range and efficient pr propagation. Poly domain deficient pr provide first example dissociation between homogen sCA seeding from biological infectivity. Results suggest pr propagation may not depend single stereotypic mechanism, but PC interaction poly domains generate infectivity.
Researchers have developed an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) framework to identify animal behavioral strategies from time-series data. This framework was applied to Caenorhabditis elegans thermotactic behavior, where worms were cultivated at constant temperature with or without food. Fed worms preferred the temperature, while starved worms avoided it. The IR approach revealed that fed worms used both absolute temperature and its derivative in their behavior, employing two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). DM efficiently reached specific temperatures, explaining thermactic behavior in fed worms. IM moved along constant temperature, reflecting isothermal tracking observed in previous studies. In contrast, starved worms escaped temperature using only absolute, not derivative. The neural basis of these strategies was investigated by applying the method to thermosensory-deficient worms. The IR-based approach is useful for identifying strategies from behavioral data and can be applied to various studies, including decision-making in other organisms.
Researchers have sequenced the genome of Chrychromina tobin, a type of alga in the Prynes order, and analyzed its transcriptome over a 24-hour light-dark cycle. The genome is approximately 59 megabases in size, 40% of which is protein-coding, and encodes 16,777 genes. Genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct expression patterns over the circadian photoperiod. The genome harbors a hybrid polyketide synth/nonribosomal synthase complex, anti-microbial peptides, and multidrug efflux proteins, and a new algal xanthorhodin. Two RuBisCOases are also identified, shared across algal lineages.
Triple-negative breast cancers, which lack the clinical markers ESR1, PGR, and HER2, are classified as Basal-like subtype. Defective BRCA1 and p53 pathways are associated with both triple-negative and Basal subtypes. Mouse studies show that combined inactivation of BRCA and p53 pathways is sufficient to suppress mammary epithelial cell apoptosis. Concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant metastatic adenocarcinomas. Tumors are poorly differentiated and have histologic features common to human BRCA-mutated tumors, including metaplasia and necrosis. Gene expression analysis shows tumors share attributes of Bas-like and Claudin-low signatures, two subtypes encompassed by broader triple-negative class defined by clinical markers.
Aedes aegypt (L.) is the primary vector of dengue, a major arboviral infection globally. Until an effective vaccine is licensed and administered, Ae.egypt control remains crucial in preventing and curtailing deng transmission. Accurate predictions of vector populations are necessary for assessing control methods and developing population reduction strategies. Ae.egpt primarily develops in artificial water containers. Release studies indicate most Ae.egpt do not disperse long distances, suggesting containers in high-density areas are more likely oviposition sites and frequently used than isolated containers. Accounting for individual characteristics, frequently used oviposition containers produce adult mosquitoes at higher rates. Most Aeegpt population studies ignore spatial larval site density. Pupal surveys (2004-2007) in Kampha Phet, Thailand, 84,840 containers estimated parameters. Regression modeling assessed larval site density, access piped water, and seasonal on container productivity. Varying-coefficient model accounted for differences between container types. Hurdle model addressed zeroes and overdispersion in pupal counts. Suitable larval sites and density determined Aept distribution and abundance. Container productivity increased with habitat density. An ecological approach accounting site density is appropriate for Aept levels and vector programs.
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) plays a crucial role in mediating gut-to-brain signaling to regulate phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental cues and feeding state. During larval development, pheromone, food, and temperature regulate the expression of daf-7 TGF-β and daf-28 insulin-like peptides in sensory neurons, promoting a decision between reproductive growth and entry into the dauer larval stage. TOR2 acts in the intestine to regulate expression of daf-7 and d-28, reflecting bacterial-dependent feeding status, integrating food signals with external cues in neuroendocrine expression. In the adult, TOR2 modulates food-regulated foraging via PDF-2/PDF-1 neuropeptide-dependent pathway. Genetic variation affects food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with these traits are identified.
Researchers analyzed the transcriptional profiles of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and primordial germ cells to identify genes upregulated in pluripotent cells in vitro and in vivo. Genes involved in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair were enriched in pluripotent cells. A novel algorithm, Compoby, was developed to predict DNA motifs regulating gene expression by combining aligned and non-aligned sequences with a probabilistic model. Compoby identified conserved motifs in upregulated genes in pluripotent cells. These motifs were active in undifferentiated ES and embryonic germ cells in a sequence-specific manner, acting as enhancers with an endogenous promoters. Activity was conserved in human ES cells. Transcription factor NF-Y bound one motif, differentially expressed during ES differentiation and required for cell proliferation. This study provides insights into pluripotent transcriptional networks. The approach can be applied to mammalian species.
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a non-segmented, negative-strand RNA virus that relies on the nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) complex for replication. Researchers have characterized a soluble heterodimer complex between a variant of SV lacking 21 N-terminal residues (ΔN21) and a 60-amino acid peptide encompassing the molecular recognition element (Mo) of P that binds to RNA-free N. The complex crystallized in a decamer form was solved at 3.0 Å resolution, revealing how Mo folds upon binding to N and competes with RNA binding and polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR spectroscopy on the complex confirmed binding of Mo, indicating its flanking regions remain flexible. The structure suggests a mechanism for initiation of viral RNA synthesis.
Researchers have investigated the role of gap junctions, a type of electrical synapse, in the fly's visual system, specifically in the vertical system (VS), which processes visual information. The VS cells in this network primarily connect via axonal gap junctions, allowing for a unique exploration of gap junction's function in sensory processing. A theoretical analysis of a realistic VS model revealed that within 10 milliseconds of visual input onset, axonal gap junctions enable the system to efficiently encode the axis of rotation, θ, of the fly's motion. This efficiency, measured in bits, is near-optimal compared to physical limits set by visual input structure. The VS connects to downstream pathways through a subset of vertical cells; with axonal gap junctions, this subpopulation's encoding of θ is superior and robust to various signal-to-noise ratios. The subpopulation's efficient encoding is necessary for the fly's visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. Gap junctions formed among axons of vertical cells only impact system output, maintaining dendritic input, suggesting neural circuit principles may be richer than point models. The study shows how specific connectivity leads to efficient stimulus encoding.
Researchers have identified human-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) as a receptor for enterovirus 71 (EV) entry and replication in leukocytes. PS-1 is a sialoglycoprotein expressed on leukocytes, serving as a high-affinity counterceptor for selectins and mediating leukocyte rolling on endothelium. The PS-1-selectin interaction requires sulfation of at least one of three tyrosines and adjacent O-glycan sialyl Lewis in N-terminal of PS-1. To elucidate the molecular basis of PS-1-EV interaction, researchers generated PS-1 mutants and identified post-translational modifications critical for PS- binding to EV. PS-1 mutants were expressed in 293 cells and transfected cells assayed for abilities to bind EV by flow cytometry. O-glycosylation on T57, critical for PS-select interaction, was not necessary for PS binding to EV. Site-directed mutagenesis at one or more tyrosine sulfation sites in N-terminal PS significantly impaired PS binding to EV. Inhibitor of sulfation, sodium, chlorate, blocked PS-EV interaction and PS-mediated replication in Jurkat cells in dose-dependent manner.
Researchers investigated the therapeutic potential of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors in controlling Leishmaniasis, a global health problem affecting millions worldwide. Current treatments are limited by toxicity and emergence of resistant strains. TOR inhibitors have shown anti-parasitic properties. This study tested three TOR inhibitors, rapamycin, GSK-2128, and KU-0064, in BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania major. Footpad swelling and parasite burden were measured, along with cytokine production and lymph node cell changes. Rapamycin and G-212, but not K-4, reduced swelling and parasite load in lymph nodes. Rapycin did not kill promastigotes in vitro. IL-4 production was reduced in splenocytes from rapycin-treated mice, with increased IFN-γ:IL-4 ratio, indicating a Th1-skewed cytokine profile. CD69 expression was enhanced on splenic and node CD4 and CD8 T cells in rapycin-treated mice. These findings suggest TOR inhibitors may be used in leishias management, with immunomodulatory effects.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between the DNA uptake sequence (DUS) and its cognate receptor ComP during natural transformation in Neisser species. Transformation is a biological process where competent bacteria take up free DNA and incorporate it into their genomes, becoming genetically altered. To prevent deleterious transformation by foreign DNA, some species preferentially take up their own DNA containing specific DUS sequence marks. The study found Com to be the primary D receptor in Neisser species, enabling analysis of D-Com interdependence. Modulating Com levels in Neisser meningidis showed that D enhancement in presence is dependent on Com, also controlling transformation in absence of D. Peripheral D bases are less important, while inner bases are essential, as single mutations led to impaired Com interaction and transformation. Naturally occurring D variants in Neisser commals differing from D by one or two bases showed impaired transformation in Ne meningidis. Com from N sub commal specifically binds cognate D variant and mediates D-enhanced transformation in com mutant Ne meningidis, confirming mechanism used by Neisser to promote own or closely related DNA.
In fission yeast, cytokinesis, the coordinated closure of the contractile actomyosin ring (CAR) and formation of the septum are crucial for cell division. While many CAR proteins have been identified, the interaction between these proteins and septum enzymes to form the septum was unclear. This study shows that cooperation between Pxl, a paxillin homolog required for ring integrity, and B1, the enzyme for linear (1,3) glucan synthesis and septum formation, is necessary for CAR anchorage to the plasma membrane before septation and furrow formation. Pxl and B1 depletion causes ring failure and cell overgrowth without septum formation. Pxl concentration at CAR increases during cytokinesis, dependent on the SH domain of protein Cdc15. B1 depletion in cells with cdcΔ3 allele causes ring disassembly and sept block, as in Pxl lacking cells. Pxl absence is lethal with C15 affected, causing CAR sliding and septum deposition along cortex. Our findings indicate CAR anchorage through C15 and Pxl, concomitant B1 necessary for CAR and sept formation in yeast.
A recent outbreak of glanders, a zoonotic disease caused by the gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia malle, was investigated in Bahrain using high-resolution genotyping and whole-genome sequencing of B. malle isolates from infected horses and camels. The results were compared to samples from a 2004 outbreak in the United Arab Emirates and placed into a broader phylogeographic context based on published B. malle data. The Bahrain samples separated into two distinct clusters, indicating a complex epidemiological background and involvement of multiple B. malle strains. The Bahrain samples were more closely related to B. malle from the 2004 UAE outbreak than other B. m, suggesting repeated importation to the region from similar sources. High-resolution genotyping and whole-genome analysis revealed phylogenetic patterns among samples. The close relationship between UAE B. malle populations may indicate a shared geographic origin yet to be identified for infecting strains. The emergence of glanders in combination with global horse trading poses a risk for human infections.
A cross-sectional study was conducted on 43 patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) who did not respond to meglumine antiate treatment. The study aimed to characterize clinical and parasitological features of these patients. The majority of patients (95.4%) were infected with Leishmania braziliensis, with 35% showing decreased susceptibility to Glucime in vitro. Lesion size and infectivity were negatively correlated with Glime susceptibility (r=-0.548 and -0.726, respectively). A negative correlation was found between lesion size and parasite resistance. L. braziliensis was the main species associated with treatment failure or relapse. A second round of treatment with pentavalent ant derivatives for L. brazili is discussed.
Escherichia coli produces several iron-scavenging molecules, including siderophores (enterobactin, salochin, and yersabactin) and genotoxin colibact, which require 4- phosphopantin transferase (PT) for biosynthesis. Two PTases, EntD and Clb, have been identified, with Ent being part of the core genome and Clb encoded on a pathogenic island (pks) associated with high pathogenic island (H) in virulent strains. H carries yabact synthesis genes except cognate PT. This study investigated interplay between siderophore and colact biosynthesis through functional interchangeability between Ent and Clb. Clb contributes to siderore synthesis. Inactivating both Ent and Clb abolishes virulence in extraintestinal pathogenic (Ex) coli in mouse sepsis model, while either functional Ent or Clb is required for Ex survival in vivo. This is the first report of multiple PT pathways leading to distinct metabolites in a microorganism. The association of p with H has been selected in highly virulent coli because Clb is promisc PT contributing to genotoxin and siderore synthesis. Data highlight complex interaction of virulence features with functions.
Researchers have developed a probabilistic model for multiple sequence alignment that accounts for insertion and deletion events in addition to substitutions, given a phylogenetic tree, using a rate matrix augmented by a gap character. The model is based on a continuous Markov process and a non-reversible (birth-death) evolutionary model for insertions and deletions, assuming events occur one residue at a time. This model is applied to phylogenetic inference by extending the program DNAML in PHYL. The extended program, DNAMLε, improves accuracy relative to the usual approach ignoring gaps, while retaining the efficiency of the Felsenstein peeling algorithm. The model accounts for the probability of a multiple alignment given a phylogenetic tree and an evolutionary model describing sequences over time. Standard benchmark methods on simulated data and a new concordance test on ribosomal alignments show the extended DNAML outperforms the usual approach.
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection initiates immunity through a complex interactions between Langerh cells (LCs) and dermal dendritic cells (DCs) in the skin. Initially, HSV infects the mucosal epidermis before entering nerve endings. In mice, LCs are the first DCs to encounter HSV, but CD103+ dermal DCs carry viral antigens to lymph nodes for presentation, suggesting cross-talk in the skin. This study compares topically HSV-1 infected human skin explants biopsies with human genital herpes lesions, showing LCs are initially infected, then emigrate into the dermis. LCs bearing maturation markers and apoptosis form large clusters with BD3+ dermal DCs (equivalent to murine CD103 dermal DC) and DC-S+ macrophages. HSV-expressing LC fragments are observed inside dermal macrophages and BD3 dermal DC upregulate damaged receptor CLEC9. No epidermal cells interact with dermal DCs. LC isolated from human skin infected with HSV-1 in vitro undergo apoptosis and are taken by BD3 dermal DC and DC-S cells. A viral relay occurs where infected LCs undergo apoptosis and are taken by dermal DC for antigen presentation. This provides rationale for targeting these cells with mucosal or intradermal immunization.
Researchers investigated the formation and dynamics of parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with Leishmania major and Leishmania amazonensis amastigotes. They found that PVs containing one or two L. major amastigotes were tight-fitting, while those housing many L. amazonensis amastotes were giant. Using multidimensional imaging of live cells, they characterized PV biogenesis and remodeling in macrophages hosting L. major or L. amazon amastotes and loaded with Lysotracker, a lysosotropic fluorescent probe. Three features of L. major amastote-hosting PVs were observed: Lotracker entry within tight-fitting, fission-prone L. major PVs, decrease in macrophage vesicles during L. major PV fission L. amazon PV enlargement, and L amazon PV remodeling homotypic fusion. In contrast, L. amazon PVs exhibited different dynamics, including PV enlargement and homotypic fusion. Multidimensional imaging revealed Leish species-specific differences in PV biogenesis and remodeling, providing new insights for studying intracellular microorganisms.
Researchers investigated the role of chromatin structure in the use of homologous sequences as donors for homologous-directed repair in the chicken DT40 cell line. Immunoglobulin genes undergo sequence diversification through gene conversion templated by pseudogene donors. The immunoglobulin V pseudogene array is characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. The study demonstrated the importance of chrom structure in gene conversion using a regulatable system where heterochromatin protein HP1 (Drosophila melanogaster var205) was expressed as a fusion to Escheria coli repressor, tethered to polymerase operators within the pseudoλ donor. Tethered HP diminished histone acetylation within pseudoλ and altered the outcome ofλ diversification, favoring non-templated mutations over templated mutations. Chromatin structure regulates homolog-directed repair. Histone modifications may contribute to genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences.
Researchers investigated the role of the cerebellum in motor learning and error correction in a study using a saccadic paradigm. The cerebellum is responsible for adjusting motor behavior in response to changing situations, and it is thought to be guided by the difference between desired and actual behavior, or error. This error not only affects immediate behavior but also induces lasting changes in parallel synapses on Purkin cells (PCs), which mediate behavioral adjustments. Olivary climbing fibers, connecting PCs, are believed to transmit error information for synaptic modification but not contribute to memory. Contrary to this concept, the study found a clear spike signature of error at its occurrence and a reverberation of this signature later before new behavior manifestation to improve it.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective loss of motor neurons and inclusions containing the RNA-binding protein TDP-43. Researchers used a yeast model of ALS exhibiting TDP-43-dependent toxicity to investigate the protein's effects. Overexpression of TDP-43 significantly altered cell shape and increased ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of a reporter construct. However, overexpression of the Hsp chaperone S1 reduced T-43's effects on toxicity and proteolysis. The strength of these effects was influenced by the presence of the endogenous yeast prion [PIN+]. Overexpression of S1 altered T-43 aggregation, but no physical association between S1 and T-43 was detected, suggesting indirect effects on aggregation. Overexpression of the mammalian S1 homologue HSPB1 relieved T-43-mediated toxicity in primary rodent cortical neurons, indicating S1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS.
A study was conducted to investigate the parasite load and molecular diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in patients with chronic Chagas disease from different regions of Brazil. A total of 65 patients were recruited, with 35 (53.8%) testing positive for Trypanosoma cruz by real-time PCR, with 20 (30.7%) having the indeterminate form and 15 (23.1%) the cardiac form of the disease. The median parasite load for all positive patients was 2.54 [1.43-11.14] parasite equivalents/mL, ranging from 0.12 to 153.66. Notably, the load was higher in patients over 70 years old, with a median of 20.05 [18.29-86] parasite/mL. Using guanidine-ED blood spiked with T. cruzi strains, it was possible to genotype up to 0.5 parasite/mL with high specificity. Of patients with positive PCR, 28 (80%) were identified T. cruzi DT, while 20% had partial results. Specimens showed prevalence of Tc, TII, and mixed Tc+TII at 40%, 17.1%, and 14.3%, respectively. Two patients were infected with T and one with T+TIII, all in chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy stage, from Bahia region. T cruz genotypes compared to load showed elevated loads in TII (median 7.56 parasite/mL) compared to T (2.35/mL). However, CCC frequency was 50% in T and 16.7% in TII.
A study on rabies in bats was conducted in Guatemala between 2009 and 2011 as part of a larger pathogen detection program. A total of 672 bats from 31 species were sampled and tested for rabies. The prevalence of rabies virus (RV) detection was low at 0.3%. Viral antigens and infectious virus were isolated from the brains of two common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus). RV was also isolated from oral swabs, lungs, and kidneys of both bats, whereas viral RNA was detected in all tissues by heminested RT-PCR except the liver of one. Sequencing of the nucleoprotein showed both viruses were 100% identical, whereas glycoprotein sequencing revealed one nonsynonymous substitution (302T). The two vampire RV isolates were phylogenetically related to viruses associated with vampire bats in eastern Mexico and El Salvador. 7% of 398 sera from bats demonstrated RV neutralizing antibodies. The proportion of seropositive bats varied across troph guilds, suggesting intraspecific compartmentalization of RV perpetuation.
Researchers have investigated the role of lamin A-type proteins in herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication and heterochromatin modulation. Histone post-translational modification regulates chromatin structure and transcriptional activity, while the nuclear lamina is thought to maintain heterochatin and transcriptional silencing. The study examined HSV infection in wild-type and lamin-deficient (Lna/−) murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). In Lna− cells, viral replication compartments are reduced in size and fail to target the periphery as in wild-type cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence studies show HSV is associated with heterochatin in Lna− MEFs. Results suggest lamin A plays a role in viral expression, replication, and growth, with greatest effect on replication at low multiplicity of infection. Lamin/C is required for viral genome targeting and heterochatin reduction on promoters during lytic infection. The nuclear lamina serves as a scaffold for DNA and protein complexes regulating euchatin and heterochatin modifications.
Researchers have investigated the structure of the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex in hydrogenosomes, a metabolically anaerobic form of mitochondria found in the excavate Trichomonas vaginalis. The study aimed to determine whether the tripletore or twin-p structure is the generic form of TOM. The results show that the highly divergent β-bar T. vaginalis TOM (Tv)40 forms a translocation channel for hydrogenosomal protein import. Tv40 is present in high molecular weight complexes, consisting of four subunits. Two subunits, Tom36 and Tom46, have heat shock protein (Hsp) and tetratopeptide repeat (PR) domains and bind hydrogenosomal proteins, likely functioning as receptors. A third subunit, Tom22, has a short domain and conserved transmembrane segment but lacks a domain. The fourth sub, hydrogenosomal outer membrane 19 (Hom19) has no homology. Data indicate TvOM is associated with sorting and assembly (SAM) 50, involved in β-bar assembly. Electron microscopy revealed TvOM forms three pores with an unconventional shape. Although TvOM lacks Tom7, phylogenetic profiling predicts Tom7 in freeivingates. The study suggests the tripletore TOM, composed of conserved subunits, was present in the last eukary ancestor (LECA), while receptors for substrate evolved in eary lineages.
Researchers conducted a comparative eQTL analysis of CD4+ and CD8 T cells to investigate the pathogenic implications of autoimmune mechanisms. They found that inappropriate or inadequate activation of these cells contributes to the initiation and progression of multiple autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Genetic studies on disease-associated polymorphisms highlighted the importance of biological context for regulatory variants, particularly in understanding the immune system's regulation and cellular phenotypes. The study identified cell-specific regulation of transcript levels of genes associated with autoimmune diseases in CD+ and CD8 T cells, including a trans-regulatory locus on chromosome 12q13.2 containing the rs1017 SNP in the R26 gene. A missense variant in IL27 associated with type 1 diabetes resulted in decreased protein activity and reduced expression of IR1 and STAT in CD T cells. The results indicate eTL mapping in purified cells provides novel insights into polymorphisms and pathways associated with autoimmune diseases.
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, socio-economic factors hinder the uptake of screening and treatment for Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT). A qualitative study was conducted in Bandu and Kasa Oriental provinces, two provinces lagging in H elimination efforts, to understand these barriers. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were held with current and former H patients, healthcare providers, and program managers of the national H control program. Interviews and discussions were recorded and analyzed using ATLAS software. Participants mentioned post-treatment restrictions: no work, sex, no food, no sun exposure. Violating these is believed to cause severe, sometimes deadly complications. These prohibitions are well-known and lead some to avoid screening, fearing taboos upon diagnosis. Originally aimed to mitigate melarsol's adverse effects, they are not evidence-based and outdated with new drugs. Correct information on H treatment is essential. Providers should engage in dialogue with the community to address unintended meanings.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 45 villages of Al-Gisha locality, Eastern Sudan, to estimate the incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in the area. Médecins Sans Frontières diagnosed and treated patients with VL at Tabarak Hospital since 2009. Between May 5th and June 17, 2011, an exhaustive door-to-door survey was conducted in the villages. Deaths were investigated through verbal autopsies, and individuals with fever for at least two weeks, VL diagnosed in the previous year, and clinical suspicion of post-kala-azar dermal leishiasis (PKDL) referred to medical teams for ascertainment. A new VL case was a clinical with positive rk39 rapid test or direct agglutination test (DAT). In the 45 villages, 17,702 households were interviewed, for a population 94,369 inhabitants. The crude mortality rate over 409 days was 0.13/10,000 people per day. VL was possible or probable cause for 19% of deaths. VL-specific rate was 0.9/100 per year. Medical teams examined 551 individuals for fever at least two weeks, of which 16 diagnosed primary VL. Overall, VL incidence 7.0/100 persons year or 7.9/100 when deaths or due were included. 12.5% (11,943/95,609) population reported past VL episode.
Research on the rates of gyrase-catalyzed supercoiling and transcription elongation control in bacterial chromosomes reveals that the supercoiling density (σ) of prokaryotic DNA occurs in two forms: diffuse supercoiling (σD) and constrained supercoiling (σ). Diffuse supercoiling moves freely around the chromosome in 10 kb domains, while constrained supercoiling results from abundant proteins binding, bending, or unwinding DNA at sites. In Escherichia coli chromosomes exhibit a 15% higher level of supercoiling compared to Salmonella enterica. To investigate mechanisms changing diffuse supercoiling, a 9 kb supercoil sensor was inserted at 10 positions around the Salmonella genome, monitoring supercoiling and transcription rates in WT and mutant strains. Transcription caused supercoiling to increase upstream and decrease downstream of highly expressed genes. Excess supercoiling was relaxed by Topoisomerase I and gyrase replenished downstream superco to maintain equilibrium. Strains with gyrase mutations at permissive temperature exhibited superco losses from 30% of WT to total σ at most locations. Superco losses were influenced by transcription addition of rifampicin, causing superco to rebound throughout chromosome. Gyrase mutants causing super losses reduced transcription rates throughout genome. The link between RNA polymerase elongation speed and gyrase turnover suggests bacteria with fast growth rates generate higher superco than slow species.
Leishmania amazonensis, an intracellular protozoan parasite, replicates within parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) that share characteristics with late endosomes/lysosomes. During infection, PVs expand significantly, but the impact on parasite intracellular survival remains unclear. This study investigated the role of LYSTBeige, a regulator of lysosome size, in PV expansion and parasite growth. Results show that host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate LYSTige expression. Mutations in Lige caused PV expansion and enhanced L. amazonensis replication, whereas Lige overexpression led to small PV that did not sustain parasite growth. Treatment of Lige overexpressing cells with vacuolin reversed this phenotype, expanding PV and promoting growth. In contrast, E-64 reduced PV size in Lige mutant cells and inhibited amazonensis replication. Large PV appear to protect parasites from oxidative damage, as inhibition of nitric oxide synth had no effect on amazon viability within PV, but enhanced growth withinige small PV. Upregulation of Lige in infected cells functions as a host response to limit parasite growth by reducing PV and inhibiting intracellular survival.
Researchers investigated the pathophysiological mechanisms of Allan-Her-Dandy syndrome (AH), an X-linked psychotor retardation characterized by delayed development, intellectual disability, muscle hypotonia, and spastic paraplegia, and disturbed thyroid hormone (TH) parameters. Mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT) gene, a TH transporter, are associated with AH. MCT knockout mice replicated abnormal TH levels but not neurological symptoms. Zebraf were generated using zinc-finger nuc (ZFN)-mediated gene editing, eliminating MCT decreased TH receptors but not other TH-related genes. M larvae exhibited neurological and behavioral deficiencies. High-throughput assays showed reduced locomotor activity, altered light response, and increased sleep. Deficiencies associated with myelin and neuron formation. Time-lapse imaging revealed reduced filopodia, axon branching, and synaptic density in sensory and motor neurons. TH analogs restored myelin and axon growth in MCT-deficient larvae, suggesting MCT regulates neural assembly, mediating sensory and motor performance. Early TH analog administration may reduce neurological damage in AH patients.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread virus that primarily affects newborns and immunocompromised or immunosuppressed individuals. It infects various cell types using distinct entry pathways involving forms of the g/g glycoprotein: g/gL/g, gL, and g/UL-131, as well as the fusion glycoprotein B. The minimal core machinery for cell fusion is g/g and B. This study demonstrates that CMV B and g/g form a stable complex early in the absence of other proteins. g/g can interact with B mutants unable to mediate cell fusion. B-g/g complexes comprise up to 16-50% of total g in CM virus particles. In contrast, small amounts of g/gL and g/UL-131 complexes are associated with B. Herpesviruses express B and g/g molecules, with most models suggesting g interacts B to mediate membrane fusion. However, direct evidence is lacking. Herpes simplex (HSV-1) suggests after binding, g/g binds B either before or coincident with fusion. Our results contradict these models, showing CM B and g/g form stable B-g complexes in virions without receptor or membrane. Data supports the proposal that g interacts B.
Mitochondrial DNA (mt) sequence variants segregate in a tissue-specific manner, leading to varying disease onset and severity. The segregation of pathogenic mt mutations is a critical determinant of disease progression. Researchers used a heteroplasmic mouse model to investigate the role of Gimap, an outer mitochondrial GTPase, in leukocytes. Gimap was found to be crucial for cell development and survival, suggesting leukocyte survival as a key factor in regulating mt sequence variants and modulating mitochondrial diseases.
Buruli ulcer (BU) is a geographically-restricted infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, with endemic regions being the primary risk factor for disease acquisition. In Victoria, Australia, efforts to estimate the incubation period of BU are hindered as most patients reside in endemic areas. However, a significant proportion of cases are acquired by visitors to endemic regions. A study on the Bellarine peninsula estimated a mean incubation period of 4.5 months, followed by a decline in cases and emergence of a new endemic on the Mornington peninsula. A retrospective review of 443 BU cases in Victoria between 2013-2016 identified cases with visits to endemic regions, with incubation defined as time between exposure and symptom onset. Data were combined with earlier cases from 2002-2012. Among 20 short-term visitors, the mean incubation was 143 days (4.8 months), similar to 135 (4.5) days. No association was found between incubation and age, sex, location, exposure duration, or lesion location. The study confirms incubation of BU in Victoria to be 4-5 months, guiding clinicians and transmission mode in different regions.
Researchers have identified a protein in the Toxoplas parasite that is related to the human Niemann-Pick type 1 protein (NPC), which plays a crucial role in cholesterol regulation and lipid trafficking. The protein, named TCR1, shares significant sequence identity with NPC and contains residues implicated in human disease. Unlike mammalian NPC, TCR lacks endosomal targeting signals and localizes to flattened vesicles beneath the parasite's plasma membrane. When expressed in mammalian NPC mutant cells, TCR restores cholesterol and sphingolipid clearance from endosomes. To investigate TCR's role, researchers genetically disrupted the gene in Tooplas, resulting in viable parasites. Quantitative lipid analysis revealed normal cholesterol levels but overaccumulation of cholesteryl esters, sphingomyins, and ceramides. ΔCR parasites exhibit abundant lipid storage bodies and membranous tubules from parasitophorous vacuoles. These mutants replicate faster in vitro and are more virulent in mice than the parental strain.
Ophthalmic syndrome, also known as Waardenburg anophthalmia, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by eye malformations, including bilateral anophthalmia and postaxial oligodactyly. Homozygosity mapping and targeted mutation analysis identified a locus on chromosome 14q24.2, leading to homozygous mutations in the SMOC1 gene in eight unrelated families. Four mutations were nonsense, frameshift, and missense, with missense mutations located in the Thyrogulin-1 (T1) domain of the protein. The mouse ortholog, Smoc, exhibits stage-specific expression during eye, limb, craniofacial, and somite development. A targeted gene-trap mutation of Smoc (Sm1tm1) reduced mRNA to 10% of wild-type levels, resulting in highly penetrant hindlim postaxial oligodactly in homozyg mutant (Sm1/t1) animals. Eye malformations, including coloboma and cleft, occurred in a proportion of Sm1/t1 embryos and pups. Loss of Sm1 resulted in a convincing phenocopy of the disease. SM1 is a mammalian paralog of Drosophila Pentone, an inhibitor of decapentaplegic. The Xenopus lavis Sm1 functions as a Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) antagonist in early embryogenesis. Loss of BMP antagonism during mammalian development explains limb and eye phenotypes in humans and mice.
Researchers have discovered that the protein TRIM22 plays a crucial role in restricting HIV replication in human cells treated with Type 1 interferon. Through transcriptional profiling, they identified TR22 as one of the most upregulated genes in response to interferon treatment. Overexpression of TR22 inhibited HIV replication, consistent with previous studies. To investigate TR22's role under natural conditions, cells depleted of TR22 using RNAi showed increased HIV particle release, indicating TR22 acts as an antiviral effector. Further studies revealed TR22 inhibits budding of virus particles containing Gag, suggesting G is TR22's target. TR22 did not block MLV or EIA G particles. Inhibition associated with diffuse cytoplasmic staining of G rather than plasma membrane accumulation, indicating TR disrupts trafficking. Mutational analysis of TR22 showed catalytic amino acids Cys and Cys of RING domain required for TR22 antiral activity. These findings disclose a pathway by which Type 1 interferons obstruct HIV replication.
A study on the mutualism between figs (Ficus) and their pollinators (Agonidae wasps) reveals a mechanism that contributes to the stability of this relationship. Figs are pollinated by wasps whose larvae develop inside the fig's "fruits" (syconia). Female wasps oviposit directly into the fig's ovules from inside the sycon. Across fig species, there is a segregation of pollinators in inner ovules and seeds in outerules. This suggests wasps avoid or are prevented from ovipiting into outerules, resulting in mutualism stability. However, the mechanism preventing was from exploiting outerules was unknown. Research on Ficus rubosa found that outerules are vulnerable to parasitic wasps ovip from outside the sycon. Parasitism decreases towards the centre of sycon, where innerules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. The gradient in offspring viability likely contributes to selection on pollin to avoid outerules and forces was to focus on subset ofules, reducing galling rates. This mechanism may contribute to mutualism independently of plant defences against pollinator oviposition or physiological constraints on poll that prevent ovip in allules.
Researchers conducted six controlled growth trials on a recombinant inbred population of Setaria italica x Setaria viridis to investigate the genetic and environmental factors influencing plant height. Plant height was measured non-destructively throughout the life cycle in both field and controlled environments. The results showed that height was reduced under water limitation and high planting density, and affected by growth environment (field vs. chamber). Plant height was found to be a heritable, polygenic trait, with major loci influencing height independent of environment. The genetic loci contributing to height changed throughout development, and reduction in water-limited environments was due to delayed progression of the genetic program establishing height in Setaria. In this population, alleles from weedy S. viridis increased height, while domesticated S. italica alleles collectively increased height in later development.
In the Pantanal wetlands of western Brazil, a region known for its diverse wildlife and hematophagous arthropod populations, the circulation of zoonotic arboviruses is facilitated. A study in the Nhecolând sub-region of Pantanal found serological evidence of flaviviruses, including West Nile virus and Ilus virus (ILHV). Seropositive horses indicated that at least three flaviviruses, including IL, circulated in the Pantanal between 2005 and 2009. To further investigate, 3,234 adult mosquitoes of 16 species were collected in 2009 and 201 in the same region. Mosquito homogenates were assayed for virus on C/36 and Vero cellolayers and tested for flaviral RNA by group-specific real-time RT-PCR. One pool of 50 engorged female Aedes aegypti tested positive for IL by culture and for IL RNA by real RTPCR, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 100. Full genomic sequence exhibited 95 identity to the only available IL sequence. The study confirms IL circulation in the Pantanal.
Researchers conducted a preclinical study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of single-dose ivermectin (MO) compared to two-dose ivermectin (IVM) in a porcine scabies model. Scabies is a common dermatological condition affecting millions globally, with limited treatment options and emerging resistance to current treatments. MO has a more favorable pharmacological profile, making it a potential alternative. Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to receive MO (0.3mg/kg once), IV (0.2mg twice), or no treatment. Efficacy was assessed by mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and ELISA-determined anti-S scieiG antibodies. Plasma and skin pharmacokinetic profiles were determined. At day 14 post-treatment, all MO-treated pigs were mite-free, while only two IV-treated were. MO efficacy was 100% and unchanged until study-end (47), compared to 62% (26-100) for IV, with one IV-treated remaining infected until 47. Clinical scabies, pritus, and anti scieiG had disappeared in MO-treated but 75 IV-treated. MO persisted 9 times longer in plasma and skin, covering mite life and enabling long-lasting efficacy.
Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive pathogen known for its antibiotic resistance and hospital prevalence, has a minimal peptoglycan (PG) synthesis machine composed of 9 proteins, fewer than other model organisms. Researchers deleted 7 genes encoding PG enzymes from the S. aureus genome without affecting growth or morphology, creating a strain with PG synthesis catalyzed by 2 penicillin-binding proteins, PBP1 and bi-functional P2. This strain was susceptible to cell-target antibiotics, host enzymes, and impaired virulence in Drosophila infection dependent on peptoglycan receptor, PGRP-SA. S. aureus can grow with only 2 active synthesizing enzymes, indicating redundancy in vitro. However, in clinically relevant environments, PG enzymes play a role in pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance.
Burkholderia pseudallei is a saprophytic bacterium that can infect humans, causing meloidosis, a difficult-to-manage disease. Despite proper diagnosis and treatment, mortality rates remain high, ranging from 20% in Australia to 40 in Thailand. Little is known about how B. pseudalle infects, invades, and survives within hosts, and the role of nutrients like iron in its pathogenesis. It was assumed B. pseudalle used iron-acquisition systems found in other bacteria, such as siderophores. However, a clinical isolate with a chromosomal deletion of the malleact gene, encoding its major-affinity siderore, was still virulent in murine meloid model, suggesting other iron-acquisition systems contribute to virulence. This study deleted major siderore malleact (m) and pyelin (p) clusters in strain 171b, revealing residual siderore activity unrelated to known Burkia siderores cepact and cepachelin, not due to chelators like citrate. Deletion of hem uptake loci hmu and hem showed hmu required for hem and hem utilization, and could not complement hmu deficiency. Prolong incubation h hem mutant in hemoglobin medium yielded variants able to utilize hem and hem, suggesting alternate pathways for these sources. Lacterrin utilization depended on malleact, not pyelin synthesis/uptake. A pchmu h hem quadruple used ferritin as source, and was lethal in acute murine meloid model. Data suggest B pseudalle employ ferritin-iron pathway to sustain in vivo growth.
Genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models (GSMs) provide comprehensive representations of cellular function, but their usability is often hindered by inconsistencies, particularly in concurrent models. To address this issue, a tool called COMM (Consensus Metabolic Model GENeration) was developed to identify and automatically resolve inconsistencies between models, thereby consolidating knowledge of metabolic function. COMM uses a semi-automated approach to reconcile differences between models, resulting in more accurate and predictive consensus models. Tests of COMM on four organisms showed that automatically generated models were predictive and increased coherence of representation. The tool is particularly useful for complex scenarios where manual curation does not scale, such as eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions.
Researchers have discovered that cartilage matrix plays a crucial role in regulating the timing of endochondral ossification, the process by which cartilage is replaced by bone tissue. They used zebraf mutants to study the interaction between cartilage and the perichond, the layer of tissue surrounding bone, and found that cartilage inhibits cartilage maturation, which in turn affects the timing of perichond development. A genetic screen identified two genes, famb and xylosyltransferase1 (xt), responsible for producing proteoglycan (PG) synthesis in cartilage and perichond. Mutants lacked normal levels of chroit sulfate PG, a key component of cartilage, and developed perichral bone earlier than wild-type siblings. Primary cartilage defects led to bone formation due to premature cartilage maturation, marked by increased expression of runx2, collagen 10, and ihh. Ultrastructural analysis showed aberrant matrix and cellular features of cartilage hypertrophy in mutants. This study refines previous findings that famb and xyl1 are involved in PG synthesis, revealing their role in cartilage production and timing of skeletal development.
Researchers investigated the role of Topoisomerase II (Top) in the separation of heterochromatic regions during meiosis in Drosophila melanogaster females. Heterochromatic homology ensures the segregation of achias chromosomes during meiosis I by connecting achmate homologs during prometaph I. The study found that knockdown of Topoisomerase II by RNA interference (RNAi) in later stages of meiosis resulted in defects in the separation of heterochromatic regions after spindle assembly. In Top2 RNA-expressing oocytes, heterromatic regions of achias and chias chromosomes failed to separate during prometaph and metaphase, forming long, abnormal projections with centromeres at the tips. Despite this, bipolar spindles formed in Top RNA-express oocytes, but achias chromosomes failed to move towards the poles during promaph. Bothias and chias chromosomes displayed orientation defects. Euchromatic regions separate earlier in prophase, no defects were observed in euchromatic separation upon Top knockdown at midphase. Embryos from Top RNA-express females failed to initiate mitotic divisions.
Researchers conducted a field study to evaluate the effectiveness of using deltamethrin-impregnated collars as a public health measure to prevent canine visceral leishmaniasis (CV) in a highly endemic area. The study took place in two areas in the district of Monteordo, Bahia, Brazil: an intervention area where seropositive dogs were collared and a control area with conventional CV control measures. At baseline, seropitive dogs were removed and serative dogs included. Dogs were reevaluated every 7-8 months for two years. In the intervention area, serative dogs received new collars and newly serative dogs were collared. Authorities were notified of seropitive dogs in both areas, which were euthanized as mandated by the Ministry of Health. The first serological survey showed similar serence in both areas. The second evaluation showed significant reductions in serence in both areas, with 6.0% in the intervention and 11.0 in the control. The relative risk (RR) indicated protection against CV in the intervention. CV incidence did not differ between areas, but increased in the control, possibly due to low serconversion or loss to follow-up. The effectiveness of deleth-impregnated collars as a community control was inconclusive, but likely provides protection over time.
Researchers investigated the notion that the biased gene content on the mammalian X chromosome is shaped by limitations on gene expression due to haploid expression. They analyzed data from the Encyclopedia of DNA (ENCODE) and Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANT5) projects. The study found that maximal expression of X-linked genes is lower than autosomal genes, with average expression three times lower on the X chromosome than autosomes. Autosome-to-X retrotransposition events are associated with lower maximal expression of retrogenes on X than X-to-autosome retrogenes autosomes. X-linked genes have lesser increase in expression than autosomal ones compared to the human-chimpanzee ancestor if highly expressed, but not lowly expressed. The "traffic jam" model explains lower breadth of expression for genes on X and Z chromosomes, as broad expression is associated with high expression. Highly tissue-specific genes are rare on X, while broadly expressed genes on X tend to be lowly expressed, indicating maximal level shapes expression not breadth. Limit to maximal expression explains biased tissue profiles of X-linked genes. Tissue-specific genes highly expressed (e.g. secretory, structural) are in gene rare on X. Trends cannot be accounted for by alternative biased expression models. The study supports the notion that it's hard for genes on X to be highly expressed due to transcription jams, providing a rationale for X's gene content, expression, and evolution.
Recent studies suggest that both anatomically modern humans and the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori originated in Africa and have been associated for at least 100,000 years. Seven geographically distinct H pyl populations exist, three of which are indigenous to Africa: hp1, hp2, and hpAfrica. The oldest and most divergent population, hp2, evolved within hunter-gatherers who represent one of the deepest branches of the human tree. This study investigated the prevalence and population of H pyl within Baka Pygmies in Cameroon. Gastric biopsies were obtained from 77 Baka from two geographically separated populations and 101 non-B individuals from neighboring agricultural populations and cultured for pyl. Unexpectedly, Baka Pyies showed a lower pyl infection rate (20.8%) than non-B (80.2%). Multilocus haplotypes were generated for each pyl isolate by DNA sequencing, but no B-specific lineages were identified, and most were assigned to hpAfrica or hp1. hpAfrica, a marker for the expansion of the Nilo-Saharan family, was divided into East and West African subpopulations, and hp1, mainly among Cameroonians, supports eastern and western Bantu expansions. An-structured model shows the pyl prevalence among B Pyies is achievable within a few hundred years, suggesting demographic factors such as small size and low expectancy lead to pyl eradication from human populations. B were either pyl-free or lost lineages during past fluctuations. Coalescent simulations and phylogen inference show Py almost certainly acquired pyl through contact with agricultural neighbors.
Dengue virus NS5 (NS5) is a highly conserved non-structural protein responsible for capping methylation and replication of the flavivirus genome. NS interacts with host proteins modulating immune responses. Unlike other flaviviruses, DENV2 NS localizes to the nucleus during infection with unclear role in replication or pathogenesis. This study examined NS of DENV1 and 2, which differ in nuclear localization, using functional and structural analyses. Gene swapping between DENV 1 and 2 NS identified the C-terminal 18 (C18) residues as sufficient to direct protein to cytoplasm or nucleus. Low micromolar binding between NS C18 and importin-alpha (Imp) allowed complex purification and crystallization at 2.2 Å resolution using x-ray crystallography. Structure-guided mutational analysis of GFP-NS clones D1 or 2 and D2 revealed residues for NS subcell localization. Notably, proline 884 allows Imp binding and mutating to Thr, present in D1 NS, mislocalizes NS to cytoplasm without virus fitness. Mutation to alanine at position 888, conserved in flaviviruses, resulted in non-viable virus, while R888 mutation led attenuated phenotype. R forms hydrogen bond with 838 conserved flavir. Data suggests evolutionarily conserved function C18, possibly RNA interactions critical replication, independent subcell localization.
Researchers have developed and field-tested an integrated mapping protocol, called the Integrated Threshold Mapping (IT) Methodology, to control and eliminate neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) such as lymphatic filariasis (LF), trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths (STH). The protocol is designed to be resource-efficient and determine whether a threshold for public health interventions has been attained in a unit. It relies on World Health Organization (WHO) recommended indicators for disease-specific age groups. The sampling frame was district for LF, trach, and schosiasis, but sub-district for schosias. The protocol was tested by comparing it to current WHO methodologies for each disease in one district in Mali and Senegal. Results were compared in terms of public health intervention and feasibility, including cost. The IT methodology reached the same conclusions as WHO regarding initiation of public interventions for trach, LF, and STH, but resulted in more targeted recommendations for schias. It was practical and demonstrated cost-effective compared to standard, non-integrated WHO methodologies. The integrated tool could facilitate implementation of programs in endemic countries.
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the conserved phosphatase Cdc14 is required for exit from mitosis and is anchored to nucleolar chromatin by the C1/Net protein until anaphase. Two pathways, FEAR (C fourteen early release network) and MEN (mitotic exit network), redundantly promote C14 release. Analysis of genetic interactions reveals a novel requirement for ubiquitination of histone H2 by Bre1 ubiquitin ligase in cycle-dependent release of C14 from nucleolar chrom when MEN is inactivated. Histone H2 ubiquination is mediated by activation of histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 (H3K4 and H3K79) but not histone deacetylase (HD) Sir2, which associates with C14 on nucleolar chrom as part of RENT. Defects in C14 release observed in cells lacking H3 lysine methylation (H36) and cells lacking HD recruited by this modification. These histone modifications represent unappreciated factors for accessibility and/or action onolar chrom of FEAR components.
Researchers have developed a new computational framework called GeneProgram to identify and characterize functional gene expression programs in human cells. These programs are sets of co-expressed genes that orchestrate normal or pathological processes. The challenge in discovering these programs lies in cellular heterogeneity within samples, genetic variation across samples, uncertainty in the number of programs and populations, and temporal behavior. GeneProgram uses Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes to address these challenges, organizing tissues and genes into overlapping programs with consistent behavior. It produces maps of expression, sorted by generality scores, which exploit learned groupings. Using synthetic and real data, Gene outperformed popular analysis methods. Gene was applied to a compend of 62 time-series expression datasets on human responses to infectious agents and immune-modulating molecules. It produced a map of 104 programs, many enriched for genes in key pathways and NF-κB transcription factors. Gene discovered programs implicating surprising pathways, including Wnt and neurotransmitter receptors in response to infection.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) drives epigenetic imprinting of the IFNG locus in NKGChi natural killer cells. Memory 1 helper T (TH) cells are characterized by stable interferon (IF-γ) expression and epigenetic imprinting of the IFNG locus. Innate cells, natural killer (NK) cells play a crucial role in defense against CMV and are a main source of IF-γ. Recent studies show memory-like features in NK subsets after CM infection. However, mechanisms underlying NK adaptive properties are not defined. This study demonstrates NKGChi NK cells in CMV seropositive individuals undergo epigenetic remodeling of IF conserved non-coding sequence (CNS) 1, similar to CD8+ T or TH1 cells. CNS accessibility enhances IF transcription activity in response NKG2 and 2, leading to IF production in NKG NK cells. Data identify epigen imprint of IF locus as hallmark and mechanism driving stable IF expression in CM-specific NK expansions, providing basis for regulation in innate cells.
Legionella pneumophila exploits the host proteasome to temporally regulate the function of a cognate effector protein. The bacterium secretes numerous effector proteins into eukaryotic cells to coordinate cellular processes important for infection. Temporal regulation is crucial for modulating distinct activities of effectors at different stages of infection. A novel effector, designated "metaeffector", has been identified, which regulates the function of another effector within the host. The Legionella protein Lub functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase, hijacking the host proteasome to target the bacterial effector Sid for degradation. Delayed delivery of Lub to the cytoplasm leads to shutdown of Sid within host cells at later stages of infection. This demonstrates a sophisticated level of coevolution between eukotic cells and L pneumila involving an effector that temporally coordinates the function of a cognate protein.
This study investigated the diversification of HIV-1 env sequences in 81 early infections resulting from single or closely related viruses, allowing for accurate estimation of the infecting virus sequence and direction of substitutions and insertions/deletions. Integrating data from multiple hosts revealed adaptive evolution of HIV-1 env and identified 24 rapidly diversifying codons, 14 of which were clustered in CTL epitopes verified by HLA or nucleotide context indicative of APOB-mediated G-to-A substitutions, excluding hypermutated sequences. Rapidly evolving sites were embedded in APOEC and CTL, suggesting APO facilitates early escape. Ten sites remained unexplained by CTL or APO hypermutation, including the most mutated site in gp41. Insertions/deletions in hyperviable regions of envelope glycoprotein were due to selection, not mutational hotspots. The study provides a detailed view of HIV-1 diversification following transmission, highlighting CTL and APO roles in shaping evolution during new infections.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study epigenetic silencing in yeast, focusing on molecular interactions within the system. The model identifies essential epigenetic marks for bistability of epigen states, incorporating two key chromatin marks: H4 acetylation and H methylation. The presence of multiple marks leads to qualitatively different behavior. Both modifications are crucial for epigen silencing robustness. The model predicts a novel bivalent state, with both active and silenced marks under certain perturbations, such as mutations or enzymatic inhibition. This bivalent state is stable under perturbations and results in patchy silencing. Titration, due to limited silencing protein supply, leads to counterintuitive responses. The model investigates silencing design and assesses experimental observations within a framework. Specifically, it examines Sir protein recruitment, spreading, and silenced regions in mutants (e.g., s2,1), clarifying Dot role in yeast silencing biology.
A study was conducted to investigate the gut microbiota (GM) composition in children hospitalized with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in Uganda. SAM is a significant health issue in developing countries, manifesting as edemat and non-edemat forms, with edemat being the more severe form known as kwashiork. The pathogenesis of both forms is unknown, but GM dysbiosis has been linked to edemat malnutrition. The study aimed to assess GM differences between Ugandan children with edemat and non-ed malnutrition. Fecal samples were collected from 87 children aged 6-24 months with SAM. Total DNA was extracted, followed by PCR and Denaturing Gradient Electrophoresis (DGGE) and 16S rRNA-targeted high-throughput sequencing. Alpha and beta diversity measures were determined with ANOVA and relative abundance test. Results showed GM differed between groups by DG (p=0.031) and high-throughput sequencing, with non-ed children having lower GM diversity (p=0.036). However, beta analysis did not reveal differences between GM with edemat and non-ed SAM (ANOS, weighted UniR=-0.008, p=0.584; unweighted UniR=0.071, p=0.011). Non-ed children had lower GM diversity than ed children, but compositional differences were not identified.
Researchers investigated telomere length variation in 112 wild-type Saccharomyces sensu stricto isolates and found extensive variation in telomere length, with a correlation to geographic origin. European isolates had short telomeres (<150bp), while American isolates had longer telomeres (>400bp). Insertion of the URA gene near telomeres allowed analysis of individual telomere lengths and telomere position effect (TPE). Crossing American and European strains resulted in F1 progeny with a continuum of telere lengths consistent with multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL) involvement. Variation in TPE was weakly correlated with telere length. Genotyping F1 segregants identified several QTL associated with telere length and silencing variation, including candidate genes and regions without known telom properties. Transgressive segregation was detected for both phenotypes. Reciprocal hemizygosity validated YU and TLC as telere QTL in S paradox subpopulations. Sequence divergence within Ku80 generated negative epistasis in allelic combinations (American-YU and EuropeanU) resulting in short telomeres.
Researchers investigated the cognitive and neural processes underlying human decision-making by examining when and how people choose, not just what they choose. Sequential sampling models (SSMs) have advanced the field by assuming decisions emerge from a bounded accumulation process, making response times (RTs) predictable. However, these models fail when individuals are not forced to respond immediately but allowed to sample sequentially, as the decision-maker may delay choice and terminate the process, unaccounted for by standard SS approach. New SS models predicting RTs from electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies were developed. Participants bought or rejected fictitious stocks based on sequentially presented cues, free to respond at any time. Standard SS did not adequately describe RT distributions, but adding a mechanism for postponing decisions improved fit. Time-frequency EEG analysis revealed alternating states of de- and increasing oscillatory power in beta frequencies (14-30Hz), indicating responses prepared and inhibited, supporting decision to not decide. The extended model accounted for adapted paradigm where participants pressed button for more information. Results demonstrate computational modeling decisions and RT support understanding hidden cognition dynamics.
Researchers identified a genetic mutation in the SUVH2 gene in Labrador Retrievers with Hereditary Nasal Parakeratosis (HN), a rare autosomal recessive skin disorder characterized by crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 13 HN cases and 23 controls revealed a strong association on chromosome 2 (p=4.4×10-14). Haplotype analysis defined a 1.6 Mb interval with 25 genes. Resequencing of one case genome at 38 coverage detected 3 non-synonymous variants in the interval. Genotyping these variants in larger cohorts identified one associated with HN in over 500 dogs. The causative variant is a missense in SUVH encoding histone lysine 9 (H3) methyltransfer, mediating chromatin silencing. The c.972G>T variant changes conserved asparagine to lysine in catalytically active domain (p.NK). Histopathological studies in vivo suggest HN not caused by hyperproliferation, but delayed differentiation of kerocytes. Data provide evidence SUVH involved in epigen regulation of kerocyte ensuring stratification and sealing mammalian epidermis.
Researchers investigated the emergence of transmissible reassortant viruses in swine during co-infection with avian and swine influenza A viruses (IAV). Reassort between IAVs is a key factor in the emergence of pandemic strains, and sw are proposed as a "mixing vessel" for generating reassortants of avian and mammalian IAV that pose a risk to mammals, including humans. The study analyzed 571 isolates from nasal wash and respiratory tract samples of co-housed pigs (influenza-negative, av H1N1 IAV-infected and sw H3 IAV-infected pigs) identified 30 distinct genotypes of reassortant viruses. Viruses from lower respiratory tissues had the largest genomic diversity, while those from turbinate and nasal fluids had the least. Reassants from lower tracts showed largest variations in growth in respiratory epithelial cells, and temperature in sw nasal cells selected the type of reassant shed by pigs. One reassant in nasal samples was consistently found in upper, middle, and lower tracts, and was efficiently transmitted between pigs. Findings suggest that during av and sw I co-infections, reassort occur in lower tracts, and tropism is a factor for transmissible reassant.
A study was conducted to investigate the effects of prazantel treatment of Schistosoma mansoni during pregnancy on the prevalence and immune responsiveness of offspring to Schistoma infection at age five years. The study used data from a trial (ISRCT32847) in Uganda, where offspring of women treated with prazantel or placebo during pregnancy were examined for Schoma infection and cytokine and antibody responses to SWA and SEA, as well as T cell expression of FoxP at age five. Of 134 children examined, 32 (2.4%) had Schoma infection at five years based on a single stool sample. Infection prevalence did not differ between children of treated or untreated mothers. Cytokine (IFγ, IL-5, IL-10 and IL-13) and antibody (Ig, Ig and IgE) responses to SW and SEA, and FoxP expression were higher among infected than uninfected. Prazel treatment of Schoma during pregnancy had no effect on responses, with exception IL-10 to SW which was higher in offspring of women received prazel during pregnancy than those did. No evidence found that Schoma infection and treatment during pregnancy influence prevalence and intensity Sch infection or effector response Sch infection offspring five years, but observed IL-10 SW suggest Schoma and treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoreg responsiveness childhood schos.
Macrophages play a crucial role in the clearance of pathogens following an infectious challenge. However, the relationship between macrophage activation and clearance remains poorly understood. This study reveals that inflammatory stimuli induce a reprogramming of the macrophage endocytic machinery, shifting from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macinocytosis, allowing for rapid transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes in a receptor-independent manner. This reprogramming is mediated by protein C-mediated phosphorylation of macrophage protein coronin 1, activating phosphoinositol (PI)-3-kinase necessary for macinocytic uptake. Expression of a phosphomim form of coron 1 is sufficient to induce PI-kin activation and macinocytosis in the absence of inflammatory stimuli.
Researchers conducted a qualitative study in Arua District, North Uganda to assess community acceptance of tset baits (insecticide-treated targets) in areas where tset control had not been previously conducted. The study aimed to understand knowledge and perceptions of tse baits in villages where they were being deployed for the first time. Focus group discussions were held with 16 male and female participants in eight villages across Arua District, with discussions recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis was used to compare views of both groups and identify salient themes. Villagers who had never seen baits before expressed fear and anxiety, associating them with witchcraft and "ghosts from the river", linked to illness, death, and misfortune. In contrast, villagers in areas where ba had been used previously had positive attitudes and were aware of their purpose and benefits. They reported similar negative perceptions when tset control started a decade ago. Results show acceptance varies between villages, related to duration of experience with tset programs. Success of community-based interventions against tset depends on community engagement and sensitization, especially in areas new to interventions.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive study on the recombination landscapes of Drosophila melanogaster, a species of fruit fly, to investigate the fundamental biological process of recombination and its implications on evolution. They analyzed 5,860 meioses, genotyping 139 million SNPs and mapping 106,964 recombination events at a resolution of 2 kilobases. This allowed for the creation of whole-genome maps of crossing over (CO) and gene conversion (GC) recombination, as well as detailed variation in recombination among individuals. The study found extreme and punctuated variation in CO rates along chromosomes, with hotspots and coldspots, and intra-specific variation associated with hotspots at low frequency. Gene conversion rates were more uniformly distributed across the genome, detectable in regions with reduced or absent CO. At local scale, recombination events were associated with sequence motifs, occurring within transcript regions, suggesting chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. The study highlights the importance of accounting for recombination variation across and among individuals in population genetic analyses to assess selection and linkage.
Researchers have identified ID2 (ID2) as a component of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) machinery in Arabidopsis thalian, but its function in RDM remained unclear. Through affinity purification of ID2, they co-purified two ID paralogs, ID1 and ID2 (ID PARAL1 and 2). The coiled domain between the XS and X domains of ID2 is essential for ID homodimerization, while the ID C-terminal X domain but not coiled domain is required for ID interaction with ID1 and ID2. Complementation testing with wild-type ID2 and mutated derivatives in the id2 mutant showed that the uncharacterized ID X domain is required for ID-ID1/ID2 formation and function. ID1 is required for de novo methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional silencing, while ID2 has overlapping roles with ID1. Unlike ID, ID and ID are incapable of double-stranded RNA binding, suggesting different roles in the ID-ID/ID complex and essential for functioning RDM.
Researchers investigated the interaction between neutrophils and Leishmania braziliensis, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. Neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens and are rapidly recruited to sites of infection. Infection with L. braziliensis led to a significant depletion of neutrophils, increasing parasite load. However, co-culturing neutils with L. brazili had the opposite effect, inducing parasite killing. The study focused on neutil response to L. brazili, exploring activation and apoptotic fate. Inoculation of serum-opsonized L. braziliastigotes in mice induced neutil accumulation in vivo, peaking at 24 hours. In vitro, exposure of thioglyateelic inflammatory bone marrow neutils to Lili modulated expression of surface molecules CD18 and CD62, and induced oxidative burst. Using mCh-expressing Lili, effects were mainly observed in infected not bystander cells. Neutil activation with Lili was confirmed by release of TN-α and neutilase. Neutils infected Lili but not L major displayed markers of early apoptosis. Lili induces neutil recruitment in vivo and neutils exposed to parasite in vitro through activation and release of inflammatory mediators, impacting parasite elimination at early stages of infection.
Bovine tuberculosis (TB) vaccination is not currently used in international control programs, including the EU, due to interference with the tuberculin skin test, used to determine TB-free status. New diagnostic tests, Differentiated Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIV), offer potential for vaccination introduction in eradication programs. Using herd transmission models from Great Britain (GB), the feasibility of supplemental vaccination is explored. The economic impact of bovine TB on farmers is dominated by testing and movement restrictions costs. Farmers' willingness to adopt vaccination requires reduced infection burden and restriction risk. In GB, the DIV test specificity, not sensitivity, is the barrier to herd benefit vaccination. Relaxing testing could mitigate negative effects, but increase hidden infection in TB-free herds. Models explore DIV characteristics for herd benefit vaccination. A DIV specificity of 99.85% and sensitivity >40% is required for benefit with no increased risk. Data from infected animals suggest a cocktail of DIV antigens can achieve 99.85% specificity and 73.3% sensitivity (61.9, 82.9%) relative to post-mortem detection.
Researchers have identified a new class of compounds called dihydroben[e][1,4]azin-2(H)ones that exhibit anthelmint activity against the parasitic worm Trichuris, which infects over 500 million people worldwide, causing physical and educational damage. Trichuris mur, a model for T. trichi, was used to screen a library of 480 drug-like molecules for paralysis of adult parasites, leading to the identification of dihydroben[e1,4]azin-2(H)ones. Further screening and synthesis of related compounds resulted in 20 active dihydrobenoxazinones, not previously implicated in nematode control, with EC50 values around 25-50μM, comparable to existing anthelmint levamis. These compounds showed low cytotoxicity against murine epithelial cells, demonstrating selectivity for the parasite. A novel oral treatment for a neglected disease is challenging, but dihydroazepin O029 reduced embryonated T. mur eggs ability to establish infection in mouse in vivo, complementing development as an oral anthint. This supports an alternative strategy of a therapeutic acting in environment, via spray, interrupting parasite lifecycle. Results show dihydroazinones as new anthint against both egg and adult Trichis stages, demonstrating selectivity and scope for optimisation to improve potency and pharmacokinetic for clinical agent.
Researchers have revisited the concept of "date" and "party" hubs" in protein-protein interaction networks, where "date" hubs" have low co-expression with their partners and "party" hubs have high-expression. Initially, it was proposed that "party" hubs are local coordinators and "date" are global connectors. However, this study found that the importance of "date" hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a small subset of them, which do not display low expression, contradicting the idea of a link between quantity and function. The date/party distinction was motivated by a bimodal distribution of co-expression, but this feature is not robust to methodological changes. Topological properties of hubs do not correlate with co-expression, but there is a significant correlation between centrality and functional similarity of interacting proteins. The study suggests that thinking in terms of date/party dichotomy for protein networks is not meaningful and it may be more useful to consider roles-protein interactions rather than individual proteins.
Researchers have developed methods to reconstruct transmission trees of infectious diseases from whole genome sequences, but a limitation is the need for genetic diversity to occur on epidemiological timescales. The position of individuals in a transmission tree can only be resolved if mutations have accumulated between pathogen genomes. To compare genetic diversity in outbreaks, the concept of "transmission" is introduced, defined as the number of mutations separating sequences from transmission pairs. Literature values were used to simulate scenarios with sequence evolution models to describe transmission of major pathogens. Results show that mean transmission varies between pathogens, but is generally low, with many outbreaks having genetically identical pairs. The impact of transmission on reconstruction was tested with tools R and phy, demonstrating that rapidly evolving pathogens like viruses provide information on individual events. Conversely, pathogens with lower transmission, such as Streptoccus, Shigella, and Clostrid, provide little to no information. This highlights limitations of genetic data in certain scenarios and the need to expand tools to integrate other epidemiological data.
Researchers investigated the process of X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammals, where one X chromosome is silenced, but some genes escape silencing. They analyzed allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells with skewed X inactivation using single nucleotide polymorphisms. A binomial model showed a continuum between complete silencing and expression from the inactive X chromosome (Xi). RNA-seq results were verified with RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Common and tissue-specific genes were identified, which may contribute to sex differences. Only 3-7% of genes escape CI in mouse tissues, indicating strict silencing control. In contrast, embryonic kidney-derived Pki cell line showed 21% escape, representing kidney-specific and cell-specific genes. Allele RNA polymerase II and DNase hypersensitivity at Xi promoters correlated with escape, suggesting open chromatin structure. Alle CTCF binding on Xi was denser in brain compared to Pki cell, possibly due to compartmentalized Xi structure and fewer brain escape genes compared to cell with larger domains.
Researchers have characterized a novel cysteine protease, Plasmod viv-4 (VXV-4), from the malaria parasite Plasmod vivax. This protease is involved in maintaining parasite homeostasis and egress from the host erythrocyte. Unlike its orthologs in Plmod falcum, VX-2 and VX-3, VX-4 exhibits differential substrate specificity and pH-dependent activity. Recombinant VX-4 hydrolyzes benzyloxycarbonyl-Le-Arg-ethyl-m-cmary-7-amide (Zu-ArgCA) and Z-Arg-MCA at acidic pH 5.5, whereas Z-Arg-MCA at neutral pH 6.5-7.5.5. VX- prefers positively charged amino acids at the P1 position, with less specificity at P3 and P4, and pH-dependent preferences for Leu at 5.5 and Arg at 7.5. Three amino acids in the S pocket differ from VX-2 and VX-3 (Ala, Gly, and Glu). Glu180 is crucial for pH-dependent substrate preference. VX- is localized in the vacuoles and cytoplasm of erythrocytic P. viv, with maximal activity at neutral pH, and against P. viv plasm 4 and hemoglobin at neutral/acidic and acidic pH, respectively. VX demonstrates pH-dependent substrate switching, allowing for efficient cleavage of different substrates in intracellular environments. VX might function as hemase in acidic foodu, mase P viv plasm 4 at neutral/acid, and cytoskeleton-degrading in erythrocytos.
Researchers have developed a novel genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis (ME-model) for the acetogen Clostridium ljungahli, a Gram-positive bacterium capable of fermenting a broad range of substrates, including H2:CO or syng (a mixture of H2/CO2). This model captures major metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, cofactor, and vitamin synthesis pathways, as well as RNA and protein synthesis necessary for catalyzing reactions. The ME-model significantly broadens predictability of acetogen physiology and reveals how protein and media composition influence metabolic pathways and energy conservation. It accurately predicts secretion of multiple fermentation products, including glycerol, a novel product for C. ljungahli, expanding its metabolic capability. Predicting overflow metabolism enables new strategies, such as glycerol formation. The model also predicts changing secretion rates based on metal availability, opening fermentation optimization and knowledge about proteome and carbon flux in acetogens.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a panel of human osteoblast (HO) cell lines to investigate the genetic control of transcript variation in osteoblasts. The study aimed to assign biological relevance to genetic signals identified in GWAS studies using large cohorts of primary cell lines. A transcriptomic survey was performed to identify cell-type specific genes and functionally relevant pathways in HO and lymphoblast cell (L) lines. Cis-association analysis with SNP genotypes was used to identify genetic variations in transcript isoforms, indicating differential expression in HO is partly controlled by cis-regulatory genetic variants. These isoforms are regulated by variants in both tissue-specific and tissue-independent manners, confirmed by RT-PCR validation. The study suggests multiple isoforms are present in both tissues and genetic may affect relative expression of one iso to another, rather than an all-or effect. Examination of top SNPs from GWAS of bone density showed overlap with probeset associations in this study, corresponding to the FAM118 gene. This was tested in additional clinical studies, revealing a novel isoform variant. The approach to examining transcriptome in multiple types is useful for detecting variation common to cell types and identifying cell-specific isoforms functionally relevant, a follow-up for GWAS.
Saccharomyces eayan, a non-S cerevisiae parent of the lager-brew hybrid S pastorian, is unable to utilize α-tri-glucide maltotose, a major carbohydrate in brew's wort, unlike most S cerevis and Froberg Sorian strains. The utilization of maltose in Saccharomy yeasts is encoded by the subtelomeric MAL gene family and requires transporters for maltose uptake. S eayan strain CBS 57 harbors SeALT genes for α-di-glucide maltose uptake but lacks maltose genes. S cere sequence indicates maltose and maltose transporters likely evolved from shared ancestral. To study evolv maltose in e CBS57, maltose-assim mutants after UV mutagenesis were subjected to evolution in carbon-limited chemostat on maltose-enriched wort. An evolved strain showed improved maltose and maltose fermentation in 7 ferment experiments on industrial w. Whole-genome sequencing revealed novel SeM413, resulting from gene introgress by non-recipro trans of at least Se genes. The tertiary ofM was comparable to original but overexpression sufficed to enable growth on maltose, indicating neofunction. The structure resembles Sorian maltose-transport gene SpY, with high to MAL1, MAL1 and Se3. Evolution maltose landscape in Sorian lagerrew likely involved similar mechanisms.
Influenza virus variants continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide, necessitating timely and accurate assessment of their impact on human mortality to inform public health planning. Current methods rely heavily on intensive surveillance, which can be biased and time-consuming. A novel host-virus interaction model was developed to establish a correlation between excess mortality caused by distinct viral strains and their antigenic distances to previous strains for each seasonal influenza subtype. This relationship was used to create a method for rapid estimation of mortality of influenza A (H1N) virus by predicting antigenic distance between A(H1 strains. The study found a positive correlation between excess mortality and antigenic variation, enabling rapid assessment of mortality burden for new strains. This approach can inform cost-effective control and prevention strategies for influenza.
Researchers have identified a small cysteine-rich protein, Pp23, from the Asian soybean fungus Phakora pachyri, which plays a role in suppressing plant immunity. The fungus, an obligate biotrophic pathogen, causes severe soybean epidemics and its interaction mechanisms with host plants are not well understood. The fungus genome encodes many small secreted cystine-rich proteins (SCRPs), but their functions are unknown. This study characterizes P. pachy effector 23 (PEC), a SCP that suppresses plant immunity. PEC23 interacts with soybean transcription factor GPL12 and soy plants with GPL12 silenced have constitutively active immunity, identifying GPL12 as a negative regulator of soybean defenses. Data suggest a virulence function of SCP and PEC suppresses soy immune responses and interacts GPL12, a negative regulator.
Chlamydia trachatis, an obligate intracellular bacterium, invades host cells and replicates within a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion. Multiple host proteins are recruited to the inclusion to support chlamial development. Chydia induces activation of the PI3 kinase (PIK) pathway for efficient replication. The EphA receptor, a cell surface tyrosine kinase, is identified as a chlamial adherence and invasion receptor that activates PIK, promoting chlam replication. Interfering with C trachitis serar2 (C) binding to EphA, downregulation of EphA, or inhibition of Eph activity reduced C infection. C interacts with and activates Eph on the surface, resulting in receptor internalization. During chlam replication, Eph remains active around the inclusion and interacts with the p85 subunit of PIK to activate the PI/Akt pathway required for chlam development. Overexpression of full-length Eph, but not mutant lacking the cytoplasmic domain, enhanced PI activation and C infection. Despite Eph depletion from the surface, C induces Eph upregulation through ER activation, keeping the cell in an apoptosis-resistant state. The significance of Eph as entry and intracellular receptor was observed with trachitis serar D. Our findings provide evidence for a host surface receptor exploited for invasion and intracellular signaling to facilitate chlam replication. Engagement of a surface receptor at the membrane is a mechanism Chy subverts the host and induces resistance.
Researchers have found that neurons exhibit dendritic excitability through the expression of voltage-gated ion channels, but the role of this excitability in dendritic computation has remained unclear. A model of an active dendritic tree shows that its output is a highly non-linear function of afferent rate, resulting in extremely large dynamic ranges of up to 50 dB. This non-linearity yields double-sigmoid responses observed in retinal ganglion cells. The study suggests that the enhancement of dynamic range is the primary role of active dendritic conductances. Neurons with larger dendritic trees are predicted to have larger dynamic ranges, while blocking active conductances are expected to decrease dynamic.
Researchers have investigated the inference of quantitative models of bacterial promoters from time-series gene data, a crucial for drug discovery, cancer research, and biotechnology. Current methods rely on assumptions that mRNA abundance in transcriptomics data represents protein concentrations and changes in gene expression are solely due to transcription factors and regulators, neglecting global effects and physiological changes. This study systematically examines the importance of these biases and corrections using a combination of models and experiments. In vivo activity of genes in the FliFliM module of E. coli motility was measured, estimating protein concentrations and global effects using kinetic models of expression. Results show that correcting these assumptions improves model quality, and simulations indicate stronger improvements for systems with longer protein half-lives and varying gene machinery activity. The proposed approach is applicable to time-series transcript data for regulatory network structure and dynamics. In the FliFliM module, results highlight global effects and regulation of Fli and FlM halfives for Fli promoter dynamics.
Researchers investigated the spatial-temporal distribution of Oligyomys fulcens, a rodent species that serves as a reservoir for zoonotic pathogens, in the Agua region of Panama. A longitudinal study of rodent populations in the Agua community between April 2006 and December 2009 was analyzed using non-spatial and spatial statistical methods. The study area was divided into a 90-node grid with a 0.09 km2 cell size, covering 6.43 km2 (2.39 x 2.69 km). Temporal data was divided into four periods: dry season, rainy season, and two transitional months. Results showed heterogeneous population densities and dispersion of O. fulcens across seasons and years, with local absence during late transitional months and re-establishment in subsequent years. Populations recurred in same area first three years, then re-established further south in final year. Spatial autocorrelation indicated local populations within 300-600 m. Suitable and unsuitable habitats were sharply demarcated over short distances. O. fulens showed a spatial pattern evolving over time, leading to changing aggregation. Hotspots of abundance showed shifting, explaining intermittent transmission risk by this species. Variation was associated with seasonality and anthropogenic pressures from agricultural activities. These factors define occurrence, timing, intensity, and duration of synanthropic populations affected by humans, and possible human exposure.
Researchers have developed a method to infer antigenic trees for the major surface protein hemagglutinin of human influenza A H3 viruses, assigning antigen weights to branches to resolve the antigenic impact of amino acid changes. This technique accurately predicts antigenic distances comparable to antigen cartography and identifies both known and novel amino acid changes with antigenic impact in the evolution of H3 viruses from 1968 to 2003. The method can be applied to infer phenotype and genotype-phenotype relationships from other types of pairwise distances.
A high-throughput RNA interference (RNAi) screen was conducted to identify host factors required for human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) infection. The analysis revealed a cluster of mitotic genes involved in a previously unknown mechanism for viral DNA import into the nucleus. In interphase cells, viruses were endocytosed and routed to the perinuclear area, but DNA failed to enter the nucleus. Nuclear envelope breakdown during interphase enabled HPV16 infection. During mitosis, viral DNA associated with host chromatin on the metaphase plate. This suggests HPV requires nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis for DNA access to the nucleoplasm.
Black Sigat or black streak disease, caused by the Dothideomyc fungus Pseudocospora fiji (formerly Mycosphaella fiji), is the most significant foliar disease of banana worldwide. Due to the lack of effective resistance, management, this disease requires frequent fungicide applications, increasing economic and environmental costs in banana production. Weekly applications in plantations lead to rapid evolution of fungicide-resistant strains, causing disease failures globally. To combat this threat, two strains of P. fiji were sequenced and assembled with a new genetic map. The 74-Mb genome of P. fiji is expanded by LTR transposons, making it largest in Dothideycetes. Mel-curve assays suggest related members of Sigat complex, P. eumae and P. mus, are also expanded. Electrophoretic karyotyping and molecular markers in P. fiji populations showed chromosome polymorphisms and high diversity. Genetic differentiation was detected using neutral markers, suggesting selection with limited flow at geographic scale. Frequencies fungicide in treated plantations were higher than untreated P. fiji populations. A homologue Cladospor fulum Avr effector, PfAv4, was identified in P. fiji genome. Infiltration purified PfAV4 into leaves resistant variety Calcut 4 resulted hypersensitive response. This suggests Cal 4 carries unknown gene recognizing Pf4.
Researchers have proposed a novel framework to study the evolution of lineage-specific transcription factor binding sites without relying on detailed cross-species sequence alignments. This approach, based on a birth-death model, aims to identify regulatory elements contributing to species-specific traits. The method was applied to analyze ChIP-seq data for six transcription factors (GATA1, SOX2, CTCF, MYC, MAX, E1, TS) along the human-mouse common ancestor lineage. Results show that a substantial fraction of binding sites (58-79% for each factor) in humans originated since divergence from mouse. Approximately 15% of all sites are unique to hominids. These elements are often near genes associated with specific pathways and harbor more SNPs than older sites in the human genome. The study demonstrates the method's ability to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements and their roles in gene regulation variation across species.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism by which light regulates the expression of the zebraf period2 (per) gene, a key component of the circadian clock, in zebraf. They identified a Light-Responsive Module (LRM) within the per promoter, which is necessary and sufficient for light-driven expression and circadian regulation. The LRM is conserved in vertebrate per genes, even in species lacking light-sensitive peripheral clocks. The human LRM can substitute the zraf LRM to confer light-regulated transcription in zraf cells. The LRM contains E-box and D-box elements, critical for its function. The E-box mediates circadian regulation through BMAL1/CLOCK activity, while the D-box drives light expression. The zraf homolog of thyroid transcription factor binds to the L D-box and activates expression. t mRNA levels are light-inducible and t knockdown attenuates light transcription from the per promoter in vivo.
Researchers have discovered that the actin-binding protein coronin plays a crucial role in regulating the motility of Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, the highly motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. The study found that parasites lacking coronin exhibit motility defects, specifically impairing colonization of the salivary glands but not migration in the skin, resulting in decreased transmission efficiency. Non-motile sporozoites have low concentrations of actin and mediate coronin localization to the periphery. Engagement of extracellular ligands triggers intracellular calcium release followed by act-dependent localization of coron to the rear and initiation of motility. Mutational analysis and imaging suggest coron organizes actin filaments for motility. Using coronin-Cherry as a marker for actin filaments, protein A was found to contribute to actin disassembly. The study suggests that calcium and cAMP signaling regulate a switch from parasite motility to host invasion by differentially influencing actin dynamics.
Researchers have identified four Leishmania mexicana lines resistant to amphotin B, a drug used to treat leishiasis. These lines exhibit altered sterol biosynthesis and increased sensitivity to pentamidine. Genome sequencing revealed a mutation in the sterol biosynthesis gene ster C-desaturase in one line, while RNA-seq showed loss of expression of ster C-methyltransferase (SMT) in three lines. MT is responsible for drug resistance and altered sterol biosynthesis. Loss of milteine transporter was also associated with one line. MT is encoded by two genes with different expression levels. Reduced expression is linked to loss of 3 untranslated region of dominant gene due to structural variations at locus. Local sequence homology between genes and presence SIDER retrotransposons promote these variations. In one case, loss MT expression not associated with loss virulence in macrophages in vivo. Sequence instability known in Leish genomes, associated with major drug resistance without fitness costs, a concern.
Researchers investigated how attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain during sensory encoding. Two processes, prediction and attention, contribute to perception and cognition, but their interaction remains unclear. Predictive coding theory suggests attention optimizes prediction precision by modulating synaptic gain of prediction units, implying attention increases selectivity for surprising information. Alternative models propose attention increases activity of prediction neurons, suggesting synergistic selectivity for feature information. This study used EEG to record neural activity in humans performing a visual task to test attention's effect on mismatch and feature information in response to surprising stimuli. Participants attended or ignored gratings with predictable, surprising, or unpredictable orientations. Surprising stimuli evoked responses encoded difference between predicted and observed features, and attention facilitated encoding of this information.
Trypanosoma brucei, a pathogen of sub-Saharan Africa, has three subspecies: T. b. brucei, T. rhodesense, and T. gambense. T. b. brucei is unable to infect humans due to sensitivity to trypanolytic factors (TLF) 1 and 2 in human serum. T. rhodesense and T. gambense are resistant to lysis by TLF. T. gambense has two distinct subgroups differing genetically and in human serum phenotypes. Group 1 T. gambense has an invariant phenotype, while group 2 shows variable resistance. Previous studies indicated group 1 T gambense is resistant to TLF1 due to reduced uptake of TLF mediated by reduced expression of TLF receptor, the haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (Hb) gene. This study investigates if true for group 2 parasites. Isogenic resistant and sensitive group 2 T gambense were derived and compared to T bruce parasites. Both express Hb gene at similar levels and internalized fluorescent labeled T1 similar to T. bruce. Both resistant and sensitive group 2, as well as group 1 gambense, internal recombinant AP1, only sensitive group parasites lysed. Data indicate group T gambense avoiding T1 is resistant to main lytic AP1. Group 2 gambense innately resistant AP1, possibly same mechanism. Group 2 gambense variably displays phenotype, expression does not correlate with Hb change or expression. Differences in human resistance mechanism between T gambense groups 1 and 2.
Researchers have investigated the role of DNA methylation in controlling HIV-1 latency, a state in which the virus remains dormant and hidden from the immune system and antiretroviral drugs. They found that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) is an epigenetic mechanism that restricts reactivation of latent HIV-1 and determines its stability. This methylation occurs late in the establishment of latency and is not required for initial provirus silencing. In latent reservoirs of aviremic patients, high proportions of non-methylated 5 LTR were found, indicating that latency is controlled by transcriptional interference and chromatin mechanisms without significant DNA methylation, which is leaky and easily reactivable. In patients without detectable viremia, HIV-1 promoters and enhancers were hypermethylated and resistant to reactivation, contrasting with hypomethyl 5 L in vire patients. However, dense methylation of HIV-1 5 LTR did not confer complete resistance to reactivation with histone deacetylase inhibitors, protein C agonists, TN-α, and combinations with 5-aza-2deoxycytidine. The densely methylated promoter was most efficiently reactivated in absence T cell activation by suboylanide hydroamic acid. The study suggests that CpG methylation controls HIV-1 latency and has implications for strategies to eradicate HIV infection.
Researchers have created a comprehensive genomic map of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, identifying over 3.6 million genetic variants, including 800,000 insertions, deletions, and complex variants up to 6,000 base pairs in length. Using a local assembly-based approach, they found that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are denser than other variants, but not due to mutagenic or mutation-prone regions. Instead, the high SNP density is attributed to population-level processes. The study also investigated gene expression variation in adult flies by mapping cis-quantitative trait loci (cisQTL) for over 2,000 genes. Insertions comprise 10% of all cisQTL and show larger effects than SNPs. CisQTL. More associations were found in males than females, and most cisQTL are sex-specific, indicating decoupling of genomic architecture between sexes and importance of genetic factors in sex-based expression. RNA-seq-based allelic imbalance in offspring of sequenced lines validated most cisQ in heterozygous individuals.
Researchers investigated the impact of amplitude cancellation on the association between neural drive and rectified electromyography (EMG) signals. Rectified EMG is commonly used to estimate neural drive to muscles and infer synaptic input to motor neurons, but amplitude loss due to overlapping motor unit potentials may distort its spectrum and correlation with neural drive. Analytical derivations and computational models of motor activity, force, and EM signal were used to examine this effect. Rectified EM without cancellation (EMnc) was found to be a superior estimator of neural drive compared to actual rectified EM. Simulations showed that the coefficient of determination (r^2) between neural drive and EMnc (0.59±0.08) matched rectified EM and drive only at low cancellation levels (<40%) and low contraction (<5% maximum voluntary force). Correlation decreased linearly with cancellation (r=-0.83) to r<0.2 at >60% cancellation and >15% contraction. Simulations also showed stronger neural drive implied stronger correlation between rectified EM and drive, with cancellation distorting mainly low-frequency (<5Hz) components. Results indicate amplitude distorts rectified EM spectrum, suggesting valid use of rectified EM as drive estimator requires low levels and strong synaptic input to motor neurons.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanism of auxin-mediated root growth inhibition in response to aluminum (Al) stress in Arabidopsis. They found that YUC, a flavin monooxygenase-like protein, regulates local auxin biosynthesis in the root transition zone (TZ) in response to Al stress. Al stress upregulates YUC3/5/7/9 in the rootTZ, leading to aux accumulation and root growth inhibition. This regulation is dependent on ethylene signaling, as disrupting ethylene signaling either enhanced or reduced YUC expression in the rootTZ in response to Al. Ethylene also enhanced root inhibition under Al was alleviated in yuc mutants or by co-treatment withucas, an inhibitor of Y activity. Eth-insensitive 3 (E3) is involved in regulating Y9 transcription. Additionally, PHYTOCHROMEACTING FACTOR 4 (P4) acts as a transcriptional activator for Y5/9, promoting Al-inhibited root growth by regulating local Ys and aux in the rootTZ. Al-induced P4 in theTZ acts downstream of eth signaling. The study reveals a regulatory cascade for Y-regulated aux biosynthesis in theTZ mediating growth response to Al.
Natural Killer (NK) cell responses in primates are regulated by interactions between killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) on NK cells and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I ligands on target cells. Research has shown that certain simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) peptides can bind to the MHC class I molecule Mamu-A*002 in rhes mac, stabilizing its interaction with the inhibitory receptor Mamu-K3DL05. This study investigated the functional implications of these interactions by testing SIV peptides bound to Mam-A* for their ability to modulate Mam-K3+ NK cell responses. Twenty-eight of 75 SIV peptides bound to Mam* suppressed the cytolytic activity of Mam-K+ NK cells, including immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes previously shown to stabilize Mam-A* tetramer to Mam-K05. Substitutions at C-terminal positions changed inhibitory peptides into disinhibitory, and vice versa, without altering binding to Mam*. The effects of these variants on NK responses corresponded to their effects on Mam-A tetramer to Mam-K. Assays with mixtures of inhib and disinhib peptides, low concentrations inhibited NK responses. Consistent with inhibition Mam-K cells by epitopes presented Mam*, SIV replication was higher in Mam* CD+ lymphocytes co-cultured Mam-K NK than Mam-K cells.
Bacterial pathogens must adapt to dynamic environmental stressors to survive and thrive. A study investigated the evolution of Haemophilus influenza (NTH) in response to transient nutrient limitation, hypothesizing that adapted strains would be better suited for colonization and long-term survival. Mutations in the 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase gene (icc) were detected, leading to decreased activity in TH. In a preclinical model of TH-induced otitis media (OM), the icc mutant showed reduced recovery from infected ears. Clinically, OM resolution coincided with middle ear fluid clearance. In contrast, the ic mutant formed more intracellular bacterial communities (IBCs) than the parental strain early in OM, while the parental strain's IBC increased at later stages, coinciding with middle ear fluid absence. This study provides insight into TH evolution during nutrient limitation and demonstrates IBC in a preclinical OM model.
Burkholderia pseudomalle, the causative agent of meloidosis, modulates host iron homeostasis to facilitate iron availability and intracellular survival. Infection of primary macrophages with B. pseudalle results in downregulation of ferroport expression, leading to increased iron availability within macrophages. Exogenous modification of hepcid function or iron supplementation with ferric ammonium citrate increases intracellular iron, stimulating B pseudalle growth, whereas iron chelation with deferoxamine reduces bacterial survival. Iron-loaded macrophages exhibit reduced NADPH oxidase, iNOS, lipocalin 2, cytokine, and caspase-1 activation. Infection of mice with the pathogen diminishes hepatic ferport expression, increases liver iron retention, and lowers serum iron levels (hypofermia). In vivo administration of ferric ammonium citrate promotes bacterial growth and inflammation, while limiting iron availability ameliorates bacterial clearance, attenuates cytokine levels, and improves survival in infected mice. The study suggests that modulation of cellular iron balance is a strategy for B pseudalle to acquire iron and restrict antibacterial effector mechanisms, promoting intracellular growth. Changes in iron homeostasis influence susceptibility to meloidosis, and iron chelation may be a therapeutic option.
Researchers have developed a novel technique called "functional mode analysis" to identify collective motions in proteins that are directly related to their biological functions. This method uses an ensemble of structures and a "functional quantity" that measures the protein's functional state to detect the most correlated motion. The functional quantity can be geometric, electrostatic, chemical, or any variable relevant to the protein's function. The technique estimates the motion most likely to cause a significant change in the quantity from the ensemble. Two correlation measures are used: the Pearson coefficient, which measures linear correlation, and mutual information, which assesses any interdependence. Detecting the most correlated motion allows deriving a model for the functional in terms of a single coordinate. The approach is demonstrated on several biomolecules: polyalanine helix, T lysozyme, Trpase, and leucine-binding protein.
Researchers investigated the removal of conventional and non-conventional introns from the nuclear transcripts of Euglena gracilis, a unicellular eukaryote. Euglenids and diplonids harbor non-conventional introns, distinct from those found in other eukaryotes. Non-conventional introns lack conserved characteristics of spliceosomal introns and U1 snRNA complementarity at the 5' end, yet form stable secondary structures at exon-intron junctions. In contrast to conventional introns, non-conventional introns insert at novel positions, whereas conventional introns are conserved or lost. This study examined the order of intron removal from Euglena gracilis transcripts of tubA and gap genes, containing both non-conventional and spliceosomal introns. The relative order of excision was compared for pairs of introns from different types. Intermediate splicing products were analyzed using PacBio Next Generation Sequencing. Results showed non-con introns removed faster than spliceosomal introns. Accumulation of transcripts with conventional intr removed non-con present suggests a time gap between splicing types.
Researchers investigated the effects of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB) infection on cardiac progenitor cells and postnatal heart development in a mouse model. CVB is an enterovirus that typically causes self-limiting febrile illness in infants, but severe cases can manifest as acute myocarditis. Chronic consequences of mild CV infection are unknown, but there is an association between early subclinical infections and late heart failure, suggesting potential for subtle damage leading to late-onset dysfunction or chronic injury due to inflammatory reactions during latent infection. Mice were infected with a subclinical dose of CVB3 at juvenile stage, showing no symptoms immediately post-infection or in adulthood. However, following physiological or pharmacologically-induced cardiac stress, infected mice underwent hypertrophy and dilation indicative of progression to heart failure. Evaluation of vasculature in hearts of stressed mice showed compensatory increase in CD31+ vessel formation, suppressed in infected mice. CV3 efficiently infected c-kit+ cells, cardiac progenitor numbers reduced in hearts of infected mice. Results suggest exhausted progenitor pool following CV3 infection impairs heart's ability to increase capillary density adapt to load.
Burkholderia pseudomalle, the causative agent of glanders, regulates IL-1 and IL-18 production through NOD-like receptor NLRP and pyroptosis via NLRC. However, the downstream pathways and cell mechanisms of death induced by B. pseudalle during infection have not been fully elucidated. This study investigated the role of B. pseudalle factors in inflamome activation and cell death pathways. Caspase-1 and pyptosis were found to be dependent on NLRC, not NLRP, in the early phase of macrophage infection, while later caspase-1 activation and cell death were NLRC-independent. An early pathway involving casp-9, -7, and PAR was identified downstream of NLRC and casp-1. Caspase-1 deficient macrophages showed strong apoptosis, dependent on apoptotic initiator and effector caspases. Early casp-1 activation in macrophages was reduced or abolished with B. pseudalle flagellin FliC or TSS3B mutant. TSS effector protein BE was shown to play a role in casp-1 processing. TSS inner protein BK mutant failed to activate casp-1, with higher intracellular counts, reduced death and IL-β secretion. Intranasal infection of BAL/c mice with BK mutant showed decreased mortality, lower bacterial loads, IL-β, myeloperoxidase, and neutrophils in bronchoveolar lavage. Results indicate a major role of TSS in NLRC-mediated casp-1 activation pyptosis and contribution of casp-dependent and -independent cell death in B.alle pathogenesis.
Arabidopsis KINγ, a subunit of the SNF1-related kinase complex, plays a crucial role in plant development. In Arabidopsis, KINγ is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of vegetative pollen cells. The Arabidopsis kinγ mutant pollen fails to germinate on the stigma, but germinates normally in vitro. Hydration of the mutant pollen on the stigma is compromised, but adding water promotes germination in vivo, suggesting hydration defect leads to germination. Mitochondria and peroxomes in kinγ mutant pollen are destroyed and reduced in number compared to wild type. kinγ mutant has reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pollen. Adding H2O2 in vitro partially compensates for reduced hydration, and overexpressing Arabid CATAL 3 reduces ROS, impairing hydration on stigma.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the enzyme RNase III plays a crucial role in protecting the cell from the expression of toxin genes carried by two prophages, Skin and SPβ, through antisense RNA. Unlike in other organisms, where RNase is not essential, in B. subtilis, its presence is vital for survival. Two toxin-encoding mRNAs, txA and yT, of Skin and SP are sensitive to RNase. The mechanism of RNase-mediated decay of txA mRNA paired with its antisense RNA, Rat, is explored in vivo and in vitro.
Researchers have investigated the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) by the parasitic nematode Brugia malayi, the causative agent of Lymphatic Filariasis. EVs are small particles containing bioactive proteins and RNA that allow parasites to secrete effector molecules and transport them to host tissues. The study analyzed EV release across all life stages of B. malayi: microfilariae, L3, L4, adult male and female worms. Nanoparticle tracking revealed discrete EV populations and a conserved secretory process. EVs were internalized by murine macrophages with no preference for stage, suggesting uniform effector trafficking mechanism. Chemical inhibitors showed all stages internalized by phagocytosis. Proteomic profiling of adult and female EVs using nano LC/MSMS described quantitative and qualitative differences in adult proteome, defining Brug EV biogenesis and sexual dimorphic immunomodulatory cargo. Ivermect inhibited EV release by all B. mal stages, also observed in related nematode Dirofilar imitis, but not in iverect-unresponsive isolate, suggesting drug mechanism and new screening platforms for anti-filar development.
A population-based study was conducted in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands to investigate the prevalence of scabies and impigo. Ten rural villages were included in the study, with 190 participants enrolled. The total unweighted prevalence of scabies was 19.2% (95% CI 17.5-21.0) and age and gender prevalence 19.2% (95 CI 16.7-21.9). Adult prevalence was 10.4% (95 CI 8.2-13.2), with highest in infants <1 year (34.1, OR 3.6, 95 CI 2.2-6) and children 1-4 years (25.7, OR 2.6, CI 1.7-3.9). Scabies affected two or more body regions in 80.9% of participants and 4.4% classified as severe. Total prevalence of impigo was 32.7 (95 CI 30.6-34.8) and age and gender 26.7 ( CI 24.2-29.5). Highest in children 1-4 (42.6, OR 4.1, CI 2.9-5.8). Scabies associated with impigo (OR 2.0, CI 1.6-2.6); 41.1 of impigo also had scabies.
In adult mice, neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus continues throughout life, but its function remains unclear. Researchers measured cellular proliferation in the hippocampus of 719 outbred stock mice and found a significant correlation between the proportions of CD8+ and CD4 T lymphocyte subsets. This correlation reflected shared genetic loci, with the exception of the H-2a locus, which had a dominant influence on T subsets but no impact on neurogenesis. Analysis of knockouts and repopulation of Tα-deficient mice subsets of T cells confirmed the influence of T on adult neurogenesis, indicating CD+ T cells or subpopulations mediate the effect. Our results reveal an organismic impact, broader than hitherto suspected, of the genetic variation that controls T development and homeostasis.
Researchers investigated the efficacy of a multi-component DNA-prime/protein-boost vaccine (TVac2) against Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, a major health problem in Latin America and emerging in the US. The vaccine, composed of selected antigens and cytokines IL-12 and GM-CSF expression plasmids, was tested in a murine model C57/6 mice. Mice were immunized with antigen-encoding plasmids plus cytokine adjuvants, followed by recombinant proteins, and challenged with T. cruzi trypastigotes two weeks later. ELISA and flow cytometry measured humoral (antibody isotypes) and cellular (ymphocyte, CD+ and CD+ T phenotype and cytokine responses. Myocardial pathology was evaluated by H&E and Masson's trich staining. TVac induced strong antigen-specific antibody (Ig2>Ig1) and moderate lymphocyte proliferation in mice. Upon challenge, TVac-vaccinated mice expanded Ig2/Ig1 and elicited CD+ T response with type 1 cytokines IF-γ and TN-α, controlling acute parasite burden. During chronic phase, response persisted, splenic CD+ cells and IFγ/TNF- cytokines subsided, and IL/IL cytok became dominant in vaccinated. Tissue parasitism, inflammation, fibrosis in heart and muscle of TVac-vacc chronic were undetectable by histological techniques. In contrast, injected vector or cytokines only responded T. cruz by elicitation mixed type 1/type 2 antibody, cell and cytok response, exhibiting persistent burden and immunopath in myocardium. TVac-induced type 1 and lymphocyte responses provided resistance to T. cruz infection, preventing evolution immunopath associated parasite in chasic hearts.
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying susceptibility loci for complex diseases, but a remaining challenge is quantifying individual disease risk based on genotype for personalized prevention and treatment. Previous studies have failed to achieve satisfactory performance due to limited confirmed loci use. This study proposes using machine learning approaches with multiple markers to improve disease assessment. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was applied to a GWAS dataset on Affymetrix genotyping for type 1 diabetes (T1D), optimizing a risk model with hundreds of markers. The model was tested on an independent Illumina-genotyped dataset (1,008 cases, 1,000 controls) and a separate Affymrix-genotyped dataset (1,529,1,458), achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.84 in both. In contrast, poor performance was seen with limited loci in the model or logistic regression. The study suggests disease assessment can be improved with algorithms accounting for interactions between multiple markers. Genotype-based risk may be feasible for diseases with notable risk captured by arrays.
Memory CD8+ T cells play a crucial role in providing immunity against viral infections by rapidly infiltrating non-lymphoid tissues such as the skin. However, the fate of these cells after entering non-lymphoid tissues is not well understood. CD62 is often used to identify central memory CD8 T cells, but its role in lymph node homing versus other functions is unclear. This study shows that memory CD8 T cells enter the skin independently of CD62-mediated lymph node reactivation and provide protection against Vaccinia virus (Vac) infection. Central memory (TCM) but not effector (TEM) CD8 T cells differentiate into CD69+/CD- tissue residents after viral clearance, dependent on local antigen recognition in the skin environment. Memory CD8 cells express granzyme after entering the skin and utilize cytotoxicity to protect against Vac infection.
Myosin VI, a minus-directed motor protein, plays a crucial role in the localization of proteins to the surface of axons in neurons. In contrast to Myosin Va, which targets transmembrane proteins to dendrites, Myos VI facilitates the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface. Non-neuronal proteins that interact with Myos VI become highly concentrated at the axonal surface in dissociated rat neurons. Disruption of Myos VI function or expression leads to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins. Myos VI mediates the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface by stimulating dendrite endocytosis, a mechanism underlying localization of many axonal proteins. Additionally, a Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myos VI is concentrated at the axonal surface of cortical neurons in mice in vivo, suggesting a potential tool for probing circuit and function.
Researchers have identified two Doublesex (Dsx) genes in Daphnia magna, a freshwater branchiop crustacean, which exhibits environmental sex determination (ESD) by producing males in response to environmental cues. One of these genes, DmaD1, is responsible for male development during ES and its organization is similar to Dsx from insects, a sister group of branchiop crustans. Unlike insects, DmaD1 exhibits sexually dimorphic differences in transcript abundance rather than sex-specific pre-mRNA splicing in the coding region. During embryogenesis,maD1 is increased in males and primarily detected in male structures. Knocking downma1 in males results in female traits and ovarian maturation, while ectopic expression in females results in male-like phenotypes. Another Dma gene,ma2, has similar expression patterns but silencing and overexpression do not induce clear phenotypic changes. These results establishma1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype. The study reveals how ES is implemented by selective expression of a conserved component in genetic sex determination (GSD) and infers an ancient link between ES and SD.
Researchers have developed a trivalent HSV-2 vaccine that targets glycoproteins C, D, and E (gC, D, g2, E) to block virus entry and immune evasion by g2 and g2. The vaccine was tested in rhes macaques and guinea pigs. Inhes macques, the trivalent vaccine induced plasma and mucosa neutralizing antibodies, blocking g2 and g2 immune evasion, and stimulated CD4 T cell responses. After intravaginal challenge, a selfimited vaginal infection was detected by histopath and immunohisto in naïve, but not trivalent immunized macques. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in guinea pigs. Animals were mock, immunized with g2, trivalent, or trivalent + g2. The tr and tr +2 groups were 97% and 99% efficacious in preventing genital lesions, outperforming g2 alone. Vaginal swabs were evaluated for HSV-2 DNA and replication between five and seven weeks after challenge. HSV-2 DNA was reduced in all groups compared to mock. Shedding of replication virus occurred fewer days in tr than g2 immunized, while tr +2 had no shedding replication virus. The tr group had <1% genital lesions and 0.2% shedding replication virus.
Researchers have developed a new method called Permseq to map protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplications and highly repetitive regions of genomes. These regions play a significant role in cellular regulatory programs. Next-generation sequencing enabled genome-wide profiling of protein-DNA interactions through chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). However, interactions in highly repetitive regions have been difficult to map due to short reads (50-100 base pairs) mapping to multiple locations in the genome. Standard methods discard multi-mapping reads and those that can accommodate are prone to false positives and negatives. Permseq is an enhanced read allocation method for Ch-se experiments that allocates multiapping in repetitive regions with high accuracy. It was comprehensively evaluated and found to significantly improve multi-read accuracy over approaches not utilizing additional data. The underlying statistical framework facilitates multi-read allocation with various data including histone Ch-se. Permseq was applied to 64 ENCODE Ch-se datasets from GM78 and K562 cells, identifying novel protein-D interactions in segmental regions. Analysis revealed protein-D interactions are evolutionarily conserved in repetitive, sharing characteristics with non-repet regions.
A nested case-control study was conducted in Tanzania to investigate the effects of schistosomiasis on susceptibility to HIV-1 infection and HIV-1 viral load at HIV-1 seroconversion. Approximately 40% of the population had Schistosoma mansoni infection and 2% had S. haematobium. The study found that women with schistosome infections had a higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition compared to those without, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.8 (1.2-6.6, p=0.019). In contrast, schist-infected men did not have an increased odds of HIV-1 acquisition. The study also compared HIV-1 RNA levels in post-serconversion blood in HIV-1 serconverters with schosias versus those without, and found a significantly higher median HIV-1 RNA level in serconverters with schias: 4.4(3.9-4.6) log copies/mL versus 3.7(2.3-4) p=0.017. The study confirms that pre-existing schist infection increases HIV-1 susceptibility in women and raises HIV-1 viral load at serconversion in an area with S. mansoni. This is the first study to demonstrate the effect of schist infection on HIV-1 susceptibility and control and differentiate by gender.
Researchers investigated ribosomal DNA (rDNA) copy number and sequence variation in human and mouse genomes using computational and droplet digital PCR approaches. They found that rDNA copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes. Contrary to expectations, human cancer genomes exhibit a loss of rDNA copies accompanied by global copy number variation. The sequence is also more variable in cancer genomes. Genomes with lower rDNA copies show evidence of mTOR pathway activation. The PTEN phosphatase, a tumor suppressor and mTOR pathway regulator, is critical for genome stability. In a mouse model of leukemia, hematopoietic stem cells lacking PTEN have lower rDNA number than normal tissue, despite increased rRNA and protein production. Loss occurs early and is associated with hypersensitivity to DNA damage. rDNA loss is a feature in cancers with mTOR activation.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of bacterial growth, death, and spread within mammalian hosts by analyzing the behavior of tagged Salmonella enterica populations in wild-type and isogenic strains in mice. These strains are phenotypically identical but can be distinguished by quantitative PCR, enabling the estimation of bacterial death rates based on strain disappearance over time. A multidisciplinary approach was used to establish the timing, occurrence, and control of key infection parameters in host-pathogen combinations. Results show that shortly after infection, concomitant death and rapid replication lead to establishment of bacterial subpopulations in different organs, controlled by host antimicrobial mechanisms. Later, decreased mortality leads to exponential increase in bacteria spread locally, with mixing between organs via bactemia and stochastic selection.
Researchers have investigated the inverse problem of binocular 3D motion perception and found that existing schemes such as interocular velocity difference and changing disparity over time, as well as joint motion and disparity encoding, do not provide a general solution to the problem. A new framework combining local velocity with binocular disparity and other cues is proposed as a more flexible solution. In the context of the aperture problem, two strategies are derived: (1) normal preferring slow motion in 3D and (2) cyclopean based on slow in 2D motion. Perceived motion direction for ambiguous motion allows distinguishing between these 3D processing strategies. Theoretical results indicate velocity and disparity from tracking are necessary to solve 3D perception. It is suggested that motion and disparity are processed in parallel and integrated in the visual hierarchy.
Researchers investigated the structure and function of AlgJ, a protein involved in O-acetylation of alginate, a polysacchar produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa during lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. The structure of Alg was determined to 1.83 Å resolution, revealing it as a SGN hyrolase-like protein with a distinct electrostatic surface compared to the N-terminal domain of AlgX. A conserved catalytic triad of D190, H192 and S288 was identified, and Alg exhibited acetylester activity in vitro. Residues in Alg signature motifs formed a network critical for alginate O-acetylation in vivo. Two electrospray ion mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) assays compared Alg and Alg binding to alginate, showing Alg weak or no binding while Alg bound polymannonic acid in a length-dependent manner. Additionally, Alg utilized surrogate acetyl donor 4-nitrophenyl acetate to catalyze alginate Oetylation. The results suggest Alg and Alg have separate roles in alg Oetylation, with Alg as terminal transferase.
Candida albicans is a common cause of human fungal infections and a significant source of mortality. It evades detection by the innate immune system through masking its cell wall with a layer of heavily glycosylated mannans. However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can lead to exposure of β (1,3)-glucans, enhancing detection by immune cells like Dectin-1, C-type lectin. Our lab previously showed that phosphatidylserine synthase plays a role in β(1,3)-uc masking. A homozygous synthase mutant, choΔ, exhibits increased β(1)-uc exposure. Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAP) pathways and upstreamho small Gases regulate cell biogenesis and remodeling. In choΔ, both C1 and M1 MAPs are constitutively activated, acting downstream of Gases C42 andho, respectively. C42 activity is upregulated inΔ. It was hypothesized that activation C42 orho and their kinases cause unmasking. Disrupting M1 does not unmask inΔ, and hyperactivatingho in wild-type increases unmask and activates C1 and M. Moreover, hyperactivating kinase in wild-type leads to C1 activation and β(1)-uc exposure. Upregulation the C1 MAP causes unmask, responsible for unmask inΔ.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study of genetic loci for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related dementias using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. The study aimed to gain insight into the molecular pathogenesis of AD and related dement. Neuropath data were used to define clinico-path AD or controls, assess neuropath features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibr tangles, NFT), and evaluate co-mor neuropath changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and brain injury (BI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clin-path AD, NPs, NFT, CAA, and L with variants in the apolipoprotein E (APO) gene, Galc transferase 7 (GAL7), ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 1 (ABCG1), and intergenic region on chromosome 9 associated with NP score. Potassium conductance calcium-activated subfamily member 2 (KCN2) was associated with HS. Twelve of 21 nonAPO genetic loci for clinically-defined AD were confirmed in clin-path sample: CR1, BIN, CL, MS4A, PICAL, ABC, CD, P2, SOR, M, EF, ZW, and C with 9 of 12 showing odds ratio in clin-path. Correlation effect sizes for AD with NFT or N showed positive, while for VBI showed negative. Co-mor neuropath features showed nominal association with known loc. The study discovered new associations with neuropath features and aligned genetic AD with neurop changes in the largest autopsy of AD and dement.
Researchers have investigated the role of urea in protein unfolding using molecular dynamics simulations on 30 proteins with diverse native folds. Contrary to expectations, urea does not induce unfolding but rather stabilizes the unfolded state by concentrating in the protein's first solvation shell with lower density than the fully unfolded state. Urea does not alter protein vibrations, instead reducing their magnitude and slowing atomic motions opposing unfolding. However, urea's stickiness and diffusion are crucial for unfolding. Long urea molecules near hydrophobic cores stabilize partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations. Simulations show ure does not favor open microstates but is not a passive unfolding spectator, displacing the folded-unfolded equilibrium. Instead, ure actively unfolds by selecting and stabilizing partially unfolded microstates, driving the conformation away from native and thermal conformations.
A systematic review was conducted to describe the epidemiology of deng disease in Colombia from 2000 to 2011. Literature searches were conducted using the terms "deng", "epemiology", and "Colia" in English and Spanish, yielding 225 citations, of which 30 met the inclusion criteria. The epidemiology of deng disease in Colombia was characterized by a stable annual number of deng fever cases, with outbreaks in 2001-2003 and 2010. Geographical spread of deng cases increased, with most of the country affected by 2010. The majority of deng cases were among those under 15 years old. Asymptomatic d virus infection, primary versus secondary infections, and under-reporting of disease were identified as gaps in knowledge areas for future research. Understanding factors determining disease expression is crucial for improved control and management.
Leishmaniasis (TL) is a disease caused by Leishmania parasites that affects skin and mucosal tissues. Patients with TL may concurrently carry other pathogens that influence the disease outcome. This review examines the frequency of TL coinfections in populations, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens in animal and human models, and implications for clinical practice. TL is defined as cutaneous, localized, disseminated, or mucocutaneous forms. HIV coinfection, superinfection, and skin manifestations of visceral lemanias are excluded. A literature search yielded 73 records: 21 studies in animals and 52 in humans (mainly cross-sectional and case studies). Trypanosoma cruzi coinfection was reported in 41% of TL patients in Argentina and helminthias in 15-88% in Brazil. Mechanisms of interaction between microorganisms are unclear, possibly involving innate immunity and regulatory networks affecting acquired responses. Diagnostic challenges arise when concurrent infections cause similar lesions (e.g., TL and leprosy), pathogens in same lesions (e.g., Leish and Sporothrix schenii), or phylogenetically close pathogens affect tests (e.g., serology leishias and Chagas). Some coinfections (e.g., helminias) reduce antileman treatment effectiveness and combinations cause adverse effects. In TL patients, coinfection is frequent, leading to diagnostic delays and treatment effectiveness and safety issues.
Researchers investigated the impact of genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on CD4:CD8 lineage commitment and MHC expression in rats. They used two genetic models to assess the contribution of specific genes in the MHC region and whether they regulate MHC expression and T cell selection. Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) associated with MHC I and II protein expression and CD:CD T ratio were mapped in outbred heterogeneous rats, identifying 10 QTL across the genome. QTL for individual traits colocalized within a region spanning MHC. To identify underlying genes, M-recombinant congenic strains were generated, refining QTL to intervals ~0.25 Mb in M-I and II regions. An interaction between intervals affected M class I expression and negative lineage commitment CD8-positive (SP) thymocytes. The effect was mapped to transporter associated antigen 2 (Tap) in M-II and classical M class (RT-A) in-I. A recombination between RT-A and Tap occurred in 0.2% of rats. Variants Tap influence antigenicity M class molecules by altering M ligandome. Results show restricted repertoire M class molecules to negative CD8 cells. This is the first study showing recombination natural alleles M influences T lineage.
A retrospective study was conducted using the Spanish National Health System's Hospital Discharge Database (CMB) to analyze the evolution of Chagas disease in Spain from 1997 to 2011. The study included 172 hospitalizations for Chagas disease, divided into two periods: 199-2004 and 2005-201. Hospitalization rates and clinical characteristics were described, and multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratio (OR) for association between conditions and hospitalization with organ damage. Hospitalization rates were 18.2/100,000 and 24.8/100,000 for the two periods, respectively. Median age was 35 (0-87), 74, with 74% female and 16-45 age group represented 69.8%. 23.4% hospitalizations included Chagas diagnosis with complications. Being male (OR 1.3, 1-1.77), aged 45-64 (OR 2.59, 1.42-4.71), and hospital cost above 3,065 (OR 2.03, 3.73.7) were associated with hospitalization complications. Since 2005, detected infections increased in Spain. Asymptomatic patients, women, fertile age, and conditions with complications highlight the need for early detection of T cruzi.
Researchers have identified hundreds of genetic markers associated with various diseases, yet a significant portion of the heritability remains unexplained. Combinatorial interactions are thought to contribute to this missing heritability, but have been challenging to discover due to computational complexity and genetic heterogeneity. To address this, a novel approach called Blocuster was developed to construct genome-wide, allele-specific networks that segregate homogeneous combinations of genetic factors and test their associations with phenotypes. Blocuster employs a correlation measure tailored for single nucleotide polymorphisms and captures genetic heterogeneity through a multifaceted collection of values. It was applied to psoriasis, discovering a combinatorial pattern with an odds ratio of 3.64 and a Bonferr-corrected p-value of 5.01×10−16. This pattern was replicated in independent data, validating the method's robustness. Blocuster improves disease susceptibility prediction and understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis, demonstrating its potential for discovering combinatorial genetic associations in genome-wide data.
Researchers conducted a large-scale chromosomal copy number variation (CN) study in 255 patients with agenesis of the corpus callo (ACC), 220 with cerebellar hypoplasia (CBL), and 147 with polymicrogyria (PM), and 2,349 controls to investigate the genetic causes of these congenital brain malformations. The study found that significantly more ACC patients had rare copy number variants (CNVs) over 1 megabase compared to controls (p=1.48×10-3, odds ratio=3.19, 95% confidence interval=1.89-5.39), but not CBL or PM patients. Rare CNVs impacted at least 1% of genes in patients and controls. Additionally, more ACC patients had CNVs over 20 genes compared to controls (p=0.01, odds ratio=2.95, 95% CI=1.69-5.18). Independent PCR confirmation showed 9.4% of ACC patients had de novo CNVs, which preferentially overlapped with de novo CNs in patients with autism spectrum disorders (p=3.06×10-4, odds=7.55, 95 CI=2.40-23). The study also confirmed and refined known CNs, including the 8p23.1-p11 duplication in 2% of the ACC cohort. Novel CNs were identified in single patients, including deletions 1p.31.3-p31.1, 1.31.2-31.3, 5.23.1, and 15.11-q13.1, and duplications 2.11-q13 and 11.14-p.2. One patient with microcephaly had paternally inherited 16.11 deletion including N1. Exome sequencing revealed recessive matally inherited nonsense mutation in non-deleted N1 allele. This study is the first systematic CN investigation in congenital brain malations, showing higher large gene-rich CN in ACC than CBL and PM.
Researchers investigated the role of Yorkie, a key effector of the Hippo signaling pathway, in planarian regeneration and its response to injury. The freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea was used as a model organism due to its high regenerative capacity. Yorkie RNA interference (RNAi) animals showed hyperactivated wound responses, characterized by increased stem cell proliferation and prolonged transcriptional wound program. This led to the identification of novel wound-induced genes repressed in Yorkie RNAi animals compared to controls. Additionally, Yorkie RNAi animals exhibited expanded epidermal and muscle populations, hypothesized to be sources of wound-induced genes. Furthermore, Yorkie RNAi animals failed to sense the size of an injury by the eyes, pharynx, brain, and gut, and midline, failing to remodel correctly scale to the regenerating fragment. These findings suggest Yorkie integrates multiple aspects of injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury transcription, and patterning.
Exosomes secreted by cells infected with Enterovirus 71 (EV71) contain viral RNA and microRNA-146, which facilitate viral replication in recipient cells by suppressing the type I interferon response. EV71 infection leads to increased exosome secretion and differential packaging of viral RNA and microRNA-146. MicroRNA-146 is preferentially packaged in exosomes, while viral RNA is retained in infected cells. Exosomes contain replication-competent EV71 RNA complexed with microRNA-146, Ago2, and GW182 and mediate EV transmission independent of virus-specific receptors. Exosomal RNA is transferred to and replicates in new cells while exosomal micro-146 suppresses type I interferon response, facilitating viral replication. IFN-stimulated gene (ISGs), BST2/tether, regulate EV-induced exosome secretion. In vivo study, exosomal RNA accumulates differentially in tissues compared to free virus.
Researchers investigated the relationship between PTEN kinase 1 (PINK) and Parkin, two genes associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease, in Drosophila. PINK is a serine/threon kinase with a predicted mitochondrial sequence and transmembrane domain, while Parkin is a RING finger protein with ubiquitin ligase activity. To understand their interaction, PINK-binding proteins were biochemically purified from human cells and screened using Drosila PINK (dINK) models to isolate molecules involved in PINK pathology. A PINK-binding protein, PG5 (PG), was identified and found to modulate the PINK pathway. Loss of Drosila PG (dPG) suppressed muscle degeneration, motor defects, and lifespan shortening caused by dINK inactivation, attributed to mitochondrial degeneration. However, PG inactivation failed to modulate parkin phenotypes. Ectopic expression of PG exacerbated dINK and dila park phenotypes. These results suggest PG negatively regulates the PINK pathway for mitochondrial maintenance and acts between PINK and Park, or independently of Park downstream P1.
Researchers investigated the role of interferon-γ in the immune response to Mycobacterium ulcerans, the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), a chronic skin disease characterized by toxin production of mycolactin. Histopathological analysis of BU lesions showed extracellular localization of acid-fast bacilli, but evidence suggests an intracellular growth phase. To determine interferon-γ's role, an experimental BU mouse model was used. Interferon-γ knockout mice showed faster disease progression compared to wild-type mice, with increased tissue necrosis and oedema, and higher bacterial burden after five weeks, indicating reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during early intracellular growth. Interferon-γ is crucial for early host defense against M. ulcerans.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in mitochondria under hypoxic conditions. Mitochondrial respiration is a major source of ROS, which contributes to various diseases. However, the mechanism of hypoxia-induced ROS production is not fully understood. A mathematical modeling approach was used to analyze this mechanism, considering all redox states in the electron transport chain. A new methodology was developed to construct large sets of differential equations for this task. The model of electron transport in mitochondria revealed two steady states of operation (bistability) of respiratory complex III under same conditions. Various perturbations can induce transition from one state to another. Normally, complex III is in low ROS mode, but anoxia can switch it to high ROS state, persisting after oxygen return. This prediction was qualitatively validated experimentally, explaining anox-induced cell damage. Bistability of complex operation may enable therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress. The modeling method can be used in systems biology studies.
Researchers used an integrative systems approach to investigate the role of the terminal gene huckin (Hkb) in the gap gene network of Drosophila melanogaster embryos. The gap network is the first regulatory tier in the hierarchy of segmentation genes specifying body position. Hkb expression was quantitatively measured, enabling its inclusion in gap gene models. Gap circuits are mathematical models of gene networks used to extract regulatory information from expression data by fitting models to patterns and obtaining estimates for parameters predicting network topology. Variability in data combined with parameter analysis improved biological relevance and consistency. Models agreed with earlier results, extending two aspects: Hkb regulates the posterior hunch (hb) domain, but has no other function. H is required for anterior shift in posterior border, reproduced in models. Gap circuits reproduced terminal gene mutants, unlike previous models, unable to reproduce null mutants correctly. Models capture expression of posterior genes and variational properties, improving understanding developmental and evolutionary dynamics of gap network.
Researchers have developed a novel immunotherapy for brucellos, a zoonotic disease causing significant economic losses worldwide, using phage lysates of Brucella abortus strains RB51 and S19. These strains are live attenuated and induce different types of immunity: RB51 stimulates cell-mediated immunity (CMI) while S19 induces antibodies. However, S is ineffective against intracellular pathogen. Both are secreted in milk and can infect humans, causing abortions in animals. Phage lysates retain immunogenicity, unlike heat or chemical inactivation. The study reports successful immunotherapy of bovine bruclos using RB51 phage (RL) and S19 phage (SL) lysates. SL induced strong antibody response and RL stimulated CMI. In vitro restimulation of leukocytes from immunized cattle produced interferon gamma. A single subcutaneous dose of 2ml cocktail (RL and SL) eliminated virulent Brucella from bruclos affected cattle, with undetectable Bruc specific amplicon by RT-PCR and negative Bruc culture in 3 post-immunization. This is the first report on minimally invasive monitoring of antibacterial therapy employing RNA specific for bacteria as biomarker and use of RB phage for immunotherapy bruclos in cattle.
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) play a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression and are also involved in the response to DNA damage. However, their activity in the presence of DNA damage suggests that there are mechanisms to protect certain CDKs from inhibition. Research has shown that CDK2 is active during S and G2 phases, but CDK2 is dispensable for survival due to compensation by other CDKs. To determine the specific function of CD2 in genomic integrity, researchers replaced wild-type CD2 with a mutant version sensitive to inhibition by adenosine analogs. The study found that transient inhibition of adenosine-sensitive CD2 after ionizing radiation increased cell killing. Extracts with adenos used preferentially phosphorylated CD2 the Nbs protein, a component of the MRN complex required for DNA repair and checkpoint signaling on a CD recognition site. In vivo, inhibition of CD2 delayed N1-Ser phosphorylation during S phase and mutation of Ser to Ala or Asp increased IR sensitivity. This study reveals a non-redundant requirement for CD2 activity in response to damage and a target of CD within the repair machinery.
Researchers used the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) method to map active regulatory elements at loci associated with hematological traits, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction in megakaryocytic and erythroblast cell lines. The study found distinct open chromatin patterns in the two cell types, with cell-specific open chromatin guiding the identification of functional variants. An open chrom region on chromosome 7q22.3 in megaryocytes but not erythroblasts was identified, harboring the non-coding variant rs342 associated with platelet volume. Resequencing of this region in 643 individuals confirmed rs342 as the putative variant. The variant was shown to modulate PIKCG expression in platelets and macrophages through differential binding of transcription factor EV1. A protein-protein interaction network analysis in Pikcg knockout mice indicated PI3 association with pathways in platelet biogenesis and thrombus formation.
This study investigates the effects of sodium current blockade in respiratory circuits and how they depend on the pharmacological mechanism and network dynamics. Most pharmacological blockers of voltage-gated ion channels have well-understood mechanisms of action, but this knowledge is rarely considered when interpreting experimental data. Blockade effects are often assumed to be equivalent, regardless of the blocker mechanism involved. Computer simulations demonstrate that this assumption may not always be correct. The blockade of persistent sodium current (INa) underlying rhythm generation in pre-Bötzinger complex (preöC) neurons is simulated via two pharmacological mechanisms: 1) pore obstruction by tetrodotoxin and 2) altered inactivation by ruz. Experimental application of tetrotoxin and ruz in respiratory circuits have diverse and contradictory effects, leading to debate on specific role of IN in respiratory circuits. Simulations match experimental data from isolated preö neurons to intact network level and generate experimentally testable predictions. This study: 1) provides mechanistic explanation for contradictory in vitro IN block results 2) shows IN block in vitro not equivalent to intact preparations 3) explains ruz failure to block IN intact network 4) predicts low tetroxin block stops respiratory rhythm in intact network. Simulations support IN role in rhythmogenesis in vivo and importance considering mechanism when interpreting pharmacological blockade data.
Researchers have investigated the role of microRNA-218 (mi-218) in the metastasis of gastric cancer (GC). They found that mi-218 expression is decreased in metastatic GC, along with its host gene Slit3. However, mi-218 negatively regulates Robo1, a Slit receptor, creating a negative feedback loop. Low mi-218 levels allow Rob1 to activate the Slit-Robo pathway by interacting with Slit2, promoting metastasis. Restoring mi-218 suppresses Rob1 and inhibits cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and vivo. The study describes a Slit-mi-218-Robo circuit disruption contributing to GC metastasis. Targeting mi-218 may block metastasis.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the transcriptional response of atherosclerotic lesions in mice with human-like hypercholesterolemia and genetic switch to lower lipoproteins (Ldl−/−po/A100/Mflox/flox/M1re). Atheroscler lesions progressed slowly at first, then rapidly, and plateaued after advanced lesions formed. Analysis of lesion profiles indicated accumulation of lipid-poor macrophages led to rapid expansion with foam formation and inflammation, supported by histology. Lowering plasma cholesterol (e.g., liproteins) at this point prevented formation of advanced plaques. Transcription profiling of atheroscl arterial wall identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. Validation by siRNA-inhibition in macrophages with acylated-LDL revealed a network of eight cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol accumulation. The study identified a network of atherosclerosis genes responding to plasma-lowering preventing formation of advanced plaques, which may be of interest for development of atherosclerosis therapies.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput screening method to identify genes involved in the assembly of the bacterial envelope of Gram-negative bacteria. The envelope is a complex barrier that makes it difficult for antimicrobial drugs to penetrate, resulting in a limited number of effective treatments and a rapid rise in resistance. To address this, a detailed understanding of the assembly process is crucial. Recent progress has been made in identifying essential biogenesis systems, but many aspects remain unclear. The researchers used a single-gene deletion library of Escherichia coli and a quantitative, high-throughput assay to screen for mutants with biogenesis defects. The screen was robust and identified known mutants involved in assembly, as well as 102 genes with unknown functions that likely impact biogenesis. One of these, Ely (YC), was further characterized and found to play a role in the metabolism of the lipid carrier for cell wall and surface polysacchar biogenesis. Further analysis of Ely and other hits is expected to reveal new information on biogenesis of the Gram-negative envelope and vulnerabilities for drug targeting. The screening method is adaptable to other organisms to study different envelope architectures.
Researchers have been using various techniques to study dynamical processes in biology, each highlighting different aspects of the system. However, integrating multiple datasets into a comprehensive view of multivar dynamics remains a challenge. A semi-supervised learning framework is proposed to fuse heterogeneous data, leveraging the intrinsic geometry of high-dimensional datasets. This approach was applied to a dataset on Drosophila pattern formation, combining gene expression, protein localization, phosphorylation, and morphogenesis data. A continuous trajectory was generated, revealing joint dynamics of these processes. The method can be adapted to other imaging modalities, providing a foundation for further data analysis and modeling of biological dynamics.
Research on snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) of classes PI, PII, and PIII was conducted to investigate their tissue localization and ability to degrade basement membrane components in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that PII and PIII SVs co-localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillaries to a greater extent than PI SV, which showed a more widespread distribution in tissue. The three SVs showed distinct patterns of hydrolysis of lamin, type collagen, and nidogen in vivo, but similar degradation of type IV collagen, indicating its critical role in microvessel destabilization and hemorrhage. Proteomic analysis of exudate revealed differences in action between SVs, with PI showing higher proteolysis of extracellular components and fibrin, while PII and P SVs had more intracellular proteins.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the homeotic genes are arranged on the chromosome in the order of the body segments they affect. Genes that influence posterior segments repress those of the anterior. However, this posterior rule is modified by the interaction between abdominal-A (ab-A) and abdominal-B (Abd-B). In the absence of Abd-B, ectopic expression of ab-A is observed in the epidermis of the eighth segment, but not in the nervous system. Repression in neuronal cells is mediated by a 92 kb noncoding RNA, "iab-8". This RNA produces a microRNA that represses ab-A and has a second, redundant mechanism acting "in cis". Transcriptional interference with ab-A promoter is the most likely mechanism.
Focal seizures are episodes of pathological brain activity that arise from a localized area of the brain and have been categorized into two types: low-amplitude fast oscillations (LAF) and high-amplitude spikes (HAS). This study investigates the underlying mechanisms of these patterns using a computational model of neocortical tissue, validated with clinical recordings of focal seizures. The model reproduces the two patterns and their properties, revealing distinct mechanisms. LAF is initiated by localized patches of activity that invade and coalesce over time, while HAS is a global transition to a seizure state triggered by a local event. This transition is enabled by increased excitability of surrounding tissue, which does not generate seizures but supports activity. Simulations show this difference in excitability explains clinical differences in surgical outcomes. Changes in tissue excitability can be elucidated using stimulation.
In flowering plants, pollen tubes transport sperm cells to the female gametophyte via the male gametophyte. Upon arrival, two sperm cells are released into the synergid to execute fertilization. Recent studies have identified proteins involved in gametophyte signaling to attract pollen tubes, but the mechanisms leading to pollen tube burst and sperm discharge remained unclear. This study investigates the role of defensin-like cyste-rich protein ZES-4 in maize, leading to pollen growth arrest, burst, and sperm release. ZES-4 is expressed in female gametophyte cells and accumulates in vesicles at the secretory zone of syner cells, released during fertilization. RNAi knockdown and synthetic Z-4 proteins show Z-4 induces pollen tube burst preferentially. Pollen membrane depolarization occurs after Z-4 application, and channel experiments indicate a role of K+ influx in tube rupture. The intrinsic K+ channel K1 is a direct target of Z. Following Z- application, K1 opens at physiological potentials and closes after wash. Vesicles containing Z- are released from syner cells upon male-female gamophyte signaling. Interaction between Z and K1 results in channel opening and K influx. K influx leads to water uptake and osmotic burst. Z- preferential activity indicates the mechanism a prezygotic barrier and reproductive isolation component in plants.
Researchers have developed a targeted oncolytic herpesvirus, RM249, which specifically infects and kills cancer cells expressing high levels of HER2 protein, a protein overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancers. To address the challenge of targeting disseminated tumors in vivo, they assessed the efficacy of systemically delivered RM249 against disseminated tumors in mouse models that recapitulate tumor spread to the peritoneum in women. Human ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3 cells implanted intraperitoneally in immunodeficient mice gave rise to progressive peritoneal carcinomatosis mimicking the condition in advanced patients. Intraperitoneal administration of RM249 inhibited carcinosis, resulting in 60% of mice free from peritone diffusion and 95% reduction in total neoplastic nodules. Intraperitone metastases are common in cancer. Administration of RM249 strongly inhibited growth of ovarian metastases HER+ MDA-Breast cells. Brain metastases also reduced. Cumulatively, intraper administration HER-redirected oncolytic HSV reduced growth ovarian and breast disseminated to peritone cavity.
Researchers have identified Sfi, a conserved component of centrosomes, as the first cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) substrate required to restrict centrosome duplication to once per cell cycle. Centrosome duplication is essential for bipolar spindle formation and genome maintenance, and is controlled in part by cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk). The study found that reducing Cdk phosphorylation of S1 by changing phosphorylation sites to non-phosphorylatable residues leads to defects in separation of duplicated spindle bodies (SPBs, centrosomes) and inappropriate SP duplication during mitosis. Cells also display defects in spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and growth. Phosphorylation of S1 by Cdk has a dual function in promoting SP separation for spindle formation and preventing premature SP duplication. Additionally, the protein phosphatase C14 has a converse role in licensing, likely dephosphorylation of S1.
HIV-1 Protein Vpr Exploits Proliferating CD4+ T Cells to Accelerate Viral Replication during Acute Infection

Researchers have investigated the role of the HIV-1-encoded protein Vpr in HIV infection and its contribution to the development of AIDS. Previous studies have shown that Vpr causes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in HIV-infected cells in vitro, and is conserved in transmitted/founder HIV-1 and primate lentiviruses. However, direct evidence in vivo has been lacking. Using a humanized mouse model, V was found to cause cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in proliferating CCR+ CD+ T cells, mainly regulatory Tregs, leading to depletion and enhanced virus production during acute infection. V-dependent replication and T depletion observed in C5ropic but not CX4ropic HIV-infected mice, suggesting dependence on coreceptor usage by HIV. Immune activation in Cropic wild-type but not V-deficient HIV-infected mice. Treatment with denileuk difoxin (DD) to deplete Tregs resulted in massive proliferation of memory cells compared to untreated. This proliferation enhanced C expression in memory cells and made them susceptible to Cropic wild-type HIV than V-deficient virus. Results suggest V exploits proliferating C CD+ cells for Cropic HIV-1. Tregs, in higher cycling state than other subsets, appear vulnerable to V during acute infection.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the genetic changes in the Plasmodium vivax population in South Korea from 1994 to 2008 using microsatellite DNA markers. The parasite was eliminated in the late 1970s but re-emerged in 1993. The study analyzed 14 microsatellite loci from 163 isolates to understand the population structure and transmission dynamics. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and genetic differentiation were analyzed to estimate temporal changes in the population. The results showed a decrease in LD levels and genetic differentiation between successive years. A Bayesian analysis suggested a drastic change in the Korean population between 2002 and 2003. Relapse and asymptomatic parasite carriage may have influenced the structure to some extent. However, the study suggests introduction of P. viv into Korea from other populations, possibly from North Korea during 200 and 200. Microsatellite DNA analysis of P. viv is effective for assessing population and transmission dynamics, aiding malaria elimination in endemic areas.
Researchers investigated the role of splicing-competent introns in regulating promoter directionality of transcription in eukaryotes. They employed strand-specific transcription run-on (TRO) analysis to show that the presence of an intron favors transcription of mRNA over antisense transcripts from the promoter. Mutation of the 5' or 3' splice site reversed promoter direction, indicating that the entire splicing-competent intr, not just the 5' site, regulates direction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed recruitment of termination factors near the promoter with intron. Removal or mutation of splice sites affected termination factor localization. The study built on previous findings that intron-mediated transcription enhancement depends on gene looping, showing looping is crucial for termination factor recruitment in the promoter-prox region of intr-containing genes. In a looping-deficient mutant, despite normal splicing, termination factors for poly(A)-dependent transcription were compromised, accompanied by loss of direction. The results propose that intron-dependent looping positions terminator factors near the promoter for antisense transcription termination, conferring direction.
Researchers have identified a novel transcription factor, ZBED, derived from a domesticated DNA transposon, which regulates IGF2 expression and muscle growth. A single nucleotide substitution in intron 3 of IGF in pigs leads to a 3-fold upregulation of IGF in skeletal muscle, resulting in major effects on muscle size, heart, and fat deposition. ZBED is a previously unknown protein specific to placental mammals, and silencing it in C2C12 myoblasts affects Igf expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing identified 2,500 ZBED binding sites in the genome, with a consensus motif matching the established IGF2 binding site. Genes associated with ZBED sites show significant enrichment in Gene Ontology classifications, including development and transcriptional regulation. In mutant pigs and ZBED-silenced C2 mylasts, extreme conservation, nucleolar localization, broad distribution, and target genes with essential functions suggest ZBED's importance in placental development, proliferation, and growth.
Researchers have used next-generation sequencing technology to study the RNA editing process in rhesus macaque, a close relative of humans, to gain a deeper understanding of this regulatory mechanism. By analyzing genome and transcriptome sequencing of multiple tissues from the same animal, they identified 31,250 editing sites, with 99.8% being A-to-G transitions. The study verified 96.6% of sites in coding regions and 97.5% in non-coding regions, demonstrating the feasibility of their experimental approach. Evidence suggests adenosine deamination is associated with macaque editome, with A-to-G sites flanked by ADAR substrates, and AD sequence and expression relevant in determining editing variance across sites and tissue types. The study found evolutionary constraint maintaining some editing sites with double-stranded structure, supporting the "tinkering" model of functional site origination. The rhes macaque editome highlights RNA regulation in primate evolution and provides a framework for understanding human editing.
Researchers have investigated the optimal decoding of sensory responses in two-alternative visual discrimination tasks, where noisy neural responses are integrated to form a reliable representation of the likelihood that a stimulus evoked the observed responses. An ideal observer should evaluate likelihood with high precision and consider only the likelihood of relevant stimuli in the task. However, a new perceptual bias reveals that observers decode likelihood with low precision when discriminating spatial frequencies. Spectrally filtered noise induced asymmetry in likelihood of spatial frequency, mainly affecting irrelevant frequencies. A significant shift in perceived grating frequency indicates observers evaluate a range of irrelevant frequencies, discarding prior knowledge of alternatives in two-altern discrimination.
Researchers have discovered that Caenorhabditis elegans piRNAs, which play a crucial role in defending the genome against foreign genetic elements, are autonomous transcriptional units. Unlike other organisms, where piRNAs are derived from a long polycistronic RNA, Caenorhabdis elegans piRNAs have a minimal 21-nucleotide piRNA sequence and a 50-nucleotide upstream motif for expression. A novel in vivo transgenic system and computational analysis revealed that the upstream motif is necessary for germline-enriched, Pi-dependent piRNA expression. A single nucleotide within the motif determines germline enrichment. Approximately 70% of Caenorhabdis elegans piRNAs are selectively expressed in male or female germline, and their target genes suggest independent evolution. The study found that Caenorhabis piRNA upstream motifs act as promoters, specifying which sequences are expressed as piRNAs, their abundance, and germl. The Caenorhabis genome encodes over 15,000 unique pi sequences, rivaling the number of mRNA genes.
Brucella species, a type of bacteria, replicate within host cells by forming endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived vacuoles. The mechanism by which they are sequestered into vacoles and obtain a continuous membrane supply for replication is unclear. Researchers investigated this process and found that during Bruc infection, the IRE pathway of the unfolded protein response (UPR) was activated in a time-dependent manner, while PER and ATF pathways were not. Additionally, COPI vesicle components Sar, Sec23, and Sec24 were upregulated. Fluorescent and electron microscopy showed marked accretion of ER-derived vacoles around replicating bacteria. A novel host factor, Y1, was identified for activation of IRE pathway in response to tunic treatment and infection. Y is responsible for phosphorylation of I through high-order assembly of Ire molecules at ER exit sites under UP conditions. Y-knockdown cells failed to generate ER-derived vacoles and remained in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Activation of I pathway and ER-derived vacole formation are critical for Br to establish replication, and is indispensable. Autophagy proteins Atg and WI, but not D, required for biogenesis of ER-derived compartments. A model for intracellular Bruc replication was proposed, exploiting UPR and ER-derived vacole machineries, dependent on Y-mediated I activation.
Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and carnation Italian ring spot virus (CV) recruit the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) into the viral replication compartment. The kinase activity of V34 is essential for TV replication, indicating that PI(3) phosphoinoside is utilized by TV for replication compartment formation. Increased expression of V34 and higher abundance of PI(3 are observed in the presence of tombusiral proteins, leading to efficient TV replication. Overexpression of PI3 phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibits TV replication on peroxomal membranes and CV on mitochondrial membranes. Purified PI3 phosphatase reduces TV replication in a cell-free system. Detection of PI with antibody or probe reveals PI enrichment in replication compartment. V34 is recruited through interaction with p33 protein. Gene analysis in yeast shows TV requires vesicle function of V34. Absence of V34, TV cannot recruit Rab-positive endosomes, providing membranes for TV compartment biogenesis. V34 and PI are needed for p33 protein stability, degraded by 26 proteasome when PI3 is decreased by V34 inhibitor.
Researchers conducted a study to assess the feasibility of feeding Aedes aegypt mosquitoes on deng virus-infected human volunteers for vector competence studies in Iqu, Peru. The study aimed to examine the transmission of deng virus (DENV) from humans to mosquitoes, a critical component of deng epidemiology. A total of 58 participants, aged 5 years or older with 5 or fewer days of fever, were enrolled from clinic and neighborhood studies on deng in Iqu between 2011 and 2015. Wild, laboratory-reared Aedes aegypt mosquitoes were fed on feile individuals or blood collected from participants, either untreated or treated with EDTA. Mosquitoes were tested after 14 days of extrinsic incubation for DENV infection and dissemination. Infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different between direct and indirect-ED feeding, but were lower for mosquitoes fed on blood without additive. Direct feeding showed greater variation following indirect-ED than indirect-no feeding. Dissemination rates were similar across all methods. No differences were detected in D infection or dissemination in mosquitoes fed on participants with different deng severity. The study demonstrates the feasibility of direct and indirect feeding for field-based studies on competence. Direct feeding is preferable in terms of ease, biosecurity, and reliability.
Researchers investigated the variability in response to topoisomerase poisons among patients using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism. They found that wild-type strains of C. elegans exhibit differences in sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs targeting topoisomerase II. An unbiased genetic approach revealed that a methionine-to-glutamine substitution in topoisomerase II (TOP-2) is responsible for this variation. The presence of non-polar methion at this residue enhances hydrophobic interactions with etoposide, a topoisomerase poison, compared to polar glutamine. This stabilizes the interaction, leading to increased genomic instability in strains with methion-containing TOP-2. The affected residue is conserved from yeast to humans and differs between human topoisomerase isoforms (methion in hTOIα and glut in hIβ). This difference influences cytotoxicity of topois poisons in human cell lines, explaining why hIα and hβ are differentially affected by poisons.
Researchers investigated the genetic factors contributing to longevity in long-lived rodents, specifically the naked mole rat, which has a lifespan multiple times longer than its phylogenetically related species. They analyzed genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species and identified 250 positively selected genes (PSGs) associated with longevity. The PSGs in long-lived naked mole rats and short-lived rats showed an expression pattern consistent with the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging, suggesting a trade-off between longevity and other traits. The PSGs were enriched in genes related to cellular respiration, ion homeostasis, and processes regulated by the mTOR pathway, including translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Notably, PSGs included RHEB, a regulator of mTOR, IGF1, central to aging pathways, and previously unknown aging-associated genes RBL, AM2, PSM1, and GER. Protein modeling revealed functional consequences of amino acid changes under positive selection.
Researchers have developed a new strategy to control the Aedes aegypti population by exploiting the endosymbiont Wolbachia to produce sterile males and females with reduced vector competence. Aedes aegypt transfection (ARP-M) was generated by introducing Wolbach in the ARP line, which had previously replaced Alb and Alb Wolbach with Wip. Various infection and fitness parameters were studied by comparing ARP-M, ARP, and wild-type (SANG) Aedes aegypt sharing the same genetic background. ARP-M showed 100% maternal inheritance of Mel and Wip Wolbach. Survival, fecundity, and fertility did not differ between the three Aedes aegpt lines. Crosses between ARP males and S females were infertile regardless of age, while egg hatch in reverse increased from 0 to 17 with S males aging 3 to 17. When competing with S males for S females, ARP males induced sterility significantly higher than expected (Fried index 1.71 instead of 1). Wolbach density in ARP females was about 15 fold higher in ARP, mostly due Mel. This corresponded to reduced competence for chikunya and deng viruses (5 and 0 rates at 14 and 21 post) with ARP females. Results Zika did not highlight differences ARP and ARP, however, none tested ARP females transmitted ZV.
Researchers have identified a new approach to discover peptide-mediated interactions in proteins by analyzing high-resolution 3D structures. Unlike previous methods, which focus on disordered regions, this study finds that peptides adopt a defined structure upon binding to their partner domains. Analysis of known peptide interactions reveals that their structure can be characteristic of the consensus motif, enabling identification of target peptides without matching established patterns. Peptides tend to have a stretched and elongated structure, distinct from others of similar length. A machine learning strategy using Support Vector Machines incorporates structural features and interface information to identify novel interactions in known 3D protein structures. Derived consensus patterns were compared to established motifs and domains. To validate, the approach, interactomes from four organisms were scanned with new patterns, revealing significant overrepresentation of 64 domain-mot interactions, 46 previously undescribed, involving over 6,000 interactions.
Researchers investigated the cellular mechanisms underlying environmental enteropathy (EE), a condition associated with impaired nutrient malabsorption and reduced vaccine responses, in 49 adults from Lusaka, Zambia. Using confocal endomicroscopy (CLE), histology, and immunohistochemistry, and mRNA sequencing of intestinal biops, they found widespread small intestinal epithelial damage and defects at villi tips, corresponding to in vivo leakage. Circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels correlated with epithelial shedding and serum glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) levels. Zinc uptake was attenuated in 64% of individuals, reduced by HIV but positively correlated with GLP-2. A U-shaped relationship was found between LPS and villus area. Transcript analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in EE, including protective peptides and proteins. CLE, Claudin 4 immunostaining and histology identified epithelial defects as sites of bacterial translocation, with increased epithelial surface area increasing translocation burden. GLP-2 and other peptides may play a role in mucosal protection in EE.
Researchers have investigated the phenomenon of superinfection exclusion (SIE) in turnip crinkle virus (TCV), where the virus blocks re-infection of host cells by the same or similar viruses. They found that the protein p28, one of two replication proteins encoded by TCV, is responsible for SIE. p28 expressed from TCV replicon exhibits strong S to different TCV replicon. Transiently expressed p28, delivered with or ahead of T replicon, recapitulates repressive activity. p28-mediated S is enhanced by C-terminal epitope tags, but weakened by N-terminal modifications and inversely correlates with p ability to complement replication p-defective TCVon. p28 in S-positive cells form large punctate inclusions aggregating non-coales S-defective yet replication-compet p mutant. Results support model that TIE caused by multimer p complexes intercepting fresh p monomers from superector genomes, abolishing superector replication. This model may apply to other RNA viruses and offer antiviral targets.
Researchers investigated whether co-administration of a plasmid DNA encoding IL-15 (pIL-15) could improve long-term protection against Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi) infection in mice immunized with a plasm DNA vaccine encoding the T. cruzi trans-sialase (TS) gene. Mice were immunized with pTS alone or in combination with pIL-15 and assessed for immune responses using TS-specific IFN-γ ELISA, serum IgG ELISA, intracellular cytokine staining (IF-γ, TN-α, IL-2), tetramer staining, and CFSE dilution assays, and protection against lethal challenge at 1-6 months post-vaccination. Mice immunized with pTS alone developed robust TS-specific IF-γ responses and survived lethal challenge within the first 3 months following immunization. Addition of p-15 to p vaccination did not significantly alter T cell responses or protection during this early postacc period. However, mice vaccinated with both pTS and p-15 challenged 6 months postacc were significantly protected against lethal T. cruzi challenges compared to those immunized with p alone (p<0.05). Improved protection correlated with higher TS-specific IF-γ producing CD8+ T cells detected 6 months postimmun. These TS-specific T cells also expanded better in vitro re-stimulation. Co-administration of p-15 during vaccination improved long-term T cell survival, memory cell expansion, and long-term protection against T. cruzi.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism controlling Polo-like kinase (PL) protein abundance in Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite responsible for basal body segregation, flagellum attachment, and cytokinesis. A Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex composed of Cull4, DNA-binding protein TbDB1, and WD-repeat protein WDR regulates PL levels in the basal body and bilobe. WDR interacts with PL through its C-terminal PEST motif and N-terminal WD40 motif binds to TbDB. Depletion of WDR inhibits bilobe duplication and basal segregation, disrupting new flagum attachment and detachment. Consistent with PL degradation, WDR depletion causes PL accumulation in basal and bil, leading to phosphorylation of Cent2 in bil at late cycle stages. This study reveals a WD-repeat protein as PL receptor in Cull-D1 ubiquitin ligase degrading PL in basal and bil after G/S cell transition, promoting bil duplication, basal separation, and flagum adhesion.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the DEAD-box helicase DDX3 in the innate immune system, a first line of defense against microbial infections. DDX3 is a type of RNA helicase, enzymes that unwind double-stranded RNA structures. Two isoforms of DDX3, DDX3X and DDX3L, were studied in mice. Mice lacking DDXX had abnormal white blood cell composition in bone marrow and spleen, and were unable to fight off Listeria monocytogenes infection. This was due to reduced function of immune cells and impaired cytokine production. Cytokines are signaling molecules that coordinate immune responses. The study suggests DDX3 is essential for innate immunity and may contribute to sex differences in resistance to infections and inflammatory diseases.
A computational model of the insect pherone transduction cascade in the male moth olfactory neuron is presented. The model accounts for pre-effector processes, including pherom molecule translocation from air to sensillum, deactivation and interaction with receptors, and G-protein effector activation, and focuses on post-eff processes. These involve production and degradation of second messengers IP3 and DAG, opening and closing of ionic channels IP3-gated Ca2+, DAGated cation, Ca2-gated Cl, and Ca2 and voltageated K channels, and Ca2 extrusion. The network is regulated by modulators protein C and Ca2calmodulin, exerting inhibition on effector channels. The model simulates evolution of linked species and membrane response to pulse stimulation of various intensities. Parameters were fitted to measured receptor potential characteristics at pherone doses. The model captures dose-response features: wide range, amplitudes, rising and falling times, and reproduces second messenger kinetics. It suggests two depolar ionic channels play different roles at low and high pherone concentrations: DAGated cation major at low, Ca-gated Cl at middle and high. Predictions are proposed and future developments discussed.
Researchers investigated how the tumor suppressor protein p53 interacts with DNA sequences and chromatin to regulate gene expression in response to cellular stress. They mapped p53 binding and histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) in untreated and doxorubicin-treated human lymphoblast cells. The study examined relationships between p53 occupancy, gene expression, H3me, chromatin accessibility (DNase hypersensitivity), ENCODE chrom states, p53 sequence, and evolutionary conservation. Inducible p-regulated genes were associated with steady-state chromatin status. Highly inducible genes were suppressed at baseline and marked by repressive histone modifications or CTCF binding. p53 sequences in different chrom contexts showed weaker pREs in open, stronger pRE in enhancers and repressed chrom. p occupancy correlated with similarity to p consensus but inversely with existing accessibility and conservation. Occupancy at transposable element (TE) repeats was higher and correlated with stronger sequences, particularly ML1, LTRB, and Mer TEs. However, binding was not associated with adjacent gene activation. Occupied in L-like TEs had negative Phylo scores and altered H3me and DHS.
Bacterial two-component signaling systems, which rely on a phosphotransfer reaction between histidine kinases and response regulators, offer a promising target for synthetic biology due to their diversity of sensory systems. This study explores the signal-response relationship of a specific motif in two-component signaling, where a histidine kinase (HK) transfers phosphate to two separate response regulator (RR) proteins. Experimental results in bacteria and yeast show that this motif enables rapid signal termination, where one RR acts as a phosphate sink for the other (output), and implements a sigmoidal signal relationship. Two conditions on system parameters are necessary for sigmoidal-response, and key parameters control threshold and sensitivity of the signal curve. The findings are confirmed by in vitro reconstitution of the HK-RR motif in Sinorhizobium meli chemotaxis pathway, measuring the resulting signal curve. The level of sigmoid in this system can be controlled by the presence of RR and an auxiliary protein binding to HK, yielding Hill coefficients above 7. The HK-RR motif allows bacteria and yeast to implement tunable switch-like processing, providing a basis for developing threshold devices in synthetic biology.
Single-cell RNA sequencing was used to investigate heterogeneity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells treated with and without salt stress to explore population variation and identify cellular covariates influencing the stress transcriptome. The study revealed significant variation in individual yeast cells, both before and after stress. A subset of cells decoupled expression of ribosomal genes from environmental stress response, partly correlated with cell cycle but unrelated to ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging of cells expressing fluorescent regulators, including transcription factor Msn2, Dot6, S1, or kinase Hog1, showed coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Transcript analysis suggested cells maintain cellular filter decoupled bursts transcription activation but mount stress response coordinated, even in subset unstressed cells.
African trypanosomias, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei, has been found to accumulate in various organs and tissues, including the male reproductive system of mice. Through fine aspiration cytology and histopathological analysis, it was revealed that T. brucei accumulates in the stroma of the epididymis, epididymal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of the testis, but not in the lumen of epididymal duct or seminiferous tubules. This indicates that the majority of parasites are not located in immune-privileged sites. Instead, they are associated with inflammatory cell infiltration, degeneration, and tissue rupture of epididymal ducts, which may be linked to reduced fertility. In the male reproductive organs, T. bruce is exposed to a strong immune response, similar to that in the bloodstream and other tissues. The detection of a high number of parasites in this organ opens the possibility of using fine aspiration cytology as a diagnostic tool in African Trypaniasis.
Researchers investigated the plasticity of the chemoreceptor repertoire in Drosophila melanogaster to understand how chemosensation is regulated in response to environmental changes. They found that chemoreceptor genes clustered in the genome undergo independent transcriptional regulation at different developmental stages and between sexes. Expression of distinct subgroups of chemoreceptors is sensitive to reproductive state and social interactions. Exposure to opposite-sex odor alters transcript abundance of chemore genes, distinct from those showing plasticity with same-sex interactions. Covariance analysis of chemosensory genes across conditions revealed 20 small, biologically relevant modules of highly correlated transcripts. This modular organization enables fine-tuning of chemore expression in ecologically and physiologically relevant conditions.
Studies of human trisomies have revealed a significant relationship between abnormal meiotic recombination and nondisjunction at meiosis I or II. Specifically, failure to recombine or recombination events located near or far from the centromeres have been linked to the origin of trisomies. Immunofluorescence methodology can be used to identify abnormal crossover configurations by examining the meiotic recombination process in human females. Research on crossover-associated proteins, such as ML1, in human oocytes was conducted to analyze their number and distribution on nondjunction-prone chromosomes and characterize genome-wide recombination in females. Results indicate the number of ML1 foci is lower than predicted by genetic analysis, but its pattern conforms to crossover-associated protein localization. Observations of individual chromosomes provide evidence for "vulnerable" crossover in fetal oocytes, consistent with nondjunction events in adult oocytes.
Blood-feeding arthropods, such as mosquitoes and ticks, transmit diseases that impose significant public and economic burdens. When a blood-feeding arthrop bites a mammal, it injects saliva containing immunogenic compounds that facilitate feeding. Research on Leishmaniasis, Plasium and arboiral infections suggests that the immune response elicited by pre-exposure to arthrop saliva can alter disease progression if the host becomes infected. Pre-exposure to arthrop saliva has been reported to both exacerbate and limit symptoms, depending on the system in question, with implications for recovery. A model of vector-borne disease was developed to explore how pre-exposure alters vector control. Results show that abundance of pre-exposed hosts increase when control moderately increases vector mortality. If pre-exposure leads to rapid infection clearance, increasing mortality may achieve greater control. However, pre-exposure prolongs duration, e.g., through symptomatic cases unlikely to be treated, control may increase total infected. Infections may go unnoticed unless active surveillance detects subclinical individuals, providing long reservoirs for transmission and long-term consequences. Sensitivity analysis suggests negative consequences mitigated through integrated management. The effect of pre-exposure on symptoms is well-stud for leishiasis, immunological and clinical largely uncharted for other-parite-host combinations. A range of epidemiological outcomes, positive and negative for health, underscores need quantify pre-ex modulates recovery and transmission in vector-b diseases.
Leishmanias is a significant disease affecting 12 million people in 88 countries, with 2 million new cases annually. Leishmania amazonensis is a major agent in Brazil, causing localized cutaneous (L) and diffuse cutaneous (D) leishmaniasis. This study investigated the impact of host immune response on Leish phenotype and virulence by comparing the proteomes of amastigotes from BAL/c and BAL nude mice. Thymic nude mice mimic patients with diffuse cutaneous leishias, characterized by T-cell hyporesponsiveness to Leish antigens. The study identified 44 differentially expressed proteins, including those related to oxidative/nitrosive stress and proteases, and known virulence factors such as oligopeptidase (OP) and tryparedin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these proteins were increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting restrained postlational modifications in BAL/c mice. An isoform of H70 was increased in amigotes from BAL mice.
AID (Activation-Induced Deaminase) plays a crucial role in immunoglobulin gene diversification and CpG methylation during development by deaminating cytosines in DNA. However, its high mutagenic potential can lead to genomic instability and translocations in B cell malignancies. Research has shown that AID is regulated by the cell cycle, with degradation occurring more slowly in the G1 phase than in S or G2-M phases. Mutations affecting phosphorylation or catalytic activity alter AID stability and abundance. To investigate the role of cell regulation, AID was tagged to destabilize outside G1 or S2-M phases. Enforced localization in G1 accelerated somatic hypermutation and class recombination, while in S2-M compromised viability. Derivatives that accelerated hypermutation with minimal impact on viability were identified, useful for iterative mutagenesis and selection. Cell cycle regulation of A stability may be applicable to DNA repair and genome engineering.
Microbial metabolism of plant polysaccharides plays a crucial role in environmental carbon cycling, human nutrition, and industrial processes based on cellulosic bioconversion. Researchers have developed a method to analyze how microbes catabolize plantacides that integrates carbohydrate-active (CAzyme) assays, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and anaerobic screening. This method was applied to study the bacterium Clostridium phyfermentans, which ferments biomass components including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabin. The bacter ferments polysacides with variable efficiencies and prioritizes metabolism of preferred substrates. Strand RNA-seq revealed how the bacter responds to polysides by upregulating specific CAymes, transporters, and enzymes metabolize constituent sugars. Fifty-six upregulated CAymes were purified, showing polysacides degraded by multiple enzymes, often from same family but divergent specificities and localizations. CAymes were tested in combination to identify synergies between enzymes on same substrate different catalytic mechanisms.
A study was conducted in Sierra Leone to assess the impact of three rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) on lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas previously treated for onchocerciasis. From 2004 to 2008, oncherciasis was endemic in 12 of 14 health districts, while LF was endemic in all 14. Three annual MDAs were conducted in the 12 endemic districts from 2008 to 2010 with good geographic and drug coverage. A mid-term assessment was conducted in 201 to determine the impact of MDAs on LF in these districts. The prevalence and intensity of microfilariae (mf) in the 12 districts were determined using the thick film method and compared with baseline data from 2007 to 200. Overall, mf prevalence fell from 2.6% to 0.3%, a decrease of 88.5%. Prevalence was 0% in four districts: Bo, Moyamba, Kenema, Kono, and Pujun. Seven districts had reductions in mf prevalence between 70% and 95%. Only Bombali had a prevalence ≥1% and was the district with the highest baseline prevalence 6.9%. Arithmetic mean mf after MD was 17.59/ml among positive individuals, a 65% decrease from baseline 50.9/ml and 0.05/ml for the entire population, a 96% decrease from 1.32/ml. Results show mf decreased <1% in all but one district after MD.
High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA profiling, have the potential to elucidate the inner workings of microbial communities in various environments, including oceans and the human gut. A key step in analyzing such data is identifying dependencies between community members, typically achieved through correlation analysis. However, compositional data generated by these techniques, consisting of relative gene or species fractions rather than absolute abundances, can produce unreliable results. Using simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project, compositional effects are shown to be widespread, with many correlations among taxa being artificial and true correlations appearing with opposite signs. Community diversity is found to modulate the severity of compositional effects. A new approach, Spar, available at https://bitbucket.org/yonf/spar, is developed to estimate correlations from compositional data. Spar is applied to infer an ecological network of interacting species across 18 human body sites. Compared to standard correlation analysis, Spar yields 3 spurious species interactions per true interaction and misses 60% of true interactions in human microbiome data, with most errors in low-diversity samples.
Researchers investigated the role of lysozym, an antimicrobial enzyme found on mucosal surfaces, in the colonization of Streptoccus pneumoniae. Lyzym has both muramidase activity, which breaks down peptoglycan, and antimicrobial activity. Two enzymes, Pgd and Ad, modify peptogcan to confer resistance to lyzym. The study found that lyzym's antimicrobial effect is due to its muridase activity and peogly modifications are necessary for pneumoc resistance. Experiments were conducted with wild-type and pgAd mutant pneumocci in lyso sufficient (LM+) and deficient (LM-) mice. Wild-type outcompeted mutant in LM+, but not LM- mice, indicating murid activity's importance during mucosal colonization. Strains with single mutations in pg or Ad outcompeted wild-type in both LM+ and LM- mice. Findings show individual peog modifications diminish fitness during colonization. Wild pneumoc's competitive advantage in LM+ but not LM mice suggests peog modifications reduce fitness, but are outweighed by benefits of resistance to peog degrading lyzym activity.
Researchers investigated the use of NS1 antigen capture tests as an alternative method for detecting deng virus in tissue specimens from confirmed fatal deng cases in Brazil. A total of 74 tissue specimens from 23 fatal cases were analyzed, including liver, lung, kidney, brain, heart, skin, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. Three NS1 capture tests were evaluated: Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS1, and NS1 Strip. The overall deng diagnosis based on these tests was 34.7% (8/23), 60.8% (14), and 91.3% (21) respectively. Dengue EL detected NS1 in 22.9% (17) of specimens and Platelia NS in 45.9% (34). The highest sensitivity 78.3% (58) was achieved by NS Strip. The Strip was most sensitive in liver 91.3 (21), lung 71.4 (10), kidney 100 (4), brain 80 (8), spleen 66.6 (10), and thym 100 (3) compared to EL assays. This study shows NS capture as a valuable approach for postmortem deng confirmation.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive molecular analysis of 718 multiple myeloma (MM) cases to investigate differences in genetic mutations between African American (AA) and Caucasian (CA) patients. Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell malignancy with higher incidence and mortality rates in AA compared to CA. The study utilized somatic whole-exome and RNA sequencing and clinical data from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation's Compass Interim Analysis 9. Results showed significant differences in mutation frequencies between groups after correcting for self-reported race and ancestry. Notably, BCL2, BRWD, and AUT2 demonstrated higher mutation frequencies in AA cases, involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies. TP53 and IRF4 mutations were more common in CA cases. This study highlights the importance of examining diverse cohorts to understand tumor genomics across populations.
Researchers have investigated the role of passenger mutations in cancer cells, which do not affect the reproductive rate of the cell, in the evolution of cancer. These mutations provide information about the history of an individual cancer and can serve as a molecular clock. They can also be targets for immunotherapy or confer resistance to treatment. The study analyzed the expansion of a population of cancer cells describing growth of primary or metastatic lesions. They looked at the process forward in time and calculated the probabilities and frequencies of successive mutations ordered by time of appearance. They computed the likelihood of evolutionary trees, informing the phylogenetic reconstruction of cancer in individual patients. The results were then looked at in reverse time for a subclonal mutation, estimating the number of cancer cells present when the mutation arose. Exact formulas were derived for the number of subcl of any frequency. This was fitted to cancer data to estimate birth and death rates of cells in early stages of clonal expansion.
Polyglutamine (Q) expansion in exon 1 (N) of the huntingtin protein is associated with Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder. When the number of glutamines exceeds a threshold of approximately 36-40, N can form amyloid aggregates similar to those found in the disease. Misfolding of monomeric N is thought to play a key role in length-dependent aggregation. This study investigates the misolding of N monomeric N with full flanking regions to determine the molecular mechanism of N aggregation and develop strategies to inhibit aggregation. Flanking sequences surrounding the poly region play a critical role in determining structural rearrangement and aggregation of N. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on monomeric N with full flanking regions, variant missing polyproline regions hypothesized to prevent aggregation, and isolated poly peptide (Q). Three constructs were studied: N with glutamine lengths 23, 36, and 47. Results show poly peptides have positive correlation between probability to form β-rich misfold state and expansion. Flanking regions of N affect probability to form β state compared isolated Q. Polyline regions form polytype II helices decrease probability Q to form β state. Lengthening Q, first-terminal 17 residues more likely adopt β-conformation rather α-helix. This study provides structural insight N misolding and elucidates role flanking in aggregation.
CRISPRs (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Palindromic Repeats) loci and their associated cas genes form the CRIS/Cas adaptive system, a primary defense mechanism employed by bacteria and archaea against foreign nucleic acids, including phages and conjugative plasmids. Short sequences separated by repeats are derived from foreign DNA and direct interference to infections. A comprehensive analysis of shotgun metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) enabled the exploration of CRPR distribution and diversity in human-associated microbial communities and discovery of new CRPRs. A targeted assembly strategy was proposed to reconstruct CRPR arrays from whole-genome assemblies that failed to identify. For each known CRPR type from reference genomes, its repeat sequence was used to recruit reads from HMP datasets and assemble into CRPR loci; unique sequences were then extracted for analysis. Novel CRPRs or CRPR variants in whole-genome assemblies were identified and targeted to comprehensively identify CRPR across samples. The distribution of CRPRs, including 64 known and 86 novel, was largely site-specific. Several CRPR loci, including novel CRPRs, were analyzed. Streptocococcal CRPRs were identified in oral microbiomes, totaling 8,000 unique spacers; samples from the same individual site shared most spacers, while different sites from the same shared fewer, and individuals almost none, indicating niche impact on CRPR evolution. CRs were demonstrated for tracing species and virus exposure.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify light and temperature-regulated transcripts in Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode model organism. Circadian rhythms have been observed in C. elegans at the behavioral level, but are relatively non-robust and no circadian transcriptional rhythms have been identified. This study aimed to investigate whether C. elegans contains a bona fide circadian clock. Genome expression profiling revealed transcripts with rhythmic expression with 24-hour periods, sustained under constant conditions, suggesting circadian regulation. Light and temperature cycles drove gene expression, with largely nonoverlapping sets. Mutations in a cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, required for sensory transduction, abolished light and temperature-regulated gene expression, indicating environmental cues act nonautonomously entrain circadian rhythms.
Saccharomyces cerevisae RAD3 gene, a homolog of human XPD, encodes a DNA helicase of TFII complex involved in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription. Mutant alleles RAD3 (rad-101 and rad-102) exhibit defects in DNA repair and hyper-recombination (hyper-Rec) phenotypes. Previous studies linked hyper-Rec phenotype of rad-101 and rad-102 to persistent single-stranded DNA gaps converted to recombinogenic double-strand breaks (DSBs) by replication. This study characterizes hyper-Rec of rad strains using a system recovering reciprocal mitotic recombination products. Rad-101 and rad-102 elevate reciprocal crossover frequency about 100-fold. Mapping shows three-quarters of crossovers reflect DSBs at same positions in sister chromatids (double-strand breaks, DSBs). Remainder reflect DSBs in single chromatids (single-strand breaks, SCBs). Ratio DSBs to SCs similar to spontaneous recombination wild-type cells. 216 unselected genomic alterations mapped, including crossovers, conversions, deletions, and duplications. Significant association found between recombination locations and gamma-H2A2AX. Hotspots deletions and duplications at IMA and H11 near chromosome end XV. Comparison with spontaneous recombination wild-type suggests subset initiated by incomplete NER, DSBs unrepaired by sisterchromatid recombination major mitotic between homolog chromosomes.
Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, utilizes a set of simple sequence repeats (SSR) to adapt to the changing host environment during persistent infection. The SSRs generate heterogeneous populations through slipped mispairing, facilitating adaptation. This study presents a molecular model explaining how an intergenic tract, via slipped mispair, operates as a rheostat to fine-tune sabA promoter expression. T-tract variants in an isogenic strain show that tract length generates multiphas output from sab promoter, altering H. pylori binding to sial-Lewis receptors on gastric mucosa. Post-infection clones show tract length is highly variable in H. pyl, mirroring host-pathogen interplay, where bacterium generates clones with best-fit phenotypes selected in host. In silico and in vitro analyzes reveal tract length affects DNA structure and RNA polymerase binding, shifting axial alignment between promoter and UP elements. Additional H pyl genes with tract similar to sab show variations acting as rheats modulating cognate output. This mechanism, mediated by promoter-prox SSR, provides transcriptional regulation in H pyl with limited transacting factors.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) must evade innate immune surveillance to establish persistent infections and amplify its genome upon epithelial differentiation. Members of the JAK/STAT family regulate the innate response, and HPV downregulate STAT1 to maintain viral episomes. STAT5, a JAK/STAT member, modulates inflammation and cell cycle progression in response to cytokines and growth factors. Studies show HPV7 activates STAT5 phosphorylation without altering total levels. Inhibiting STAT5 phosphorylation with pimide abolishes genome amplification and late expression in differentiating keratinocytes, whereas undifferentiated cells stably maintain episomes show no effect on replication. Knockdown studies reveal STAT5 isoform is responsible, mediated through ATM damage response. Downstream STAT5, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) contributes ATM pathway members. Findings identify new mechanism innate regulator STAT5 promotes viral replication through DNA damage response.
Researchers in Kathmandu, Nepal identified 13 immunogenic Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi antigens expressed in the biliary tract of chronic carriers. These antigens were not found in healthy individuals from a typhoid endemic area. The identified antigens included putative membrane proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins. One antigen, YE (ST147), an uncharacterized protein with ATP-binding motif, showed prominent responses in screen. Responses to YE in patients with biliary tract S. Typhi were compared to those without S Typhi, patients with tyoid fever, and healthy controls in tyoid area. Seven of 10 (70%) chronic carriers, 0 of 8 (0%) bile-negative controls, 0 8 (0%) healthy, and 1 8 (12.5%) with tyoid had detectable anti-YE IgG in blood. IgA responses were also present.
Researchers investigated the role of RNA produced by homologous genomic loci in defining the transcriptional state of a silenced gene. They tested the effect of non-functional alleles of the white gene in the presence of a functional copy of white, silenced by heterochromatin. Results showed that non-functional white alleles, unable to produce a transcript, reactivated expression of a wild-type copy of the same gene silenced by heterochatin. This epigenetic phenomenon, termed transcriptional transactivation, relies on homolog RNA presence and is affected by genes involved in post-transcription silencing. Data suggest a new level of gene control by homolog RNA in heterochromatic context.
Boophil, a multifunctional kunit protease inhibitor from the midgut of the tick Rhipphalus microplus, exhibits antithrombotic activity by targeting various enzymes involved in the coagulation and complement cascades. Unlike most previously identified inhibitors found in the salivary glands, Boophil is expressed in the midut and targets thrombin, elastase, and kikrein. Amidolytic assays and surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed Boophil as a classical noncompetitive inhibitor of thrombin with respect to chromogenic substrates, dependent on both exosite and catalytic sites. This inhibition is accompanied by blockade of platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot formation in vitro. Additionally, Boophil is a noncompetitive inhibitor of FXa, preventing FIX activation, and inhibits kikin activity and its reciprocal activation, targeting the contact pathway. Boophil also abates cathepsin G and plmin-induced platelet aggregation and affects elastase cleavage of Tissue Pathway Inhibitor (TFI). In vivo, Boophil inhibits carotid occlusion triggered by Fe3 and promotes bleeding in mice tail transection. Boophil's inhibition of multiple enzymes in proteolytic cascades and cell activation plays a crucial role in maintaining midut hemostasis and inflammatory response, allowing ticks to digest blood for metabolism and egg development. Boophil is the first midut FXa inhibitor also inhibiting thrombosis.
Researchers have developed a spatially explicit model, general-purpose model of enteric tissue (SEMT) to investigate the relationship between inflammation and tissue patterning in the gut. The mucosa of the intestinal tract is a finely tuned system where structure and function are interdependent, with mucosal architecture playing a key role in diagnosis and pathophysiology of gastrointestinal diseases. Inflammation is a significant in the pathogenesis of many gastrointestinal diseases and influences mucosal architecture through morphogenic pathways. To understand the role of inflammation in enteric tissue patterning, the authors developed SEMT to represent enter epithelial tissue behavior influenced by inflammation, generating various pathophysiological processes from a common base. SEMT reproduces healthy ileal mucosal dynamics and morph knock-out experiments, providing insight into clinically relevant mechanisms, such as PTEN/PIK's role in inflammation-morphogenesis, enterocyte slough in ischemia-reper, and chronic low inflammation driving colonic metaplas. Results suggest SEMT as a platform for studying inflammation in gastrointestinal disease.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of Wolbachia, a symbiont that mitigates arbovirus transmission, in controlling Aedes aegypt populations. Traditional control methods, such as source reduction and insecticide spraying, have limited success. Models predicted a rapid increase in Wolbach-positive Ae. aegi mosquitoes due to cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) and high maternal transmission associated with wMel strain. Wolbach wMel was released for 20 weeks in Tubanga, Rio de Janeiro, achieving 87% household approval. The frequency peaked at 65% but dropped after releases stopped. High maternal transmission (97.56%) was observed. Releasing mosquitoes with low mortality and large wing length had no effect on invasion trend. Investigating lab procedures, pyrethroid resistance in wMel decreased from 68% to 3.5% after 17 generations. Initially, released mosquitoes were susceptible to pyreoids, associated with household use, jeopardizing Wolia invasion. A new strain wRio was produced by crossing wBr females with field males to introduce pyreoid resistance. wRio increased survival but negatively affected Ae.egi fecundity, reducing egg size and hatch. Despite fitness costs, wRio established where w failed, highlighting local genetics, especially insecticide background, is critical for invasion. Household support remained high at 90% for wRio. Summer temperatures above 30°C did not affect w expression on Brazilian background. Wolia should match insecticide profile to achieve invasion.
Researchers investigated the role of the vaccinia B protein in poxvirus replication and its interaction with the cellular antiviral factor BAF. They created a B deletion mutant virus (Δ1) to search for suppressor mutations and identified novel pathways involving B. After several passages of Δ1, a robust increase in viral titer was observed. Characterization of the adapted viruses revealed mutations correlating with loss of function of vaccinia B pseudokinase provided a fitness enhancement to the virus. This suggests reductive evolution drives pox adaptation. Expression of full-length B led to a fitness reduction in viruses with B defect, but no impact on wild-type or other poxviruses, indicating B possesses inhibitory activity masked by B kinase. Investigation of B attributes showed it localizes to the nucleus, a rare among poxiral proteins. B phosphorylation is reduced when B is present in cells without B, suggesting B enhances antiral activity of B. Studies of B and B present a paralog kinase-pseudase pair exhibiting epistasis in virus, potentially conserving B during pox evolution and orchestrating nuclear events during infection.
Researchers investigated the conformational behavior of two synthetic peptides, LKKKLLKKLL (L) and EAAEAAEAAE (E), with built-in amphiphicity forming an alpha-helix, using molecular dynamics simulations. These peptides are too short to form multiple structural elements and stabilize internally, resulting in a high degree of intrinsic disorder in solution. Their conformational preference is susceptible to environmental conditions such as pH, salts, or presence of interfaces. In bulk water, the peptides are neither random coils nor fully alpha-helices, but adopt multiple conformations with short lifetimes, providing a basis for conformation and population shift upon environmental changes. Differences in response to macroscopic and molecular interfaces are linked to inherent alphael tendencies in water. The peptides' aggregation is affected by presence or absence of interface, and subtly by surface charge and hydrophobicity.
Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) is a betaherpesvirus that infects humans within the first years of life and establishes latency in various cell types. The virus integrates its genome into the telomeres of host chromosomes in latently infected cells. The mechanism of integration remains unclear. Interestingly, HH-6 and other herpesviruses harbor telomeric repeats (TMR) identical to human telomeres at the ends of their genomes. The HH-6 genome contains two T arrays, perfect (pMR) and imperfect (impMR). To investigate the role of T in integration, both p and imp were deleted in the HH-6 genome and reconstituted. The T mutant replicated comparable to wild-type (wt) virus, indicating T are not essential for HH-6 replication. To assess integration, an in vitro system was established to evaluate efficiency and maintenance in latently infected cells. Integration of HH-6 was impaired in absence of T, and the genome was rapidly lost, suggesting integration is crucial for maintenance. Individual deletion of p and imp revealed p play major role in HH-6 integration, while imp only minor, allowing a model for HH-6 integration. Data show that HH- T are dispensable for replication but crucial for integration and maintenance in latently infected cells.
Researchers have determined the 2.6 Å crystal structure of vaccinia virus protein D13, a key component of the outer scaffold of viral crescent precursors. D13 folds into a jellyroll structure with a novel head domain and assembles into trimers homologous to double-barrel capsid proteins of adenovirus and lipid icosahedral viruses. When tethered onto artificial membranes, D forms a honeycomb lattice assembly structurally similar to viral crescent and immature particles. The architecture of the D honeycomb and lipid-remodeling abilities of D support a model of assembly similar to mimivirus. Poxviruses, unlike enveloped viruses, produce infectious particles without acquiring internal membranes through cellular compartments. Instead, immature particles are generated from crescent-shaped precursors with contentious composition. The findings establish the first step of poxvirus morphogenesis utilizes a lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosahedral viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. D13 is a target of rifampicin and its structure will aid poxirus assembly inhibitors development.
Researchers studied the role of auxin and ethylene in root development in Brachodium distyon, a monocotyledonous plant, and compared it to Arabidopsis, a dicotyledon. Auxin biosynthesis via indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA) is essential for root development in Arabidopsis, requiring TRYOPHANINAMOTANSFER OF ARABOPSIS 1 (T1) and T1-RELATED (TAR) genes. A promoter-DNA insertion in Brachodium TAR-LIKE (BdARL) downregulates expression, reducing tryptophaninotransferase activity, creating a hypomorphic Bdt2 allele (Bdt2ypo). Unexpectedly, dtypo mutants display elongated roots due to enhanced cell elongation. This phenotype is also seen in a stronger dt2 allele and mimicked by treating wild-type with L-kyunine, a T1/TAR inhibitor. Lkyine-treated and dt roots show elevated, not reduced auxin levels, not due to alternative biosynthesis, but increased expression of YCCA genes, rate-limiting IPA to auxin conversion. YCCA are downregulated by ethylene precursor 1-aminoclopropane-1-carboxy-acid (ACC) and upregulated in eth-signaling component mutant ethylene 2-like 1, also displaying dt phenotype. dt phenotypes differ from Arabid t1/t mutants with reduced growth and aux levels. This may be due to Brach eth inhibiting IPA-dependent rate-limiting step, conferring suboptimal aux levels for cell elong, suggested by observations. Results reveal local aux and ethylene homeostasis control elong in Brach roots and alternative aux-ethylene crosstalk wiring compared Arabid.
In a study on the evolution of gene expression in budding yeast species, researchers found that the rate of gene divergence correlates with the organization of their promoter nucleosomes. Specifically, genes lacking a nucleosome-free region (Occupied Prox Nucle, OP) vary widely between species, while those containing a nucleosome-free region (Depleted Prox Nucle, DPN) remain conserved. To investigate the role of early dynamics in this divergence, the team artificially selected for high expression of GFP-tagged proteins. Surprisingly, selection was successful for both OP and DPN genes, with 80% of each group increasing expression by a similar amount. Notably, the two groups adapted through distinct mechanisms: DPN-selected strains duplicated genomic regions, while OP-selected favored mutations not duplications. When selection was removed, DPN but not OP genes reverted to wild-type levels, consistent with lower diversity between species. The study suggests that promoter organization constrains early dynamics and biases long-term evolution.
Human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) transactivator/oncoprotein Tax activates Iκ kinases (IKs) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κ) to promote cell proliferation and transformation. However, Tax expression in most cells leads to upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21IP/W1 and p27IP, causing p53/pR-independent cellular senescence. This study demonstrates that p21IP/W1/p27-mediated senescence constitutes a checkpoint against IK/NFκ hyperactivation. Senescence induced by Tax in HeLa cells is attenuated by mutations that reduce IK/NF activation and prevented by blocking NFκ using degradation-resistant mutant Iκα despite constitutive IK activation. Small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown indicates RelA induces senescence by acting upstream anaphase complex and Rel to stabilize p27IP and p21 mRNA. Downregulation NFκ by HT-1 antisense protein HB delays or prevents Tax-induced senescence. The balance between Tax and HB expression determines HT-1 infection outcome. Elevated HT replication and Tax drive IK/NF hyperactivation and senescence, while HB modulates Tax-mediated replication and NF activation, allowing HT-infected cells to proliferate and persist.
The frontal lobe plays a crucial role in decision-making and executive control, governing the selection and coordination of goal-directed behaviors. Current models of executive function fail to explain decision-making in uncertain, changing, and open-ended situations. A computational model of executive function is proposed to address this issue. Behavioral experiments demonstrate that the model predicts human decisions and variations across individuals in natural situations. The model reveals that the frontal lobe monitors up to four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers their ability to predict outcomes, selecting the most reliable strategy to guide action and maximize rewards. If unreliable, a new strategy is formed from stored memory, probed, and confirmed to drive action. The executive has a limited capacity for three to four strategies, compensated by a binary control structure promoting exploration and creation of new strategies in ambiguous situations. Results support a model integrating reasoning, learning, and creativity in decision and adaptive behavior.
Researchers have developed a new approach called Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations Parameter Trajectories (ADAPT) to study the long-term effects of pharmacological treatments and their potential side effects. A time-dependent model of molecular adaptations is used to analyze the dynamics of changes in biological systems during treatment. This approach identifies necessary changes in model parameters to describe transitions between different stages of treatment, providing insight into affected biological systems and molecular events. ADAPT captures interactions between proteome and transcriptome levels, often less understood, through time-dependent parameter descriptions. The method was applied to investigate adaptations induced by pharmacological activation of liver receptor X (LXR), a potential target for atherosclerosis treatment. Trajectories showed a cascade of adaptations, revealing a counterintuitive function of scavenger receptor B1 (SR1), facilitating hepatic cholesterol uptake. Although LXR activation promotes cholesterol efflux and excretion, analysis showed reduced hepatic capacity to clear cholesterol upon prolonged treatment, confirmed by immunoblot measurements of SR1 in hepatic membranes. Additionally, ADAPT was used to identify potential side effects and design interventions to prevent them.
Researchers have investigated the processing of multi-dimensional sensorimotor information in the spinal and cerebellar neuronal circuitry, focusing on why sensory and motor signals are combined in the neurons of the spinocerebell pathways and how granule cells receive this input with respect to their output. A new hypothesis is proposed on how the spinerebell systems and cerebell cortex interact to support coordination of multi-segment limbs and bodies. The recombination of signals to the spinerebell neurons can approximate spatial and temporal dependencies between limb segments, necessary for coordination. However, random recombination of sensory and motor signals is limited by the number of granule cells, which restricts the number of recombinations. Instead, the spinal circuit provides useful recombinations described as linear projections of multi-dimensional input space. Granule cells, aided by Golgi cells, enhance these projections allowing Purkinje cells to approximate non-linear functions. The hypothesis provides a novel view on spinal and cerebell gran layer function, illustrating cerebell coordination supported by spinere recombinations.
Researchers employed next-generation sequencing to investigate the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) during Chikungunya virus (CHV) development in the mosquito vector Aedes albopictus. The study identified 88 known and 79 miRNAs in uninfected and CHV infected Ae. albictus cell lines, respectively, and nine novel miRNAs in Ae. albict. Comparison of the two libraries revealed differential expression of 77 miRN between CHV infection. Specifically, CHV altered the mi profile of eight miRN. The putative targets of these miRN were classified into pathways. This study identified and described mi profiles upon CHV in Ae. albict, providing insight into cellular modification by mi during CHV infection and potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies.
A study was conducted to determine the economic burden of Cysticercosis (CE) in Iran. CE is a parasitic disease affecting humans and livestock, with significant medical and economic importance in developing countries, including Iran. Data on epidemiology, including prevalence and incidence in humans and animals, were obtained from hospitals, literature, and government reports. Economic data on human and animal disease, including treatment costs, productivity, and livestock losses were from national and international datasets. Monte Carlo methods represented uncertainty in parameters. Estimated 1,295 surgical cases per year 2000-2009, and 635,232 asymptomatic individuals (95%CI 149,466-1,120,998). Annual CE cost in Iran was $232.3 million (95% CI $103.1-397.8), including direct and indirect costs. Human cost was $93.3 million (95 CI $6.1-222.7) and livestock $132 million (95 CI $61.8-246.5). Per case was $1,539. CE has considerable impact on Iran, approximating 0.03% of country's domestic product. A surveillance system and control program are necessary to reduce burden. Cost-benefit analysis programs recommended incorporating losses in Iran.
Mousepolyomavirus (MPV) is a lytic virus that infects mouse cells, transforms cell culture, and is highly oncogenic in rodents. Researchers used deep sequencing to analyze MPV infection of NIH3T cells at various times post-infection and analyzed both viral and cellular transcriptomes. The analysis revealed a transcriptional profile of early-to-late switch with both early-strand and late-strand RNAs transcribed at all times. Novel insights into viral expression emerged, including widespread RNA editing of transcripts late in infection. By late infection, 359 host genes were significantly upregulated and 857 downregulated. Gene ontology indicated transcripts involved translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover upregulated, while extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc binding, SH domain and GTP activation downregulated. Noncoding RNAs levels altered, noncoding MAL1, involved splicing and marker late cancers, downregulated, while others strongly upregulated.
Hundreds of thousands of runners attempt to complete a marathon each year, with over two-fifths experiencing severe performance-limiting depletion of physiologic carbohydrate reserves, known as "hitting the wall", resulting in thousands dropping out before the finish. Analyses of endurance physiology have suggested that glycogen reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon, making "hitting the wall" inevitable, or that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete a marathon without "hitting the wall". A computational study demonstrates that energetic constraints on runners are more subtle, depending on physi variables including muscle distribution, liver glycogen density, and running intensity as a fraction of aerobic capacity. The study estimates distance at which runners exhaust glyc stores as a function of intensity, providing a basis for ensuring safety and optimizing performance by setting paces and prescribing mid-race fueling to avoid "the wall". The analysis sheds light on standards in running that have remained empirically defined, such as Boston Marathon qualifying times.
Researchers conducted a transcriptional analysis of murine macrophages infected with different Toxoplas strains to identify novel regulation of host signaling pathways. Toxoplas from Europe and North America belong to three distinct genetic lineages (I, II, and III), whereas South American isolates are rare and diverse. T. gondii strains exhibit various phenotypes in mice, such as virulence, persistence, oral infectivity, migratory capacity, cytokine induction, and host gene expression modulation. Toxoplasis outcomes vary, and the parasite genotype is hypothesized to play a role besides host and environmental factors. Macrophages are crucial in early immune response against T. gondii and preferentially infected in vivo. To determine non-canonical Tooplas interactions, murine macrophages were infected with 29 Tooplas strains representing diversity, and RNA-sequencing analyzed host and parasite transcriptomes. Large differences were found in parasite effector expression and chromosomal variation in some strains. Novel strain-specific host pathways were identified, including type I interferon regulation by atypical strains. IFβ production was associated with parasite killing, independent of interferon gamma, dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors in macroph and cytoplasmic receptor retic-inducible gene 1 (RIG) in fibroblasts.
Researchers have investigated the process of recombination in enteroviruses, a mechanism that allows for the acquisition of new genetic material and is crucial for the emergence of novel pathogenic variants of poliovirus. Despite its importance, the recombination process remains poorly understood. A novel genetic approach was used to isolate chimeric interic poliruses with duplicated sequences at the recombination junction. Serial passage of viruses with imprecise junctions yielded progeny with increased fitness, which lost the duplicated sequences. Mutations affecting polymerase fidelity or replication complexes altered recombination yield, but not non-recombination. This suggests recombination is replicative and can be enhanced or reduced. The study proposes that recombinants result from a biphasic process: initial recombination followed by resolution, deleting extraneous sequences and optimizing fitness. This has implications for understanding evolution in positive-strand RNA viruses.
Researchers have identified a new catecholamine clearance route in adipocytes, specifically in white adipose tissue, mediated by the organic anion transporter 3 (Oct3, also known as Slc22a3). This route is distinct from previously reported mechanisms involving sympathetic neurons or pro-inflammatory macrophages in adipose tissues. Oct3 is highly expressed in white adipose tissue and displays the highest uptake rate of norepinephrine (NE) compared to other routes. Adipocytes express high levels of degradation enzymes monoamine oxidase A (Mao), monoamine oxidase B (Mob), and catechol O-methyltransferase (Comt), enabling NE clearance by adipocytes and reuptake Oct3. Administration of Oct ablation induces higher thermogenesis and lipolysis compared to littermate controls. After prolonged cold challenge, inguinal white adipose adipose tissue (WAT) in Oct-deficient mice shows stronger browning and elevated thermogenic gene expression than littermates, involving β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR)/protein kinase (PKA)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-responsive element binding (CRE) pathway. Glycolytic genes are reprogrammed to compensate for ATP loss in adip-specific Oct knockout (KO) mice. Inhibition β-AR abolishes lipolytic and thermogenic activities in Oct-deficient WAT, indicating NE overload in vicinity adipocytes OctKO. Reduced alleles in OCT are associated with increased basal metabolic rate (BMR). Oct governs β-activity as NE transporter in adipocytes, offering therapeutic potential for metabolic disorders.
Heterochromatin-enriched HP proteins, specifically HP1, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression by binding to histone H3 tails methylated on lysine 9 via their chrom-domain. However, their affinity for methylated chromatin is poor in vivo and in vitro, and chromatin opening during replication facilitates their binding to nucleosomes. This led to the investigation of additional histone binding activities of HP proteins. The chromadow-domain of HP interacts with histone H3 in a region inside the nucleosomal barrel, the entry/exit point of the nucleosome. This region is also contacted by the catalytic subunits of the SWI/SNF complex. In vitro, SW/SNF remodeling requires this contact and is inhibited by HP proteins. Antagonism between SW/SNF and HP is observed on interferon-regulated genes. SW/S activity loads HP to chromatin in vivo and vitro. Our data suggest HP chromadow-domains benefit nucleosomal opening to bind chromatin and HP use this to arrest chrom remodeling.
Researchers investigated the property of self-containment in RNA structures, which refers to the tendency of an RNA sequence to maintain its optimal secondary structure regardless of its surrounding nucleotide context. They defined self-containment using a scoring method called the self-containment index and found that microRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit high self-containment, consistent with the requirement for structural invariance imposed by the miRNA biogenesis pathway. In contrast, most other structured RNAs do not display self-containment. Further analysis revealed a trend towards higher self-containment among conserved miRNAs, suggesting that self-containment may be a characteristic of miRN acquiring new genomic contexts. The study also found that miRNAs display enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs and a trend towards natural selection for self-cont in functional classes. The authors propose that self-cont arises from selection for robustness against perturbations during biogenesis and modular composition of function.
Researchers have identified four transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis that play a crucial role in limiting the spread of necrotrophic fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea and Plectphaella cucumeria. Mutations in these TFs result in increased susceptibility to these pathogens and activation of non-immune host processes that contribute to disease. Transcriptome analysis revealed a common transcriptional signature of 77 up-regulated genes in mutants. Several of these up-regulated genes encode secreted peptides, named PROIR (provirulence factors), which are important for disease susceptibility to necrophic pathogens.
Researchers have identified the transcription factor Forkhead Box 1 (FOX1) as a critical regulator of endometrial receptivity for embryo implantation. In a study using the progesterone receptor (PGR) Cre mouse model, uterine ablation of Fox1 resulted in infertility due to altered epithelial cell polarity and apoptosis, preventing embryo penetration of the luminal epithelium. Analysis of the utine transcriptome after Fox1 ablation revealed changes in gene expression for cell activation, invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, β-caten (CTN1) signaling, and increased progesterone receptor (PGR) signaling. Increased PGR signaling was due to PGR retention in the utine epithelium during the window of receptivity. Constitutive expression of epithelial P during this period inhibited FOX1 in the nucleus of utine epithelium. Reciprocal expression of P and FOX1 was observed in human endrial samples during proliferative and secretory phases. The study demonstrates FOX1 and loss of P during receptivity are interrelated for implantation.
Researchers developed a statistical model to map the spread of deng cases in Bangladesh, accounting for underreporting due to zero-inflation. They analyzed district-level monthly deng cases from 2000 to 2009, using a negative binomial generalized linear mixed model with spatial and temporal effects. Bayesian inference was performed using the integrated Laplace approximation. The study found that mean temperature and its interaction with mean diurnal range, lagged by two months, were significantly associated with deng incidence. Mean rainfall two months prior was positively associated with deng. Densely populated districts and those bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence than others. The model estimated 92% of annual deng cases occurred between August and September. Cases were reported across the country, with 94 in the capital Dhaka, located centrally. Less than half of reported cases were observed from surveillance data. The proportion varied by month, with higher in high-incidence districts, decreasing towards the end of transmission.
In a novel environment, mice exhibit a preference for a specific location marked by the highest number of visits and cumulative time spent, which serves as a reference point for exploratory behavior. Examination of this "home" base" highlights its organizational features. Researchers investigated other types of marked places in exploratory behavior and their influence on overall behavior, discovering "knots" in a large arena. Knots are circumscribed areas with tortuous paths of twists and turns, characterized by high inbound speed and low outbound speed. Typically, one knot per session, with distinct boundaries, maintained within and across sessions, situated away from walls. Knots differ from "home" features, except for high inbound speed and low outbound speed. Knot establishment is enhanced by saline injection and placement in exposed arena, suggesting stress and arousal consolidate long-term contingency between locale and knot-scribling. In a cue-free environment, mice mark locale with twisting and turning, creating a self-generated, centrally located landmark. Knotcribling implies multiple views of the environment, allowing recalibration of locale and compass. Vestibular input from scribling improves scene interpretation.
High-Resolution Genetics Identifies Lipid Transfer Protein Sec14 as Target for Antifungal Compound NG04

Invasive fungal infections caused by pathogens result in over 1.6 million deaths worldwide annually. A high-throughput screening identified the ergoline compound NG04 as an antifungal agent with selectivity over mammalian cells. High-resolution chemogenomics revealed lipid transfer protein Sec14 as the target of NG04, with resistant mutations in Sec14 defining compound interactions in the protein's binding pocket. Beyond its lipid transfer function in pathogenic fungi, Sec14 is involved in secretion of virulence determinants essential for pathogenicity of fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans, making Sec14 an attractive antif target. Consistent with dual function, NG04 inhibits growth of clinical isolates C neo and NG04-related compounds show equal potency against neo. NG04 analogues exhibit fungicidal activity against fluconazole-resistant neo strain. We present genetic evidence NG04 inhibits Sec14, supporting NG as novel antif starting point.
Researchers have identified mefloquine, an antimalarial drug, as a potential treatment for schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease that exacerbates poverty. Current treatment relies on a single drug, prazantel, which may lead to drug-resistant parasites, necessitating new antischosomal compounds. Mefloquine was tested in mice infected with Schistoma mansoni and S japonicum, resulting in significant worm burden reductions (72.3-100%) after a single oral dose of 200-400mg/kg. High reductions were also observed in young stages of S mansoni and japon in mice. Both meflo enantiomers showed comparable worm reductions in subpatent and patent S mans infections. These findings suggest a novel antischosomal drug based on aminoal functionality. Further in vitro and in vivo studies aim to elucidate meflo's mechanism and effect on S haobium and other trematodes.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to map the geographical distribution of podoiosis, a non-filar elephantias characterized by massive swelling of the lower legs. Podoiosis was identified as a neglected disease by the World Health Organization in 2011. A multi-stage sampling design stratified the country by environmental risk of podoiosis, sampling 76 villages from 40 districts in 10 regions. All individuals 15 years or older in villages were surveyed and screened for lymphedema. A clinical algorithm diagnosed podoiosis excluding filarial lymphema. Individuals with lymphema were tested for Wuchereria bancrofti antigen and IgG using Alere Filasis Strips (F) test and Standard Diagnostics (SD) BIOL lymphatic filariasis Ig4 (W123) tests, and thick films. 10,178 individuals from 4,603 households participated, 83 with lymphema were identified, 2 were F positive and negative W123.

Notch Signaling Mediates the Age-Associated Decrease in Adhesion of Germl Stem Cells to Niche

In Drosophila female germline stem cells (GSCs), Notch signaling is increased with age, leading to their removal from the niche. Low levels of Notch signaling in GSCs result in increased adhesion to the niche, outcompeting neighbors with higher levels of Notch. Adhesion is regulated by E-cadherin expression. Notch signaling in Gs hastens age-dependent loss from niche, partially mediated by Sex. Disruption of Not signaling in Gs does not delay G loss during aging, nor affects BMP, which promotes self-renew of Gs. In contrast, niche Not activation maintains niche integrity, mediating G retention, is reduced with age, indicating Not regulates niche occupancy both intrinsically and extrinsically.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL97 protein, a kinase, phosphorylates the retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor suppressor and lamin A proteins, which are also substrates of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). A functional complementation assay showed UL97 has CDK-like activity. Seven human herpesviruses encode a kinase with sequence homology to UL97, termed conserved herpesvirus kinases (CHPs). To determine if UL97 CDK-like activity was shared by all CHPs, each protein was expressed in human cells to test R phosphorylation, lamin A phosphorylation, and nuclear disruption, or S. cerevisiae cdc-13 to assay CD function. All beta and gamma-herpes CHPs phosphorylated R and lamin, disrupted nuclear, while alpha-herpes did not. Similarly, all but one beta and gamma CHPs displayed CD activity in S. cerevisiae, while alpha did not. This identified virally CD-like kinases, abbreviated v-CDKs. Non-CD activities of UL97, promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies (PMLBs) and cytoplasmic nuclear aggres, showed conservation among CHPs, not segregating specific families. Genomic conservation not maintained at functional level. Data indicate related kinases, some antiviral drugs targets, serve overlapping functions during infections.
A systematic review was conducted to determine the global distribution of Burkholderia pseudallei, a Tier 1 select agent and cause of melioidosis, in the environment. The study aimed to update the risk map of meloidosis and propose international guidelines for soil sampling. A working group, the Detection Environmental Burkholder pseudalle Working Party (DEBP), was formed during the 6th Meloidosis Congress in 2010. PubMed was searched from January 2012 to 2011 using MeSH terms pseudalle and meloidosis. Bibliographies were searched for secondary references. The geographical distribution of pseudalle in the environment was categorized as definite, probable, or possible. The methodology for detecting pseudalle was extracted and collated. Global coverage was patchy with a lack of studies in areas where meloid is suspected. Sampling and bacterial methods were variable and not robust. Consensus guidelines were developed to reduce false-negative results and provide affordable, low-tech methods for developed and developing countries. The guidelines provide a basis for an accurate global pseudalle map.
Researchers have identified peptides that inhibit the entry of denguevirus by targeting a late-stage intermediate in the fusion process. The mechanism of membrane fusion by class II viral proteins involves large-scale rearrangements of the envelope glycoprotein E, transitioning from dimers to trimers. This rearrangement occurs through the outward rotation of the ectodomain after loss of the dimer interface, followed by reassociation into trimers. A 55-residue membrane-proximal stem then zips up domain II, bringing the transmembrane segments of the C-terminus and fusion loops of domain II together. Peptides derived from the stem of deng-virus bind to E stem-less trimer, a conformation intermediate in vitro. Assays show these peptides block viral fusion and infectivity with potency proportional to their affinity for the conformation intermediate, even when peptide is removed from preincubated inoculum before infecting cells. The peptides bind virions before attachment and are carried into endosomes, where acidification initiates fusion. Binding depends on dynamics, as there is no inhibition if preincation and separation at 4°C rather 37. A two-step model for the mechanism of inhibition is proposed. Targeting viral entry can block infection effectively. Data support proposed mechanisms how conformation change promotes fusion and suggest inhibiting flavivirus entry.
Researchers have developed a method to sequence the whole genome of Vibrio cholera directly from dried filter paper, enabling molecular analysis of the bacterium in resource-limited settings. Cholera causes approximately 4 million cases and 95,000 deaths annually, with recent outbreaks in Haiti and Yemen highlighting its global health concern. Specimens preserved on paper allow for rapid, low-cost, and safe sequencing, providing data on circulating strains, contributing to policy on cholera control and elimination. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) recovered a complete V. cholera O genome from stool enriched alkaline peptone water (AP) and V. cholera culture, spotted on filter, with 0.02 ng/μL DNA concentration. GS confirmed presence/absence of genes, including cholera toxin and pilus loci. GS identified diarral pathogens from AP-enriched specimen, highlighting potential for gut microbiome exploration and co-infections impacting disease severity. GS placed specimens in global cholera phylogenetic tree, identifying 7th pandemic El Tor. GS mapped reads from AP-enrich and culture isolate filter papers, providing epidemiological information on V. cholera strains in remote settings. This identified co-infecting pathogens and rare V. cholera strains in choleraemic areas.
Researchers have identified a protein called Dyne that plays a crucial role in regulating epithelial polarity in Drosophila follicle cells. Epithelial polarity is essential for the proper organization and function of epithelial tissues, and is maintained by the precise localization of apical and basolateral determinants. However, little was known about how these determinants are localized within the cell. A genetic screen for epithelial defects in Drosila follicle cells revealed that Dyne is essential for apico-basal polarity. Dy acts through the cytoplasmic scaffolding protein Stardust (Sdt) to localize the transmembrane protein Crumbs, by targeting specific dt mRNA isoforms to the apical region. The mRNA localization signal was mapped to an alternatively spliced exon. The presence or absence of this exon corresponds to a developmental switch in dt mRNA localization, with apical transcripts found in early stages of epithelial development and unlocalized in mature epithelia. This is the first demonstration of Dyne's role in epithelial polarity and suggests mRNA localization may regulate ap-basal organization. Alternative splicing of a coding exon controls mRNA localization during development.
Researchers have investigated the mode of reproduction in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis, and found evidence of intraclonal genetic exchange in the natural vector. Previous studies suggested a clonal reproduction, but genetic analysis of populations and co-infections in sand flies proposed a non-obate sexual cycle in the extracellular stage. To test this, transgenic L. infant lines were developed expressing drug markers linked to green and red fluorescent reporters. The hypothesis was that cells with identical genotypes could recognize and mate. In a study, individuals of Phlebotus periciosus were fed a mixture of parental clones, and both markers were exchanged in the sand midgut of the vector. Using yellow and drug markers, genetic exchange in L. infant was confirmed. Progeny were triploid based on DNA analysis. The hybrid was stable throughout the parasite cycle. Infections by the hybrid in BAL/c mice showed reduced parasite loads in spleen and liver, and weight similar to uninfected mice. Sple argin activity was lower than parental strains. A L. infant hybrid was obtained from intraonal exchange, suggesting the parasite can recognize same genotype and mate. The hybrid was stable but less virulent, correlating with lower argin activity in vitro and vivo.
Leishmaniasis (VL), caused by Leishmania donovani, is a significant health concern in Ethiopia. A study on VL transmission in HIV-VL co-infected patients in north and south Ethiopia characterized 63 L. donani strains. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to examine three regions: internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS), cysteine protease (cp), and HASPB (k26). ITS and cp-PCR identified strains as L. donani, while k-PCR amplicon size varied by patient origin. Northwestern Ethiopia strains (36/40) produced 290bp, with minority (4/40) 410 amplicons, all from HIVL co-infections. Southwestern strains (20/23) produced 450bp, with smaller (290 or 360) for three. Sudanese strains had 290bp identical to northwestern, Kenyan 500-650. High-resolution (HR) analysis distinguished products. Sequence analysis showed k repeat in L donani comprised 13-14 amino motifs, 13 prevalent in don, rare in infantum. Order varies between regions. HAS repeat (k) shows considerable polymorphism among donani from East Africa regions. This should inform diagnostic and vaccine design based on antigen.
Researchers investigated the distribution of recombination breakpoints in HIV-1 genomes to understand how they contribute to the diversity of the HIV/AIDS pandemic. They developed a probabilistic model of HIV-1 recombination based on local sequence identity and compared it to the distribution of breakpoints in the HIV pandemic. The model accurately predicted the frequencies of inter-subtype recombination across much of the HIV genome, indicating that local sequence-dependent recombination is sufficient to explain breakpoint locations. In regions with significant overrepresentation of breakpoints, such as the env gene, and underrepresentation, like gag and pol, natural selection was inferred to influence recombination. The paucity of breakpoints in the envelope gene suggests recombinants in this region are less successful. Breakpoints at higher than predicted were found near env, indicating selection for recombinants due to this region or part of it being recombined as a unit. The findings indicate a portion of the genome deviates from a probabilistic recombination model, suggesting only a minority of recombination events contribute to HIV-1 evolution.
A hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework is proposed for concurrent model comparison and parameter estimation at the population level, addressing the interdependence between model parameter estimation and model comparison. This framework combines previous approaches to estimate individual variation in parameters over a population of subjects, leveraging population distributions, and compare candidate models by individual variation in expressed according to fits to each subject. The population parameters for estimating a model depend on subjects that express the model. HBI has advantages for both estimation and comparison theoretically and experimentally. Estimated parameters by H show smaller errors compared to other methods. Model comparison by H is robust against outliers and not biased towards simplistic models. The fully Bayesian approach enables inference on group parameters by performing H-test. This framework integrates estimation and comparison into a single step, reducing computational complexity and improving accuracy. HBI is applied to simulated and real data, demonstrating improved performance over separate methods. Theoretical analysis shows that H minimizes bias and maximizes efficiency. H is robust to model misspecification and outliers, providing accurate inference on population parameters and model comparison.
Researchers have investigated the role of rhombomeres and Hox genes in the development of the auditory circuitry in the mouse brainstem. Rhomberes contribute to the formation of brainstem nuclei, including the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, ventral cochlear nuclei (VCN), and olivocochlear neurons, which are functionally linked to sensory and motor components of the auditory system. The assembly of these r-derived components is crucial for sound perception and relies on interactions between Hox1 and H2 genes. In mice lacking Hox1 and H2, transmission of low-level auditory stimuli is impaired, leading to hearing impairments. In contrast, H2 regulates Rig1 axon guidance and contralateral projections from the VC to the nucleus of the trapezoid, a circuit involved in sound localization. The study demonstrates that individual rhomeres and their associated H codes control distinct, functionally segregated circuits in the developing brainstem.
Researchers have sequenced the genome of the marine bacterium Saccharagus degradans strain 2-40 (S2-40), a member of a newly discovered group of estuarine bacteria that specializes in breaking down complex carbohydrates. The genome analysis reveals an impressive array of enzymes capable of degrading over 10 different types of polysaccharides. Notably, many of these enzymes exhibit unique architectures, featuring novel combinations of catalytic and substrate modules. It is proposed that these features facilitate the depolymerization of complex polysacchar in the marine environment. This is the first sequenced genome of a marine bacterium capable of degrading plant cell walls, a component of the carbon cycle not well-characterized in the marine environment.
Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) is a zoonotic flavivirus that causes significant childhood neurological infections in Asia. Over the past 20 years, the dominant genotype of JE has shifted from III (GIII) to I (GI). The mechanism of this shift is unknown. Culex (C) mosquitoes are common in China and play a crucial role in JE transmission. This study used C. pipiens mosquitoes from China as an in vivo model to explore their potential role in JE genotype shift. Female C. pipiens were orally exposed to GI or GIII JE strains. Midgut, organs, and salivary glands of infected mosquitoes were collected at 7 and 14 days post-infection (dpi) and subjected to measure infection rate, replication, dissemination, and transmission of JE in C. pip by 50% tissue infective dose assay. C. pip was competent for both GI and GIII infection, with similar rates and kinetics. After establishment, C pip disseminated both genotypes to organs at similar rates. GI-infected saliv glands (16.2%) were positive for GI, while GIII was undetectable in GIII-infected saliv at 7dpi. However, 29.4(5/17) and 36.3(8) were positive for GI- and GIII-infected saliv at 14, showing increase in JE rate. No difference in transmission between GI and G-infected was detected. Data showed GI and GIII have similar infectivity in C. pip, suggesting C pip may not play critical role in JE shift.
A two-year retrospective review of dengue deaths in Malaysia from 2013 to 2014 was conducted to investigate demographics and clinical characteristics associated with deng mortality. A total of 322 deng deaths were reviewed, with a mean age of 40.7 ± 19.3 years and 72.5% were adults. The median duration of first medical contact and hospitalization was 1 and 3 days, respectively. Diabetes and hypertension were common comorbidities among adults and elderly. The most common symptoms reported were lethargy and vomiting, with lethargy being more common in children (p=0.038) and abdominal pain in adults (p=0.040). 22.4% had no symptoms. Only 34% were suspected of deng at initial presentation. Adults developed severe plasma leakage (p=0.018) and more than half suffered multi-organ involvement (54%) and 20.2 had no organ involvement. Deaths occurred at median 3 days post-admission. Dengue shock syndrome (DSS) contributed 70% of deaths, followed by organ involvement (69%) and bleeding (29.7%). In Malaysia, deng deaths primarily occurred in adults, with SS as leading cause regardless of age. Atypical presentation and progression of deng in this cohort prompts early recognition and intervention to prevent deaths.
In a study on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, researchers investigated the role of insulin signaling in mediating female attractiveness to potential mates. Insulin, a nutrient-sensing pathway governing investment in survival versus reproduction, was manipulated to assess its impact on sexual attractiveness. Results showed that insulin signaling in the body and ovarian follicle cells, integrated by pherone-producing cells called oocytes, affects attractiveness. Ovaries were required for global insulin effects on attractiveness, and manipulations of insulin specifically in follicle cells recapitulated global manipulations. Modulation of insulin in the body produced opposite effects on attractiveness, suggesting a competitive relationship with the ovary. Tissue-specific insulin manipulations changed attractiveness and fecundity in the same direction, indicating insulin activity as a link between fecity and attractiveness cues. Cues, cuticular hydrocarbons responded to body and follicle manipulations, independent of pathway activity from these tissues. The study describes a system where attractiveness results from connection between attractiveness and organism state of fecity, both created by insulin in the body and in follicle cells.
During the 2013-2015 Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic in West Africa, the transmission of the virus varied significantly across the hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. To investigate district-level transmissibility of EVD, a statistical approach was applied to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) for each district and country using weekly incident numbers. The growth rates during the early outbreak's exponential phase were estimated using regression of case counts on the first eight weeks since onset. A mixed model was fitted to account for heterogeneity between countries, calculating R based on predicted growth rates and serial distribution. At the district level, R ranged from 0.36 (Dubka) to 1.72 (Bey) in Guinea, 0.53 (Maryland) to 3.37 (Margibi) in Liberia, and 1.14 (Kadugu) to 2.73 (Rural) in Sierra Leone. Nationally, an R of 0.97 (95% 0.77-1.18) was estimated for Guinea, 1.26 (95%0.98-1.55) for Liberia, and 1.66 (95 1.32-2) for Sierra. Socio-demographic factors such as urbanization, high population density, and wealth index were positively associated with R, suggesting urban growth in West may have contributed to EVD spread.
Researchers investigated the factors that influence protein evolution rates, focusing on the interplay between structural properties and age. A dataset of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins with mapped to PDB structures was used. The study found that previously observed correlations between structural properties and evolutionary rates held within each age group, including relationships between solvent accessibility, designability, and rates. However, age also played a role in modulating the relationship between solvent accessibility and rate. Younger proteins, despite being less designable, evolved faster than older ones. The previously reported relationship between age and rate could not be explained by structural biases among groups. A knowledge-based function was introduced to study protein stability through large-scale computation. Older proteins were found to be more stable in their native structure and robust to mutations than younger ones.
Polycomb-like 3 (P3) is a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that promotes embryonic stem cell (ES) self-renewal. Mass spectrometry identified P3 as a Suz12 binding partner, and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed P3 interactions with PR2 core components. Knockdown of P3 in ES cells increases spontaneous differentiation, yet does not affect early differentiation as assessed in teratom and embryoid bodies. P3 has a specific role in regulating ES self-renew. Consistent with P3 promoting PR2 function, decreasing P3 reduces H3me3 levels while overexpressing P3 increases H3me levels. Chromatin immunrecipitation and sequencing (IP-q) reveal P3 co-localizes with PR core component Suz, and depletion of P3 decreases Suz binding at 60% of PR targets. Mutation of conserved residues within P Tudor domain, implicated in recognizing methylated histones, compromises H3me formation, suggesting the Tud domain is essential. P3 and its paralog P2 exist in different PR complexes but bind many same targets, particularly Cp islands regulated by P3. P is critical for ES selfnew, histone methylation, and PR recruitment to subset genomic sites.
Researchers investigated the regulation of a chemoreceptor gene, sr-234, in Caenorhabditis elegans, which is involved in chemosensory behavior. The gene expression of sr-234 in the AD sensory neuron is previously shown to be regulated by the MEF-2 transcription factor. This study found that MEF-2 acts together with basic helix-loop-helix (bHL) transcription factors to regulate sr-234 as a function of feeding state. A cis-regulatory M2 site is necessary and sufficient for starvation-induced downregulation of sr-234, while an E-box binds HL factors to drive sr- expression in AD. HL-2, HL-3, and HL-4 act in AD neurons to regulate sr-234. MX-3 and HL-30 in the intestine regulate sr- in AD neurons, dependent on insulin signaling in AD. Intestine-to-neuron regulation of sr- involves a subset of insulin peptides.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the association between the detection of Mycobacterium ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of Buruli ulcer (BU) disease in southeastern Australia. Adult mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula, Victoria, from December 2004 to December 2009, and screened for M. ulcer using real-time PCR. The number of laboratory-confirmed BU cases in residents during the same period was tallied to determine cumulative incidence in each location. Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated between proportion of M. ulcer-positive mosquitoes and incidence per town. A strong dose-response relationship was found between M. ulcer detection in mosquitoes and human disease risk (r = 0.99; 95% CI 0.92-0.99; p < 0.001). The study supports the hypothesis that mosquitoes are involved in M. ulcer transmission in southeastern Australia. This has implications for intervention strategies to control and prevent BU.
A mutation in the gene encoding the mitochondrial Mg2+ channel MRS2 results in demyelination in rats. The dmy mutation is a model for studying myelin maintenance, as it causes severe myelin breakdown in the central nervous system (CNS) after normal myelination completion. A G-to-A transition at 177 bp downstream of exon 3 of the MRS2 gene creates a novel splice site, inactivating the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type M2DNA confirms this. M2 encodes a component of the Mg2 influx system in mitochondria of yeast and human cells. Dmy rats have mitochondrial deficits: elevated lactate in cerebrospinal fluid, 60% ATP reduction, and swollen mitochondria in oligodendrocy cytoplasm. M2-GFP transgenic rats show M2 expression in neurons, not oligodrocytes, and ultrastructurally in mitochondria inner membrane. Observations indicate dmy suffer mitochondrial disease, myelin maintenance differs from production. Mg2 homeostasis in mitochondria is essential for myelin maintenance.
Researchers analyzed eight publicly available clinical microarray studies to evaluate the consistency of gene expression signatures between internal and external studies. Current documentation standards for signatures do not allow for unambiguous application to external patients, hindering independent evaluation and clinical use. Study-internal classifications were based on documented information, while study-external classifications were based on documented signatures. The study found that exact specification of a classification rule alone does not define a signature unambiguously. Discrepancies between study-internal and studyexternal diagnoses were as high as 30% in the worst case and 18 in median. A proposed documentation strategy, which includes quantitative preprocessing information, reduced the discrepancy to 1. The process of bringing microarray gene expression signatures to clinical practice can be improved and made more reliable with better documentation of signatures.
Researchers have investigated the structure of curli amyloid fibrils, secreted by Enterobacteriaceae, which contribute to biofilm formation and bacterial resistance to environmental stress. Crystal structures of amyloid-forming segments from the major curli subunit, Csg, revealed a steric zipper-like fibrils of β-sheets, linking curli to human amyloids. Danti-meric peptides, designed to interfere with Alzheimer's disease amyloid-β, inhibited Csg fibrillation and biofilm formation in Salmonella typhim. Additionally, C fibrils seeded amyloidβ fibrillation, supporting structural resemblance and potential cross-species amyloid interactions. The study provides insights into amyloidogenic regions for cur formation, suggesting a strategy to disrupt amyloid biofilms and hypothesizes self-propagating prion species from microbial source influencing neurodegenerative diseases.
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) is a significant cause of encephal in Asia, characterized by high fatality rates and neurologic sequelae among survivors. In the Philippines, the epidemiology of JE is not well defined. A systematic review of literature and surveillance data from 2011-2014 was conducted to inform consideration of JE vaccine introduction into the national schedule. Searches were conducted on JE and the Philippines in four databases and library. Data from acute encephal syndrome (AES) and JE surveillance from the national laboratory from 2011-2014 were tabulated and mapped. Twenty-nine reports on JE in the Philippines were identified, including five serologic surveys, 18 clinical reports, and eight studies (two with both clinical and animal data). Eighteen studies reported 257 laboratory-confirmed JE cases from 1972-2013. JE virus (JEV) was the causative in 7-18% of cases meningitis and encephitis combined and 16-40% enitis. Predominantly affected children under 15 years, with 6-7% resulting in death. Surveillance from 2011-2014 identified 73 laboratory-confirmed JE of 497 tested. This review demonstrates endemicity and geographic range of JE in the Philippines, supporting vaccine use in the country. Continued surveillance with confirmation is needed to quantify JE burden, guide prioritization of high-risk areas and vaccine schedule, and measure preventive measures against this public health threat.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary origins of genetic robustness in bacteria by studying the metabolic networks of hundreds of species across various simulated environments. They found that variations in robustness levels among species reflect ecological adaptations. Robustness was decoupled into two components: environmental-dependent, responsible for 20% of non-essential reactions, associated with species' lifestyle (specialized/generalist), and environmental-independent, associated with intrinsic metabolic capacities (correlation=0.6), observed in fast growers or extensive secondary metabolite producers.
A randomized trial was conducted in Enteb, Uganda to investigate the effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection on antibody responses to measles catch-up immunization in pre-school children. The Immune Modulation and Childhood Immunization (IMChI) study enrolled 193 Schistoma-infected and 61 uninfected children aged 3-5 years. Infected children were randomized 1:1 to receive prazantel 2 weeks before, at the time of, or 1 week after measles immunization. Plasma-meas IgG was measured at enrollment, 1 and 24 weeks post-immun. Primary outcomes were IgG levels and percentage with protective levels. Anti-meas Ig increased post-immun, but at 1 post-imm Schoma-inf children had lower Ig (adjusted mean 0.4 [0.2-0.7] and percentage with protective levels lower (odds 0.1-0.9) compared to uninf. Among Schoma-inf, Ig post-imm was higher in those treated with prantel than not (treated before-imm, 2.3[1.5-4.8]; at-imm 1.8[1.1-3.5). At 24 post-imm, Ig did not differ between groups, but tended lower in previously-inf who remained Schoma-positive than became-negative. The study suggests Schoma infection in pre-school is associated with reduced response to measles immun, and prant treatment improves. Schoma may contribute to impaired responses in endemic populations; control may enhance vaccine efficacy.
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding bacterial evolution through large-scale sequencing of population samples, revealing that multiple gene sequences and broad population coverage are necessary for an unbiased view of genetic structure and ancestry patterns. However, traditional phylogenetic analysis faces challenges with extensive sampling, particularly with recombination. To address this, new statistical tools for recombination detection and population representation are introduced, along with a population model describing sequence space in terms of variability and affinity to other populations. These tools are combined with phylogenetic analysis on extensive data from Neisseria, demonstrating their potential. The introduced tools are available in BAPS 5.2 software, downloadable from http://web.ab.fiak.fi/matec/baps.html.
Researchers have investigated the role of cortical rhythms in cognitive abilities, specifically focusing on beta activity in the 20 Hz frequency band, which has been linked to neural correlates of attention. Studies suggest that top-down beta rhythms generated in higher cognitive areas and transmitted to sensory areas support attention modulation. A computational model of cortical sensory areas was developed to elucidate beta's functional roles and mechanisms. Results show that top-down beta activates ascending projections from L5 to L4 and L2/3, responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Slow inhibitory interneurons resonate at 20 Hz and modulate activity in superficial layers in attention-related manner. Predicted roles of these cells in attention provide a mechanism for cholinergic drive to support selective attention.
Researchers have developed a new method, called Multiple Shooting for Stochastic Systems (MSS), to calibrate and predict stochastic compartmental models of epidemics. These models are useful for studying the emergence of new pathogens when the number of infected individuals is small. However, existing methods for estimating and predicting these models' parameters are limited. SS applies a linear approximation to describe the size of fluctuations and updates the belief about the epidemic state with each new observation. The method was tested on simulated outbreaks of a novel virus, using weekly diagnosed case counts as a proxy for incidence. Results show that SS accurately estimates key parameters (mean infectious duration, R0, and Reff) and the unobserved number of infected during an epidemic. It also predicts future hospitalizations and overall attack rate accurately. SS outperforms three benchmarks: 1) Poisson approximation, 2) particle filtering, and 3) Kalman filter in most scenarios. The method may improve current approaches for calibrating and predicting stochastic epidemics.
Human visual perception is shaped by two opposing forces: adaptation and past decisions. A series of experiments investigated the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during forced-choice tasks. Multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches revealed that perceptual reports are influenced by a hierarchy of serial processes. Low-level adaptation repels perception from previous stimuli, while decisional processes attract towards recent stimuli. This hierarchy of dependence arises from decision templates, not sensory processes. A two-process model explains persistence, where decision weights compensate for adaptation, leading to biases in perception. A unified account proposes distinct mechanisms promote differentiation and integration of visual information over time.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Clock-Cycle (CLK-CYC) heterodimer in circadian transcription in Drosophila. The CLK protein lacks an activation domain, but its partner CY has a DNA-binding domain and a glutamine-rich region that contributes to transcriptional activity. To study the role of CY in circadian timekeeping, a CY-viral 16 (VP) fusion protein was added to the CLK-CYC complex, enhancing transcriptional activity. This was observed in both CY-VP-expressing flies and S2 cells, with increased levels of CLK-C target mRNAs and short period. Reporter gene expression in CYVP-expressing flies showed the short period is due to rapid transcriptional phase. Behavioral effects require period (per) promoter and are not due to higher PER levels, indicating CLK-CVP effects are a consequence of increased transcription. This suggests timing of transcription activation, not activation, is key to behavioral effects in CYVP-express flies. The study indicates circadian transcription contributes to circadian function in Dophila.
Researchers investigated how horizontally acquired genes function in different species. They found that existing proteins in an organism can limit the functionality of a new gene if it interacts with an ancestral pathway. The study focused on the pmr gene in Salmonella and Escherichia. The pmr gene activates the Pmr/PB system in Salmonella but not in Escheria. The pmr protein binds to phosphorylated Pmr (mr-P), protecting it from dephosphorylation by mr. This leads to transcription of mr-dependent genes, including polymyxin resistance. However, the E pmr protein can activate the Pmr system in Salmonella, despite not in Esia, suggesting a difference in controlling mr levels. The E coli mr has higher phosphatase activity towards mr-P than Salmon mr, and a mr domain responsible for this was identified. Replacing the E coli mr with Salmon mr gene made coli resistant to polymin under mr-inducing conditions. The study shows that differences in biochemical activities of ancestral proteins dictate acquired gene functionality and suggest acquired genes can potentiate ancestral loci.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to identify differentially expressed genes during the early stages of embryonic stem cell differentiation. This process involves the loss of pluripotency-associated transcripts and induction of differentiation genes. Traditional methods of identifying differentially expressed genes by comparing cell types include a large portion of genes that respond to, rather than regulate, the process. The researchers used biological replicates and a statistical approach to analyze gene expression data without separating cell types, finding it informative for detecting differentially expressed genes. This method was applied to murine embryonic stem cell differentiation, identifying Smad1 as a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal. The approach was formalized as a statistical test applicable to other differentiation processes.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze genetic data from next-generation sequencing studies, called unbiased clustering of gene variants with phenotypic-link network. This method aims to identify functional relationships between genes from diverse data types, such as protein-protein interactions and gene-expression networks, and assess their significance by comparing interconnectedness with random gene sets. However, previous methods can be affected by confounding bias, leading to false positives. The study found that genes implicated by de novo variants tend to cluster together due to longer coding sequence length, resulting in inflated p-values in functional studies. To address this, the researchers created an integrative method that controls for this bias. They inferred associations between human genes from diverse data and assessed with a novel phenotype-based method, examining de novo gene variants while accounting for unexplored confounding in coding sequence. The method was tested on various data and networks, showing disease genes cluster more significantly in integrated phenotypic-link network than other networks. A tool was developed to identify functional associations among mutated genes in disease, accounting for sequencing bias, demonstrating suitability for clustering genes underlying polygenic disorders.
In January 2014, the Mexican government implemented an 8% tax on non-essential foods with energy density ≥275 kcal/100g and a peso-per-liter tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (SBs) to prevent obesity and diabetes. This study evaluated changes in volume of taxed and untaxed food purchases in response to these taxes, stratified by socioeconomic status (SES). Data from Nielsen's Consumer Panel (CPS) was used, including 6,248 households that participated for at least 2 months in 2012-2014, with average follow-up of 32.7 months. Volume of taxed and untaxed food purchases from January 2012 to December 2014 were analyzed using a longitudinal fixed model, adjusted for pre-existing trends to test if post-tax trend was different from pre-tax trend. Household characteristics and contextual factors like salary and unemployment were controlled. Taxed food purchases decreased by 5.1% in 2014 compared to expected based on pre-tax 2012-201 trends, with no change in untaxed purchases. Low SES households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods than expected, medium SES 5.8% less, while high SES did not change.
Researchers have proposed a biophysically plausible model to explain the properties of collision-sensitive neurons, which integrate information across a large part of the visual field. The model assumes that each channel is noisy and has a response threshold, and approximates a power law as a result of pooling these channels. This mechanism can predict many characteristics of the Lobula Giant Detector Neuron (LG), a type of collision-sensitive neuron. The model depends critically on noise in the inhibitory pathway, but is robust against noise in the excitatory pathway. The model reproduces the LG's response to various stimuli, including motion direction, speed, and contrast. It also captures the neuron's non-linearity and non-monotonicity. The authors suggest that this mechanism could be a common underlying principle for brain functions at multiple levels, from biophysics to psychophysics.
Cameroon is endemic for Buruli ulcer (BU), a disease caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans. In 2002, the National Buruli Ulcer Control Programme (NBPUC) was established to control the disease. This summary describes the evolution, achievements, and challenges of the NBP and suggests scaling up the programme. Data from 2001-2014 was analyzed, including reports from the NBP. Key indicators and case detection rates were plotted to determine trends. A linear regression analysis of detection from 2005-2014 was conducted, testing for statistical significance. In 14 years of control, 370 cases were reported. The detection rate decreased from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants. The number of endemic districts rose from 2 to 64. Five diagnostic and treatment centers are operational, with two planned for 2015. The health system has been strengthened, and research and education increased in Cameroon. The NBP began 30 years after first reported cases in 1969, but significant progress has been made.
Researchers investigated the influence of outcome valence (gains or losses) on confidence judgments in human learning through trial-and-error stimulus-outcome associations. Two experiments showed that participants were more confident in their choices when learning to gain compared to avoid losses, despite equal performance in both contexts. Computational modeling revealed that this bias is driven by context-value, a dynamic estimate of the average expected value of options, explaining performance in both gain and loss domains. The bias effect of context on confidence is domain-general and has significant implications. In volatile environments, individuals' flexibility in learning strategies differs when outcomes are framed as gains or losses.
Researchers have investigated the function of the non-structural protein 3 (ns3) of alphaviruses, a component of the viral replication complex, composed of a conserved amino-terminal domain involved in RNA synthesis and a poorly conserved carbox-terminal region. A carbox-terminal proline-rich motif shared among alphavirus ns3 proteins was identified as a target for Src-homology 3 (SH) domains of amphiphins 1 and 2. SH-dependent binding of amphins to ns3 was observed in Semliki Forest (SF), Sindbis (SINV), and Chikunya viruses. Upon alphavirus infection, intracellular amphin distribution was altered and colocalized with ns3. Mutations in ns3 disrupting amphin SH binding and RNA-mediated silencing of amphin2 resulted in impaired RNA replication in HeLa cells infected with SINV or SF. Infection of Bal/c mice with SF carrying SH binding-defective ns3 was associated with decreased mortality.
A study was conducted to investigate the molecular epidemiology of chromoblastycosis, a disease caused by fungi of the order Chaetothyales, in Brazil. The researchers analyzed 123 clinical strains of the disease using DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer region and partial β-tubulin genes. The strains were grouped into three clusters within the family Herpotiaceae, known to cause the disease. The Fonca cluster contained the majority of strains, with Fonsepi being the most prevalent at 80%, followed by Fmonora at 13%, Fnica at 3%, and a single isolate of Fpnius. Two additional species, Rhinadiella and Cyphora, were also identified with frequencies of 3% and 1, respectively.
Listeria monocytogenes Infection Induces DNA Damage and Dampens the DNA Response

Listeria monocytogenes, a pathogenic bacterium, induces DNA breaks in host cells during infection. The host's DNA damage response (DDR) is a signaling pathway that detects and repairs DNA damage caused by endogenous or exogenous assaults, including infections. However, the impact of bacteria on the DDR is not well understood. This study found that Listeria monocogen infection causes DNA breaks in host cells. Notably, the response to these breaks is only moderately activated. The bacterium's toxin, listeriolysin O (LO), was found to block the DDR by degrading the sensor Mre11 protein. Knocking out or inactivating proteins involved in DDR promoted bacterial replication, highlighting the importance of this mechanism for infection control. The study shows that dampening the DDR is crucial for successful Listerial infection.
Researchers conducted an epigenetic library screen to identify compounds that influence human herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and 2 (HSV-2) replication. They found that bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) plays a critical role in HSV infection. Treatment with a pan-BD inhibitor, JQ1, enhanced HSV infection. JQ acts through BR4, as knockdown of BR4 expression ablated J1's effect on HSV. BR4 regulates HSV replication through a complex involving CDK and RNA polymerase II; J1 promotes HSV-1 by allocating the complex to viral promoters. Suppression of BR4 or CD9 activity hindered infection. Data suggest J1 enhances HSV by switching BR4 to viral gene expression from chromatin. Transient BR4 or BR1/2 expression mimicked J1's effect. BR4 is a modulator for J's action on HSV and has an essential role in infection.
Researchers investigated the microbial communities in the mouths of children affected by noma, a disease that causes severe facial disfigurement and affects over 140,000 malnourished children annually. The cause of noma remains unknown, but a combination of microbial infection, poor oral hygiene, and weakened immune system may contribute to lesions that are entry points for gangrenous infections. A cross-sectional study analyzed 16S rRNA gene amplicons from gingival fluid samples of 12 healthy children, 12 with noma lesions, and 12 with Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis (ANG) lesions and healthy sites. Compared to healthy individuals, samples from diseased mouths were enriched with Spirocha and depleted Proteobacteria, while healthy sites from diseased had similar proportions of Spiro and Proteobacteria to controls. Samples from n mouths did not show higher Fusobacter abundance, casting doubt on its causative role. Microbial communities from n and AN lesions were dominated by Prevotella intermedia OT, less abundant in healthy sites. Multivariate analysis confirmed different bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites. Several OTUs in Erysotrichales, Cloidales, Bacteriales, and Spirotales were identified as indicators of n, suggesting one or more microbes within these orders associated with noma development.
Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacterium that infects insects, uses a communication system called quorum sensing to adapt to its environment and commit to sporulation, a process of producing spores for survival. Researchers investigated the role of quorum sensing in the bacterium's life cycle within an insect host. They found that a specific regulator, Npr, part of the RNPP family, controls sporulation in the absence of its signaling peptide, Npr. N acts as a transcription factor, regulating genes for survival in the insect cadaver. However, in the absence of Npr, N negatively controls sporulation by inhibiting the expression of SpoA-regulated genes, preventing Kin-dependent phosphorylation of phosphotransferase SpoF, delaying the sporulation process. N displays similarities with Rap proteins, also in RN family, lacking DNA-binding domain, controlling expression via protein-protein interactions. Conservation of residues interacting with SpoF suggests common inhibition of sporulation pathway. The structure of N confirms a Rap-like structure. A regulatory mechanism proposes key residues of bifunctional N involved in two functions. N switches from dimer inhibitor sporulation to tetramer transcriptional activator in necrotrophic lifestyle. N tightly coordinates sporulation and necrophism, ensuring survival and dissemination during infection.
Researchers have developed a new computational model to predict the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs in treating HIV infection. The model, called proteochem, combines genotypic and phenotyp data from a large clinical database of 300,000 drug-mut bioactivity points to identify optimal treatment regimens for individual patients. Unlike previous models, protechem considers chemical properties of drugs and their targets. The model achieved a prediction error rate below 0.5 log change and outperformed previous sequence-based models in resistance prediction and classification. It identified known and novel resistance-conferring mutations in HIV Reverse Transcriptase and Protease. The model was applied to a public HIV resistance database from Stanford University, achieving a correct prediction rate of 84% compared to 80% in a high-quality subset. The study demonstrates protechem models can accurately predict phenotyp resistance from genotyp data, including novel mutants and mixtures. Additionally, the model informs users about prediction reliability.
A computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis, based on pseudop autocatalysis, was developed to test the explanatory and predictive powers of pseudop-based mechanisms in chemotaxis. The model reproduced a wide range of existing data on cell movement and chemotaxis, simulating cell polarization, persistence, and pseudod selection in response to chemoattract gradients. It also predicted pseudod position bias in low chemo gradients and lateral pseudod initiation in high gradients. To test the model's predictive ability, untested predictions were made, including that the angle between successive pseudods at the cell front would increase with the difference between the cell's direction and the chemo gradient. This was measured in Dictyostelium cells under different conditions, with results agreeing with the model. The model and data suggest that pseudocycle lies at the heart of cell motility in rapidly moving cells like Dictyostel and neutrophils, implying chemaxis relies on pseud modification rather than generation or actin polymerization by chemo.
Fleas can transmit Yersinia pestis through two mechanisms: early-phase transmission (EPT) and bio-dependent transmission (BDT). However, the efficiency of transmission varies among flea species and results have been inconsistent. One complicating factor is the type of rodent blood used for the infectious meal. This study investigated the effect of host blood on EPT by feeding fleas bacteremic mouse, rat, guinea pig, or gerbil blood and assessing the location and characteristics of infection in the digestive tract and transmissibility of Y. pestis. Surprisingly, 10-28% of rodent fleas fed bacteremic rat or guinea blood regurgitated a portion of the infected meal into the esophagus within 24 hours. This phenomenon is termed post-infectional esophageal reflux (PIER). In contrast, PIER was rarely observed in fleas fed bacteremic or gerbil blood. PIER correlated with accumulation of dense aggregates of Y. pest, red blood cells, and hemoglobin in the proventriculus. At next feeding, fleas with PIER were 3-25 times more likely to appear blocked with blood retained in the esagus than fleas without P. Three days after feeding on bacteremic blood, Oropsa montana transmitted significantly more CFU than groups using mouse blood, and this transmission was bio-dependent. Data support a model where EPT results from regurgitation of Y. pest from obstructed foregut and E and BDT can temporally overlap. The insolubility of hemoglobin in rats and slower digestion of their blood promotes regitative transmission, which may explain why rodents are prominent in plague ecology.
Researchers have investigated the role of positive correlations in neuronal activity in the brain and found that they can significantly enhance coding performance. Contrary to previous studies suggesting they are detrimental or marginally beneficial, positive correlations can suppress probability of error by several orders of magnitude and increase the number of stimuli encoded, or capacity, by more than tenfold. These effects do not require unrealistically high correlation values and can occur in populations with tens of neurons. Heterogeneity in population activity is beneficial for these effects. Suppression of error and enhancement of capacity rely on a specific pattern of correlation. Tuning of one or several parameters can lead to perfect coding. The pattern of positive correlation leads to 'locking' of response, eliminating variability in subspace relevant for discrimination.
Researchers have developed a conjugate vaccine against cholera, a severe watery diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholera, by combining the O-specific polysaccharide (OSP) of Vibrio cholera O1 Inaba strain with a recombinant fragment of tetanus toxin heavy chain (rTHC). The conjugate vaccine was prepared via acid chemistry and tested in mice with varying doses (10-50 μg) and compositions of OSP to rTH molar ratio (3:1, 5:1, 10:1), adjuvant, and route of immunization. Immunized mice developed anti-OSP and anti-T serum IgG, vibriodal and memory cell responses following intramuscular or intrader vaccination. Intestinal lamina prop IgA responses targeting OSP occurred intrader. Comparable immune responses were found in mice immunized with variations, although memory and vibri responses were blunted in highest dose (50 μ). No change in responses occurred with or without adju. Administration of rTH resulted in 55% protective efficacy in mouse cholera model. The conjugate vaccine induces memory and protection against cholera in mice.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 42 villages across three regions of Cameroon to investigate the cross-reactivity of immunochromatographic test (ICT) for lymphatic filariasis (LF) in areas with contrasting levels of Loa loa and Mansonella perst endemicity. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and intensity of Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Mansonella perst, and clinical manifestations of LF. A total of 219 individuals participated, with 24 testing positive by ICT, with prevalence ranging from 0% in South-west to 2.1% in North. Lymphedema was diagnosed in 20 individuals, with majority in North-west, none tested positive by ICT. No Wuchereria bancft microfilariae were found in night blood of individuals with positive ICT or lymphedema. Positive ICT associated with high Loa microf intensity, 21 with over 8,000 Loa microf/ml blood (odds ratio 15.4; 95%CI 6.1-39.0; p<0.001). Strong association observed between Loa prevalence and ICT area (Spearman rho 0.900; p0.037), with 1% or more ICT in areas Loa above 15%. No association between ICT and Mansonella prevalence (Spearman -0.200; p0.747) or microf density (odds 1.8;95CI0.8-4.2; p0.192). The study confirmed association between ICT and Lo intensity (microf/ml) at individual level, and ICT with high Lo prevalence. Results suggest main confounding factor for ICT positive test are high Lo levels. Findings indicate Wucher bancft less prevalent in Central region Lo highly endemic than assumed, accurate re-mapping region useful shrinking LF map distribution.
SARS-CoV replication is supported by a reticular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum. Positive-strand RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV, replicate in the cytoplasm of host cells. Their replication complexes are associated with modified cell membranes, ranging from spher membrane invaginations to elaborate webs of vesicles. The ultrastructure, morphogenesis, and role in replication remain poorly characterized. Double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) were implicated in SARSV RNA synthesis. Cryo-electron tomography of infected cells revealed a three-dimensional imaging of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations at high resolution. A reticular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum was defined, integrating convol membranes, interconnected DMVs (200-300 nm), and vesicles from DM merger. Convoluted membranes were immunolabeled for viral subunits. Double-stranded RNA, presumably synthesis site, localized to DM interior. No connection between DM and cytosol was discerned, raising questions about DM formation and SARSV synthesis site. The virus reorganization of host membranes into a network organizes replication and possibly hides from antiviral mechanisms.
Researchers have investigated the role of suberin, a chemical compound found in plant roots, in regulating water and nutrient uptake from the soil. The current understanding of suberin's function is based on a model suggesting it forms a barrier limiting extracellular or apoplastic transport of water and solutes in roots. However, there is no direct genetic evidence to support this model. A study on Arabidopsis thaliana plants with enhanced suberin1 (es1) mutation showed a connection between suberin in roots and water movement through the plant and solute accumulation in shoots. Plants with increased suberin had reduced transpiration rates and increased water efficiency during growth. These changes in suberin and water transport were associated with decreased accumulation of Ca, Mn, and Zn, and increased accumulation of Na, S, K, As, and Mo in shoots. This study provides genetic evidence that suberin in roots controls water and ion transport to leaves. Changes in elemental accumulation in leaves indicate significant radial transport of Ca, Mn, and Zn occurs in apoplast.
Researchers investigated the kinetics of rhodopsin deactivation and its role in regulating the reproducibility of the single photon response (SPR) in vertebrate phototransduction. They developed a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CT) model based on the biochemistry of rhodin activation and deactivation, interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction. The model was parameterized with data from photoresponse of wild-type and mutant mice with varying numbers of phosphorylation sites. The model reproduced both wild-type and mutant responses with a single set of parameters. Variability in the response was dissected into components: random number of turn-off steps, random sojourn time between steps, or both. Results showed that only randomness in sojourn times at each phosphorylated state contributed to Coefficient of Variation (CV) of response, while number of turn-off steps had negligible effect. This contradicts the view that more decay steps lead to more stable response. Rhodin shutoff was found responsible for response variability, while messenger diffusion acted as suppressor.
Researchers have developed a new mathematical framework to analyze stochastic reaction networks in fluctuating environments by decoupling the network from its extrinsic factors. These factors, such as fluctuations in ribosome numbers, affect gene network dynamics but are typically hard to model. The framework incorporates the environment's effect into a new network model, allowing for decoupling. Fluctuating extrinsic components, like chemical species, can be marginalized to obtain this decoupled model. Process and master equations are derived, enabling stochastic simulations. Case studies demonstrate the approach's significance.
Researchers have developed a novel brain-machine interface (BMI) architecture that utilizes optimal feedback modeling and adaptive processing to improve control and adaptability. Current BMI decoders, such as Kalman filters and closed-loop decoder adaptation (CLDA), do not directly model spikes, limiting processing speed and adaptation. A unified CL framework generalizing across setups is lacking. The proposed architecture integrates an infinite-hor feedback (OFC) model of the brain's behavior in closed-loop control and a point process model of spikes. The OFC infers user intention during CL, termed intention estimation. OF is used for autonomous and dynamic training. The point model enables neural processing and adaptation with every spike, faster than current decoders, and dynamic-event adaptation unlike batch-based methods. Experiments in a non-human primate over days dissociated effects of CL components. OF estimation improved performance compared to current techniques. OF assisted training enabled proficient control. Spike-event adaptation faster and consistent convergence than batch methods, robust initialization. The architecture extended beyond training tasks. This has implications for clinically viable neuroprosthetics.
Researchers investigated the effect of stimulus structure on redundancy in the retina by measuring responses from populations of retinal ganglion cells to natural and artificial stimuli with varying degrees of correlation. Simultaneous recordings are publicly available online. Responses to spatio-temporally structured stimuli, such as movies, showed modest correlations between ganglion cells, more than to white noise, but less than predicted by a non-adaptive model of retinal response. In contrast, responses to stimuli with purely spatial correlations, ganglion showed correlations consistent with static, non-adaptive receptive field nonlinearity. Ganglion cells responding to spatio-temporally correlated stimuli had faster temporal kernels and stronger surrounds. These properties, along with gain changes in contrast at gang cell input, explained pairwise correlations across receptive field measurements.
Researchers have developed an integrative multi-network and multi-classifier approach to predict genetic interactions, focusing on synthetic lethality, a type of genetic interaction where a combination of mutations results in a surprising phenotype. This approach improves upon existing methods by defining a large number of features characterizing relationships between gene pairs from various data sources, independent of known interactions. A non-parametric multi-classifier system was developed to predict interactions using these features, enabling simultaneous use of multiple classification procedures. Experiments demonstrated improved performance compared to current state-of-the-art method. The approach was used to derive a yeast transcription factor genetic network, supported by literature, and predict interactions between non-essential gene pairs in yeast. The method is expected to be effective in uncovering new interactions in yeast and higher organisms like mouse and human, where few interactions have been identified.
The BRCA Challenge is a long-term data-sharing project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GAH) to aggregate BRCA1 and BRCA data to support collaborative research. The project aims to provide an informed understanding of the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk across the predisposition genes BRCA1 and BR2. Initially, reported variants in BR1 and BR2 from public databases were integrated into a single site, www.brca.org. The BR Exchange provides a reliable and accessible record of interpreted variants for high-penetr phenotype. Over 20,000 variants have been aggregated, three times the number in the largest public database at project outset, with approximately 7,250 classifications. Data is based on information from clinical databases, including Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC), ClinVar, and Leiden Variation (LOV), as well as population databases linked to a single access point. The BR Challenge brought together the international Evidence Network for Interpretation of Genomic Mutations (ENIG) consortium, expert panel, clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and providers to advance understanding BR1 and BR2 variation. Ongoing work includes contact with national centers with BR1 and BR2 data to encourage sharing, development of methods for genetic variation extraction at laboratory level, and engagement with communities to understand clinical significance of BR and BR variation.
Malaria, caused by the Plasmodium parasite, remains a significant threat to human health, resulting in approximately one million deaths annually. The parasite undergoes a complex life cycle in humans and mosquitoes, requiring adaptation to various environments. To cope with reactive oxygen species and maintain redox processes, Plasium relies on adequate redox balance. A study of subcellular localization of antioxidant and redox proteins revealed the complete red compartmentation map of Plasium falcum. Two Plas peroxiredoxins and putative glyoxal system were targeted to the apoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid. The compartmentation of thiorexin and glutaredin-like proteins was also obtained. Notably, Plasium utilizes alternative translation initiation (ATI) to target glutathione reductase and thiorexin reduct, two major antioxidant enzymes. This dual localization by ATI may also occur in other Apicomplexa, opening therapeutic avenues.
Researchers investigated the role of electrostatic interactions in the folding and binding of the intrinsically disordered protein (ID) PUM to its partner Mcl-1 using a structure-based coarse-grained model with an explicit Debye-Hückel charge. The model was calibrated with experimental data on helical content and affinity and binding rate changes with respect to ionic strength. The study found that intramolecular electrostatic interactions had a minor influence on the unbound state of PUM. However, intermolecular electrostatic interactions, particularly non-native electrostatic interactions, played a significant role in the formation of the initial complex. The model revealed the binding mechanism in more detail than experimental data alone, highlighting the importance of non-native electrostatic interactions in the binding process. The study suggests that electrostatic interactions are crucial for describing the binding of IDPs. This approach could provide predictions for mutational studies.
Polycomb group (Pc) proteins are conserved chromatin factors that maintain the silencing of key developmental genes outside their expression domains. Genome-wide analyses have shown that Polycomb proteins bind to discrete Polycomb response elements (PREs). Within the nucleus, Polycomb proteins localize in structures called Polycomb bodies that contain silenced genes, and it has been shown that PREs form long-range networks. This study investigated the nuclear distribution of two Polycomb proteins, Polycomb (PC) and Polyhomeotic (PH), using a combination of immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP proteins to analyze the formation and mobility of Poly bodies during fly embryogenesis and compare to condensed euchromatin. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that Poly bodies correspond to 3D counterparts of genomic domains identified genome-wide. During embryogenesis, PC and PH progressively accumulate in Poly bodies, forming structures localized on euchatin domains with histone H3-methylated on K27. Time-lapse analysis revealed two types of motion influence Poly bodies and chromatin containing H2-GFP: First, chromatin and Poly bodies undergo long-range motions corresponding to whole chromosome movement. Second, each body and chrom domain has fast, highly constrained motion. In this regime, Poly bodies move within larger volumes than chromatin. Moreover, both types move smaller than chromosome territories, restricting interaction with nuclear structures. Fast Poly and chromatin motion during embryogenesis decreases in late stages, indicating chrom dynamics in gene silencing maintenance.
Researchers used ultra-deep sequencing to study mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in the livers of normally aging and prematurely aging mice that are homozygous for an allele expressing a proofreading-deficient mtDNA polymerase (mt mutator mice). The results show that mt mut mice have 10-times-higher mtDNA mutation loads than wildtype siblings, with increased levels of truncated mt molecules and decreased sequence coverage in deleted regions. In contrast, mt mice have low frequencies of circular DNA deletions. Sequence analysis indicates that most mutations in heterozygous mt mice and wildtype siblings are inherited from heterozygous mothers, consistent with germl transmission. No increase in point or deletions was found in wildtype C57/6 mice with age, questioning causative role in aging. Additionally, no frequency of transversions increased with time in any genotypes, arguing against oxidative damage as major cause of mt mutations. The study suggests that most somatic mt occur as replication errors during development, not accumulation in adult life.
Researchers have identified a novel type of Na+-driven ATP synthase membrane motor in the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum, which utilizes glutamate decarboxylation to generate a transmembrane Na+ gradient. This ionotive force is directly coupled to ATP synthesis via the F1Fo-ATP synthase, which features a Na+ recognition motif shared with other human pathogens. Molecular modeling and free energy simulations of the enzyme's rotary element, the c-ring, indicate Na+ specificity in physiological settings. Consistent activity measurements show Na+ stimulation of the enzyme, both membrane-embedded and isolated, and ATP synthesis is sensitive to the Na ionophore monens. Furthermore, Na+ has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting ion-binding sites in both the ATPase and c-ring. Evidence of Na coupling is provided by two crystal structures of the c-ring solved by X-ray crystallography at 2.2 and 2.6 Å resolution at pH 5.3 and 8.7, respectively. Na ions occupy all sites, coordinated by four amino acids and a water. Intriguingly, carboxylates mediate ion binding. Simulations and experiments demonstrate this implies a proton is bound to all sites, although Na alone drives the rotary mechanism. The structure reveals a new mode of ion coupling in ATPases and provides a basis for drug design against the opportunistic pathogen.
T cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules on antigen-presenting cells initiates adaptive immunity. In vitro, high-affinity and long-lived TCR-MHC interactions correlate with potent T cell activation. However, the influence of TCR-MHC parameters on cell responses in vivo is not well understood. This study investigated the effect of T-MHC binding on cell immunity by tracking CD4+ T activation, effector, and memory responses to immunization with peptides exhibiting various T-M half-lives and in vitro activation potencies. Contrary to in vitro predictions, optimal in vivo responses occurred to ligands with intermediate T-M halfives. Diminished in vivo responses to the ligand with longest-M were associated with attenuation of intracellular signaling, expansion, and function at multiple time points.
The genome of Nectria haematocca, a member of the Fusarium solani species complex, has been extensively studied in its mating population VI (MP). This species is known for its ability to cause disease in over 100 plant genera and opportunistic infections in humans. The genome analysis revealed 17 chromosomes ranging from 530 kb to 6.52 Mb, with a total size of 54.43 Mb and 15,707 predicted genes, the largest in ascomycetes. Two gene classes contributed to expansion: specific genes not found in other fungi, including Fusarium gramineum, and genes present in single copies in other fungi but multiple in N. haocca MP. Some genes resulted from duplication, others from horizontal transfer. Supernumerary chromosomes 14, 15, and 17 were confirmed absent in pulsed gel electrophoresis experiments, lacking isolate-specific sequences on ends. These chromosomes contain repeat-rich, unique, duplicated genes, and lower G+C content compared to others. The origin of extra genes and supernary chromosomes is unknown, but expansion and size align with species' diverse habitats. Unique genes on supernary might account for isolates' different niches.
Researchers have developed a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to study the egress of pseudorabies virus (PR) particles from infected non-polar epithelial cells. The method uses total internal reflection (TIR) microscopy to image virus particles near the plasma membrane and a pH-sensitive probe to visualize exocyt. Single-particle tracking and mean displacement analysis reveal particles travel to the membrane inside acidified secretory vesicles. Rab GTPases Rab6, Rab8, and Rab11, regulators of the plasma-directed secretory pathway, are present on these vesicles. These vesicles undergo fast directional transport to the site of exyt, frequently near patches of LLβ, a complex anchoring microtubules to the plasma. Vesicles dock at the site of exyt for seconds before membrane fusion, displacing the virion across the plasma. After exyt, particles remain confined on the outer surface.
A study investigated the impact of Enterobius vermicularis infection and mebendazole treatment on intestinal microbiota and host response in 109 primary school children in Taich, Taiwan. The results showed that Enterobias infection increased gut microbiota diversity, which peaked after mebendazole administration. At the phylum level, Enterob infection and meend deworming were associated with decreased Fusobacteria and increased Actinob. At genus level, probiotic Bifobacterium abundance increased after Enterobias and meend treatment. Intestinal SIg level was lower in Enter-infected group, elevated in meend-treated. Pre-treatment Salmonella was associated with increased SIg after meend dewing.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to investigate the genetic basis of root length in Arabidopsis thalian and found that the narrow-sense heritability, a measure of additive genetic variation, was statistically zero. This suggests that standard genome-wide association approaches, which assume additive genetic variation, were unable to identify associated loci contributing to root length. However, the broad-sense herit, a measure of total genetic variation, was significant and primarily due to epistasis, the interaction between genetic loci. An epist genome-wide association analysis was performed to identify loci contributing to epist variance, revealing four pairs of interacting loci on seven chromosomal regions that met a multiple-testing corrected significance threshold. The genotype-phenotype maps of these pairs showed epasis cancelling out additive variance, explaining why they were not detected in standard GWA. The study's small population size increased the risk of identifying false epist due to testing associations with many markers in few phenotyped individuals. A new statistical approach estimated the false-positive rate, suggesting half the pairs were true associations. Experimental evaluation of candidate genes within associated loci suggested this estimate was conservative, identifying genes affecting root development in four of the pairs. The epist analyses confirmed and identified new candidates for root in wild-collected A. thaliana accessions.
Mitochondrial DNA (mt) mutations are a common cause of human disease, affecting multiple populations worldwide. The clinical presentation of pathogenic mt mutations is associated with mt haplogroup background, but it is unclear if this is limited to a few examples or a general phenomenon. To investigate, 30,506 mt sequences were sampled globally. After quality control, pathogenic scores were assigned to major alleles for each sequence. Pathogenic scores for disease-causing mutations differed significantly between mt haplogroups. Mutations were observed across haplog backgrounds, while others were specific to clades. Some reflected founder effects, others recurred within phylogenetic clusters. Sequence diversity showed disease-causing mutations more frequent in young sequences, genomes with two or more disease-causing more than expected by chance. These findings implicate mt background in recurrent events purified through natural selection in populations, explaining low mt disease frequency in specific groups.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study cell-cell interactions, specifically contact inhibition of locomotion (CIL), on microped substrates. These substrates restrict cell migration to linear, one-dimensional paths, leading to frequent collisions between polarized cells. The model includes mechanics of cell shape and a minimal chemical model for CIL to reproduce observed outcomes in two-cell collisions. A balance between internal polarization and cell-cell adhesion governs the collision outcome. Parameters controlling transitions between outcomes include cell-cell adhesion strength, propulsion, and CIL rates. These parameters suggest why different cell types exhibit distinct collision behavior and interventions modulate outcomes. The model reproduces heterogeneity in-cell collision observed in neural crest cells by either tuning parameters or assuming cell-to-cell variation in cell-adhesion.
Researchers have investigated the dissociation mechanism of the thioredoxin (Tr) mixed disulfide complex, a process that has been debated for over twenty years. The study focused on the complex between Tr and its endogenous substrate, arsenate reductase (Ars), where a Cys29Tr-CysArs disulfide is formed through nucleophilic attack of CysTr on oxidized CysArs. Theoretical analysis, molecular dynamics simulations, and biochemical experiments with cysteine mutants were used to study Tr disulfide dissociation. Conformational changes around the disulfide brought CysTr in contact with CTr, activating it for nucleophil attack by hydrogen bonds. CTr was found to be more reactive than CArs. Additionally, Tr directed its nucleophil attack on more susceptible C than C. This multidisciplinary approach provides insights into universal thiol/disulf exchange mechanism in reduced and oxidized Tr.
People's preferences for certain features or outcomes are not fixed and can be influenced by the preferences of others, even if conformity is not rewarded. Researchers hypothesized that individuals are uncertain about their own tastes and can learn about them by considering the preferences of others and updating their beliefs through Bayesian inference. If a person's choices reflect uncertainty, as in random-preference models, the degree of taste change should correlate with their choice variability. Temporal discounting is an example of taste-for-patience, quantifying impulsivity with psychometric properties that can change upon observing others' choices. A study of 14-24 year olds examined discounting behavior, including variability before and after observing another person's choices found evidence for taste uncertainty and Bayesian updating. Participants' decision variability was better accounted for by a random-taste than a response-noise model. Taste shifts were described by a Bayesian model accounting for uncertainty and social information relevance.
In budding yeast, multiple signaling pathways converge on the MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) pathway to regulate filamentous growth, a complex response to specific environmental conditions. A novel approach called secretion profiling was used to measure the extracellular release of Msb2, a mucin that functions at the head of the filamentous growth (FG) MAPK pathway. Secretion profiling of a genomic collections showed that pathways regulating filament growth (AS, RIM, O1, PI, and RT) were also required for FG activation. This sensitized the pathway to multiple stimuli and synchronized it with the global network. Several regulators were required for MS2 expression, identifying the MS2 promoter as a "hub" where signals converge. Accessibility to MS2 was regulated by histone deacetylase (HD) Rpd3L, positively regulating FG activity and filament growth.
Researchers investigated the role of gene expression changes in the evolution of divergent morphologies in filamentous fungi, specifically in the genus Sordarcomycetes, by culturing five species in a common environment and profiling genome-wide gene expression at five developmental stages. They reconstructed ancestral gene expression phenotypes and identified genes with the largest increases in expression across development. Knockout experiments and phenotypic analysis in two divergent species showed altered fruiting body development in species with increased expression. This approach proved more efficient than gene deletion studies targeting whole genomes or families. Combining expression measurements with phenotypes refined Bayesian networks underlying fruit body regulation, a poorly understood process in multicellular development.
Researchers investigated the use of square electroporation to introduce transgenes and macromolecules into Schistosoma mansoni eggs, a developmental stage with a high ratio of germ to somatic cells. Eggs were incubated with Cy-labeled siRNA and exposed to square electrop, resulting in Cy-signals detected by fluorescence in eggs and miracidia hatched from treated eggs. Electrop was also used to introduce mRNA encoding firefly luciferase, with luciferase activity detected 3 hours later, whereas lucase was not evident in eggs soaked in mRNA. Schist eggs were exposed to Moloney murine leukemia virions (ML) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis glycoprotein V, with proviral trans detected by PCR in genomic DNA from miria hatched vir-exposed eggs. Quantitative PCR analysis showed electrop of virions resulted in 2-3 times more copies of provirus in schosomes compared to soaking alone. Additionally, relative PCR indicated a copy number for proviral luciferase trans of ∼20 for 100 copies of representative endogenous cathepsin D. Square electrop facilitated introduction of trans into schosome. Electrop was more effective for transduction with pseudyped ML than simply soaking eggs in virions.
Researchers have developed a novel approach called Perturbation Markovian Transmission (PM) to study the dynamic behavior of large macromolecular assemblies, which are crucial for various biological processes in cells. These assemblies communicate through allosteric interactions between parts, influencing cellular signaling. Previous studies on topology and fluctuation dynamics of coarse-grained residue networks provided insights, but lacked time-dependent behavior characterization. The PM model monitors responses of over 8,000 residues across 6 decades of time, using Klov subspace projection, yielding rich information. Criteria of relaxation time, flow, amplitude, and oscillation dynamics identify pivotal residues for movement, signaling, and binding. Applying PM to the GroEL-Gro chaperone system, predictions showed 71-84% accuracy compared to independent literature studies. This method can be applied to other macromolecular machineries like the capsid and ribosomal complex.
Researchers have investigated the role of fungal galectins, a type of carbohydrate-binding protein found in fungi, and their interaction with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that feeding the galectin Coprinopsis cinerea CGL2 to C. elegans inhibited its development and ultimately led to its death. The toxicity of CGL was dependent on its ability to bind to fucose-containing glycojugates, as evidenced by the lack of toxicity of a carbohydrate-defective C2 variant and resistance of a C. elegans mutant defective in fucose biosynthesis. A screen for C2-resistant mutants identified the glycojugate as a Gal1,4Fuc1,6 modification of C. elegans N-glycans. Analysis of N-glycans in wild-type and C2-resistant nematodes confirmed this finding and identified a putative glycosyltransferase required for its biosynthesis. The crystal structure of C2 and Gal1,4uc,6Glc trischar at 1.5 resolution revealed the basis for this interaction. These results suggest galectins play a role in fungal defense against predators by binding specific glycojugates of organisms.
Researchers have investigated the impact of long-lived reservoirs of latently infected CD4+ T cells on the evolution of HIV within and between hosts. A within-host quasis model incorporating a long-lived reservoir was developed and nested into an epidemiological model of HIV dynamics. For biologically plausible parameter values, the presence of a reservoir was found to delay evolutionary dynamics within a host, with longer delays associated with larger reservoir sizes and homeostatic proliferation of cells within the reservoir. This delay can change the dynamics of the virus at the epidemiological scale. In particular, the within-host delay can allow the virus to evolve intermediate loads consistent with maximising transmission, as observed, rather than high loads previously predicted by models. This effect can be enhanced if viruses similar to those initiating infection are preferentially transmitted. The results depend on within characteristics such as reservoir size, with evolution of intermediate loads only occurring when dynamics are sufficiently delayed. The study suggests the reservoir plays an underappreciated role in both within and between-host evolution.
Coxsievirus B3 Inhibits Antigen Presentation, Exerting Profound Selective Effect on MHC Class I Pathway

Researchers investigated how Coxsievirus B3 (CV3) affects antigen presentation to the immune system, using transgenic CD4 and CD8 T cells as sensors. They found that CV3 almost completely inhibits antigen presentation via the MHC I pathway, evading CD8 T cell immunity. In contrast, presentation of CV3-encoded MHC II epitopes is relatively unaffected, and CV3 induces CD4 T responses that are phenotypically normal. CV3-specific CD4 cells display an effector phenotype, mature into multi-functional memory cells that expand following infection and differentiate into secondary effector cells secreting multiple cytokines.
A Phase II Randomized Double-Blind Trial of High-Dose Intravenous Methylprednisone and Oral Predolone versus Intravenous Normal Saline and Oral Predolone in Individuals with Lepros Type 1 Reactions and/or Nerve Function Impairment

This study investigated the efficacy of high-dose intravenous methylprednisone in combination with oral predolone versus intravenous normal saline and oral predone in treating leprosy Type 1 reactions and nerve function impairment. Lepros Type 1 reactions cause significant nerve damage and disability, and corticosteroids are the standard treatment, but optimal dose and duration are unclear. Type 1 reactions have a Th1 immune profile, with interferon-γ and interleukin-12 expression in cutaneous and neural lesions. Methylprednisone has been used in Th1 diseases like rheumatoid arthritis to modulate the immune response.

Forty-two individuals were randomized to receive methylprednis followed by predone (n=20) or predone alone (n=22). There were no significant differences in adverse events or clinical improvement at completion. However, methylpred individuals were less likely to deteriorate in sensory function between day 29-113. Fifty percent with Type 1 and nerve impairment required additional predone despite 16 weeks corticoids. The study supports prolonged corticoid courses for Type 1 and investigates recurrence factors during cortoid treatment.
Researchers investigated the role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in modulating CD8+ T cell responses in chronic HIV infection. In contrast to Treg from HIV-negative individuals, Treg from HIV-infected patients (T/HIV+) did not suppress polyclonal autologous CD+ T cell function, suggesting a defect in suppressive capacity of T/H+ or insensitivity of effector cells to infection. However, T/H+ inhibited IFN-γ expression of autolog CD+ cells stimulated with CMV/EBV/Flu (CEF) antigens, but not HIV-specific CD+ cells. Cross-cultures showed T/H inhibited differentiation of CEF- or HIV-specific CD+ cells from infected patients. PD-1 and PD-L expression was higher on HIV-specific CD+ cells than CEF CD+ cells, and these markers did not change after T depletion or co-culture with T/H-, unlike C-specific CD+ cells. T/H+ failed to modulate differentiation and expression of PD-1/P-L on HIV-specific CD cells, suggesting a defect contributing to exhaustion of HIV-specific responses.
Researchers evaluated the potential of Wuchereria bancrofti glutathione-S-transferase (GST) as a vaccine candidate against lymphatic filariasis. GST is a protein produced by the parasite that counteracts oxidative radicals in the host's immune system, allowing it to survive in the lymphatic vessels for years. Although GST has been studied as a vaccine candidate for other parasites, its potential for lymphatic filari has not been explored. The study cloned and expressed the GST gene from the third larval stage of W. bancrofti and purified the recombinant protein. Serum from individuals living in an endemic area showed significant levels of anti-GST antibodies compared to those who were microfilaric or had clinical symptoms. Isotyping revealed a predominance of IgG and Ig3 antibodies in endemic individuals. Functional analysis of the recombinant GST showed it retained enzymatic activity and antibodies from endemic sera inhibited this activity. Similar results were obtained with antibodies raised in mice in neutralization assay. Brugia mal GST and WGST showed significant similarity. To evaluate vaccine potential, B. mal was used as challenge. Antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity assay confirmed role of human and mouse antibodies. Subsequent studies in jird model showed approximately 61% protection against B. mal infection in immunized with GST. Results indicate GST is a potential vaccine against lymphatic filari, achieving 61% protection in jird model. The protein retained enzymatic activity and this appears critical for parasite survival in host.
CRISPR-Cas technologies have revolutionized genome editing in experimental organisms and hold immense therapeutic potential. Despite advancements in understanding the CRISPRas system, concerns persist regarding potential off-target effects remain. Recent studies employed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of edited embryos or animals to identify de novo mutations (DNMs), which may represent changes introduced by poor editing fidelity. However, these studies used strain-matched, not pedigree-matched controls, making it difficult to distinguish generational or colony differences from DNMs. This study employed a trio design and whole-genome sequenced 8 parents and 19 embryos, 10 of which were mutagenized with well-characterized gRNAs targeting the coat Tyrosinase (Tyr) locus. Detailed analysis of whole-genome data revealed that if CRPR mutagenesis caused SN or indel off-target mutations in embryos, the number of these mutations was not statistically distinguishable from background DNMs due to other processes.
Researchers have identified two proteins, Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 (HR1) and Phosphatase 7 (PP7), that play a crucial role in controlling stomatal aperture in Arabidopsis plants. Stomatal pores on the leaf epidermis regulate CO2 uptake for photosynthesis and water loss by transpiration, affecting photosynthesis, water efficiency, and crop yields. Blue light, an environmental signal, is perceived by blue/UV-absorbing cryptochromes phototropins, but the transduction cascades linking perception to stomatal response are unknown. Mutations in HR1 or PP lead to stomatal misregulation and reduced water loss under blue light. Both HR and PP are expressed in guard cells in response to light-dark or dark-light transition. HR interacts with PP through N-terminal zinc finger motif and requires PP for stomatal response. HR is phosphorylated in vivo and PP dephosphorylates HR. HR is dephosphorylated in 193 kDa complex in dark, blue increases to 285Da in light. In PP mutant, this shift impaired and HR predominantly phosphorylated. Modification of HR by PP under blue is essential for proper conformation or assembly of functional HR complex. Guard cells control stomatal response to multiple stimuli.
The Mediator subunit MDT-15 plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression in response to ingested materials in Caenorhabditis elegans. MDT-15 interacts with the sterol response binding protein SBP-1 and the nuclear receptor NHR-49 to modulate fatty acid metabolism. However, MDT-15 has a broader function, integrating metabolic responses to ingested materials. Depletion of MDT-15 or mutation of the mdt-15 gene impairs induction of detoxification genes in response to xenobiotics and heavy metals, rendering animals hypersensitive to toxins. MDT-15 selectively affects stress responses related to ingestion, as defects do not impact other stress responses such as thermotolerance. MDT-15 integrates transcriptional pathways to monitor availability and quality of ingested materials, including nutrients and xenobiotics.
Researchers have proposed a new paradigm for understanding how the hippocampus, a brain region responsible for spatial navigation, forms mental maps of the environment. Contrary to the assumption that it encodes geometric information such as distances and angles, they suggest that the pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information. Coiring implies spatial overlap of place fields, leading to a topological map encoded by coiring based on connectivity and adjacency. A computational model of hippocampal activity was tested with varying parameters (firing rate, place size, and number) in simulations of rat trajectories in topologically and geometrically distinct environments. Using Persistent Homology, an algebraic topology tool, patterns of coiring conveyed topological information in biologically realistic time. Simulations revealed a "learning" region where interplay between parameters produced hippocamp states more or less adept at map formation. Lower number of neurons could be compensated by firing or place size adjustments, but beyond a point formation failed. This region provides a theoretical lens to view conditions impairing spatial learning by altering cell rates or specificity.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) production involves the assembly of virions on the surface of lipid droplets, envelopment at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and egress via the secretory pathway. However, the cellular requirements and mechanistic understanding of HCV secretion are incomplete. This study combined RNA interference (RNAi) analysis of host factors for HCV secretion with live cell imaging of H core trafficking to gain a detailed understanding of H egress. RNA studies identified components of the secretory pathway, including ER-Golgi trafficking, lipid kinases, and proteins that regulate trans-Golgi network (TGN), VAMP vesicles and adaptor, and recycling endosome. The results support a model where HCV is enveloped at ER and exits the cell via secretory pathway. An infectious HCV with tetracycline (TC) tag in core was constructed to monitor core trafficking in association with cellular cofactors. Only trafficking events required essential H assembly factor NS2 were quantified. Core trafficked to cell periphery microtubules, inhibited by nocodazole. Subpopulations localized Gol and co-trafficked recycling endosome. Silencing recycling component Rab11 resulted accumulation H core Gol. Majority trafficked with apolipoprotein (ApoE) and VAMP vesicles.
Researchers investigated the role of the imprinted gene Grb10 in tumor formation in mice with a mutation in the Neurofibromatosis tumor suppressor gene 1 (NF1), which is associated with an increased risk of radiation-induced malignancies. They found that Gr10 expression was absent in tumor cell lines from these mice, and that the expressed allele was commonly lost in NF1 mutant tumors. Gr10 is an imprinted, meaning it is expressed from only one parental allele, and heterozygous loss leads to complete loss of expression. Genetic alterations are common in tumorigenesis, but the role of imprinted genes is not well understood. The study tested whether Gr10 restoration or loss affected tumor growth features. Restoring Gr10 in NF1 mutant tumors decreased proliferation, soft agar formation, and downregulated Ras signaling. Conversely, Gr10 silencing in untransformed mouse fibroblasts increased proliferation and Ras-GTP levels. Expression of constitutively activated MEK rescued cells from Gr10-mediated reduction in colony formation. These results show that Gr10 loss can occur in tumorigenesis, with consequences in untransform primary cells. In tumors, Gr10 loss promotes Ras hyperactivation, which promotes hyperproliferation, an early tumor feature. This study identifies a novel role for an imprinted gene in tumenesis in the context of a NF1 mutant mouse model.
Human Pavlovian fear conditioning, a process of learning to predict threats from environmental cues, is a fundamental skill in changing environments. Despite numerous studies on neural mechanisms forming associations between neutral and aversive events, computational understanding is fragmented. Different models give opposing predictions for trial-by-trial dynamics of learning, such as autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity. This study investigates ANS responses to conditioned stimuli during Pavlov fear conditioning. A statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling provides precise, trial-by-trial, single-subject estimates of AN responses. Proposed non-probabilistic, probabilistic, and non-learning models, as well as observation functions linking models with AN activity are considered. Across three experiments, skin conductance (SCR) and pupil size (PS) responses are measured. A probabilistic model best explains AN responses. SCR and PS reflect different quantities: SCR tracks expected uncertainty and outcome, while PS tracks outcome. Combining psychophysiological with computational theory, evidence is provided that Pavlov threat formation in humans relies on probabilistic inference and uncertainty estimation. This informs neural aversive learning theories.
Researchers have identified a new regulator of the septation network (SIN) in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, called PomA, which suppresses asexual reproduction by affecting the phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The septation network, composed of the conserved Cdc7 kinase cascade, is crucial for cytokinesis and asexual reproduction, while the MAPK pathway responds to stress and environmental factors through successive phosphorylation. PomA is a negative regulator of septation and conidiation, as the pom mutant exhibits defects in septation and conidiation, and overexpression of Pom suppresses septation. Under normal conditions, Sep positively regulates the phosphorylation of MAP-Hog, while Pom reverses this process. In the absence of Pbs, a putative upstream member of Hog, Pom and Sep are unable to affect Hog phosphorylation. Under osmotic conditions, induced Hog is capable of bypassing Sep, a key player in early cytokinesis, but not Mob/SB, last in the SIN kinase cascade, indicating osmotic-induced septation bypasses Sep but not SIN. Findings show crosstalk between SIN and MAP pathways. Pom and Sep indirectly regulate Hog phosphorylation through Hog upstream kinases.
A study was conducted to investigate the association between the presence of Leishmania virus 1 (LRV1) and mucosal manifestations in tegumentary leishiasis (TL) patients. TL is endemic in Latin America, with approximately 20,000 cases reported annually, and its pathogenesis is not fully understood. Clinical manifestations vary from cutaneous leishias (CL) to severe outcomes such as disseminated leishias (DL), mucosal leishias (ML), and diffuse cutaneous leishias (DCL). The study included 156 patients from Rondon's Hospital of Tropical Medicine with leishias clinical diagnoses (109 CL, 38 ML, 5 CL+ML, DL, and DCL) and molecular diagnoses confirmed by PCR targeting hsp and DNA sequences and HSP PCR-RPL. LRV was tested by RT-PCR. Leishmania species were detected: 121 (77.6%) Leishmania Viia braziliensis, 18 (11.5%) Leish V guyensis, 3 (1.8) Leish V laini, 2 (1.3) Le Leish amazonensis, and 2 (1.3) Leish V shawi. Six (3.9%) were Leish sp. but species not determined, and 4 (2.6) were mixed L. V. brazili and L. V. guy. LRV was detected in L. braz (54), L. guy (5), L. amazon (2), L. lain (1), and inconclusive (6). Patients with CL+ML and DCL were excluded from analysis. Association between LRV and disease was tested among remaining 147 (CL=109, ML=38). Of them, 71.1 (n=27) muc lesions were LRV+ and 28.9 (n=11) LRV-. Cutaneous lesions 36.7 (n=40) LRV+ and 63.3 (n=69) LRV-. Ratio LRV+/LRV- was 2.93 (95%CI 1.57-5.46; p<.001), confirming LRV association with muc leishias as in animal models and LRV not sole factor in disease.
Type I interferon (IFN) plays a crucial role in protecting against pneumocococcal disease by inhibiting bacterial transmigration across the lung. Pneumococcus pneumonia is a leading cause of bacterial sepsis and meningitis, associated with high morbidity and mortality. IFN is elicited during pneumoc infection, but its significance was not well defined. Research shows IF counteracts transmigration of bacteria from lung to blood. Mice lacking type interferon receptor (Ifnar−) or treated with neutralizing antibody against IF exhibited enhanced bacteremia following intranasal pneumoc infection, while maintaining lung bacterial numbers. Treatment with IFβ or IF-inducing synthetic RNA (poly I:C) reduced bacteremia following intranas infection. IF led to upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation pneumoc receptor platelet activating factor (PAF receptor). IF reduced pneumoc invasion and trans across epithelial endothelial layers, Ifnar− showed enhanced lung permeability. Data identify IF as host defense component regulating mechanisms involved pneumoc invasion, PAF-mediated transcytosis and tight-dependent pericellular, limiting site-restricted infection to invasive disease.
Researchers have developed a multi-layered neural network that utilizes spike-dependent plasticity to learn a foraging tasks. A single-layer networks employing reward-modulated spike-dependent plasticity (STDP) can learn simple foraging tasks. This study demonstrates advanced pattern and continuous learning in a network of spiking neurons with multiple layers. The network uses both reward-modulated and non-rewardulated STDP and multiple mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy, including heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, output normalization of ST, and limits on synaptic strength. The addition of a hidden layer with non-reward ST neurons responded to specific inputs and performed basic classification of patterns. When combined with a layer implementing ST, the network learned discrimination between rewarding and punishing patterns without labeled data. Synaptic noise allowed trial-and-error learning to identify goal-oriented strategies effective in solving the task. The study shows a set of spiking network properties with ST sufficient to solve complex foraging involving pattern and decision-making.
In a mouse model of luminal breast cancer, the transcription factor ELF5 drives metastasis by recruiting Gr1+ myeloid-derived suppressor cells. During pregnancy, ELF5 establishes the milk-secreting alveolar cell lineage by directing the fate of mammary luminal progenitor cells. In cancer, ELF5 is a key determinant of tumor subtype and has been linked to anti-estrogen insensitivity. In the mammary tumor-Polyoma T (MT-PMT) model, ELF induction increased leukocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and blood vessel permeability in primary tumors, leading to increased size and number of lung metastasis. Myel-derived suppressor cells, a group of immature neutrophils, were recruited to the tumor in response to ELF. Depletion of these cells using LyG antibodies prevented ELF from vasculogenesis and metastasis. Expression in luminal breast cancers indicated myel cell invasion and inflammation correlated with ELF, and ELF staining predicted shorter metastasis-free and overall survival of lum patients with early disease progression. In the MMT-PMT model, ELF drives metastasis by co-opting the immune system. ELF has been implicated in anti-estrogen development, this implicates ELF as factor in acquisition of lethal phenotype in luminal breast.
Recent research has shown that the interaction between chromatin loops, characterized by three factors: connection pattern, distance, regulatory elements, and form, plays a crucial role in determining cell-to-cell variability in gene expression. To address this, a model was developed that maps three fundamental patterns of interacting DNA loops into a 4-state stochastic model of transcription. The study found that side-by-side loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce noise, whereas alternating loops have opposite effects. The effects of facilitated and direct looping on gene expression were compared, revealing that the former outperforms the latter in controlling expression and noise, but this control is distance-dependent, with a moderate loop length where the difference between the two forms is negligible.
Researchers have developed a new approach to design post-transcriptional regulators, called riboregulators, which can dynamically repress gene expression without the need for proteins like Hfq and CRISPR. However, there is a lack of general principles to design riboregulators, limiting their availability. To address this, researchers created translation inhibiting RNAs from scratch and explored their features related to thermodynamics and structure. 12 structural and thermodynamic features were identified, and 6 were retained from an in silico generated ribg library. 18 riboreulators were selected and co-expressed with target regions to link inhibiting features to functionality. Experiments showed ribg repressed protein expression by up to 60%, which was partially explained by ordinary least squares model. A regression model was constructed to link ribg properties to repression. Both structural and therm features were important for efficient gene repression by ribg. This approach enables reliable de novo engineering of effective ribg, expanding RNA toolbox for gene modulation.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms of transient associations among neurons in the cortex, which are thought to underlie memory and behavior. They recorded local field potential (LFP) activity at multiple sites in the cortex of awake monkeys and organotypic cultures. The study found that when the activity of a local group of neurons exceeds a threshold, its pattern is reflected in LFP without distortion at other sites via fast synaptic transmission. Large-amplitude LFPs, called coherence potentials, extend up to hundreds of milliseconds and mark loss-less spread of temporal information like action potentials at single-cell level. Coherence potentials have additional degree of freedom in diversity of waveforms, providing high-dimensional parameter for encoding and identification of associations. This behavior is analogous to spread of ideas and behaviors in social networks.
Researchers conducted a systematic screen of yeast gene deletion mutants to investigate the factors involved in nuclear size control. The study found that nuclear size correlates with cell size, but the underlying mechanism was unknown. The screen identified 25 essential factors that alter nuclear size and implicated RNA processing and LINC complexes in size regulation. Analysis revealed both smaller and larger nuclear phenotypes and highlighted global processes and structural components crucial for size control.
Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment for various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease and essential tremor (ET). Current DB involves delivering constant-frequency pulses via implanted electrodes. Closed-loop approaches adapt stimulation to ongoing brain activity, potentially improving efficiency and reducing side effects. Success depends on devising a strategy minimizing neural oscillations associated with motor disorders. A step towards this is a mathematical model describing brain oscillations when stimulation is applied. Our work uses coupled oscillators to represent neurons generating pathological oscillations. A reduced Kuramoto model analyzes patient response to stimulation with given phase and amplitude, under conditions. For patients, best strategy is phase-specific and greater effect when amplitude is lower. Predictions compared with ET data. A hybrid strategy combining phase-locked and adaptive DB is proposed.
Researchers have developed a new loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, named Biom-LAMP, to detect Schistosoma mansoni in Biomphalaria glabrata snails, the intermediate host of the parasite causing intestinal and hepatic schistosiasis. The assay targets a 28S-18 rRNA ribosomal intergenic spacer sequence and has a detection limit of 0.1 fg of S. mansoni DNA at 63°C in 50 minutes. BiomAMP was evaluated in experimentally infected snails exposed to miracidia at different times post-exposure: prepatent period, light infections, and detection of infected snails in pooled samples. DNA extraction was performed using a commercial kit or simple NaOH method. BiomAMP detected S. mansoni in all snail groups without complicated DNA extraction procedure. The assay is specific, sensitive, rapid, and cost-effective for screening intermediate hosts with S. mansoni in individual snails and pooled samples. It is suitable for large-scale field surveys for schistos control in endemic areas.
In Sri Lanka, deng has been a reported as a public health problem since the 1960s and has become a priority for public health authorities. The Ministry of Health is responsible for controlling deng and other disease outbreaks and healthcare. A large number of public health staff are involved in deng control activities year-round and provide free care to deng patients at secondary hospitals, placing a significant financial burden on the public sector. This study estimated public costs of deng control and hospitalizations in Colombo, the most urban district in Sri Lanka, during 2012 from the Ministry's perspective. Using cost tools, costs were collected and analyzed retrospectively using a combination of activity-based and costing approaches. Total deng control and hospitalization costs were estimated at $3.45 million ($1.50 capita in Colombo in 201. Personnel accounted for 79% of deng control costs and 46 of hospitalization costs. The per capita deng control cost was $0.42. Hospitalization costs ranged $216-609 for pediatric and $196-866 for adult according to disease and treatment severity. This is the first assessment of deng burden in the public sector in Sri Lanka. Country-specific evidence is needed for setting health priorities and deploying technologies. Results suggest deng a major burden on public sector Sri Lanka.
A predominantly Neolithic origin of European paternal lineages has been debated, with contributions from Paleolithic hunter-gatherers and Neolithic farmers from the Near East. Haplogroup R1b2 (R-M269) is the most common European Y-chromosome lineage, increasing in frequency from east to west, carried by 1 in 10 European men. Previous studies suggested a Paleolithic origin, but the geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity is best explained by a single source in the Near East Anatolia during the Neolithic. This indicates most European Y-chromosomes originate from the Neolithic expansion. This pattern contrasts with maternally inherited DNA, suggesting a unique role for males in the transition.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between movement variability and motor learning speed, suggesting that variability may enhance learning. A computational model of motor adaptation was used to examine the effects of variability on learning, revealing both positive and negative outcomes. Experimental results showed decelerating effects of variability on learning. A meta-analysis of published studies across various experiments found no statistical correlation between movement variability and learning rate. Motor learning is a complex process that can be modeled, but further research is needed to understand involved factors.
The RelA, a member of the NF-κB family, plays a crucial role in immune and inflammatory responses, survival, and proliferation by regulating genes involved in these processes. Rel interacts with transcription coactivators CREB-binding protein (CB) and its paralog p300 to activate transcription. The Rel:CB/p300 complex consists of two components: Rel's DNA-binding domain interacts with CB's KIX domain, and Rel's transcription activation domain (TAD) binds CB's TAZ. Phosphorylation of Rel's conserved Ser276 is necessary for interaction and a decisive factor for Rel:CB/p300. The role of this interaction in Rel-activated transcription remains unclear. This study provides the structure of the Rel:CB complex by NMR spectroscopy, revealing Rel's TAD folding upon binding TAZ through conserved hydrophobic sites on TAZ surface. Analysis with mutational and isothermal calorimetric studies designed Rel-mutants abrogating distinct Rel:CB/p300 components. Cell-based studies, modeling, and genome-wide expression showed a major Rel-activated genes affected by this interaction. Rel:CB/p300 controls NF-κ response through NF- feedback loop. Chromatin analyses Rel target promoters showed CB/p constitutive recruitment, indicating CB/p role in Rel recruitment Rel sites.
Time-course Gene Set Analysis (TSA) is an extension of gene set analysis methods for longitudinal gene expression data. It uses random effects modeling with maximum likelihood estimates to analyze repeated measurements, including unbalanced data with missing at random (MAR) measurements. TSA is a hypothesis-driven method that identifies a prior-defined gene sets with significant variations over time, accounting for heterogeneity within sets. It compares biological conditions and indicates if set patterns differ significantly. The method was applied to two real datasets: the DAL-1 trial and a study on influenza and pneumococcal vaccines. In the DAL-1 trial, TSA revealed 69 gene sets with significant change over time, while univariate gene analysis and Gene Set Enrich Analysis (GSEA) failed to detect patterns. In the second dataset, TSA identified 4 sets linked to influenza, previously associated with pneumoccal. TSA exhibited good statistical properties and power in simulations, outperforming other time-course gene set analysis methods. The method is available through an R package.
A systematic effort has been made to map the global endemicity of Plasmodium vivax, a malaria parasite that has received less attention than Plasmodium falciparum. The study updated the geographical limits of P. viv transmission to 2010 and used 9,970 geopositioned parasite rate surveys from 1985-2010 to estimate endemic age-standardized parasite rates within 5x5 km grid squares. A spatiemporal Bayesian model was used, incorporating Duffy phenotype data to suppress endemic predictions in Africa. Endemicity was predicted within a narrow range globally, with estimates rarely exceeding 7%. The Americas contributed 22% of global risk, but areas were sparsely populated and only 6% of 2.5 billion people at risk. In Africa, Duffy negativity constrained transmission to Madagascar and parts of the Horn, 3.5% global. Central Asia had 82% global risk, with high areas in India and Myanmar. South Asia had highest endemic in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, 9% global.
Staphylococcus aureus, a common pathogen responsible for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), employs various cell-wall anchored proteins to facilitate adhesion and invasion of host tissues and evade the immune system, contributing to its virulence. One such protein, clumping factor B (ClB), has been implicated in nasal colonization through interaction with the cornified envelope of the anterior nares. However, its role in SIs has not been investigated. This study reveals a novel function of Cl in SIs. Cl is essential for abscess formation and bacterial load during early infection, mediated by interaction with loricin, expressed in abs tissue. Targeting Cl with a vaccine elicited both humoral and cellular responses, conferring protection against S aureus skin infection. Cl is identified as a key antigen for future SIs vaccines.
Researchers have developed a stochastic framework to predict the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) against HIV, using dolutegravir (DT) as an example. The framework integrates pharmacological, viral, and host factors determining prophylactic efficacy. It combines population pharmacokinetics of DT with a stochastic model to predict plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM that prevent 50 and 90% of sexual transmissions, respectively. The model predicts reduction in HIV infection when DT is used in EP, PrEP, and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) before/after exposure. Daily EP with 50mg DT prevents 99-100% of infections and 85% when 50 of dosing events are missed. EP 'on demand' prevents 79-84% and PE >80 when initiated within 6 hours after exposure and continued as long as possible. The framework can be adapted to other EP candidates, indicating oral 50 DT is non-inferior to Truv. Predicted 90% concentrations guide release kinetics of developed DT nano-formulations.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection induces autophagy to enhance its replication. However, the regulation of the autophagic pathway by HCV remains unclear. This study demonstrates that HCV induces the expression of Rubicon and UVR, which inhibit and stimulate the maturation of autophagosomes, respectively. Rubicon expression is induced promptly by HCV, while UVR induction is delayed, resulting in autophag accumulation at early infection points. Rubicon inhibits maturation of autophosomes in H-infected cells, confirmed by siRNA knockdown and overexpression of Rubicon, enhancing and suppressing maturation autosomes. Rub plays a positive role in H replication, as suppression reduces H replication and overexpression enhances replication. In contrast, UVR overexpression facilitates maturation autosomes and suppresses H replication. The H subgenomic replicon, expressing nonstructural proteins, induces Rubicon and autag accumulation. Further analysis indicates NSB protein sufficient to induceicon and autosomes. Results show H, differentially inducing Rub and UVR, temporally regulates autagic to enhance replication.
Cyclin-like 1 (Cny1) is a newly identified member of the cyclin family with high sequence similarity to Cyclin Y (Cny). In mice, Cny1 is predominantly expressed in the testis, with levels seven times higher than Cny. Male C1- mice are infertile, while both male and female C- mice display normal fertility, indicating C1, not C, is essential for male fertility. Spermatoa from C- mice exhibit impaired motility, thin annulus region, and bent head. The protein, not mRNA level of cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CD16) is decreased in testis C- mice. C1 interacts with CD16, increasing stability and kinase activity of CD16. CD16 phosphorylation levels are altered in presence C1. Phosphorylation sites of CD by mass spectrometry reveal modifications on N-terminal CD indispensable for C binding and modulation CD kinase activity. C1 regulates spermatogenesis through interaction and modulation CD16.
Enterohemorrhagic Escheria coli (EHE) strains cause diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome due to toxin-mediated vascular endothelial injury. EHE hemolysin (EC-H), a member of the RTX repeats-toxin family, is an E virulence factor of increasing importance. The toxin exists as free EC-H and EC-H associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by E during growth. While the free toxin is lytic to endothelium, the effects of OM-associated EC-H on vascular and intestinal epithelial cells, major targets during E infection, are unknown. 

Research demonstrates that OM-associated EC-H does not lyse cells but triggers apoptosis in human microvascular endothelial (HBMEC) and Caco-2 cells. The toxin is internalized via dynamin endocytosis and trafficked into endo-lys compartments. Upon acidification and pH drop, EC-H is separated from OM, probably via pore-forming, and targets mitochondria. This decreases transmembrane potential and translocation cyto c to cytos, indicating permeabilization of membranes. Subsequent activation casp- and cas-3 leads apoptotic death evidenced by fragmentation and condensation. The ability to trigger apoptotic pathway in microvascular and epithelial cells indicates mechanism involvement in E diseases. OM-mediated intracellular delivery represents mechanism for bacterial to target mitochondria.
In the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the process of transcript elongation by RNA polymerase II (RNAPI) is accompanied by conserved patterns of histone modification. Histone modifications have established roles in transcription initiation, but their functions during elongation are not well understood. Mono-ubiquination of histone H2B (H2ub) plays a key role in coordinating co-transcription histone modification by site-specific methylation of histone H3. H2ub also regulates gene expression through an unidentified methylation-independent mechanism. This study reveals bidirectional communication between H2ub and Cdk, the ortholog of metazoan transcription elongation factor (PTEFb), in yeast. Chemical and genetic analyses show that lowering Cdk activity or preventing phosphorylation of its substrate, transcription factor Spt, reduces H2ub in vivo. Conversely, mutations in H2ub pathway impair Cdk recruitment to chromatin and Spt phosphorylation. Moreover, Spt phosphorylation-site mutation combined with deletion of histone H3 Lys methyltransferase Set, phenocopies morph and growth defects due H2ub loss, suggesting partially redundant roles Cdk and Set downstream H2ub. Surprisingly, mutation histone H2 ubiqu-acceptor residue relaxes Cdk activity in vivo and Cdk mutations suppress cell-morph defects Hub deficient. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrate opposing Cdk and Hub on transcribing RNAPI distribution.
Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South America. To understand the evolutionary history of this emerging pathogen, a phylogenetic analysis was performed on the largest YF dataset to date, comprising the prM gene from 133 isolates from 22 countries over 76 years. The results indicate that circulating YF strains arose in Africa within the last 1,500 years and emerged in the Americas following the slave trade approximately 300-400 years ago. These viruses then spread westward across the continent and persist in the jungles of South America. The study demonstrates how sequence data can be used to test hypotheses of viral dispersal and demographics, and the role of human migration in the spread of disease.
Researchers studied a virulent Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate in a mouse model of colonization and disease transmission, with and without influenza A virus (IAV) co-infection, to identify bottlenecks in pneumocococcal pathogenesis. A comprehensive analysis of population bottlenecks in this model revealed that, in the presence of IAV co-infection, the pathogen must pass through single bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and transmission between hosts. Passage through these bottlenecks was not associated with genetic adaptation of the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission occurred between exit from one host and establishment in another, with number of shed organisms in secretions critical to overcoming it. These findings demonstrate that viral infection and TLR-dependent innate responses stimulate and are required to control bacterial contagion.
Researchers investigated the immune response of humans to saliva proteins from the sand fly Phlebotus orientalis, a vector of Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis in Eastern Africa. The study aimed to evaluate exposure to sand fly bites in human populations from endemic areas. Volunteers' sera were tested against recombinant P. orient salivary antigens, produced using bacterial and mammalian expression systems. Two recombinant proteins, m5 and mY1, were identified as promising antigens with high correlation and specificity to whole fly saliv gland homogen. Combination of both proteins increased correlation and predictive values of P orient exposure. This is the first report of screening sera for anti-P orient antibodies using recombin salary proteins. Recombinant proteins mY1 and m5 proved valid for screening sera from Sudan and Ethiopia for P bites. Utilization of both proteins increased detection of anti orient responses.
Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI) is a mobile genetic element associated with multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of pathogenic Enterobacteriaceae. It is mobilized by IncA and Inc plasmids (A/C plids), which trigger its excision from the chromosome through the transcriptional activator ACD. Although SGI is not self-transmissible, it carries genes NS, HS, and GS, coding for homologs of mating pore subunits NC, HC, and GC, encoded by A/C plids. This study investigated regulation of NS and HS and their role in SGI transmissibility. Transcription of NS and HS promoter sequences to lacZ confirmed inducibility by ACD. Mating experiments with SGI and Inc plid pCR mutants revealed interactions between the two elements. NC and HC are essential for C plid transfer, but SGI rescues individual mutants, showing NS, HS, and GS are functional. Complementation of C and S mutants showed that NS/HS replace NC/HC in C pore and GS and HS are required for SGI optimal transfer. Remodeling the C pore by S1 enhances transfer rate over plid. GS allows transfer between cells bearing Cids, disabling C entry mechanism. Tra facilitate S invasion of populations bearing Cids.
Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo-like kinase Cdc5 plays a crucial role in the DNA damage checkpoint and mitotic progression. When cells encounter persistent or irreparable DNA damage, they can escape cell cycle arrest through adaptation. The mechanism of adaptation remains unclear. Researchers found that CDC5 is essential for adaptation and its overexpression promotes faster adaptation, indicating high levels of Cdc modulate checkpoint inhibition of cell cycle machinery. To pinpoint CDC's step in the pathway, CDC was overexpressed from GAL promoter in damaged cells and examined key checkpoint steps individually. CDC overproduction had little effect on early steps leading to Rad53 activation. Sensors Ddc (9-1 complex member) and Ddc (D2/Mec complex member) localized to damage sites, Mec1 active, and Rad9 retained Mec phosphorylation. Damage-induced Rad9-Rad53 interaction remained intact. However, Rad53 hyperphosphorylation significantly reduced, consistent with cell-cycle loss during adaptation. CDC attenuates DNA checkpoint through Rad53 hyperosphorylation loss, allowing adaptation. Polo kinase homologs inhibit Clas activation, suggesting conserved function in vertebrates.
Researchers have developed a computational framework, known as the 3D Kirchhoff-Nern-Planck (KNP) framework, to study the dynamics of ion concentrations and electrical potential in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain on large spatial and temporal scales. This framework is crucial for understanding pathological conditions such as seizures, stroke, and depression, which are associated with changes in ion concentrations in the ECS. The KNP framework assumes electroneutrality, allowing it to circumvent charge relaxation processes on spatial scales of nanometers and nanoseconds, making it feasible to run simulations on spatial scales of millimeters and seconds on a standard computer. This is a significant improvement over previous models that required extensive computing power and were limited to small spatial and temporal scales or simplified one-dimensional processes. The 3D KNP framework was used to simulate the dynamics of ion and electrical potential surrounding a morphologically detailed pyramidal cell. The simulation demonstrated the efficiency of the framework and elucidated the neuron's contribution to electrodiffusive effects in the ECS. The authors envision future applications of the framework to more biologically realistic systems to explore pathological conditions with large variations in ECS.
A proposed budget cut to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) funding for mosquito-borne disease surveillance has the potential to leave the country unprepared to handle emerging and existing diseases. A study evaluated the impact of delayed responses to deng epidemics in a developed urban environment, using a mathematical model to simulate scenarios of delayed response to deng introduction in Cairns, Queensland, Australia. The results were coupled with surveillance and case management costs to estimate cumulative costs of each scenario. Halting surveillance increased epidemic management costs by an order of magnitude compared to sustained surveillance and early detection. Total costs of preparedness through surveillance were lower than response to vector-borne pathogens, excluding human lives and well-being costs. The study provides a science-based justification for reassessing the CDC vectororne program budget and emphasizes need for sustainable surveillance systems.
In a prospective study conducted in semi-urban and rural Nicaragua, researchers investigated dengue as a cause of acute febrile illness in children and adults. A total of 740 patients aged ≥1 year presenting with febrile were consecutively enrolled from Monday to Saturday daytime to early evening. Paired sera were obtained from 90% of the patients, and tested for deng IgG and IgM and serotyped deng virus using reverse transcript-PCR. The results showed that 63.5% of patients were seropositive for deng at enrollment, with seropreval increasing with age, reaching 90% in those over 20 years. Acute deng serotypes 1 and 2 were identified in 5.1% of patients, with only 8.1% of confirmed clinically suspected. The study found deng to be an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in western Nicaragua.
Arabidopsis leucine-rich receptor-like kinase NIL1 (NIL1) plays a crucial role in the induction of innate immunity against parasitic nematodes. Plant-paras nematodes cause significant economic losses worldwide, and effective defense against them relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by surface-localized receptors, leading to the activation of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). While PT has been extensively studied in various plant-pathogen interactions, its role in roots and plant-nemat interactions is less understood. This study reveals that nemat-derived elicitors can induce PT in Arabidopsis in a manner dependent on the immune receptor BAK. Consistent with BAK's role, a leucine-rich receptor-like kinase, NIL1, is specifically regulated upon nemat infection. NIL1 is essential for PT responses to nematodes and loss-of-function mutants are hypersusceptible to various nematodes. NIL is the first immune receptor involved in basal PT induction in plants or animals to nematodes.
Treatment of Schistosoma mansoni with milteine in vitro enhances serological recognition of worm surface antigens.

Researchers have repurposed the anti-cancer drug miline for the treatment of Leishmaniasis and found it to be effective against Schistos spp, targeting all life stages of the parasite. This study investigated the effect of treating Schos mansoni adult worms with miline on worm surface antigen exposure in vitro. An indirect immunofluorescence assay using rabbit-S mansoni adult homate and anti-S mansoni antisera showed strong immunofluorescence on S mansoni adult surface after miline treatment, with the latter antiserum previously shown to enhance schosidal activity of prazantel. Antibodies recognizing surface antigens on miline-treated worms were eluted in low pH buffer and used in western blot to identify antigenic targets in adult worm homogen extract (Sm). Four proteins reacted with antibodies were purified and proteomic analysis (MS/MS) confirmed as S mansoni: fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, Sm22.6 alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogen. These antibodies bound to 3-hour schosula surface and induced agglutination, suggesting a role in immune protection. This study reveals a novel miline anti-schistome action mechanism, previously lentenced with prazant (PQ), which unmasks surface antigens not exposed during infection. Antigens involved may be targets and antibodies could increase drug efficacy and contribute to re-infection resistance.
Bacillus cereus, an opportunistic pathogen, has evolved multiple systems to acquire iron from various sources to overcome its low solubility and bioavailability. While iron acquisition from heme and hemoglobin has been extensively studied, little is known about iron acquisition from ferritin, a 24-mer protein storing thousands of iron atoms within its cavity. The surface protein IlsA (Iron-regulated leucine rich surface type A) of B. cereus binds heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin in vitro and is involved in virulence. This study demonstrates IlsA acts as a ferritin receptor, causing ferritin aggregation on bacterial surface. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicates Ils binds several ferritins through interaction with subunits, while UV-vis data show significant iron release from ferritin in Ils presence. Disruption siderophore bacibactin production drastically reduces B. cere ability to utilize ferritin for growth and attenuates bacterial virulence in insects. A new model of iron acquisition B. cere involves Ils binding to ferritin followed siderore iron uptake is proposed. This highlights interplay between surface protein and siderore provides insights into B. adaptation and general pathogenesis.
Researchers have developed a thermodynamically consistent model of the post-translational circadian clock in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis elongatus. The clock is driven by a phosphorylation cycle of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. KaiC forms a homohexamer with two domains, CI and CII, which can bind and hydrolyze ATP, but only CII can be phosphorylated at two residues in a specific sequence. The model proposes two main ideas: ATP hydrolysis in CI provides thermodynamic force for clock switching Kai between active and inactive states; phosphorylation of CII drives hydrolysis in CI. The model explains how KaiA stimulates phosphorylation by acting as a nucleotide exchange factor and how Kai affinity for different Kai phosphoforms generates temporal order of phosphorylation. Phosphorylation in CII slows AD release from CI, making inactive KaiC state stable. Inactive Kai binds KaiB, stabilizing state and sequestering Kai, leading to dephosphorylation. A kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm simulates system of over a billion reactions, describing experimental data.
Hepatitis B virus (HB) suppresses the innate immune response to establish persistent infection, despite being a DNA virus, its pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) can be sensed by RIG and activates MAVS to mediate interferon (IFN) synthesis. However, the mechanism by which HBV fails to induce interferon-β (IFN) synthesis remained uncharacterized. This study demonstrates that HBV-induced parkin recruits the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LAC) to mitochondria and attenuates IFNβ synthesis. Parkin interacts with MAVS, accumulates unanchored polyubiquitin chains on MAV via LAC, disrupting MAV signalosome and IRF3 activation.
Researchers have identified a novel superantigen, pT, associated with Crohn's disease, encoded by the pT gene of Pseudomonas fluorescens. The crystal structure of pT was determined at 1.7 Å resolution, revealing its interaction with human class II MHC molecules. pT and its homolog, PA5, bound to mammalian cells and stimulated human lymphocyte proliferation, inhibited by anti-class II MHC HLA-DR antibodies and to a lesser extent by HLA-D and DP antibodies, indicating class IIHC-specific binding. pT efficiently precipitated both endogenous and recombinant HLA-DR molecules, directly interacting with HLA-DR. Competition studies showed pT and superantigen Mycoplas arthritidis mitogen (M) competed for HLA binding, indicating overlapping sites. Structural analysis classified pT as a Tet-family DNA-binding regulator. The pT structure indicates a new T superantigen family.
Researchers investigated the role of allelic patterns of Nanog expression in embryonic stem cell heterogeneity. Nanog is a key regulator of pluripotency, and its expression varies within stem cell populations in vivo and in vitro. A multiscale stochastic population equation framework was developed to understand how allelic regulation influences observed heterogeneity of Nanog in stem cells. Allelic expression and transcriptional noise were considered. Results showed that allelic Nanog expression led to three distinct Nanog states, while combined with transcriptional noise resulted in a bimodal distribution. Uniform populations gave rise to same Nan heterogeneity within ten cycles, regardless of allelic pattern. Depletion of NANOG was slower than accumulation, indicating Nan state-dependent dynamics. Allelic transcription raised questions about using stem cell lines with reporter genes knocked in single locus. Divergence was observed in reporter and protein profiles due to half-lives of insertion in one or both alleles. In stem with restricted Nan expression, allelic facilitated maintenance of self-renew cells with sufficient Nan content to prevent pluripotency loss. Findings highlight allelic control of Nanog as determinant of stem population heterogeneity, warranting investigation in cell specification and reprogramming.
Researchers have quantified and classified the expression of unused proteins in Escherichia coli across various environments, revealing that nearly half of the proteome is unused in certain environments. This unused protein expression incurs a quantifiable costs on cellular growth rates, accounting for >95% of the variance in growth rates across 16 distinct environments. A genome-scale model was developed to compute environment-specific cost and utility of the proteome on a per gene basis, utilizing absolute proteomics data. The study found that reduction in unused protein expression is a common mechanism to increase cellular growth in adaptive experiments. Unused proteins encode nutrient and stress-prepared functions, which may convey benefits in varying environments.
Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci harboring genetic variants associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in populations of European descent. To investigate the genetic architecture of T2 in diverse populations, a genome-wide association study was conducted in 3,955 Chinese, 2,010 cases and 1,945 controls, 2,034 Malays 794 and 1,240 controls, and 2,146 Indians 977 and 1,169 controls. The study aimed to identify novel variants implicated in T2 and assess the transferability of previous findings from European populations to the three major ethnic groups in Asia, comprising half the world's population. Of the SNPs associated with T2 in previous GWAS, variants at CDKAL and HXIDE/KIF showed strongest association with T in meta-analysis including all ethnic groups. However, consistent direction of effect was observed for many SNPs in this study and those in European populations. Examination of associations at CDAL and HXIDE/K loci provided evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity in relation to T2. Variation in linkage disequilibrium was detected between populations for most loci previously identified. These factors, with limited power, contributed to failure to detect associations in diverse populations. The study highlights the importance of surveying across racial/ethnic groups for fine-mapping causal variants and searching population-specific variants.
In the basidiomycous yeast Cryptoccus neoformans, nuclear division occurs in the daughter cell during mitosis, where kinetochores cluster and the nucleus migrates to the bud. Aurora kinase I1 (I1) localizes to the nucleus upon nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis in C. neoans. I1 is required for timely nuclear envelope breakdown and is essential for microtubule stability. Depletion of I1 results in delayed kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. An in silico modeling of mitosis suggests cytoplasmic microtules and dynein promote atypical division in C neo.ans. Introducing additional parameters, the model predicts cortical generated by cytoplasmic I and dyin regulates kinetore clustering and migration. In vivo alterations of I or dyin levels delay nuclear migration. In silico and live imaging suggest I spatiotemporally influences I and dyin activity with microtule stability for timely division. Timely nuclear breakdown by I allows its entry, facilitating spatiotemporal regulation of division during semi-mitosis in neoans.
Researchers investigated a case of aggressive medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with a somatic RET p.Cys634 mutation, a known to be a cancer driver mutation, and a germline RET p.C630 substitution, initially considered clinically irrelevant due to its synonymous nature. Next-generation sequencing revealed the two mutations were in cis, with no evidence of gene amplification. Expression analysis showed increased RET transcript levels in the patient with both mutations compared to MTCs with p.C634 mutations only. Minigene assays demonstrated the synonymous mutation alone explained the increased mRNA level. In silico and RNA immunoprecipitation experiments showed the p.C630 variant created new exonic splicing enhancer motifs, enhancing SRp55 recruitment to the mutant, leading to more efficient pre-mRNA maturation and increased mature mRNA encoding a constitutively active RET. These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations can contribute to cancer progression.
Researchers have developed a bioinformatics system to remove contaminants and low-complex genomic sequences from draft genomes of eukaryotic pathogens, enhancing the accuracy of metagenomic sequencing for diagnosing human infections. Metagen sequencing captures all DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a sample, but complete characterization depends on available genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes exist, increasing metagen's diagnostic power. However, contamination in published genomes increases false pathogen identification risk. The system identifies human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences in a comprehensive database of eukotic pathogen genomes and removes low-complex genomic sequences, another source of false positives. This pipeline produced a "clean" euk pathogen database for bioinformatics analysis. In metagen samples, the new database offers better sensitivity and reduced false positives compared to original genomes.
Researchers investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of Trypanosoma brucei in Uganda to understand the epidemiology of Sleeping Sickness Nagana. Despite a decline in Human African Trypanosomiasis (AT) on the African continent, it remains a significant health issue in Uganda, with sporadic outbreaks in traditional areas and spread to new regions. The study genotyped 269 isolates from Uganda and southwestern Kenya at 17 microsatellite loci and checked for the SRA gene, which confers human infectivity to T.bodesense. Results showed three distinct genetic clusters: cluster 1 and 3 from central and southern Uganda, cluster 2 from southwestern Kenya, not sorted by subspecies or collection date. Analyses revealed genetic admixture and long-range dispersal, suggesting recent gene flow between clusters. The expansion to new foci in central Uganda occurred from northward Todesense, confirming emergence of human infect strains from non-infect Tbr strains and cattle reservoir importance in shaping epidemiology in the region.
Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXIP) plays a crucial role in various cellular processes, including tumor suppression, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. However, its involvement in inflammation is not well understood. Research reveals that TXIP-deficient mice are more susceptible to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxic shock. In response to LPS, TXIP-deficient macrophages produce higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). The iNOS inhibitor rescues TXIP-deficient mice from endotoxic death, indicating NO is a key factor in TXIP-mediated endotoxicity. This susceptibility of TXIP-deficient mice occurs despite reduced IL-1β secretion due to increased S-nitrosylation of NLRP3 compared to wild-type controls.
Researchers have identified a previously uncharacterized protein, ZTF-8, in Caenorhabditis elegans, which plays a crucial role in DNA damage response and double-strand break repair in the germline. Germl mutations in DNA repair genes are linked to tumor progression, and failure to activate a DNA damage checkpoint or repair meiotic double-strand breaks can impair chromosome segregation. ZTF-8 interacts with the 9-1 complex and is required for both mitotic and meiotic double-strand break repair, as well as meiotic DNA damage activation. ZTF-8 mutants exhibit sensitivity to gamma radiation and hydroxyurea, mitotic arrest at S-phase accompanied by activation of ATL-1 and CHK-1 damage kinases, and accumulation of mitotic and meiotic recombination intermediates. This indicates Z-8 functions in double-strand break repair. However, impaired meiotic break progression fails to trigger CEP-1/p53-dependent damage in pachene, supporting a role in meiotic damage response. Z-8 partially localizes with the 9-1 complex and interacts MRT-2/Rad, a component of this complex. Human RH rescues phenotypes in Z- mutants, suggesting conservation across species. Z- is involved in promoting stalled forks and meiotic double-strands by transducing damage signaling via 9-1 pathway.
During neural tube development, multipotent progenitor cells differentiate into specific cell types in a spatial and temporal patterns. Researchers investigated the mechanism linking progenitor identity and differentiation in the neural tube, where motor neuron (MN) progenitors differentiate more rapidly than other progenitors. Using single-cell transcriptomics, they defined the transcriptional changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into MNs. Gene expression dynamics reconstruction from these data indicate a crucial role for the determinant Olig2 prior to MN differentiation. O2 represses the Notch signaling effectors Hes1 and H5. O2 repression of H5 appears to be direct, via a conserved element within H5 that restricts expression from MN progenitors. These findings show a tight coupling between patterning and differentiation regulatory networks, demonstrating O2 as a developmental coordinator of MN spatial and temporal generation.
Researchers investigated the role of cross-reactive T cells in clearing the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in non-human primates using a translational model. In a mouse model of influenza, T cells provide broad protection against multiple subtypes when antibodies against a single subtype fail. However, the role of T in humans remains unclear. The study infected rhesus macaques with a seasonal H1 isolate, resulting in detectable cellular and antibody responses but no neutralizing antibodies against H1dm. Four months later, the "primed" animals and naive controls were challenged with H1dm. In naive animals, CD8+ T cells appeared in blood and lung 5-7 days post-inoculation with Hdm, reaching peak 7-10 days. In contrast, T were recruited to lung as early as 2 days in "prim" animals, peaking in blood and lung 4-7 days. Interferon-γ ELisp and intracellular cytokine staining showed virus-specific response peaked and higher in "prim" than naive. This involved CD4 and CD8 T. Strikingly, "prim" cleared Hdm significantly from upper and lower respiratory than naive, before Hdm-specific neutralizing antibodies. Results suggest cross-react T mediate clearance antigenically novel virus in primates. Vaccines inducing such cells may protect against severe caused emerging influenza.
A novel Loop-Med Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay was developed for the rapid and sensitive detection of Coxiella burnetii, the causative agent of Q fever. The assay targets the repeated sequence IS111a of the htp gene of C. burnii using a universal primer set designed with Primer Explorer 4 software. The sensitivity of the LAMP was evaluated using known quantities of recombinant plasmids containing the targeted gene, with a limit of detection of 1 copy per reaction. Specificity was determined using 26 members of the Rickettsiaceae and 18 common pathogens, with no cross-reactivity observed. The LAMP was compared to real-time PCR on 24 blood samples, including 6 confirmed and 18 probable Q fever cases diagnosed by serological and real-time PCR, and 126 animal samples from 4 provinces, including goats, cattle, horses, marmots, and deer. The positive rate of febrile patients was 33.3% (95%CI 30.2-36.4) for LAMP and 8.3 (7.4-9) for real-time PCR (p<0.05). Similarly, the positive rate of animals was 7.9 (7-8) for LAMP and 0.8 (0.7-0.9) for real-time PCR (p<0.01). The LAMP was used to confirm Q fever in the Li area, Xinjiang Province. The LAMP is a tool for diagnosis of Q in humans and animals, especially in rural China, due to its rapid and sensitive detection without equipment or complicated protocol.
Researchers have identified a novel class of regulatory elements called embryonic stem (ES)-specific enhancers (ESs) in hematopoietic cells, which are prone to DNA methylation changes indicative of active chromatin states. These ESs are enriched in a group of enhancers designated hematopoietic ES and are associated with gene expression in cancer. Methylation of ES is linked to transcriptional activity, with methylated ESs being hypermethylated in cancer compared to normal somatic cells and co-localized with silenced genes, while unmethyl ES tend to be hypomethyl in cancer and associated with reactivated genes. Constitutive hematopoietic stem-specific enhancers do not show these trends, suggesting selective reactivation of ES in cancer. Further analysis of hypomethyl ES downstream the VFA gene revealed a regulatory circuit affecting VFA transcript levels across cancers and patients. The study suggests that these enhancer sites provide a framework for reactivation of genes in cancer.
Researchers investigated the effect of subdividing a population on the time it takes to cross a fitness valley or plateau in a rugged landscape. They used a generic model with demes connected by migration, without significant changes in deme size, environmental heterogeneity, or geographic structure. The study focused on the optimal speedup gained by subdivision, driven by the dem that crosses fastest, and found that isolated demes must be in the sequential regime for significant acceleration. Using Markov chain theory, they obtained conditions for optimal speedup: the subdivided population's crossing is as fast as its fastest dem. Stochastic simulations verified predictions. Subdivision accelerated valley crossing in a wide range of parameters beyond the optimal window. The effect of subdivision degree and trade-off between speed magnitude and range was investigated. Results for valleys and plateaus also held for weak beneficial mutations. The study extended to a population connected by migration to one or several islands, showing subdivision with migration accelerates crossing and shedding light on necessary conditions.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypt, the primary vector for arboviruses such as deng, Zika, chikunya, and yellow fever viruses. The study aimed to understand the metabolic environment within the mosquito that enables viral replication and dissemination. Viruses are enveloped and replicate on cellular membranes, manipulating host metabolism to facilitate infection. Interfering with this environment hinders replication in human and mosquito cell models. The study used high-resolution mass spectrometry to analyze metabolic perturbations following deng virus infection in midut tissue, the primary site of infection and replication. Metabolites exhibited a dynamic profile across early, mid, and late infection points. Lipid content increased, specifically glycerophospholids, sphingolids, and acyls, coincided with viral replication kinetics. Elevated glycerol levels suggested resource diversion from energy to synthetic pathways. Acylcarnines were elevated, indicating mitochondrial disruption and energy diversion. A sphingipid pathway hub, dihydroceramide to ceramide ratio, was critical for the virus cycle. This study reconstructed the sphip pathway in A aegypt. Results highlight biochemical points to target multiple pathogens transmitted by this vector.
Researchers have developed a simplified model of the action potential (AP) in rabbit heart cells, known as the "parsimon" model, to elucidate the minimal physiological requirements for physiological phenomena such as alternans and spiral wave breakup. Existing models of AP are complex and varied, leading to dissimilar predictions. The parsimon model combines a Hodgkin-Hux formulation of the sodium current (INa) with a phenomenological model of repolarization similar to the voltage-dependent, time-independent rectifying potassium current (IK). It was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit cells under physiological conditions, including current-voltage (I-V) relationships during the AP upstroke, rapid recovery of excitability during the refractory period, and steady INa in voltage clamp. The model reproduces several emergent phenomena, including alternans rates >250bpm observed in rabbit myocytes, reentrant waves on the surface of the rabbit heart, and spiral wave breakup. Variants of the model elucidated the minimal requirements for alternans and wave breakup, namely kinetics of IN inactivation and non-linearity of IK. The model's simplicity and physiological parameters make it ideal for generating mechanistic insight and a building block for more detailed ionic models of rabbit electrophysiology.
During the sexual cycle of Paramecium, the assembly of the somatic genome involves the precise excision of tens of thousands of short, non-coding germl sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences or IES), each flanked by TA dinucleotides. These genome rearrangements are initiated by developmentally programmed DNA-strand breaks (DSBs), which depend on domesticated transposase PigMac. The DSBS exhibit a characteristic geometry with 4-base 5' overhangs centered on conserved TA and may align and ligate with minimal processing. However, the molecular steps involved in the final assembly of somatic genes remained unknown. This study demonstrates that Ligase IV and Xrccp, components of non-homous endjoining (HE) pathway, are required for repair of I excision sites and circularization of excised IES. Transcription of LIG and XR4 is induced during sexual cycle and Ligp-GFP protein accumulates in developing somatic nucleus during I excision. RNA-mediated silencing of either gene results in persistence of broken ends, apparently against resection. At nucleotide level, removal of 5-terminal nucleotide occurs in L-silenced, while addition to 3 ends of breaks is blocked, together with final step, indicative of coupling NJ polymerase and ligase activities. Data indicate I excision "and-cut" mechanism involving introduction double-str cleavage at both ends each I, followed by DS repair via precise joining.
A study was conducted to investigate the mode of death in patients with heart failure due to Chagas disease, comparing it with non-Ch cardiomyopathy. The REMHE trial was analyzed, grouping patients by etiology (Ch vs non-Ch) and mode of death. The primary endpoint was all-cause and heart failure mortality. 342 patients were analyzed, with 185 (54.1%) dying. Death occurred in 56.4% of Ch patients and 53.7% non-Ch patients. The cumulative allcause and heart mortality was higher in Ch patients compared to non-Ch. No difference in cumulative sudden mortality between groups. In Cox model, Ch etiology (HR 2.76; CI 1.34-5.69; p=0.006), LVED (1.07 CI1.04-1.10; p<0.001), creatinine (0.98 CI0.97-0.99; p=0.006) and amiodarone (3.05 CI1.47-6.34; p=0.003) were associated with heart mortality. LVED (1.04 CI1.01-1.07 p=0.005) and beta-blocker (0.52 CI0.34-0.94 p=0.014) were associated sudden mortality. In severe Ch disease, heart failure is most mode of death.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which plant cells defend against geminiviruses, a type of plant virus. The mechanism involves a protein called NIK, which interacts with a ribosomal protein called rp10. NIK phosphorylates (adds a phosphate group to) rp10, redirecting it to the nucleus where it may modulate viral infection. Overexpression of NIK or a hyperactive NIK mutant promotes accumulation of phosphorylated rp10 in nuclei, while inactive NIK fails to redirect rp10 to nuclei. Mutant rp10 unable to be phosphorylated by NIK is not redirected to nucleus. Loss of rp10 function increases susceptibility to gemivirus infection, similar to NIK null alleles. Geminivirus interferes with NIK-mediated localization of rp10 as countermeasure. NIK defense does not activate RNA silencing or hypersensitive response but inhibits plant growth. Although gemivirus studied overcomes this defense in Arabidopsis, NIK response may restrict other viruses.
Researchers investigated the role of alternative oxidase (AOX) in the pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, which causes disease in humans by adapting to oxidative stress from the host's immune cells. They created a genetically stable strain of P. brasiliensis with a 70% reduction in AOX gene expression and evaluated its interaction with immune cells and a mouse infection model. Interaction with activated macrophages induced higher AOX expression in conidia than yeast cells, while AOX-antisense conidia and yeast had decreased viability. In a mouse infection model, absence of AOX in P. brasensis resulted in reduced fungal burden at 8 and 24 weeks post-challenge and increased survival. In presence of H2, wild-type yeast increased AOX and had higher viability than AOX-antis yeast.
Researchers investigated the neural mechanism of episodic memory in the hippocampus, specifically the role of rate remapping in CA3 place cells. Episodic memory is thought to be supported by attractor dynamics in the hippocampus, where the spatial map of cells encodes contextual information through firing variability. To test whether memories are stored as multimodal attractors in populations of place cells, experiments morphed one context into another while observing responses of CA cell ensembles. Average activity in CA was reported to transition gradually rather than abruptly from one context to the next, suggesting lack of attractors associated with stored representations. However, individual CA cells showed mix of gradual and abrupt transitions at different points along sequence and displayed hysteresis, a signature of attractor dynamics. A neural network model of CA with attractors for position and context was developed to understand these results. For memories in overlapping ensembles within single map, position-dependent attractors made transitions different along sequence. Smooth curves arose from averaging population, heterogeneous responses observed single unit. In contrast, orthogonal memories led abrupt transitions both population and unit as experimentally observed remapping two independent maps. Strong feedback entailed hysteretic effect network diminished overlap memories. Results suggest context-dependent memory supported local attract within spatial CA place cells.
Entamoeba histolytica, a microaerobic enteric protozoan parasite, causes amebic colitis and intestinal abscesses in millions of inhabitants of endemic areas. The troozoites of E. histoly are exposed to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species during infection. E. hist lacks key components of eukaryotic anti-oxid defense systems, such as catalase and glutathione. Alternative anti-oxid defense strategies operate in E. hist. This study investigated metabolic responses of E. hist to H2O2 and paraquat oxidative stress by measuring metabolites by capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight spectrometry. Oxidative stress modulated metabolites in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide amino metabolism. Oxid stress inhibited glycol due to inactivation of key enzymes, redirecting flux to glycer production, chitin bios, and nonoxid pentose phosphate. Glycol repression evidenced by gly intermediates upstream pyruv, reduced nucleos triosphates. Glycer biosynthetic pathway present in E hist demonstrated by glyol 3-phosphate glyol production upon oxidative.
IKAR is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate, and its dynamic expression is necessary for proper hematopoiesis. IKAR collaborates with the Nucleosome Remodeling Deetylase (Nu) complex to promote gene repression and activation. However, it remains unclear how IKAR supports activation while associated with the HD-containing Nu complex. IKAR binds to Positive-Transcription Elong Factor b (PTEb) at promoters. This study demonstrates that Nu and Pb are assembled in a complex that can be recruited by IKAR to specific genes. IKAR expression influences recruitment of the Nu-Pb complex to gene regions and facilitates elongation by transferring Phosphatase 1 (PPα), an IKAR-binding Pb activator, to CDK. An IKAR mutant unable to bind PPα cannot sustain expression and impedes normal differentiation of hematietic progenitors. Knockdown of Nu subunit reveals occupancy of Nu at transcribed regions favors relief of II promoter proximal pausing and promotes elongation.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary history and phylogeography of rabies viruses associated with outbreaks in Trinidad, a Caribbean island experiencing periodic outbreaks in livestock. Molecular characterization of Trinidadian rabies virus (RV) and a Bayesian phyloge approach were used to determine if outbreaks were due to in-situ evolution or importation from the South American mainland. RV sequences were confirmed as bat variant and clustered with Desmodus rotus (vampire bat) related, falling into two temporally defined lineages: Trinidad I and II. Trinidad I (1997-200) sequences, mostly from the northeast, were closely related to RV from Ecuador (2005,7), French Guiana (199), and Venezuela (199,4). Trinidad II comprised southwest sequences, clustering into two groups: IIa (200,200) and IIb (2010), related to Brazil (99,4) and Uruguay (7,8). Phyloge analyses supported separate RV introductions from mainland for each lineage. Estimated introductions and expansions suggest in-situ evolution within Trinidad following each. Data indicate co-circulation of I and II during 200. Findings suggest vampire bat origin of Trinidad RV, further studies should investigate RV spatiemporal dynamics and bat ecology, particularly between mainland and Trinidad.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the regulatory network of genes involved in the development of distinct areas in the mammalian cerebral cortex. The cortex is composed of multiple areas, each with specific functions, and their emergence during development depends on the expression of several genes. Along the anterior-posterior axis, gradients of Fgf, Emx, Pax, Coupfi, and Sp play a crucial role in specifying area identity. However, the interactions between these genes leading to their spatial patterns are not fully understood. A Boolean model of interactions between the five genes was used to determine which interactions and combinations occur in networks that reproduce observed patterns experimentally. The model treated expression as qualitative, reflecting available data. Simulated patterns by all possible networks containing the genes of interest. Only networks were able to reproduce observed patterns. These lacked certain interactions and combinations, including auto-regulation and inductive loops. Higher order interactions also appeared in networks that satisfied criteria for performance. Analysis of probability each interaction indicated likely in the network regulating area. Repressive interactions were more than inductive, but mutually repressive not critical for functioning. The model illuminates principles of the network regulating area development and makes testable predictions.
Researchers used ChIP-Seq technology to study the genome-wide localization of H2A ubiquity in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells, focusing on the role of B1 in this process. B1 is a component of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which regulates gene expression through histone modifications. The study found that B1-dependent H2 ubiquity peaks at the transcription start site (TSS) of annotated genes, particularly those with the H3K27me3 mark and low expression in MEF cells. Additionally, they identified regions of H2 enrichment throughout the genome, including 700 gene promoters. Genes with H2 peaks have lower expression compared to those without peaks. Knocking out B1 increased expression of genes with H2 peaks. H2 enrichment is not limited to H3K27-marked regions, but also found at high CpG promoters, suggesting DNA methylation may be linked to H2 at these sites. This study reveals B1-dependent H2 ubiquity and suggests H2 targeting in differentiated cells may differ from embryonic stem cells.
Pregnancy-induced non-coding RNA (PINC) and retinoblast-associated protein 46 (Rap46) are upregulated in alveolar cells of the mammary gland during pregnancy and persist in alve cells that remain in the regressed following involution. The cells that survive involution are thought to function as alolar progenitors that differentiate into milk-producing cells in subsequent pregnancies. Researchers investigated the role of INC and RAp in maintaining this progenitor population. In post-pubal mouse mammary gland, INC is enriched in luminal and alveolar progenitors. INC levels increase throughout pregnancy and decline in early lactation when alve cells undergo terminal differentiation. INC expression is decreased when mammary epithelial cells are induced to produce milk. Overexpression of INC in HC11 cells blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown of INC enhances differentiation. INC interacts with RAp and other members of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Targets of INC are differentially expressed following modulation of INC levels. Data suggest INC inhibits terminal differentiation of alve cells during pregnancy to prevent milk production until parturition. The PR2 complex including INC and RAp confers epigenetic modifications maintaining mammary epithelial cells committed to alve fate in involuted gland.
Researchers have investigated the role of PML/TRIM19, a protein involved in antiviral defense, in the context of HIV-1 infection. They found that HIV-1 triggers the formation of PML cytoplasmic bodies within 30 minutes post-infection, which last approximately 8 hours with a peak at 2 hours. P localization is blocked by reverse transcription inhibitors and not observed with unrelated viruses, suggesting it is specifically triggered by retroiral reverse transcription. P/TRIM knockdown increases reverse transcription efficiency, indicating it interferes with an early step of retroiral infection. However, P does not directly inhibit retroiral but stabilizes its partner Dax. In the presence of P, cytoplasmic Dax is near HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse transcription. Dax also inhibits exogenous and endogenous retroviruses, identifying it as a broad inhibitor of reverse transcription.
A novel multiple protein structure alignment algorithm, Matt (Multiple Alignments with Translations and Twists), has been developed to address the computationally prohibitive task of finding optimal protein structure alignments. Unlike previous methods, Matt allows for local flexibility between fragments by permitting small translations and rotations to bring aligned fragments closer, even if impossible under rigid transformations. A dynamic programming guides these alignments, restoring geometric consistency in the final output. Matt was tested on the Homstr and SAB benchmark datasets, demonstrating competitive performance with other programs on Homstr and outperforming others on Smark, which features more distant homologous proteins. Matt excels in aligning α-helices and β-strands, crucial for structural library construction in threading approaches to protein folding. A p-value based on core length and root mean squared deviation (RMSD) separates homologous from non-homologous structures in Smark. Matt's success is attributed to modeling conformation states and backbone distortions in distantly related proteins.
During mitotic entry, the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) and inactivation of its counterphosphatase PP2A55 trigger entry into mitosis. Greatwall, a kinase, inactivates PP2A55 via its substrates Ensa and AR19. Both Great and En/AR19 are regulated by phosphorylation, but the regulation of Great activity and phosphatases controlling Great kinase and substrates is poorly understood. Researchers used a combination of mathematical modeling and experiments with phospho-specific antibodies to monitor Great, En/AR and Cdk phosphorylation during mitotic entry and exit. They found that PP55 is required for Great dephosphorylation at the Cdk site Thr194. En/AR deosphorylation is mediated by the RNA polymerase II C-terminal phosphatase F1. Surprisingly, inhibition or depletion of F1 or PP does not block deosphory of the bulk mitotic Cdk substrates during exit. The results suggest a hierarchy of phosphatases coordinating Great, En/AR and Cdk deosphory during exit.
Researchers investigated the development of autologous neutralizing antibodies (Nab) in two individuals with acute/early subtype C HIV-1 infection and found that viral escape occurred despite high titers of these antibodies. To understand the escape pathways, envelope (Env) glycoprotein chimeras and mutants were created from variants identified at multiple time points. In one subject, escape was driven by changes in the V3-V5 region of gp120, while in the other, escape was driven by V2. The V2-dependent pathway was retained over time and allowed the virus to evade two monoclonal antibodies from the same patient via a single N-linked glycosylation site in V2. Sequence analysis showed selective pressure on same Env regions in both subjects, despite different escape domains. These findings suggest a single pathway is not sufficient for escape in subtype C-1 infection and support a model where multiple strategies, including glycan shifts, epitope alteration, and conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.
Researchers sequenced the genomes of 13 Capsella grandiflora individuals to investigate the extent of positive and negative selection across the genome. They found strong positive selection in coding regions, but weak in most non-coding regions, except for 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs. Estimates of selection on noncoding regions across the Brassicaceae family showed strong signals of selection. Reduced neutral diversity around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved noncoding regions indicated recent selective sweeps at these sites. Expression data from leaf tissue showed genes highly expressed experienced stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transforms resting B lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts, establishing latent infections that can lead to malignancies. EB-encoded transcriptional regulator EB2 (EB2) drives the cooperative and combinatorial genome-wide binding of master regulators of B-cell fate, EBF and RBPκ. Contrary to previous studies suggesting static binding of B-cell factors to target promoters, EB2 induces formation of new binding sites for Rκ and EBF, many of which are in close proximity to the cellular and viral genome. Newly formed sites co-occupied by EB2-EBF-Rκ correlate with transcriptional activation of genes crucial for B-lymphoblast function. Conditional expression or repression of EB2 leads to rapid alteration in Rκ and EBF binding. Biochemical and shRNA studies demonstrate cooperative assembly at cooccupied sites. EB2 facilitates combinator interactions inducing new transcription factor occupancy and gene programming necessary for Blymphob growth and survival.
Aedes aegypt, the primary vector of four deng virus (DENV) serotypes, exhibits genetic differences in vector competence for virus transmission across populations in Mexico. Genetic studies indicate that the intersection of the Neovolcan axis (N) with the Gulf of Mexico in the state of Veracruz acts as a barrier to gene flow among Ae.egypt populations north and south of N. Populations north and south of N differ in vector competence (VC) for deng serotype 2 (DENV2), with an average rate of 0.55 for north of N and 0.20 for south of N. Most variation is attributed to midgut infection barriers, with 21.5% of Aeegpt north of N failing to develop midut infections and 30.3% of those infected failing to disseminate, compared to 45.2% failing to develop midut and 62.8% failing to disseminate south of N. Barriers to gene flow in vector populations may impact frequency of epidemiologically relevant traits such as competence.
In a study on the replication cycle of Escherichia coli, researchers investigated the role of the Dna protein in initiation. Dna cycles between active ATP-bound and inactive ADP-bound forms, and its accumulation is thought to control initiation frequency. To test this, cells with a surplus of ATP-Dna were analyzed, but initiation timing remained unchanged even with a 50% increase in concentration. This suggests that while Dna drives initiation, its accumulation does not control timing. Instead, other factors are required to regulate initiation in response to the cell environment. The study also examined the in vivo roles of Dna-dependent Dna inactivation (DA) and Dna-binding protein Dia. Loss of DA affected cell cycle during slow growth, making it sensitive to Dia protein concentration, indicating compromised machinery performs less robustly.
Researchers have developed a novel approach called partial Granger causality to uncover interactions in multivariate data with exogenous and latent variables in the frequency domain. This method is crucial for understanding biological processes at various levels, including subcellular, cellular, and organismal. Oscillatory activity plays a significant role in these processes, involving numerous interacting elements. The approach was tested with toy models and applied to experimental datasets: (1) microarray data of HeLa cell cycle, (2) in vivo-electrode array (MEA) local field potentials (LFP) from inferotemporal cortex of sheep, and (3) in LFP from distributed sites in right hemisphere macaque monkey.
Researchers have developed new methods for inferring local ancestry at each locus in the genome of admixed individuals, such as those of Latino descent, which is crucial for medical and population genetic inferences including disease-risk loci, recombination rates, and genome mapping. Existing methods for local ancestry inference are often designed for use with genotyping arrays and fail to utilize the full spectrum of data from sequencing. Haplotype-based approaches are computationally demanding and time-consuming for large sample sizes. The new methods leverage continent-specific variants (CSVs) to improve existing approaches in sequenced genomes, incorporating admixed genomes with public datasets like 100 Genomes to enhance CSV accuracy. Simulations show the approach achieves accuracy comparable to computationally intensive haplotype-based methods with reduced runtime. The method recovers local ancestries as 100 Gen consensus calls in admixed individuals from  Gen Project. The approach is extended to low-coverage sequencing, demonstrating accurate inference at low coverage. CSV is generalized to sub-continental-specific (sCSV) and sub-ancestry can be determined for short chromosomal segments based on CSV.
Researchers have identified circadian oscillations in the majority of mammalian genes using digital signal processing techniques. Previous studies have described circadian periodicity in the hypothalamus and peripheral tissues, with 10-15% of genes oscillating daily, regulated by an intrinsic molecular clock. However, statistical analyses are limited by small datasets and high noise. A new approach applies digital signal processing to each group of genes oscillating in phase, combined with periodicity tests, revealing circadian oscillation in nearly 100% of expressed genes. This suggests circadian oscillation in gene expression should be evaluated in biological pathways. Changes in gene expression due to mutations or environmental factors, such as photic stimuli or feeding, should consider changes in amplitude and phase of oscillations.
High-resolution mapping of crossover and non-crossover recombination events was achieved through whole-genome resequencing of an avian pedigree. This study aimed to elucidate the recombination landscape and its impact on evolution at a local scale. A three-generation collared flycatcher pedigree was sequenced at high coverage, identifying 325 crossovers at a median resolution of 1.4 kb, with 86% localized to <10 kb intervals. Observed crossover rates matched linkage data, with 52% higher in males (3.56/Mb) than females (2.28/M), increasing towards chromosome ends in males but not females. Crossovers were non-randomly distributed, with distinct hotspots and concentrations in genic regions, highest in promoters and CpG islands. 267 non-crosso events were identified, associated with crossover locations. A significant bias (0.18) favored'strong' (G,C) over 'weak (A,T) alleles at non-c events, indicating GC-biased conversion in avian system.
Researchers have studied the properties of repeat proteins, which are composed of repeated 20-40 amino acid stretches that fold into non-globular, elongated structures stabilized by interactions within and between repeats, but not between distant residues. The inherent symmetries in sequence and 3D structure are reflected in a folding landscape that can be analyzed as a quasi-one dimensional problem. A general description of repeat protein energy landscapes is presented based on an Ising-like treatment of elementary interactions between foldons, whose ensemble is treated as spin variables. The folding properties of a complete domain (stability and cooperativity) can be derived from this description. The one-dimensional model implies simple relations for observables: free energy (ΔG) and cooperativity (m-value), not applicable to globular proteins. Parameters for coarse-grained description in fold spin variables can be extracted from detailed simulations on funnel landscapes. A case study of tetratricopeptide (PR) repeat proteins is presented, relating results to experimentally observed transitions. Single mutations significantly affect folding behavior, suggesting natural proteins are poised at particular ratios of inter/intra-element energetics allowing transitions in physiological conditions, related to biological functions.
Researchers investigated the role of the stress-regulated transcription factor CHOP in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a type of liver cancer associated with viral hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism. They found that CHOP is overexpressed in human and mouse models of HCC, and that mice lacking CH are resistant to chemical-induced HCC and exhibit reduced apoptosis and proliferation. Additionally, CH-null mice are resistant to liver fibrosis, a key risk factor for HCC. Gene expression profiling showed that CH deletion reduces basal inflammatory signaling in the liver. The study suggests that CH contributes to H by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation, implicating it as a common factor in H development in various liver diseases.
A systematic review of clinical studies on the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by Leishmania aethopica in Ethiopia was conducted to identify potentially efficacious medications for clinical trials. Twenty-four records reporting 506 treatment episodes of CL due to Lethopica were identified, with antimonials (201), pentam (150), and cryotherapy (103) being the most commonly used. Twenty case series and two small, poor-quality randomized trials were found, with two non-randomized studies on cryotherapy, antimonials, and pentam. Cryotherapy cure rates were 60-80% and 69-85 with antimonials. Pentam was effective against complicated CL and non-responsive ant cases. However, all studies had methodological limitations. Data on milteine, paromycin, and liposomal amphotin B were scarce, with few on diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis (DCL). Antimonials and paromycin or pentam combinations were potentially effective for DCL, but not evaluated. The evidence for CL treatment due Lethica is limited, with antimonials being the available treatment in Ethiopia. Their efficacy and safety in CL should be defined. Alternative first-line treatments like miline or paromycin should be explored. High-quality trials on Lethica are needed, exploring sequential methods to evaluate options in parallel.
Researchers have successfully reconstituted a biochemical oscillator in vitro using three purified proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which displays salient properties of circadian rhythms, including self-sustained 24-hour periodicity and temperature compensation. The biochemical basis of this oscillator was analyzed by quantifying time-dependent interactions among the proteins using electron microscopy and native gel electrophoresis to elucidate the timing of complex formation among the proteins. Data were used to derive a dynamic model that accurately reproduces rhythms of Kai complexes and KaiC phosphorylation, consistent with biophysical observations of individual protein interactions. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) confirmed monomer exchange among Kai hexamers. The model suggests monomer exchange maintains synchrony among hexamers, sustaining high-amplitude oscillation. Perturbation analysis of the oscillator using temperature pulses reset the phase of Kai, testing resetting characteristics of this circadian oscillator.
Researchers investigated the relationship between trial-to-trial variability in brain activity and behavioral performance in a visual detection task using electroencephalography (EEG). Contrary to previous studies that assumed a monotonic relationship, they found an inverted-U shaped relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral output. Specifically, when the fluctuation in broadband EEG activity was closer to the across-trial mean, hit rate was higher and reaction times faster. This relationship was observed not only in post-stimulus-evoked brain activity but also in pre-stimulus spontaneous activity, indicating anticipatory brain dynamics. The findings suggest the presence of stochastic noise in the brain and support attractor network theories, which propose that the brain settles into a confined state under performance and proximity to the target is associated with better performance.
Sexual reproduction is a key evolutionary innovation in eukaryotes, involving interaction between compatible partners that undergo cell fusion and meiosis. In fungi, mating compatibility is governed by the mating (MAT) loci. Basidiomycetes have a hypothesized ancestral state of tetraploidy, with two unlinked MAT loci containing homeodomain factor (HD) and pherone and pherone receptor (P) genes. Alleles at both loci must differ for mating completion. However, some basidiomyc have bipolar systems, arising from linkage of HD and P loci. In Tremellales, bipolarity is found in pathogenic Cryptoccus species. This study analyzed MAT loci from 24 Trichporales species, sister to Tremales. All species have fused MAT loci with a single HD gene per type, similar to pathogenic Cryptoccus. HD and P allele combinations differ between Trichporales and pathogenic Cryptoccus. Tetraplo species in Tremales suggest fusion occurred independently in Trichporales and pathogenic Cryptoccus, supporting convergent evolution towards fused regions. Unlike other basidiyc lineages, MAT loc content and order are conserved in Trichporales, with no recombination suppression to adjacent regions.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to predict the abundance of non-domiciliated vectors of Chagas disease in the Yucán Peninsula, Mexico. The model was based on demographic parameters estimated from two years of field data and accurately predicted field data in the absence and presence of insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying was found effective when 50 mg/m2 were applied within a two-month period matching the immigration season, resulting in an 80% reduction in abundance. Larger doses or more frequent interventions did not improve this reduction, and decreased with different timing or lower frequencies. Insect screens reduced abundance proportionally to the vector immigration rate, offering an effective and sustainable alternative for control.
Feather patterning in avian skin is a complex process involving coordinated interactions between fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling, mesenchymal cell movement, and a reaction-diffusionaxis system. During development, feathers first appear along the dorsal midline in rows, with new buds added sequentially in a wave-like pattern. This patterning relies on a mechanochemical integration through a positive feedback loop centered on FGF20, which induces cell aggregation, compressing the epidermis to intensify F20 expression. The travelling wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding ectodysplasin (E) expression, initiating F20 expression, which spreads across a mesenchymal density gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold for mesenchym cells to form a bud. Feather primordia arrangement is lost in flightless emu and ostrich, though via different developmental routes. Ostrich retains general bird arrangement but lays primord without wave, akin to mammalian hair follicle formation. Embryonic em lacks cells to enact formation, causing failure, instead entire skin gains primord through later process. Reaction-diffaxis system with mechanical processes generates feather array in flight birds. Key EDAR pathway in vertebrate patterning activates quasi-1 dimensional, highly ordered formation.
A systematic review was conducted to investigate the presence and persistence of filoviruses, including Ebola and Marburg virus, in the body fluids of infected individuals and survivors. A total of 683 articles were screened, with 33 eligible studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The studies examined the presence of filiruses in various body fluids, including blood, saliva, urine, stool, and semen, among others, in individuals with laboratory-confirmed or clinically diagnosed filirus infections. The review found that most body types of fluids had insufficient data to draw strong conclusions, with variable prevalence of positivity. Fluids taken more than 16 days after onset were usually negative. RT-PCR tests for filirus RNA yielded positive results 4 times more often than tissue culture. Filirus was detected in most fluid types, but not every sample from confirmed patient. Apart from semen, non-blood RT-PCR positive samples likely culture negative and possibly low risk. Contact with blood and blood-stained fluids major transmission risk due to high viral loads in blood.
Researchers have developed a fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model to describe neuronal spike timing dynamics that exhibit power-law behavior due to correlated membrane conductance processes. These processes cannot be characterized by a single time constant, resulting in a non-Markovian process that can be modeled with a fractional derivative. A fractional derivative is a non-local process where the value of the variable is determined by integrating a weighted temporal voltage trace, or memory. The model incorporates a fractional derivative with an exponent that can vary from 0 to 1, with 1 representing a normal derivative. As the exponent decreases, the weights of the trace increase, and the value is increasingly correlated with the past voltage trajectory. The model reproduces upward and downward adaptations found in cortical pyramidal and tectal neurons in vitro. It also produces spikes with longer latency and inter-spike variability and power-law distribution. The model's spiking activity deviates from Markov and reflects accumulated membrane dynamics affecting response to external stimulation.
Researchers have identified six superoxide dismutase (SOD) isoforms in the fungus Paracoccoides genome, which play a crucial role in defending against reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by host immune cells. To counteract ROS, Paroccoides expresses various antioxidant enzymes, including SODs. This study analyzed the expression of SOD isoforms in different Paroccoid phylogenetic lineages (S1, 2, 3, and Pb01) using quantitative RT-PCR. Results showed increased expression of PbS1 and Pb3 during transition, exposure to oxidative agents and phagocytic cells, suggesting these proteins aid in combating superoxide radicals during host-pathogen interaction. Pb1 and Pb3 knockdown strains showed involvement in response to host immune cells, particularly oxidative stress, in a mouse infection model. Protein analysis and knockdown strains suggest Pb3 linked to extracellular activity while Pb1 to intracellular requirements. Data indicate P. brasensis responds to endogenously generated radicals and counteracts immune burst by inducing S isoforms.
Intrinsically Disordered Proteins Display No Preference for Chaper Binding In Vivo

Researchers investigated the relationship between intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and chaper binding in cells. IDPs are sensitive to proteolysis in vitro but show no enhanced degradation in vivo, leading to the hypothesis that they may associate with chaper for protection against proteases. Analysis of high-throughput interaction data revealed a negative correlation between predicted disorder by the IUP algorithm and chaper binding in E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metaz species. This contrasts with the positive correlation between disorder and partner binding in the interactome. Normalizing for overall interaction involvement, the difference between chaper-binding and non-binding proteins is more pronounced. Chaper binding is primarily required for globular protein folding, as evidenced by preference for chones with at least one Pfam domain. ID that bind chaper tend to bind other proteins, suggesting assembly promotion rather than folding assistance as the primary consequence of chaper binding.
In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, the Spalt (sal) and Spalt-related (salr) genes encode zinc-finger transcription factors regulated by the Decapentaplegic (Dpp) signaling pathway in the wing imaginal disc. These genes are crucial for cell survival and proliferation in the central region of the disc and vein patterning in the lateral regions. To understand the genetic control of wing growth and patterning by the Dpp pathway, identifying direct Salm and Salr target genes and analyzing their functions is essential. A microarray experiments comparing sal/sr knockdown wing discs to control discs and in situ hybridization revealed a complex transcription landscape regulated by Sp proteins in the disc. Candidate Salm/Sr targets include genes with expression turned off and genes positively regulated by Salmr. Loss-of-function analysis indicates a fraction of these genes are required for wing patterning and growth. This study opens a new avenue to reconstruct the genetic structure of the wing, linking Dpp activity to epithelial tissue development.
Researchers have identified two protein phosphatases, GSP-1 and GSP-2, and their regulators SZY-2 and SDS-22, as key regulators of ZYG-1 protein levels in Caenorhabditis elegans. ZYG-1 is a homolog of the human Plk4 protein, which is required for centri duplication. The study found that downregulation of PP1 activity, either through direct inhibition or mutation of SZY-2 or SDS-22, rescues the loss of centri duplication associated with a ZYG- hypomorphic allele. This is achieved through an increase in ZYG-1 levels, indicating PP regulates Z-1 through post-translational mechanism. Moderate inhibition of PP activity restores centri duplication in Z- mutant, but strong inhibition in wild-type leads to centri amplification via production of more than one daughter centri.
Visceral leishmanis in an environmentally protected area in southeastern Brazil: Epidemiological and laboratory cross-sectional investigation of phbotine fauna, wild and canine hosts

A study was conducted in the municipality of Campinas, southeastern Brazil, where visceral leishmanias (VL) was first reported in 2009 in a dog living in an upscale condominium within an environmentally protected area (EPA). Since then, transmission remained restricted to dogs in two contiguous condominiums within the EPA. A cross-sectional study investigated Leishmania spp. infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals, and sand flies using molecular and serological techniques. Canine seroprevalences were 1.5% and 1.2% in 2013 and 2015, respectively. Six species, confirmed or suspected vectors or transmitters of Leish, were identified. Two Lutzia longipalis, the main L. (L) infant vector in Brazil, were captured in EPA. Natural infection L. (L) infant was recorded in Expillidae firm and Pomy monticola. Infection L. (L) infant and Leish subgenia was detected in white-eared opossum (Didel albivent), a known VL reservoir. Geographical coordinates of infected animals were plotted on EPA map, demonstrating proximity between animals, human residences, including dogs positive VL, and forest areas. The EPA has an active VL focus. The risk of establishing and maintaining disease foci in similar scenarios, e.g. wild areas undergoing modifications, is evident. Different epidemiological profiles of VL must be included in prevention and control measures considering each area's particularities.
Epstein-Barr Virus-Encoded MicroRNA MiR-B9 Promotes Tumor Metastasis by Targeting E-cadher in Nasopharynge Carcinoma

Epstein-B virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus associated with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly metastatic tumor prevalent in Asia. While viral proteins promote NPC migration and invasiveness, not all tissues express these oncoproteins, suggesting alternative mechanisms contribute to tumor behavior. Our previous study revealed high EB miR-B9 expression in EB-positive NPC tissues. This study investigated mi-B9's effect in EB-negative and EB-positive NPC cells using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Mi-B9 promoted migration and invas in cultured cells, with enhanced metastatic ability in vivo. Computational analysis revealed mi-B targets Eadher, a membrane protein crucial for cell junctions and epithelial phenotype. Biochemical and functional assays confirmed mi-B specifically inhibits Ead to induce mesenchymal phenotype and promote NPC migration. These results indicate mi-B is promastatic viral RNA, suggesting high mi-B levels in EB-positive NPC contribute to tumor aggressiveness.
Gash is a command-line tool designed for visualizing splicing events across multiple samples. It takes a specified genomic region as input and generates sash plots for individual RNA-seq experiments as well as aggregated plots for groups of experiments, a feature unique to this software. Unlike existing programs generating sash plots, it uses bioinformatics file formats, is annotation-independent, and visualizes splicing events for large genomic regions by scaling down genomic segments between splice sites. Gash is available at https://github.com/gigabriel/gash. Implemented in Python, it generates R code for plotting.
Researchers have developed a probabilistic model of cis-regulatory module (CRM) evolution that accounts for different modes of evolution of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) and background sequences. This model addresses limitations of existing sequence evolution models, which do not explicitly consider CRM properties. A novel aspect of the work is a probabilistic model of TFBS gains and losses, a recognized as part of regulatory evolution. A computational framework uses this model to solve CRM alignment and prediction problems. The method is similar to statistical alignment methods but uses conserved sites to improve alignment. It deals with uncertainties of binding annotations and sequence in a probabilistic framework. Simulated and real data demonstrate the program's ability to improve alignment and CRM prediction over state-of-the-art methods. Alignments produced by the program were used to study genome-wide binding of transcription factors in Drosophila blastoderm. Results show that factor-bound sequences are under evolutionary constraints even if neighboring genes are not expressed in blasterm and distal sites are more conserved than proximal.
Researchers have investigated the functions of the Drosophila piRNA pathway in genome maintenance and telomere protection. The piRNA pathway silences transposons in the germline, but its role during development is unclear. Mutations in Drosoph piRNA genes arm, aub, ago3, and rhi lead to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during cleavage embryonic divisions. aub and arm show defects in telomeresolution during meiosis and cleavage divisions, while lig-IV mutations disrupt nonhomologous end joining, suppressing fusions. By contrast, lig-IV enhance chromosome fragmentation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies show aub and arm disrupt telom binding of HO, a component of telomere complex, and reduce expression of 19-22ntelom-specific piRN. Mutations rhi and ago do not block HO binding or production of piRN. These findings reveal separable functions for Dophila pi pathway. a, arm, a, r, and ago silence transons and maintain chromosome integrity cleavage embryonic divisions. a and arm have additional function in assembly telomere complex.
In November 2007, a hemorrhagic fever (HF) outbreak occurred in Bundibyo District, Western Uganda, resulting in 7 reported cases. Laboratory investigation of the initial 29 suspect blood specimens using classic methods (antigen capture, IgM and IgG ELISA) and a newly developed random-primed pyrosequencing approach identified the outbreak to be associated with a newly discovered Ebola virus, Bundibyoebolavirus. This virus is distantly related to CôteIvoebolavirus found in western Africa. The discovery of this new species has significant implications for the design of future diagnostic assays to monitor HF in humans and animals, as well as ongoing efforts to develop antivirals and vaccines.
Researchers investigated the heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression by analyzing a cohort of 648 patients with an average follow-up time of 4.78 years. The Global Deteration Scale (GDS) and Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) procedures characterize seven stages of AD, from normal to severe dementia, with published mean durations for each stage. However, the variance was unknown. Statistical analysis reconstructed DS/FAST stage durations, revealing standard deviations comparable to mean values for stages 4-6, indicating large variations in AD progression among patients. This heterogeneity suggests the existence of subgroups with distinct decline patterns.
A study investigated the role of neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity in a hippocampal memory model with grid-cell input. The model was designed to encode and decode memory patterns with changing statistics, showing that neurogenesis was more effective than turnover and plasticity in adapting to changes while preserving earlier representations. The model was extended to include realistic spatial input from entorhinal cortex grid cells, comparing performance across environments using three strategies: synaptic plasticity, turnover, and neurogenesis. Neurogenesis outperformed the others with spatial patterns. A biologically plausible rule incorporating cell death and plasticity improved performance. This rule was tailored for short or long-term memory. Adult neurogenesis profiles were examined under different rearing conditions, with distinct features for experimental testing. Place cells emerged and refined in the model due to dentate gyrus sparsification.
African trypanosomes, the parasites responsible for sleeping sickness, express three identical glutathione peroxidase (Px) enzymes that detoxify lipid hydroperoxides. Research has shown that Trypanosoma brucei lacking mitochondrial PxIII exhibit a weak proliferation defect, while those lacking cytosolic PxI and PxII undergo rapid lipid peroxidation and lysis. Supplementing the medium with α-tocopherol derivative Trolox rescues the phenotype. This study investigates the mechanism of rapid cell death and finds that the lysosome is the primary site of injury. Feeding PxII knockout parasites with Alexa-conjugated dextran or LysoTracker in Tro yields discrete lysosomal staining, which spreads upon Tro withdrawal. T. brucei acquires iron by endocytosis of transferrin. Supplementing with iron or transferrin induces, while iron chel deferox and apo-transferrin attenuates lysis of PxII cells. Immunofluorescence with Mito and lysosomal marker p67 reveals lysosomal disintegration precedes mitochondrial damage. In vivo experiments confirm negligible mitochondrial peroxidase role: PxIII knockout displays slightly delayed disease development. Data demonstrate that in African trypanosomes, the lysosome, not mitochondrion, is primary site of damage and cytos Px protect lys from iron-induced peroxidation. This is linked to high endytic and iron acquisition of infective T. bruce. Cytosolic PxII knockout in procyclic form results in viable cells in Tro-free medium.
Researchers have inactivated the Pmel gene in mice to study its role in melanosome formation and pigmentation. Pmel is an amyloid protein expressed in pigment cells, forming intracellular fibrils in early melanosomes, where eumins deposit later. It is conserved across vertebrates and variants in several species are linked to reduced eum in epidermal tissues. However, it was unclear if variants were gain-of-function or loss-of-function, and no complete loss-of-function had been reported in mammals. The P−/− mice are viable, fertile, and display no developmental defects. Melanosomes in P− melanocytes are spherical, unlike the elongated shape in wild-type. This was observed in skin-derived melanocytes, retinal pigment epithelium, and uveal melanocytes. P inactivation had a mild effect on coat color in four genetic backgrounds, most notable in brown/Tp mice. This is similar to the silver mutation, suggesting other vertebrate alleles with striking effects are dominant. Despite mild pigmentation, P led to reduced eum in hair, indicating PM's role in efficient epidermal pigmentation.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of environmental methods for deng vector control was conducted to evaluate their effectiveness in preventing deng infections. Nineteen studies were included, with sixteen contributing to the meta-analysis. The methods evaluated were: (1) container covers with and without insecticides, (2) waste management and clean-up campaigns, and (3) elimination of breeding sites by rendering mosquito breeding sites unusable or eliminating them. Quality was highest for container with insecticides, followed by waste without direct collection and elimination of places. Meta-analysis showed a weak effect on larval populations, with no differences between individual methods. Container without insecticides (BI: -7.9, DOE-5) and waste with collection (BI: -8.83, DOE-6.2) achieved strongest BI reductions, while pupal results were opposite, with covers (P: -0.83, 0.09) and elimination (P: -0.95, -0.83) showing strongest. Each method showed effectiveness in reducing Aedes larval and pupal densities. However, high-quality studies are needed to strengthen evidence.
Researchers have identified small molecules that inhibit protein synthesis by stalling the ribosome, a strategy for developing therapeutic compounds. Compounds that inhibit PCSK9, a regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have been shown to reduce LDL in preclinical models, affecting only a few off-target proteins. A genome-wide CRISPR screen was used to identify proteins and pathways modulating cell growth in presence of PCS9 translational inhibitor PF-06303 (PF3). The most potent genetic modifiers of fitness in PF3 were ubiquitin binding protein ASC2 and helicase3, which bind to ribosome and protect cells from PF3 toxicity. Surprisingly, quality control proteins Pelota and H1 sensitize cells to PF3 treatment. Genetic experiments showed ASC3 interacts with ASC2 and functions downstream of H1. These findings reveal connections between ribosome control pathways and insights into selectivity of compounds stalling translation, aiding development of next-generation compounds treating disease.
Researchers have discovered that the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) promotes the destruction of cellular messenger RNA (mRNA) through a unique mechanism involving aberrant polyadenylation. This process is mediated by the viral SO protein, which does not have intrinsic ribonuclease activity. The study found that SO-expressing cells exhibit extended poly (A) polymerase-generated poly(A) tails and polyaden-linked mRNA turnover, indicating that SO-induced polyadenylation correlates with RNA turnover. Inhibition of poly(A) tail formation blocks SO activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins are crucial for SO function, with the latter undergoing striking nuclear localization by SO. SO-induced mRNA turnover represents a novel host shutoff mechanism and a model to study poly(A)-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells.
Researchers investigated the role of type III interferon (IFλ) in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They found that these bacteria induce IFλ production in the lung, which is mediated by the IL-28 receptor. Mice lacking this receptor showed increased bacterial clearance and reduced lung pathology compared to controls. Improved clearance correlated with reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines and increased anti-inflammatory cytokines in the airway. In human epithelial cells, IFλ inhibited miR-21, leading to upregulation of PDC4, a protein promoting inflammatory signaling. In vivo, following infection, mi-21 was reduced and PDC increased in wild-type mice compared to IL-28 null mice. Infection of PDC null mice with USA resulted in improved clearance, reduced pathology, and reduced cytokine production. The study suggests IFλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting mi-21 regulation of PDC4 during bacterial pneumonia.
Researchers conducted a retrospective study on 781 cases of advanced-stage human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) admitted to the National Center for African Trypanosomias in the Democratic Republic of Congo between 1989 and 2012. The study examined mortality trends and risk factors, with death as the outcome variable. Predictors included age, gender, duration of disease, location of trypanosomes in body fluids, cyach, protach, clinical status, and treatment regimen. Results showed mortality rates of 17.2% in the standard melop schedule, 12.1 in the short melop schedule, 5.4 in first-line eflithine, 9.1 in NECT regimen, and 36 in severely affected patients given eith due to clinical status. After adjusting for treatment, death odds ratios were 10.40 for clinical dysfunction on admission, 2.14 for protach, 1.99 for parasites in CSF, and 1.7 for cyach. Multivariate analysis retained clinical status on admission and protach as predictors of death.
Researchers have developed a computer vision pipeline to study the effects of isolation on social dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism for studying small-scale, transient social behavior. The existing methods for analyzing large groups of flies were limited by the lack of reliable tools, so a new imaging arena and tracking algorithm were created to follow multiple flies simultaneously. An automatic classification and graph-based network analysis was designed to quantify changes in social networks in response to isolation. Results showed that isolation significantly enhanced individual and local network parameters, depicting near-neighbor relationships. Genome-wide molecular correlates of behavioral changes were explored, revealing gene expression alterations on day one, mostly in metabolic genes. Metabolic changes were verified by increased lipid content in isolated flies. A reliable tracking pipeline for large groups was developed to unravel behavioral, molecular, and physiological impact of isolation on social dynamics in Drosila.
A clinical pilot study was conducted in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of a smartphone adaptation of the World Health Organization's (WHO) diarrheal disease management guidelines, including a modality for age-based weight estimation, in a resource-limited setting. The study took place in a district and sub-district hospital during the 2015 cholera season, where both lacked scales for weight estimation. The study consisted of a 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention period with 10-day post-discharge follow-up. Standard care was maintained with the exception of clinicians using the tool during intervention. Inclusion criteria were patients 2 months and older with uncomplicated diarral disease. The outcome was adherence to guidelines for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and zinc. A total 841 patients were enrolled (325 pre-intervention, 516 intervention). During intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for IV fluids decreased at district and subistrict hospitals (p < 0.001) with risk ratios (RRs) 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. However, when fluids were prescribed, volume adhered to recommendations. Proportion for recommended azithromycin increased (p < 0.001; district p=0.035 subistrict) with RR 6.9 district and 1.6 subistrict, while other antibiotics decreased; zinc increased. Limitations included absence of concurrent group and independent dehydration assessment pre-intervention. Despite limitations, opportunities to improve care, including assessment, estimation, and selection. Findings demonstrate smartphone tool improve adherence.
A mechanistic model of within-host parasite dynamics was developed using experimental data from Daphnia magna and a microsporidian parasite. The model integrated host and parasite traits such as survival and virulence, which have distinct temperature dependencies, into disease dynamics. Parameters were specified by metabolic theory of ecology, including host mortality, parasite growth, virulence, and abundance. The model predicted host survival, parasite growth, and infection cost across temperatures with fewer parameters than discrete models.
Researchers have investigated the role of inhibitory interneurons in shaping the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs) in the brain. Specifically, they focused on the interplay between three types of GABAergic interneurons: parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), and vaso intestinal (VIP) peptide-expressing interneurons. The study proposes a network motif where PV and SOM interneurons control somatic and dendritic inhibition of PCs, while mutual inhibition between VIP and SOM interne converts VIP inputs into changes in somato-dendritic inhibition of PCs. A computational model was used to demonstrate the neuronal and synaptic properties supporting this hypothesis. The SOM-VIP motif allows the circuit to switch between two processing modes, either integrating top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of PCs or cancelling them.
Microbiome-wide association studies investigate the relationship between microbial communities and host phenotypes, including disease. These studies compare microbial abundances between groups to identify specific microbes linked to phenotypes. However, abundance differences reflect not only direct associations, but also indirect effects due to microbial interactions. Researchers found that interactions can generate numerous spurious associations providing no mechanistic insight. A method was developed using statistical techniques from physics to remove indirect associations, applied to the largest pediatric inflammatory bowel disease dataset. The method corrected inflated p-values in standard tests, revealing only a subset directly linked to disease. Direct associations showed higher accuracy in separating cases from controls, pointing to immunomodulation, butyrate production and brain-gut axis as factors in inflammatory disease.
Researchers compared the effects of Wolbachia infection on the replication and transmission of two flaviviruses, Dengue (DENV) and West Nile (WNV) viruses, in Aedes aegypt mosquitoes using two Wolbach infection models: stably infected and transiently infected. Studies have shown that the interaction between Wolbach and pathogen is influenced by host-Wolbach interaction and infection model, with some evidence suggesting Wolbach can enhance pathogen infection under specific conditions. This study found Wolbach had similar blocking effects in both stable and transient infection models, but with lower magnitude in transiently infected mosquitoes. No enhancement of either DENV or WNV Kun strain infection was observed in Wolbach infected Ae aegypt, suggesting Wolbach as a safe means to restrict virus transmission.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, cilia are microtubule-based organelles that mediate signal transduction and are organized into structurally and functionally distinct compartments: the basal body, transition zone (TZ), and cilia shaft. The C elegans cilia shafts of amphid and phasm sensory cilia are subdivided into two regions by different microtub ultrastructure: a proximal doublet region adjacent to the TZ and distal singlet region. The mechanisms that establish and maintain the region adjacent to the TZ, termed "Invers compartment" (Inv), are unknown in vertebrates and C elegans. This study explored the biogenesis, structure, and composition of the Cans ciliary double region and Inv. The Inv is conserved and distinct from the double region. The genes n-2 (Cans Invers homolog) and double region ar-13, lp-11, and unc-119 are redundantly required for cili. The Inv and double region can be sorted into two modules-n-2p-11 and ar-13-119, which are antagonized by hd-6 deacetyl. The genes modulate the sizes of N-2 Inv and A-13 region. Glutlation, a tub-transl modification, is not required for ciliary of Inv and region components; rather, is modulated by-2, -13, and-119. The ciliary and localization of N-, A-, and UNC does not require TZ, region and Inv-associated genes-2 require its calcium EF domain for targeting to Inv. The Cans Inv is distinct from double region, and components interact to regulate cili via placement, microub ultra, and protein.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the polarity protein Scribble in regulating myelination and remyelination in the central nervous system. Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendrocy development and is upregulated in mature oligodrocytes, localizing to both developing and mature myelin sheaths. In cultured oligodrocytes, Scribble knockdown disrupts morphology and myelination initiation. Conditional Scribble elimination in myelinating glia of transgenic mice impairs myelination in CNS, both during development and following demyelination, and myelin sheath extension is disrupted at later stages. Scribble regulates myelin thickness by suppressing the extracellular signal-related kinase (ER)/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway and localizes to non-compact myelin flanking the node of Ranvier, where it is required for paranodal axo-glial adhesion.
Listeriolysin, a novel peptide associated with a subset of Listeria monocytogen, has been identified as a bacteriocin-like hemolysin and cytotoxic virulence factor. It plays a key role in the virulence of Group A Streptococcus (GAS), the causative agent of pharyngitis, impet, necrotizing fascitis and streptoccal shock. However, evidence suggests that a number of Gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, including Lister monocytogen, Clostridium botulin and Staphlococcus aureus, produce related peptides. Notably, the L monocogen cluster is found exclusively among subset lineage I strains, responsible for majority of listeriosis outbreaks. Expression of these genes results in production of hemolytic and cytotoxic factor, Listerin, contributing to virulence of pathogen assessed by murine and human polymorphonuclear neutrophil studies. This discovery establishes existence of extended family of S-like virulence peptides (MVPs), revealing genetic basis for enhanced virulence of proportion I monocogen.
Researchers investigated the expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) in mycetoma granuloma, a persistent granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria. The disease is characterized by the formation of macroscopic structures called "grains" surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. The study aimed to determine if IL-17 and MMP-9 expression correlates with disease severity and causative agent. 

A total of 100 myetoma biopsies were obtained from the Myet Research Centre, Sudan. IL-17 and MMP-9 expression were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. IL-17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, while MMP-9 was mainly in Zones II and III. MMP-9 was higher in Actinadura pelletii and Streptomyces somali biies compared to Madura myetatis biies. MMP-9 levels were directly proportional to IL-17 (p=0.001). MMP-9 was significantly associated with disease duration (p<0.001). There was no correlation between IL-17 and patient characteristics.
Molecular recognition by intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) often involves specific contacts and target-induced order transitions. However, some IDPs remain disordered in the bound state, a phenomenon known as "fuzziness," characterized by polyvalency, sequence insensitivity, and a dynamic ensemble of disordered-state conformations. The transcription activation domain of the Ewing Sarcoma oncoprotein (E) is an ID that exhibits fuzziness, with multiple E aromatic side chains driving recognition. Given the role of cation-π interactions at protein-protein interfaces, it was hypothesized that E-target binding involves polyc-π contacts between disordered E and basic residues on the target. Here, the pol-π hypothesis was evaluated via functional and theoretical interrogation of E variants. A range of E sequence variations, including aromatic number, density, and charge perturbations supported the model. Trends were captured by a coarse-grained E model and an analytical based on between E aromatics and cations of a generic target. E-target binding is driven by a balance between E conformation and favorable c- contacts. This mode offers a framework for promiscuous recognition by polyval ID.
Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, possesses two putative ATP-dependent Lon homologs, Lon-1 and Lon-2. Unlike other bacteria, Boria spirochetes code for two Lon homologs. Previous studies showed that B. burgorfer Lon-1 is upregulated by exposure to blood in vitro, while Lon-2 is not. This study aimed to clarify the functional roles of these proteases in B. burgorfer. Phylogenetic analysis revealed Lon-1 and Lon-2 cluster separately due to differences in NH2-terminal binding domains. Recombinant Lon-1 exhibited ATP-dependent chaperone-protease activity in vitro but did not complement E. coli Lon mutant, while Lon-2 corrected characteristic Lon-mut phenotypes. B. burgfer Lon-1 and Lon-2 have distinct functions. Lon-2 functions in a manner consistent with canonical Lon, engaged in cellular homeostasis. Lon-1, induced by blood, may be important in host adaptation from arthropod to warm-blood host.
Researchers investigated the role of antibody-dependent phagocytosis (ADP) in preventing HIV-1 infection, a process mediated by Fc gamma receptor (FR)-mediated antibody functions. They measured the ability of HIV-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to mediate the internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-1-decorated cells by phagocytes. The study used a green-fluorescent protein-expressing molecular of HIV-1JR, an R5 clinical isolate, in combination with polyclonal HIV or mAbs to capture and neutralize HIV. TH-1 and U937 cells, as well as freshly isolated monocytes from healthy individuals, were used as phagytic effector cells, and uptake of virions was measured by cytometry. Surprisingly, minimal AD of virions was observed with any antibodies. However, coating virions with gp41 or gp-derived peptides gp41, but not gp120-specific m efficiently mediated phagocytosis. A minimum of hundred gp41 molecules were needed for successful phagytosis, similar to the number of envelope spikes on viruses phagosed, e.g. influenza virus. Fluorescence spectroscopy showed a clear association between virus aggregation and AD. In contrast, vir-decor cells were targets for AD orgocytosis in presence HIV-antibodies. Findings indicate AD of vir may not play role in preventing infection due paucity trimers and inability vir-bound to cross FRs phocytes. However, AD orocyt could play clearing HIV-infected cells verge infection.
Hookworm infection is a widespread in many countries worldwide, yet its global economic and health impact is not well understood. A computational model was developed to estimate the economic and health burden of hookworm infection in every country, region, and globally, in 2016 from a societal perspective. Globally, hook infection resulted in 2,126,280 Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) using 2009 disability estimates and 4,087,803 DALYs using 201 disability estimates (excluding cognitive impairment). The inclusion of cognitive impairment did not significantly increase DALs worldwide. Productivity losses varied with probability and anemia calculation method, ranging from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion annually using gross national income per capita as proxy wages and from $2.5 to $43.9 billion using minimum wage as proxy wages. Hookworm is classified as a neglected disease, yet its economic burden exceeded estimates of diseases receiving more attention, such as rotavirus. Countries transitioning to higher income, like Brazil and China, still face significant hook burden.
Researchers investigated the effects of hypoxia on the developing vertebrate central nervous system, building on previous findings in in invertebrate Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that hypox disrupts axon pathfinding in forebrain neurons of zebraf (Danio rerio), leading to commissural axons failing to cross the midline. This was caused by activation of the hypox-inducible transcription factor (HIF) pathway, which was mimicked by chemical inducers of HIF or expression of constitutively active Hα. Blocking transcriptional activation of Hα prevented the defects. EphrinB2 was identified as a target of the H pathway, with knockdown of EphB rescuing the errors and EphA receptor expressed in a pattern complementary to misrouting axons. Constitutively active EphB targeted to neurons showed Eph mediating errors via reverse-signaling. Magnesium sulfate, used to improve neurodevelopment in preterms, protected against errors by upregulating EphB.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate pulmonary abnormalities in mice infected with paracoccidiomycosis (PCM), a fungal disease of pulmonary origin, using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and histopathological findings. Fifty male BALB mice were inoculated with Paracococidioides brasiliensis conidia (n=50) or PBS (n=50). HRCT scans were performed every four weeks to determine pulmonary lesions, quantify lung density, and reconstruct lung structure. Lungs were also analyzed by histology and histometry. Three patterns of lesions were observed: nodular-diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-tum. Lesions were mainly located around the hilus and affected the left lung more frequently. At four weeks post-challenge, 80% of infected mice had peri-bronial consolidations with increased lung density compared to controls (-263±25 vs -422HU, p<0.001). Consolidation progressed to middle regions at 8 and 12 weeks. Histology revealed consolidation as confl granulomatous reaction, nodules as compact granomas. At 16 weeks, confl granomas formed pseudooral masses obstructing bronchi. Discrete fibrosis was visible around granomas, evident by histology. This study demonstrated HRCT's utility in evaluating and quantifying pulmonary damage in PCM. The experimental design reduced animal sacrifice and allowed monitoring treatment efficacy through a more rational approach to lung disease study.
A proof-of-concept study investigated the use of an interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-γ) as a marker for latent Leishmania donovani (L. donani) infection in visceral leishmaniasis (VL) endemic areas. The study aimed to evaluate a modified commercial kit, QuFERON, with five Leishmania-specific antigens: H2, H2-PS2, H-Le12, crude antigen (CSA), and soluble Leish antigen (SL) from L. donani to detect cell-mediated immune response in VL. Venous blood samples from 13 active VL patients, 15 cured patients, 11 non-endemic controls, and 19 endemic controls were analyzed. The assay based on SL had a sensitivity of 80% (95 CI 54.81-92.95) and specificity of 100 (74.12-100). Results suggest a whole-blood SL-based QuFER assay can measure cell-mediated response in L. donani infection. Positive IF-γ response to Leish antigen in VL patients contradicts conventional non-proliferative antigen response of peripheral mononuclear cells.
Enteropathogenic Yersiniae, such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, can cause persistent gastrointestinal infections that may lead to relapsing enteritis and autoimmune disorders. To establish a persistent infection, the bacteria must navigate through the intestinal epithelium and colonize gut-associated lymphatic tissues, evading host immune responses. The mechanism by which they achieve this is not well understood. Research has shown that the CNFY toxin enhances the translocation of anti-phagocytic effectors, inducing inflammatory responses, leading to tissue destruction and alteration of the intestinal microbiota and bacterial clearance. Suppression of CNFY function, however, increases interferon-γ responses, comprising non-inflammatory antimicrobial activities and tolerogenesis. This process is accompanied by preprogramming the pathogen's transcriptional response towards persistence, giving the bacteria an advantage against host responses and facilitating a commensal lifestyle.
Researchers have identified a novel pathogenic gene, DES1, in the fungus Magnaporthe oryza, which plays a crucial role in suppressing the host plant's basal defenses to facilitate successful colonization and reproduction. The gene was discovered through screening for pathogenic-defective mutants in a T-DNA insertional library. Bioinformatic analysis revealed DES1 encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown biochemical properties, conserved in filamentous Ascomycetes. Targeted deletion of DES1 had no effect on developmental processes, including vegetative growth, conidial germination, appressium formation, and appressium-mediated penetration. However, conidial size of the mutant was smaller than wild-type, with no defects in cell wall integrity. The Δdes mutant was hypersensitive to oxidative stress, with decreased extracellular enzyme activity, including peroxidases and laccases, and ferrous ion leakage. In interaction with a susceptible rice cultivar, cells inoculated with Δdes exhibited strong defense responses: brown granules in infected cells, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, autofluorescent materials, and PR gene induction in neighboring tissues. Δdes displayed reduced hyphal extension, decreasing pathogenicity. Suppression of ROS by dipheniodium (DPI), an NAD oxidase inhibitor, reduced defense in plant tissues with Δdes. Furthermore, Δdes recovered normal growth in DPI-treated plant. These findings suggest DES functions as a pathogenic gene regulating ROS-mediated plant defense.
Researchers evaluated the accuracy of model-based statistics (MB) for predicting Schistosoma haematium infection in Ghana by comparing empirically determined prevalence values from 79 school surveys with predicted values from MB. Schools were categorized according to WHO guidelines to assess implications of differences. Using predicted values alone, 21 of 25 empirically determined 'high-risk' schools would have been undertreated, and 20% of remaining schools would have been treated despite empirically determined absence of infection. This would have resulted in 28% of children being undertreated and 12% receiving treatment without demonstrated need. The current predictive map for Ghana was inadequate for guiding national program when aggregated to district level. Assessing each school in potentially endemic areas is not feasible; modelling must be complementary to empiric assessments. Predictive mapping should not be a one-time exercise, but an iterative process incorporating empiric testing and refining to create updated versions meeting operational needs of disease control managers.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms guiding sperm through the reproductive tract to oocytes in Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that oocytes synthesize sperm-guiding prostaglandins from polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUA) precursors in yolk lipoproteins. Using genetics and electrospray ion tandem mass spectrometry, they delineated F-series prostland metabolism pathways. Omega-6 and omega-3 PUFAs, arachidonic and eicosentaenoic acids, were converted into more than 10 structurally related F prostagland, which collectively and redundantly promote sperm guidance. Disrupting omega-3 PU synthesis triggered compensatory upregulation of prostagland from omega-6 PAs. C elegans prostland synthesis involves distinct mechanisms from mammalian cyclooxygenase pathways, yet PG2 stereoisomers are synthesized. A conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme, whose human homolog is implicated in Biet's Crystine dystrophy, regulates prostland synthesis. Results support multiple cyclooxygen-independent prostland function in promoting sperm motility for fertilization. This pathway may be conserved.
Researchers have identified a challenge in the development of biotherapeutics due to immunogenicity, which hinders widespread clinical application. To address this, improved deimmunization technologies are needed. An algorithm was developed to optimize proteins for reduced T cell epitope content and high function. In silico analysis revealed no single global optimum for deimmization, instead, mutagen epitope deletion yields a spectrum of designs with tradeoffs between immunogenicity and function. The Pareto frontier, undominated variants with no better performance in both criteria, was identified. A Pareto frontier for a therapeutic enzyme was constructed and experimentally evaluated. Measures of performance correlated with computational predictions, mapping a functional space. This is the first systematic assessment of the penalty for progressively deimmized biotherapeutic candidates. Algorithms may rapidly design tradeoffs between immunogenicity and functionality, augmenting, accelerating, and de-risking deimmization efforts.
Elevated temperature increases meiotic crossover frequency via the Type I pathway in Arabidopsis thalian.

Meiosis, a fundamental to sexual reproduction in eukaryotes, relies on reciprocal exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes, known as crossover (CO), to ensure proper chromosome segregation. CO frequency and distribution are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, with more known mechanisms governing the former than latter. Elevated temperature induces meiotic hyper-recombination in Arabidopsis thalian, with genetic analysis of mutants in recombination pathways showing extra COs derive from Type I interference pathway. Heat-induced COs not result from increased double-strand breaks, hyperrecomant phenotype specific to thermal stress, not generalized response. Findings provide mechanistic insight into environmental modulation of meiotic recombination, practical applications.
A novel computational approach has been developed to address the challenge of navigating the vast and rapidly evolving landscape of biomedical literature, particularly in molecular biology. This approach, called Hanalyzer, is a knowledge-based system that combines reading, reasoning, and reporting to facilitate the analysis of experimental data. It extracts information from external resources, either by parsing structured data or using natural language processing to extract from unstructured data, and tracks provenance. Reasoning enriches the extracted knowledge by noting, for example, genes annotated to the same ontology or database entry. Reasoning also combines sources into a network representing all relationships between pairs of genes and calculates a reliability score. Reporting combines the network with congruent constructed from data and visualizes in a tool facilitating knowledge-based analysis of data. Hanalyzer was implemented on a large-scale expression dataset relevant to craniofacial development. The tool was critical in creation of hypotheses regarding four previously uncharacterized genes in craniofac development, each validated by further work.
Helminth parasites, specifically Fasciola hepatica, secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) that can be internalized by host cells, modulating the host's immune response. However, the surface-exposed molecules involved in ligand-receptor interactions with host cells to initiate vesicle docking and internalization are poorly understood. This study used membrane-impermeable biotin reagent to capture proteins on outer surface of two EV subpopulations (15k and 120 EV) released by adult F. hepatica, identifying 380 proteins including virulence factors, membrane proteins, and molecules in EV biogenesis/trafficking. Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis showed 120 EV have endosomal origin, released via protonephial excretory system, while 15 EV are from gastrodermal epithelial cells lining fluke gut. Lectin microarray profiled surface oligosaccharides of intact EV displayed to host, showing identical glycoconjugate profiles for 15 and 120 EV, distinct from parasite tegument, high mannose predominant. F hep EV resisted exo and endoglycosidase, glycosidase PNG remodelled surface oligosacides blocking uptake by macrophages. Pre-treatment with host antibodies or purified against EV surface proteins (DM9, CD63, myferlin) enhanced internalization.
Arabidopsis thaliana CDF2 plays a crucial role in the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), which are essential for plant development. miRNAs are initially transcribed as stem-loop primary miRNAs (pri-miRNAs) by RNA polymerase II, then cleaved in the nucleus into mature miRNAs by Dicer-like 1 (DCL1). CDF2, a DOF transcription factor, interacts with D1 and regulates the accumulation of a subset of miRNAs. C2 binds directly to the promoters of some miRNA genes, acting as a transcriptional activator or repressor. C2 preferentially binds to pri-miRNAs regulated by itself and affects D1-mediated processing of these priiRN. Genetically, C2 functions in the same pathway as miR156 or mi172 to control flowering. C2 regulates a group of priiRNAs at both transcriptional and post-transcription levels to maintain proper levels of mature miRN, influencing plant development.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GG) in the establishment of communication between oocytes and granulosa cells during folliculogenesis, a process essential for providing ova for reproduction. GG, a metabolic intermediate in protein geranylation, increases in oocytes during early follicular development. Depletion of GG in oocytes impairs granosa cell proliferation, primary follicle transition, and female fertility. Mechanistically, GG depletion inhibits Rho GTP geranylation and GTPase activity, leading to accumulation of junction proteins in oocyte cytoplasm and disrupted oocyte-granosa connection. GG also blocks Rab27 geranylation, affecting secretion of o materials such as G9. GG administration restores defects in o-granosa contact, granosa proliferation, and primary transition in GG depletion mice. This study demonstrates GG-mediated geranylation contributes to o-granosa communication and regulates primary follicle transition, a key follicogenesis phase for female function.
RNA polymerase II (Pol II) is a eukaryotic enzyme responsible for synthesizing messenger RNA from a DNA template. Despite extensive biochemical and biophysical studies, the route of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) entry into the active site of the enzyme remains unclear. Crystallographic structures of Pol II have provided insight into the structural basis of transcription, but the conformation of the unpaired non-template part of the transcription bubble (TB) is unknown. The diffusion of NTP through the main channel may overlap with the TB region, making structural information on TB crucial for understanding Pol II transcription. This study presents a structural model of Pol with a complete transcription bubble based on existing data and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, revealing NTP pathways. Results show both channels have space for N loading, but the percentage of conformations with space for N through the secondary channel is twice that of the main. Further MD simulations with N loaded channels indicate NTP diffusion through the main is disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between N and negatively charged backbone nucleotides in non-template DNA. The study suggests the secondary channel is major for N entry during II transcription.
Dengue is a reportable disease in Thailand and Cambodia, but the reported incidence may not accurately reflect the true burden of the disease. To estimate the magnitude of underreporting and establish accurate burden estimates, laboratory-confirmed outpatient and inpatient cases from prospective cohort studies were used. Two cohort studies were conducted among children under 15 years of age from a deng field site consortium over at least two deng seasons. Age-specific multipliers (MF) were calculated by comparing cohort data to national surveillance in the same province and year. In Thailand, 14,627 person-years of cohort data were obtained in two provinces and 14,493-years from one in Cambodia. The average incidence of laboratory-confirmed deng was 23/1,000 and 25/1,000 in Thailand, and 41/1,000 in Cambodia. Calculated MF varied by age and year (0.4-29). Average age-specific MF were applied to country-level data, indicating 229,886 (210,612-331,236) deng cases annually 2003-2007 in Thailand and 111,178 (80,452-357,135) in Cambodia. Underreporting of total inpatient deng was 8.7 and 2.6 in Thailand, and 9.1 and 1.4 in Cambodia. In 2007, over 95,000 children in Thailand and 58,000 in Cambodia were estimated hospitalized due to deng. Calculating MF by cohort to surveillance is an approach to accurately assess burden. These data indicate deng reported in many countries, surveillance under the true burden.
Researchers investigated the role of natural killer (NK) cells in promoting CD8 T cell responses against cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. They used congenic or mutant mice and genetically engineered viruses to examine the consequences of NK cell defects on antiviral CD8 responses. The study found that NK cells accelerate CD8 cell responses against viral infection in vivo for the first time. The mechanism involves NK limiting IFN-α/β production, which reduces immunosuppressive effects on the host. This is achieved by controlling cytomegalovirus, reducing plasmacyoid dendritic cell (pDC) cytokine production, preserving conventional dendritic (c) cell compartment, and accelerating antiral CD8 cell responses. Exogenous IF-α administration in animals ablates DCs and delays CD8 cell activation in face NK control viral replication. Data demonstrate NK cells' ability to respond early to cytgalovirus infection contributes to innate response balance, dampening immunopathology and promoting antiral CD8 cell initiation.
In Arabidopsis thalian, the 45S rRNA genes are organized in tandem arrays with varying in copy numbers from hundreds to thousands. While not all copies are transcribed under normal conditions, the regulation of specific rRNA expression is unclear. This study identifies four rRNA variants in Arabidopsis thalian. Transcription of one variant is induced, while others are repressed or unchanged in wild-type plants. Disruption of the nucleolin-like gene (AtNUC1) affects transcription of these variants. The most represented variant, inactive in wild-type plants, is reactivated in Atuc1 mutants. Pre-rRNAs originate from Pol I transcription and are accurately processed. Atuc1 disruption causes loss of symmetrical DNA methylation without histone epigenetic marks on r genes.
Researchers have identified human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) proteins UL38 and UL29 as interacting with the histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) protein, which plays a crucial role in regulating CMV gene expression. Using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, potential interactors were identified, including multiple CMV-coded proteins. The interaction of UL38 and UL29 with HD1 was confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation. HD1 is part of the nucleosome remodeling and deetylase complex (Nu), and UL38 and UL29 associated with the M2 component of Nu. Knockdown of Nu constituents RBP and CH4 inhibited CM immediateearly RNA and DNA accumulation, indicating multiple Nu components are needed for efficient CM replication. Treating cells with the deetyl inhibitor trichostatin did not rescue UL29 or UL38 deficient viruses, suggesting a positive role for Nu elements in replication. UL29 transiently expressed enhanced the CM major early promoter in a reporter assay, regardless of UL38 expression. Induction of the major early reporter by UL29 required Nu components, consistent with inhibition of early RNA accumulation after RBP and CH4 knockdown. UL29 modifies the Nu complex to stimulate early RNA accumulation.
Researchers investigated the antibody response to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in children following primary infection and its evolution through adolescence and adulthood. They used whole-genome fragment display libraries to identify epitopes in the RSV fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins. The study found modest changes in anti-F epitope repertoire post-infection and a 100-fold increase in G-reactive epitopes spanning the N- and C-terminus of G ectodomain, with increased reactivity to the conserved domain (CCD). Panels of antigen sites were synthesized to evaluate sera from children, adolescents, and adults in real-time assays. A steady increase in RSV epitope repertoire from children to adults was observed using peptides and proteins. Novel epitopes were identified in pre-fusion and immunodominant in F27. Antibody binding to preusion was 2-3 times higher than postusion. R-G responses were high early in children but declined in adults using proteins or peptides. This study shows unlinked evolution of anti-F and G responses and evidence for immune-driven R-G evolution.
Researchers investigated the mode of action of emodeide, a veterinary anthelmint, against adult Brugia malayi, a species causing lymphatic filariasis. Emide potently inhibits parasite motility by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, with males being more sensitive than females. RNAi knockdown suggests emide targets S-1 channels. The slo-1 isoforms, with alternatively spliced exons at the RCK domain, were heterologously expressed in Xenopus lae oocytes. The slo-1 iso, found in males, is more sensitive to emide than slo-1a, found in females. Selective RNAi of slo-1 in females increased emide potency. In Oncherca volulus, causing river blindness, has two isoforms with homology to B-S-1 and B-F at R1. In silico modeling identified an emide binding pocket in the R1 region, affected by splicing variations. Emide has potent macrofidal effects and splicing in R1 affects potency.
The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (GPELF) relies on rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) to determine where mass drug administration for LF is required and when it can be stopped. These tests detect Wuchereria bancrofti glycoprotein in the blood of infected persons via a carbohydrate moiety recognized by monoclonal antibodies AD12 and DH5.5. Loa loa cross-reactivity with RDTs has been recognized as a serious obstacle to LF elimination in loa-endemic areas. To understand the nature of this cross-reactivity, the DH5 antibody was used to immunoaffinity purify Loa antigens from sera of individuals with positive RDT to loa. Immunlot analysis revealed many AD/DH5-reactive antigens and proteomic analysis identified multiple Lo proteins in RDT-positive loa sera. These included secreted and somatic proteins, suggesting they may be released by Loa adult and microfilar. Unlike the high molecular W bancft circulating antigen, Loa antigens appeared transiently present in blood of subset persons loa. Key differences between antigens W bancft and Lo can differentiate results by species and lead to improved tests LF and loa.
Researchers have identified a novel cilium-associated protein, RAB-28, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, which is conserved in humans and associated with Bardet-Bied syndrome (BBS). Cilia are sensory and signalling organelles extending from eukaryotic cells, crucial for various physiological and developmental processes. Defects in cilia cause inherited disorders, such as retinitis pigmentosa and BBS, affecting multiple organs. Cil formation and function depend on intraflagellar transport (IFT), driven by kinesin-2 and IFT-dyne motors and regulated by the BBS cargo protein complex. Whole-organ RNA-Seq profiling in C elegans revealed a signature profile enriched for ciliary transcripts, including FAM161, CC104, and RP1, confirmed to be cilium-localised. From 185 candidate ciliary genes, orthologues of MAP, Y, CC149, and R28 were identified as conserved cilium components. C elegans R-28, linked to autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, is a small GTPase exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons, associating with IFT. GTP-bound R-28 concentrates at the periliary membrane in a BBS-dependent manner and undergoes bidirectional I. Functional analyses showed normal cil structure, sensory and I in a-28 null, but overexpression of GDP or GTP variants R-28 perturbed cil and sensory morphogenesis.
Researchers investigated how the brain represents the external world through neural responses, despite lacking direct access to external stimuli. Using hippocampal place cells as a model, they demonstrated that action potentials (spikes) from stereotyped but unknown receptive fields can be used to extract global features of the environment and construct an accurate representation of space, up to an overall scale, for tracking the animal's position. This approach differs from previous methods reconstructing position from place cell activity, which relied on knowing place fields or other neural responses related to position. By analyzing groups of cells firing together, a significant structure in the underlying stimulus space was revealed, enabling the brain to construct internal representations.
Researchers investigated the role of the NLRP inflamome and IL-1β in the pathogenesis of viral fulminant hepatitis (FH), a severe liver disease with high mortality due to excessive inflammation. Wild-type mice infected with murine hepatitis virus-3 (MHV-3) exhibited severe disease and high mortality associated with significant IL-1β elevation in serum and liver. In contrast, IL-1 receptor deficient (IL-1R-/-) or IL-1 antagonist (IL-Ra) mice showed reduced virus replication, disease progression, and mortality. IL-1R deficiency impaired virus-induced fibrinogen-like protein-2 (FGL) production in macrophages and CD45+Gr1 neutrophil infiltration in liver. Macrophages released reactive oxygen species (ROS) suggesting viral initiation of NLR3 inflamome activation. Mice deficient in p47phox, a NADPH oxidase subunit controlling ROS production, showed reduced NLR3 inflamome activation and IL-β secretion during infection, conferring resilience to FH. Viral animals deficient in NLR and Caspase-1, inflamome components, had reduced IL-β and ameliorated hepatitis. The ROS/NLR/IL-β axis is a critical pathway activated causing severe liver disease during infection.
Researchers conducted a study in Malawi to investigate the role of hookworm infections in severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children. They used multiplex real-time PCR to assess hook species-specific prevalence, load, and their contribution to anemia and iron deficiency. Fecal samples from 830 pre-school children participating in a case-control study were analyzed. Hookworm infections were found in 34.1% of severely anemic cases and 27.0% non-severemic controls (p<0.05), while 5.6% were detected by microscopy. Ancylostoma duale and Necator american prevalence were 26.1% and 4.9%, respectively. Moderate to high A. duale infections were associated with severe anemia (adjusted odds ratio 2.49, 95%CI 1.16-5.33 and 9.04, 95CI 2.52-32.47). Iron deficiency through bone marrow examination was associated with A. duale intensity (odds ratio 3.63, 95CI 1.18-11.20, 16.98 95 3.88.74.35 and 44.91 5.23-385.77 for low, moderate, and high). This study is the first to assess hook load and species with anemia and bone iron deficiency. A. duale prevalence was higher than expected and associated with severe anemia and iron in pre-school in Malawi, indicating need for species-specific screening. Multiplex real PCR is a tool for public health to combat anemia and iron in resource settings.
Researchers have identified a protein called COM-1 in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans that plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) during meiosis. Meiosis is a process of cell division that occurs in reproductive cells where genetic material is shuffled to produce offspring. DSBS can be repaired through two ways: homologous recombination (HR) or non-holog end joining (NHE). HR is necessary for the formation of interolog crossovers (COs) which are necessary for proper chromosome segregation. COM-1-deficient cells repair DS via the error-prone pathway NHE, resulting in lack of CO, chromosomal abnormalities, and embryonic lethality. In contrast to its yeast counterparts, COM1 is not required for Spo11 and initiation of meiotic DS repair, but promotes meiotic recombination by counteracting the NHE complex. COM1 acts parallel to the nuclease EX-1 to promote interolog HR at early pachytene stage of meiotic prophase, safeguarding CO formation. Both nucleases are dispensable for RAD51 recruitment at late pachene stage when hom-independent pathways predominate. This suggests redundancy and regulation of DNA resection during meiotic prophase. The study reveals the lethal consequences of NHE during meiosis and a critical role for COM1 in NHE inhibition and CO in germ cells.
Researchers investigated the humoral immune response to Burkholderia pseudallei antigens in a caprine model of acute meloidosis following aerosol exposure. The study aimed to characterize the humoral immune response to identify immunogenic proteins for diagnostics and vaccine candidates. Outbred goats were used to mimic human infection more accurately than inbred mouse models. B. pseudallei was delivered intratracheally, and antigen proteins were profiled from the infecting strain MSH511. Humoral responses were analyzed by ELISA and western blot, and antigens identified by mass spectrometry. Results showed a greater humoral response with IgG antibodies in breadth and quantity compared to IgM throughout infection. Pre-infection sera showed multiple immunogenic proteins reactive for IgG (7-20) and IgM(0-12) in goats despite no previous exposure to B.alle. After infection, IgG reactive proteins increased as disease progressed. Early infection (day 7) showed reaction to chaper proteins Gro, EL, EFu, and DK. These proteins detected in all samples post-infection with Gro immunodominant. Seven reactive antigens were selected for ELISA. Heat shock protein Gro1 elicited strongest antibody response compared other antigens. Most showed peak IgM reactivity day 14, IgG reactivity increased as disease progressed. MSH511 proteomic comparison between goat and human sera showed common reactive proteins between humans and goats meloid.
Cyclin B–cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activation is a crucial for initiating mitotic entry, triggered by a positive feedback loop at the end of the G2 phase. During metaphase, the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclos-dependent destruction of cyclin B inactivates C1, allowing mitotic exit and cell division. Previous models describe C1 kinetics in mitosis, but experimental data on activation in mitotic cells have been lacking. Researchers used a novel approach to determine the temporal development of cyclin B–C1dk activity in single cells. By quantifying dephosphorylation of C1 and phosphorylation of the C1 anaphase-promoting complexyclos, they disclosed cyclin B–C1 continues to be activated after centrosome separation. Importantly, cytoplasmic cyclin B–1C1 activity can be maintained when cyclin B translocates to the nucleus in prophase. These data were fitted into a model describing cyclin B–1C1 in human, revealing a resemblance to bistable circuit. In line with kinetics, cyclin B–1C1 levels to enter mitosis are lower than cyclin B–1C1 for mitotic. Gradually increasing cyclin B–1C1 after centros separation is critical to coordinate mitotic progression.
Researchers investigated the neutralizing antibody (Nab) responses after HIV-1 superinfection (SI) in 21 Kenyan women exposed to subtypes A, C, and D, and superinfected after a median of 1.07 years following initial infection. Plasma samples were collected at a median 2.72 years post-SI. The study focused on 4 main epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope: CD4 binding site, V1/V glycan, N332 site in V3, and gp41 membrane proximal external region. Epitope mapping techniques showed SI did not induce a dominant response to any of these epitopes in the 21 women. Computational analysis suggested 20/21 superinfected women's responses could not be ascribed single specificity with confidence. These findings support a model where SI with subtypes promotes broad polyclonal Nab response, suggesting vaccine designs using multivalent immunogens to elicit diverse Nabs.
Congenital human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a leading cause of neurological disabilities in children worldwide, but the underlying mechanisms are not well-defined. Research has shown that CMV dysregulates the Notch signaling pathway in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs). Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes) is a key regulator of NPC fate and brain development. This study found that CMV downregulates Hes protein levels in NPCs. The CMV 72Da immediate-early 1 protein (IE1) is involved in H degradation by assembling a ubiquitination complex and promoting H ubiquitination as a E3 ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasomal degradation of H. SpA, a component of PML bodies, is another target of IE-mediated ubiquination. The C-terminal region of IE, amino acids 451-475, is required for IE/H interaction and IE-mediated ubiquination but not for IE/SpA interaction and ubiquination. This study reveals a mechanism linking downregulation of H to neurodevelopmental disorders caused by CMV infection and identifies IE as the first CM-encoded E ubiquitin ligase.
Researchers investigated transcription factor binding and gene expression in blastoderm embryos of four Drosophila species: D. melanogaster, D. yak, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis, to understand how regulatory sequence variation drives gene expression divergence. They compared gene expression levels measured by mRNA-seq to genome-wide binding measured by ChIP-seq of four transcription factors involved in anterior-posterior patterning. Results showed that mRNA levels are more conserved than individual factor binding events, and changes in gene expression were not explained by changes in factor binding. However, highly bound sites in regions bound by multiple factors and near genes were conserved more than other sites, suggesting weak or non-functional factor binding not subject to purifying selection.
Epidemiological Assessment of Eight Rounds of Mass Drug Administration for Lymphatic Filariasis in India: Implications for Monitoring and Evaluation

A large-scale epidemiological study was conducted in two primary health centers in Thanjavur district, India, a region endemic for bancroftian filariasis, which had undergone eight rounds of mass drug administration (MDA). The survey covered 70% of the 50,363 population and found a microfilaria (M) prevalence of 0.2% and intensity 0.004 per 60µl blood, while antigen (Ag) prevalence was 2.3% and 17.3 units. Ag prevalence ranged from 0.7 to 0.9% in children 2-10 years and 2.7 to 3.0 in adults. Despite M levels <1% and Ag <2 in sentinel sites, "residual" M prevalence ≥1 was found in children irrespective of Ag-status and "transmission" at least one Ag-positive child during M period hotspots were identified. Antigenemic persons were clustered at household and site levels. An Ag prevalence of 1% in children (0.4 community M prevalence) was proposed as a threshold for stopping MDA. The existence of hotspots and spatial clustering indicate the need for developing surveillance strategies detecting hotspots, evidence-based sampling and evaluation size for transmission assessment surveys.
A systematic review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of temeph, an organophosphate laricide, in controlling deng vectors and deng transmission when used as a single intervention or in combination with other methods. A comprehensive literature search of six databases and grey literature was performed, with 27 studies included in the review (11 single intervention, 16 combined). Single intervention studies showed temeph reduced entomological indices, while 11 of 16 combined studies showed tem with other chemical methods reduced entom indices, but this was not sustained in five. The effectiveness of temeph was dependent on factors such as delivery quality, water rate, type, debris, temperature, sunlight, and exposure. Timing and reapplication, reluctance, cost, supplies, time, and labour were limitations. When used alone, tem was effective in suppressing entom indices, but not when combined with other interventions. No evidence suggests tem use reduces deng transmission.
The cohesin complex plays a crucial role in holding sister chromatids together from the time of their duplication in S phase until separation during mitosis. In budding yeast, cohesin is found along the length of chromosomes, but is most abundant at the centromere surrounding region, the pericentere. Research has shown that the C19 kinetore complex and replication-associated factor, C3, are important mediators of perenteric cohesion, but act through distinct mechanisms. The C19 complex directs the association of cohes with the pericere, while C3 is dispensable for cohes enrichment in the perere but essential for its functionality in holding centromeres together. Cells lacking C3 exhibit cohesion defects in combination with mutants of the C19 complex. Delaying DNA replication rescues the defect in cells lacking C19 components, but not C3. This suggests the C19 complex ensures cohes loading at centrom prior to replication fork passage, ensuring incorporation through a process requiring C3.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of the serum metabolome and lipidome in adult patients with deng fever/deng hemorrhagic fever (DF) at three stages: early febrile, defervence, and convalescence. Using liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, they identified 60 differential metabolites in a sample of 44 patients. The main metabolite classes were fatty acids, acylcarnitines, phospholids, and amino acids, with perturbed pathways including fatty acid biosynthesis, β-oxidation, phosphid catabolism, and steroid pathway. These changes suggest a multifactorial host response to DENV infection. Analysis of phosphids and sphingids revealed temporal trends associated with lymphocytes and platelets, with significant perturbation during early stages and normalization at convalescence. These metabolites may serve as prognostic markers. DENV causes distinct serumome and lipidome changes, with many metabolites involved in inflammatory responses. The study found early anti-inflammatory responses modulating pro-inflammatory processes, preventing excessive or prolonged inflammation. This is the first example of omic approach revealing concurrent, dynamic host responses to DENV, providing insights into why DF is self-limiting.
Research on Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) has increased in recent years, with significant gaps in diagnostic and treatment remaining. Analyzing bibliometric data from research publications is a powerful method for revealing research efforts and partnerships. This study aimed to map NTD research in Germany and its partners abroad to enable informed evaluation of German contributions to NTD research. A Scopus database search for articles with German affiliations published between 2002-2012 was conducted for kinoplast and helminth diseases. Open tools were used for data cleaning (OpenRefine), geocoding (OpenMaps) and creating (TableNet) to visualise and analyse co-author networks (Gephi). From 26,833 publications worldwide addressing 11 diseases, 1,187 (4.4%) had at least one German affiliation, and 972 were processed for the five most-published diseases. Of those, 4,007 authors and 863 institutions were extracted to construct co-author networks. The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries, with collaborations on the African continent scattered. NTD research in Germany was distributed among 220 institutions. Strong performers were identified on individual level using parameters (publications, h-index) and network (between centrality). The network varied between diseases. The share of NTD publications with affiliations is half its share in other medical fields. This underlines the need to identify and expand Germany's strong research towards NTD. Spatial analysis of collaborations abroad supports strengthening research capacity, particularly in low-middle countries less involved than high. Identifying knowledge within researcher networks complements traditional indicators for collaboration opportunities.
In Haiti, the Ministry of Public Health and its international partners implemented a mass drug administration (MDA) program targeting lymphatic filariasis (LF) and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) since 2000. By 2012, the neglected tropical disease (ND) program had reached national scale, achieving high epidemiological coverage, allowing for treatment cessation of LF in most of the country. Key to this success was the detailed implementation of MDAs, which included: community awareness through evidence-based, multi-channel education facilitated by voluntary distributors; community trust through respected member recruitment, training, supervision, and motivation; directly observed treatment; accessible distribution and supply; and data-driven strategies. These strategies were effective, with 100% geographical coverage in 2012, exceeding targets for LF (65%) and STH (75%), and significant infection reduction, with 45 communes reaching LF treatment threshold. International support enabled Haiti's successful campaign, resulting in steady progress toward LF elimination and STH control. The described efforts established global best practices for ND control and address future challenges: maintaining STH control post-LF treatment and morbidity management for lymphatic patients.
Researchers investigated the role of the master regulator Ctr in Sinorhizobium meli, an alphaproteobacterium that forms a symbiotic relationship with legume hosts. The bacterium undergoes cellular differentiation within host cells, resulting in genome amplification, branching, elongation, and loss of reproductive capacity. Similar to Caulobacterus cresus, Ctr is linked to cell cycle regulation, but its function in S. meli is not well understood. Depletion of Ctr caused cell elongation, branching, and genome amplification, similar to nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. Cell cycle proteolytic degradation of Ctr is essential in S. mel, suggesting a mechanism for C depletion in differentiated bacteroids. ChIP-Seq and gene microarray analysis showed S. mel Ctr regulates similar processes as C cresus Ctr, but through different genes. C does not control Fts complex for cell division timing, but negatively regulates septum-inhibiting Min system.
Francisella tularens is a highly infectious bacterium that causes the zoonotic disease tularemia. Its ability to multiply and survive within macrophages is crucial for its virulence. Researchers screened a library of HimarFT transposon mutants of the F. tularens vaccine strain L to identify intracellular growth-deficient mutants, isolating one mutant in a gene encoding a putative glutamyl transpeptase (GT). This gene, F_076, was designated ggt. The ggt mutant showed impaired intracellular multiplication and attenuated virulence in mice. The study found that the GT activity of F. tulareis enables the utilization of glutathione (GSH, γ-glutylcystylglycine) and γ-glutylcyste dipeptide as cystine sources for intracellular growth. This is the first demonstration of the essential role of a nutrient acquisition system in intracellular F. tulareis multiplication. Glutathione is the most abundant source of cystine in host cytos. The capacity of this intracellular pathogen to utilize available GSH as cystine host cytos a paradigm of bacteria-host adaptation.
Researchers investigated the interaction between two species of Leishmania parasites, Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania major, by infecting macrophages in culture. Leish amazonensis amastotes occupy large parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) containing multiple parasites, while Leish major amastotes lodge in small, tight PVs that undergo fission as they divide. To determine if PVs of these Leish species can fuse, macrophages were infected with non-fluorescent Leish amazonensis amastotes and 48 hours later superinfected with fluorescent Leish major amastotes or promastigotes. Fusion was investigated by time-lapse imaging of living cells and colocalization of parasites in the same PVs. Results showed that PV containing Leish major promastigotes fused with established Leish amazon PVs, while PV containing Leish amastotes did not fuse. In chimeric vacuoles, Le major promigotes remained motile and multiplied but did not differentiate into amastotes. In contrast, doubly infected cells had unfused PV containing Leish promigotes, which were destroyed or differentiated into proliferating amastotes. This indicates PVs customized by Le majorast or promig differ in ability to fuse with Leish PV, and species-specific PV required for major differentiation.
Researchers investigated the ability of native membrane-expressed HIV-1 Env trimers to elicit tier 2 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in rabbits. Immunization with virus-like particles (VLPs) expressing trimers (trimer VLP) or DNA expressing Env trimer followed by protein (DNAimer) resulted in potent nAb titers in 2/8 and 1/20 rabbits, respectively. The sera neutralized quaternary epitopes and exploited gaps in the glycan defenses of the conserved region of JRFL gp120. Trimer VLP sera targeted the absence of a glycan residue at position 197, present in 98.7% of Envs. Removing this glycan made 50-67% of clade B tier 2 isolates sensitive to trimer VLP sera. Neutralizing epitopes overlapped with the CD binding site, suggesting the glycan acts as a "fence" limiting access. Bioinformatics analysis shared features of trimer VLP and monoclonal antibody 9. DNA trimer sera targeted absence of gly at 230, proximal to CD site, similar to monoclonal 8, albeit tier breadth. Data show strain-specific holes in gly fence allow tier 2 nAbs to native spikes. Cross-neutralization occurs without gly. Observations inform future nAb vaccine development.
Researchers investigated the use of immunohistochemistry to monitor wound healing in patients with Buruli ulcer (BU) treated with antibiotics. Traditionally, surgery has been the primary treatment for BU, but a combination of oral rifampicin and intramuscular streptomycin has improved outcomes and reduced recurrence rates. However, managing extensive lesions after successful therapy remains a challenge, particularly in African countries with high disease burden. Wound healing is delayed in some treated patients, but reasons are not fully understood. The study analyzed tissue specimens from eight BU patients with plaque lesions before and after chemotherapy using immunohistochemistry for markers of connective tissue neoformation, tissue remodeling, and epidermal activation. Several markers were found suitable for monitoring wound healing. α-smooth muscle actin positive myofibblasts were not present in untreated lesions but emerged during healing, producing extracellular matrix proteins like pro-collagen and tenascin in fibronectin areas. After treatment, cells including myiblasts showed activated phenotype with ribosomal S6 phosphorylation, a translation marker. Healing wounds showed dermal remodeling by apoptosis and cytokeratin 16 expression in epidermis.
Researchers investigated the relationship between impulse conduction and mitochondrial transport in adult mammalian peripheral nerves in vivo. They used confocal imaging of saphen nerves in anaesthetized mice to study mitochondrial trafficking in resting and electrically active axons. Electrical stimulation at low frequency increased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial traffic in myelinated and unmyinated axons. Higher frequency conduction within physiological range (50 Hz) increased anterog, but not retro, mitochondrial traffic by increasing mobile mitochondria number and velocity. Capsaicin application to innervated saph nerve increased traffic in both myel and unmyinated axons. Mitochondria in axons conducting higher frequency became shorter, supplying additional mitochondria to population through fission. Recruited mitochondria did not accumulate at Nodes of Ranvier, continuing anterogradely. This pattern suggests peripheral terminals sensory ax represent high metabolic sites during high conduction. Most biogenesis occurs at body, antog mitochondrial may ensure uniform density along ax during high load, supporting sustained con.
Spondylacotarsal synostosis (SCT) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive vertebral fusions caused by loss-of-function mutations in Filamin B (FLNB). FLNB acts as a scaffold linking the actin cytoskeleton to signal transduction systems. Employing Fln knockout mice, we found morphological and molecular evidence that intervertebral discs (IVDs) of Fln-/- mice undergo rapid degeneration during postnatal development due to abnormal cell changes in IVD, particularly the annulus fibros (AF). In Fln-/- mice, AF cells lose fibroblast characteristics and acquire hypertrophic chondrocy phenotype. This is marked by endochond-like ossification: altered collagen expression, Collagen X, increased apoptosis, and inappropriate ossification. Conversion to chrocy coincides with upregulated TGFβ via Smad3 and BMP p38 signaling and activated canonical and non-canonical targets p21 and Ctg. FLNB attenuates Tβ/BMP signaling and influences AF fate. IVD disruptions in Fln/- mice resemble degenerative discs, revealing molecular causes vertebral and degeneration.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism by which the orthomyxirus Thog virus (THOV) employs to evade antiviral immunity. The virus targets the general transcription factor TFI, which is crucial for the recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to promoter sites. THOV achieves this by relocating TFI from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, creating a TFI-depleted environment. This would be expected to broadly impact gene expression, but surprisingly, only a limited number of genes are affected. The study found that TFI is essential for de novo recruitment of Pol II to promoters, but not for regulated expression from paused promoters. Many immune genes require de novo recruitment of Pol, making THOV's targeting of TFI a mechanism to modulate immune responses without disrupting other transcriptional activities. This suggests that interfering with TFI activity could be a therapeutic strategy to control undesirable inflammation.
Human parvovirus B19 (B19) infection of primary erythroid progenitor cells (EPCs) causes cell cycle arrest at both in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The virus induces a DNA damage response (DDR) that facilitates viral replication, but is not required for cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase. A putative C-terminal activation domain (TAD) within the NS1 protein is responsible for G2 arrest. To understand the mechanism of B19 NS-induced G2 arrest, doxycine-inducible B19-permissive UT/E-S cell lines were established that express NS or NSmT2, and the function of T2 was examined during G arrest. The results confirm the NS T2 domain plays a role in NS-induced G arrest. Mechanistically, NS activates cellular expression through T, which is responsible for ATR activation. Activated A phosphorylates CDC25 at serine, which inactivates the cyclin/CDK complex without affecting nuclear import. The ATR-CHK-CDC25-CDK pathway is activated during B19 infection of PCs, and A plays a role in B19-induced G arrest.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne virus that causes a range of diseases from uncomplicated to life-threatening, characterized by endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. Research has shown that the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) of DENV induces endothelial hyperperability in mice and human pulmonary endothelial cells by disrupting the endothelial glycocalyx layer. This study investigated the role of inflammatory mediators and endothelial-intrinsic pathways in DENV-induced vascular leakage. In vivo, DENV NS triggered vascular leakage in the dermis of wild-type C57/6 mice, but not the related West Nile virus NS. In vitro, human dermal endothelial cells exposed to DENV did not produce inflammatory cytokines (TN-α, IL-6, IL-8), and blocking these cytokines did not affect DENV-induced endothelial hyperability. Furthermore, DENV induced vascular in TLR- or TN-receptor-deficient mice at similar to wild-type levels. Finally, DENV-induced vascular was blocked using inhibitors targeting glycocal disruption. These findings indicate that DENV-induced endothelial vascular is independent of inflammatory but dependent on glycocal components.
In budding yeast, the assembly of a septin ring at the site of bud emergence is a critical for proper cytokinesis, spindle positioning, and the spindle position (SPO) checkpoint. The PO checkpoint delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis until the anaphase spindle aligns with the division axis. PO signalling requires Kin4 kinase and Kin4-regulating Elm kinase, which also controls septin dynamics. Two ubiquitin ligases, Dma1 and Dma2, control septin dynamics and PO by promoting Elm1 recruitment to the bud. Dma1 D2 mutant cells show reduced Elm levels at the bud and Elm-dependent Kin4 activation. Artificial Elm recruitment to the bud restores normal septin ring, spindle positioning, and PO response in Dma2 cells.
Humans inhabit a diverse range of environments, and natural selection has likely played a significant role in their ability to survive and thrive in extreme climates. This study scanned the human genome for signals of selection by identifying SNPs with strongest correlations to climate variables across 61 worldwide populations. Results show enrichment of genic and nonsynonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SNPs among those correlated with climate variables. Strongest signals overlap with GWAS, including pigmentation and autoimmune disease SNPs. Enrichment found in gene sets related to UV, infection, immunity, and cancer. Adaptations to climate shaped spatial variation in humans.
Short QT syndrome (SQ) is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. This study investigates arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the delayed rectifier K+ current (IK)-linked SQT1 variant of SQ. Markov chain (MC) models were found to be superior to Hodgkin-Hux (HH) models in reproducing experimental data effects of the N588 mutation on KCNH-encoded hERG channel. Ionic models were incorporated into ventricular action potential (AP) models and 1D and 2 idealized and realistic transmural ventricular simulations and 3D anatomical model. In single cell models, the N588 mutation abbreviated ventricular AP duration at 90% repolarization (AP90) and maximal transm voltage heterogeneity (δ) during AP. This resulted in transm heterogeneity AP90 and effective refractory period (ERP) effects anticipated to be anti-arrhythmic rather than pro-arrhyth. However, considering transm heterogeneity IK density in intact tissue based on Tusscher-Noble-Noble-Pfil ventricular model, N588 mutation led to QT shortening and increased T-wave amplitude, but δ found augmented in local ventricular tissue regions, increasing vulnerability unidirectional conduction and predisposing reentrant excitation. In 2 and 3D models, N588 facilitated reentrant excitation due reduced substrate sustaining re-entry size. Thus, S1 N588-hERG mutation facilitates ventricular reentry, increasing lifespan reentrant waves and scroll 3D tissue stability.
Researchers have developed a deep network model to study the collective motion of zebraf (Danio rerio) that is both predictive and insightful. The model is composed of modules that allow it to capture the behavior of each individual in the collective. Simulated trajectories show that the model recovers the underlying rules used to generate them, including the number of interacting neighbors. Experiments on groups of 60 zraf show that interactions between pairs can be described as repulsive or attractive when moving slowly, but at high velocities, interactions are alignment or repulsion at close distances. The model reveals that each zraf decides where to move by aggregating information from neighbors, with higher weights for those close, in collision, or moving in frontal and lateral locations. The network also finds that the number of interacting individuals is dynamic, typically between 8-22, with 1-10 most important.
A study was conducted to quantify the fitness of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in a Swiss cohort using a phylogenetic approach. The research aimed to understand the dynamics of transmitted drug resistance in antiretroviral treatment, as around 10% of ART-naive patients in Europe are infected with drug-resistant HIV-1. The study employed a stochastic birth-death process model to reconstruct the transmission tree of viral lineages among hosts infected by sensitive or resistant strains. The fitness was quantified as the ratio of transmission rates of resistant to sensitive strains. Six mutations in the reverse transcriptase and one in the protease gene were analyzed: 41L, 67,N,70,184,210,215,215,219 (RTI-related) and 103,108,138,181,190 (NNI) and 90 in the protease. The 90 mutation in protease was found to have higher fitness than sensitive strains. Reverse transcriptase mutations 67,70,184,219 were less fit than sensitive. Posterior intervals for remaining mutations included 1, indicating no significant effect on transmissibility. This is consistent with alternative fitness measures. A novel phyodynamic approach was developed to estimate transmission cost of resistance.
A study investigated the role of the Elong complex, specifically the histone acetylase Sin3/El3, in the translation of stress-induced mRNAs in fission yeast. The Elong complex was found to interact with RNA polymerase II and its deficiency led to transcriptional defects. However, Elong was also shown to modify tRNAs, affecting translation efficiency. The study revealed that Sin3/3p is crucial for oxidative stress survival, as the transcription program governed by the Sty1-Atf1-Pcr pathway was affected in mutant cells. Notably, cells lacking Sin3p could not modify the uridine wobble nucleotide of certain tRNAs, and other tRNA modifying activities, such as Ctu-C2, were also essential for normal tolerance to H2O. A plasm overexpressing tRNALUU complemented the stress-related phenotypes of Sin3p mutant cells. The study found that H2-dependent genes, including transcription factors At1 and P1, were highly expressed mRNAs with a biased lysine codon usage. These mRN were poorly translated in stress cells lacking Sin3 or C2, whereas mutated At1 with AAA-A lysine codons was efficiently translated in all backgrounds. The study demonstrated that lack of functional Elong resulted in stress phenotypes due to its contribution to tRNA modification and translation inefficiency of stress-induced mRN.
HIV-1 Nef protein plays a crucial role in the virus's ability to replicate and progress to AIDS in primates. To understand how Nef increases the infectivity of free virus particles, researchers investigated its link to Env protein. Since Nef did not affect the quantity of Env on virus particles, they looked for qualitative changes by examining if Nef alters HIV-1 sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies. Nef conferred up to 50-fold resistance to 2F and 4, two potent neutralizing monoclonal antibodies targeting the membrane-proximal region (MP) of gp41. In contrast, N had no effect on HIV-1 neutralization by MP-specific antibody Z13, peptide T20, or a panel of antibodies targeting gp120. Resistance to neutralization by 2 and 4 was observed in N from diverse HIV-1 and SIV isolates, as well as HIV-1 virions with Env from CCR- and CX4-tropic viruses, clade B and C, or primary isolates. Analysis of N mutants revealed this activity requires N myristoylation, but is separable from other N functions like enhancing infectivity and downregulating CD4. Glycosylated glycoprotein substituted Nef in conferring resistance 2 and 4, indicating this is conserved in retrovirus without N. Given MP-recognition by 2 and 4 dependence on membrane, in contrast to membrane-independence Z13, data supports a model where N alters MP in virion membrane context. N and Glyylated glycoprotein decreased virion capture by 2 and 4, not other antibodies. Studies show N protects lentiviruses from broadly-acting neutralizing antibodies. This N activity has implications for HIV immunity and AIDS pathogenesis.
Researchers investigated the gene expression changes in the snail host, Bithia siam gomphos, infected with the liver fluke Opisthoris vivini, which causes cholangiocarcinoma in the Greater Mekong region of Thailand. High-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics analysis revealed 7,655 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between infected and uninfected snails, associated with 43 biological pathways, including immune mechanisms against parasites. Differentially expressed genes with immune functions showed proteases were downregulated in infected snails, while heat shock proteins and actin transcripts were upregulated in infected snails compared to uninfected counterparts. This study provides a foundation for functional analysis of genes and products involved in immune mechanisms allowing parasite colonization of snail host. Annotated dataset is a resource for discovery of susceptibility and resistance mechanisms in snail to parasite and comparative analysis with other snail hosts of platyhelmin, including schistosomes.
Researchers investigated the role of complement receptor 1 (CR1, also known as CD35) in the susceptibility to leprosy, a significant public health issue in Brazil. CR1 binds to complement fragments C3/C4 deposited on mycobacteria, facilitating its entry into macrophages. The study examined CR1 polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR1 levels in a case-control study with 213 leprosy patients (47% multibacillary) and 297 controls. Nine polymorphisms were hapyped by multiplex PCR-PCR in 213 lepro patients and 297 controls. mRNA levels were measured by qPCR and CR1 by ELISA in 80 samples. Individuals with the most common recombinant haplotype harboring rs926*T in intron 21 and rs700*T in exon 26 (encoding p140Met of Yolk antigen) presented higher susceptibility to lepro (OR 2.43, p0.017). Paibacillary patients with these variants had lower CR1 levels, reducing anti-inflammatory response (p0.040 and 0.046). The most haplotype increased susceptibility to multacillary form (OR 3.04, 0) presented intronic rs343*G allele, associated higher gene expression (0.043), increasing parasite internalization. An inverse correlation was found between CR and mannose-binding lectin (initiator lectin pathway complement, recognized by1) (R-0.52 0.007).
Researchers conducted a study to investigate sex-specific differences in serum metabolite concentrations and their genetic determinants. They analyzed data from over 3,300 individuals from the KORA F3 and F cohorts, measuring 131 metabolites, including amino acids, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyins, acylcarnines, and C-sugars. A linear regression analysis revealed significant differences between males and females for 102 out of 131 metabolites (p-value < 3.8×10^-4, Bonferr-corrected threshold). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) showed genome-wide significant differences in beta-estimates for SNPs in the CPS1 locus (carbamyl-phosphate synthase 1, significance: p < 3.8×10^-10, Bonerr-correct threshold) for glycine. The study found that metabolite profiles of males and females are significantly different, and specific variants in metabolism-related genes depict sexual dimorphism.
Genome-scale metabolic networks are used to model genotype-phenotype relationships through flux simulations, but the large solution space of metabolic states requires optimization approaches. The objective function used in optimization is linked to the biological hypothesis underlying the model, making it a crucial parameter for successful modeling. Linear combinations of fluxes are used to formulate objective functions, but the optimization is sensitive to stoichiometry representation of the network, leading to different results with numerically equivalent but biochemically stoichiometric representations. This ambiguity makes biological interpretation subjective. A new method, Minimization of Metabolites (MiBl), decouples stoichiometry from objective formulation by using metabolite turnovers instead of fluxes. Simulations of perturbed networks show stoichi representation independence is essential for unambiguous modeling and biological interpretation. MiBl expands metabolic modeling scope, elucidating genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the distribution of plague (Yersinia pestis infection) and the genetic structure of the black rat (Rattus rattus) population in Madagascar, the primary reservoir of the disease. A comparative study of seroprevalence and genetic data (15 microsatellite markers) was conducted in four geographic areas with varying topography, each covering 150-200 km within the Madagas plague focus. Serrevalence levels in rat populations mirrored those reported in humans, with marked genetic structure increasing with relief. However, servalence and genetic data differed between areas, indicating plague distribution not solely dependent on rat dispersal. Genetic estimates suggested epizootics had weak impact on population sizes. In highlands, plague dissemination not solely by rat dispersal, human activities involved in spreading disease in rat and human populations.
Researchers investigated the human IgG responses to Schistosoma mansoni's surface proteins, specifically the Ly6 family members, following praziquel treatment. The study aimed to understand the host-parasite interactions by examining the tegument surface proteins and elicited immune responses. A comprehensive analysis of the Schistoma mansoni Ly family revealed eleven members, including three novel proteins, and confirmed Sm29 as a unique double PAR/Ly domain-containing protein. The presence of cysteine residues, signal peptides, and GPI sites suggest all Ly proteins are cell-bound. IgG and IgE responses to surface-bound LyA and LyB were measured in a cohort of S mansoni-infected Ugandan males before and after prazant treatment. Pre-treatment IgG prevalence for LyA and LyB were 7.4% and 25.3% respectively, higher than IgG for sub-surface antigen SmAL. Post-treatment IgG against surface LyA and Ly significantly dropped compared to rising Ig for sub-s SmAL. The study expands the number of Ly proteins in S mans and demonstrates surface LyA and Ly elicit immunological responses during infection in endemic communities.
Researchers have developed a computational model to simulate the morphogenesis of epithelial cells in the Drosophila retina, focusing on the role of the adhesion protein Cadherin. The model aims to minimize the interfacial energy between cells during tissue formation. Experimental data from normal and mutant cells lacking or misexpressing Cadin are explained by a model incorporating key features of morphogenesis, including Cadin expression timing and its relation to cell contact remodeling. Simulations replicate wild-type and mutant cell geometries, highlighting Cad dynamics and the importance of adhesion protein and its timing in cell remodeling. Additionally, the model suggests Cadin is recycled from inactive to active interfaces, modulating adhesion between cells.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the role of MT1-MMP, a protease involved in cancer cell invasion, in degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM) at invadopodia. Previous studies suggested continuous supply of MT-M, but its turnover rate and contribution to degradation were unclear. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments with tagged MT-M at invadop showed rapid recovery, approximated by double-exponential plots with 26 and 259 seconds. Recovery depended on vesicle transport, not lateral diffusion. A computational model was constructed based on FR kinetics, reproducing experiments. Inhibiting ves transport blocked ECM degradation and simulation showed no degradation under inhibiting ves transport. ECM degradation reduction depended on MT-M turnover. Experiments and simulations established MT-M turnover's role in invadodia degradation. Simulations suggested synergy between proteolytic activity and MT-M turnover, with nonlinear reduction in degradation when both factors reduced. A computational tool was developed to evaluate cancer invasion strategies.
Researchers conducted a spatio-temporal assessment of simian/humanodeficiency virus (SHIV) evolution in macaques infected with RT-SHm027, a simian immunodef virus encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, treated with RT inhibitors. The study aimed to understand how drug-resistant HIV-1 arises and spreads within an individual and how spatial structure impacts its emergence. Serial samples were taken from blood, including plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at four time points. Single-genome sequencing revealed a dynamic process where vRNA rapidly acquires drug resistance across compartments through multiple mutations. The same genotypes were present across compartments, but frequencies did not equilibrate immediately. Blood and lymph nodes were compartmentalized, while blood and lymph differed from mucosal tissues. The study suggests blood sampling does not capture viral dynamics in other body parts, especially gut, where vRNA turnover was faster and plasma retained fewer wild-type viruses than other compartments.
Researchers investigated the role of feedback regulation in cell lineage progression on tissue morphogenesis using mathematical modeling. They found that a specific feedback architecture, where both positive and negative diffusible signals act on stem and progenitor cells, leads to bistable or bimodal growth, ultrasensitivity to external cues, growth-driven budding, self-elongation, and self-organization in the form of lamellar patterns. These behaviors arise through control of stem/progenitor self-renewal, not cell cycle regulation. Spatial patterns result from interactions between diffus factors with antagonistic effects, but morphogenesis is not due to Turing instabilities.
Researchers conducted the largest genome-wide association study to date on myopia, a common eye disorder characterized by excessive elongation of the eye, in 4,771 European participants. The study aimed to elucidate the etiology of myopia, which is complex and poorly understood. A survival analysis of age of myopia onset identified 22 significant associations, 10 of which replicated earlier associations with refractive error. Ten novel associations were replicated in a separate cohort of 8,323 participants who developed myopia before age 10. These associations explain 2.9% of variance in myopia onset and suggest multiple mechanisms behind its development. One association is in PRSS56, linked to abnormally small eyes, one in LAMA, part of extracellular matrix, two in RGR and RDH, involved in regeneration of 11-cis-retinal, two in ZIC and SFRP, involved in retinal ganglion growth, and five in neuronal development.
Researchers investigated the role of curvature feedback in the energetics and dynamics of lamprey swimming using a closed-loop model. The lamprey, like other animals, have a central pattern generator (CPG) circuit that activates locomotion and adjusts to sensory inputs from the environment. This feedback system is crucial for responding to perturbations, but also active during unperturbed swimming, influencing the baseline pattern. The study evaluated different forms of body-based feedback and their effects on swimming energetics and kinematics, as little is known about curvature feedback form. The CP was modeled as coupled oscillators, pairs representing left and right body segments, activating muscles and moving the lamprey through a Navier-Stokes fluid. Body curvature served as input to the oscillators, closing the loop. Two feedback forms were considered, consistent with lamprey proprioceptive receptors. Directional feedback excited or inhibited oscillators on the same side, opposite on the other, depending on gain. It did not affect frequency, but changed activity duration. Magnitude feedback provided symmetric effect on both oscillators, increasing frequency and reducing cost when gain was high. Both feedback had similar curvature magnitude. Results indicate magnitude-based feedback on CP with different forms cause distinct performance.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of HIV epidemics in Africa, where local outbreaks are often dominated by a single subtype, indicating strong founder effects. They hypothesized that competition between viral strains may favor the strain that first colonized a population, slowing new strain invasion and epidemic diversification. A stochastic modeling framework simulated epidemics over contact networks, introducing a second strain into a population with established first strain. Simulations were parameterized with empirical data, testing scenarios with varying prevalence levels. Results showed the second strain spread slower than the first, even with equal transmission efficiency, unable to invade on pandemic timescale. A 25% transmission advantage over the first strain was needed to dominate in decades. The effect was weaker if introduced during growth phase. Interference mechanisms (inhibition, superinfection, hub depletion, peak infectiousness) were tested, confirming a strong first comer advantage in HIV competition, explaining global geography and influencing pandemic evolution.
Researchers have investigated the self-organization of muscle structure and function across multiple scales, from the sarcomere to the muscle bundle. To address this multiscale problem, they constrained muscle cells in microenvironments that facilitate intracellular organization. The study hypothesized that extracellular boundary conditions facilitate cytoskeletal organization for sarcomerogenesis. A model was developed for the cytoskeleton of neonatal ventricular myocytes in relation to extracellular matrix cues. Numerical results and in vitro assays showed distinct cytoskeletal architectures arise from temporally-ordered processes: interaction between actin fibers, myofibrils, and focal adhesions, as well as cooperative bundling of nascent myofils. A hierarchy of mechanisms regulates contractile cytoskeleton self-organization, with a positive feedback loop initiating symmetry break, potentiated by extracellular conditions, polarizing contractile cytoskeleton.
Researchers investigated the invasive potential of Wolbachia, a symbiotic bacterium being trialed as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission, in Brazilian Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Wolia requires high maternal transmission rate, strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, and low host fitness costs to invade and spread within wild populations. However, differences in climate, field protocols, urbanization, and human density amongst deployment sites have limited comparison of Wolia's invasive potential. The study characterized the phenotypic effects of the Mel strain in Aedes aegi mosquitoes with Brazilian background to understand its invasive potential. Results showed Mel causes cytoplasm incompatibility, high maternal transmission rate, and no detrimental effect on host fecundity or fertility. To understand urban landscape effects on mosquito survival, mark-release experiments were conducted using Wolia-infected mosquitoes in Rio de Janeiro areas where Wolia will be deployed. Mosquito populations were characterized in relation to socio-demographic conditions at sites and future release areas. Mathematical models were constructed using laboratory and field data to describe urban conditions influencing Wolia infection reaching 100% following release. Invasion was predicted at all sites, with varying conditions between sites, influenced by local population size. Analysis of laboratory and field data showed Mel Wolia possesses characteristics to spread in urban-dem environments, including Eliminate Program sites.
Histone lysine methylation is a crucial epigenetic modification that regulates chromatin structure and gene expression. Histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation, existing in mono-, di-, or tri-methyl states, plays a significant role in gene expression involved in plant development and stress responses. However, the mechanism of this epigenetic modification is not fully understood. Researchers identified a Jmj domain-containing protein, JMJ703, as a histone lysine demethylase that reverses all forms of H3K4 in rice. Loss-of-function mutation of the gene affects stem elongation and growth, possibly due to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes in the mutant. Crystal structure analysis of the catalytic core (cMJ703) revealed similarity with mammalian and yeast JMJD proteins, H3 and H3 demethylases, but specific features were observed. Key residues interact with cofactors Fe(II) and N-oxylglycine and methylated H3K peptide were identified, essential for demethyl activity in vivo. Several residues conserved in H4 demethylases suggest involvement in H4 specificity.
HIV-1 capsid plays a crucial role in various steps of the viral life cycle, from reverse transcription to integration, and is targeted by multiple host and pharmacologic ligands. However, structural studies have focused on capsid monomers (CA), and the mechanism of ligand influence on infection is unclear. This study reveals a multi-subunit interface within hexamers mediates binding to cellular cofactors NUP and CPS6, competed by antiretroviral compounds PF74 and BI-2. Each ligand anchors via a phenylalanine-glycine (FG) motif to a pocket in the N-terminal domain of one monomer, with BI-2 also interacting across the N-terminal C-terminal (NTD) interface of a second monomer. Dissociation of hexamer into monomers prevents high affinity with CPS6 and PF, and abolishes NUP binding. The interface is conformationally dynamic, but N or CPS binding is accommodated by one conformation. N and CPS have overlapping sites, each making unique interactions, mutated selectively perturbing cofactor dependency. Results show multiple ligands share an interface in HIV-1 caps lost upon disassembly.
Researchers have improved the genome assembly of the Aedes aegypt, a mosquito species that transmits diseases such as dengue and yellow fever and chikunya viruses, by generating a genetic map of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in recombinant progeny from a cross between two strains. This map revealed a high rate of misassemblies in the current genome, with sequences from different chromosomes found on the same scaffold. The corrected assembly allowed assignment of 60% of the genome to chromosomes and ordering of scaffolds along chromosomes. Large regions of suppressed recombination were found around the centromeres, extending up to 47% of the chromosome. The new assembly was used to map a gene conferring resistance to the parasite Brugia malayi, and a list of candidate genes affecting the trait was generated.
Aedes aegypt, the primary vector of dengue chikunya and yellow fever viruses, is a key target for vector control in tropical countries. Traditional larval surveys remain the basis for most mosquito surveillance programs despite new trapping devices. A multicenter entomological study compared four traps (BG-Sent, Adultrap, MosquiAP, and ovitrap) with larval surveys in five cities representing tropical climates. Traps were applied to 1 km areas monthly, simultaneously with larval surveys. Positivity and density indices were calculated and regressed against meteorological variables to characterize mosquito infestation patterns. The House Index was low in most cities, with median 0, while traps produced indices, indicating greater sensitivity to Ae.egyti presence compared to larval. Trap indices plateaued at high densities, but both agreed on mosquito seasonality in all cities. Mosquito seasonality was associated with temperature, not precipitation, even in areas with small temperature variation. All traps outperformed the Index in measuring seasonal abundance and should be considered complements or alternatives to lar surveys. Choice between traps depends on cost and ease-of-use.
Human cytidine deaminase APOECG3 (AG) is a potent inhibitor of retroviruses and transposable elements, capable of deaminating cytidines to urines in single-stranded DNA replication intermediates. The protein contains two cytidine deaminase domains (CDAs), with only the C-terminal domain known to mediate deamination. The crystal structure of tetrameric APOEC2 revealed residues in AG that facilitate oligomerization. Yeast two-hybrid assays, coimmunprecipitation, and crosslinking showed tyrosine-124 and tryptan-127 in the enzymatically inactive N-terminal CDA mediate AG oligomer, coinciding with HIV-1 virion packaging. AG oligization is also RNA-dependent. Homology modeling AG onto A2 structure indicates a positive charge accumulation in a putative dimer interface. Substitution arginine residues 24, 30, and 136 in this pocket reduced virus inhibition, virion, and oligization. Oligomer-deficient AG associated less efficiently with cellular RNA.
Researchers have investigated the genetic factors contributing to quantitative variation in agriculturally, evolutionarily, and medically important traits in Drosophila melanogaster, a species with high levels of sequence variation and low linkage disequilibrium. They focused on the bric-br locus, which affects cuticular pigmentation, and identified polymorphisms that create major-effect quantitative trait loci (QTL) alleles. These polymorphisms are located in three functional regions: a promoter, tissue-specific enhancer, and Polycomb response element. Analysis of allele-specific expression at the br-br locus confirmed that these polymorphisms modulate transcription at the cis-regulatory level. The study demonstrates that a single QTL can act through a combination of multiple mechanisms, and variation in regions flanking experimentally validated functional elements can significantly impact transcriptional activity and phenotype.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, a leading cause of invasive mucosal disease in humans, has persisted despite antibiotic and vaccine use due to its ability to adapt through genetic exchange with surrounding microbes. DNA uptake and recombination is controlled by a regulated quorum sensing system triggered by extracellular accumulation of competence stimulating peptide (CSP). This study shows CSP stimulates production of diverse bacteriocins through increased secretion of bacteriocin pherom, BlC, requiring functional competence system. A conserved motif in BlC promoter mediates upregulation by CSP, leading to BlC accumulation and activation of entire locus. Biofilm-grown organisms demonstrate DNA exchange enhanced by bacterin secretion, suggesting co-stimulation provides adaptive advantage. Bl and regulatory pathways diverged in pneumoccus ancestor, yet maintain connection promoting competition and adaptation by targeting various competitors while allowing DNA incorporation.
Researchers investigated the role of cellular protein SR20 in poliovirus infection, focusing on its interaction with protein PC2, a known to be involved in viral translation. They found that SR20 localizes from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected neuroblastoma cells, where it partially co-localizes with PC2, corroborating previous in vitro data. SR20 is associated with PC2 bound to polirus RNA in infected cells, indicating interaction occurs on the RNA. A mutated version of SR20 lacking the RNA recognition motif (SR20ΔM) localizes similarly to full-length SR20 and co-localizes with PC2, but expression results in a 100-fold decrease in virus yield compared to wild-type SR20. These results support a model where SR20 interacts with PC2 bound to viral RNA, recruiting ribosomes in a direct or indirect manner with additional protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions.
Researchers conducted an N-ethyl-nitrosurea (ENU) mutagenesis screen to identify genes regulating neural crest (NC) development, a population of embryonic cells giving rise to glia, neurons, and melanocytes. The screen utilized a mouse model sensitized for NC defects, Sox10Lac/+. Out of 71 pedigrees analyzed, four heritable loci, modifier of Sox10 expression 1-4 (m1-4), were identified, showing altered NC patterning. Homozygous m1 embryos lacked Sox10ac expression in cranial ganglia, cranial nerves, and sympathetic chain, while other Sox-expressing cells remained unaffected. Linkage analysis, sequencing, and complement testing confirmed m1 as a new allele of receptor tyrosine kinase Erb3, Erb3m1, with a single amino acid substitution in extracellular region. The ENU mutation did not alter protein expression, but impaired ER3 signaling, causing embryonic defects in m1 resembling Er3 null alleles. Biochemical analysis showed ER3 on cell surface, but ligand-induced phosphorylation reduced by m mutation. The study highlights the importance of mutated residue for ER3 function and activation.
Researchers conducted a study in a rural Ugandan fishing community to investigate factors influencing Schistosoma mansoni infection, a parasitic flatworm causing schistosomiasis. The study aimed to determine the impact of age, sex, ethnicity, and IgE (immunoglobulin E) on susceptibility to reinfection after antiparasitic treatment. The study used a multi-disciplinary approach to account for environmental and behavioral heterogeneities in cercarial exposure. Results showed that ethnic and sex-related variations in S. mansoni reinfection were due to differences in cercarial exposure, not biological susceptibility. Age-related differences in reinfection were not explained by exposure, but linked to IgE and IgG responses to tegument antigen SmAL (formerly Sm22.6), associated with resistance to reinfection.
A study was conducted to investigate the correlation between the number of eggs per gram of feces (EPG) and the worm burden of Clonorchis sinensis in humans. A total of 60 residents, 50 egg-positive and 10-negative, in Sanche-gun, Korea, participated in the study from 2006-2009. Egg positivity in feces was diagnosed using the Kato-Katz method. After administration of prazantel, participants were purged with cathartics and adult worms collected from feces. EPG ranged from 0 to 65,544. Adult C. sin were collected from 17-positive cases, with numbers ranging from 1 to 114 per individual. A positive correlation between EPG and numbers was demonstrated (r= 0.681, P<0.001). Worm recovery rates were 9.7% in EPG 1-1,000 and 73.7% in EPG over 1,000. No worms were detected in egg-negative subjects. Maximum count per worm per day was estimated 3,770 in subject EPG 2,664 and 106 collected. The numbers of worms were significantly correlated with egg in Cloniasis. It is estimated that at least 110 are infected with EPG around 3,000 and productivity per day around 4,000.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to combat the emergence of antifungal drug resistance by harnessing synthetic lethal interactions in a model organism. Antifungal drug resistance is a growing concern, prompting the development of new therapeutics and combinatorial therapy. Current combinator therapies are based on drug mode of action and resistance mechanisms, limiting the number of targets. An unbiased genome-wide screen was conducted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing Candida glata P1 gain-of-function allele, which mediates fluconazole resistance in the human pathogen. Eighteen synthetically lethal S cerevisiae mutants were identified in expressing C glata P1. One mutant lacking histone acetylase G5 was further investigated. Deletion or drug inhibition of G5 caused lethal in C glata expressing P1 alleles. Moreover, deletion or drug inactivation of G5 inhibited emergence of fluazole-resistant glata isolates in evolution experiments. This study provides proof of concept that synthetically genetic screens can identify novel proteins therapeutically targeted, allowing effective treatment of drug-resistant infections.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of membrane structures and phosphoinositides during poliovirus (PV) multiplication. They observed that phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PIP) appears as vesicular clusters in infected cells. The study used two PV mutants, EG and GG, with aberrant proteolytic processing of the P3 precursor, which delays genome replication and assembly, to understand the formation of PV-induced membrous structures. In wild-type PV, PIP changes were detected as early as 30 minutes post-infection. PIP remodeling occurred in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride, a replication inhibitor, accompanied by membrane tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicular clusters formed in the perinuclear region at 3 hours post-infection, too late for replication. Delays in EG and GG PVs were similar to PIP remodeling, suggesting PIP as a genome-replication organel marker. GG failed to convert virus-induced tubules to vesicles, resulting in nearly 5-log reduction in virus production. Results indicate PV induces distinct membrous structures for replication (tubules) and assembly (ves clusters). The pace, spatiemporal dynamics, and efficiency of replication-to-assembly organel conversion may be set by P3 processing rate and capacity to yield 3 and 3 proteins.
Researchers developed a multi-step strategy to identify small compounds with trypanocidal activity from the ZINC database using ligand and target-based virtual screening. From 23 selected compounds, 12 non-peptide cruzain inhibitors with low micromolar affinity (3-60µM) through competitive inhibition were identified. The binding mode of cruzain inhibitor Neimed was confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Cruzain is a validated target for Chagas disease treatment and shares similarity with mammalian cathepsin L. Increased catheps L activity is linked to invasive properties and metastatic cancer, so cruz inhibitors were assayed against it, showing similar affinity (4-80µM) with poor selectivity for cruz. To select potent cruz inhibitors, structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies were conducted against T cruz-infected cells. Two compounds showed trypanidal activity. Using Neimed as precursor, SAR established the 2-acetamthiophene-3-carbox group essential for enzyme and parasite inhibition. The IC50 for Neimed against T. cruzi-infected cells was 10.6±0.1µM, 10-fold lower than benznidazole. Employing molecular simplification, a smaller compound (Neimed) with lig efficiency 0.33kcal mol-1atom-1 was highlighted as a non-peptide, non-covalent cruzain tryocidal candidate.
Researchers have developed two DNA-based vaccine formulations against yellow fever (YF) virus, a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical regions worldwide. The current attenuated YF vaccine generates long-lasting antibodies and T-cell responses, but can have rare, severe side effects. This study designed and evaluated two non-viral DNA antigens encoding the full-length envelope protein (pYFE) or full-length protein fused with lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-1 (LFE), aiming to divert antigen presentation through major histocompatibility complex compartments. The formulations were tested in C57/6 and BAL/c mice, corresponding to H2 and H2 backgrounds, respectively. Both induced strong T-cell responses against all epitopes generated by Y17 vaccine, with LFE performing best. Additionally, LFE stimulated high anti-Y neutralizing antibody titers comparable to 17 vaccine levels. Notably, LFE provided 100% protection against intracereally challenged mice. These results indicate LFE as a promising vaccine candidate for further development.
Vibrio cholera, the causative agent of cholera, relies on chitin utilization for persistence and horizontal gene transfer in marine environments. The chb operon encodes genes involved in chitin oligosaccharide chitobse uptake and catabolism. The sensor kinase ChiS regulates this locus, but downstream mechanisms of ChiS activation of ch operon expression are unclear. An unbiased transposon screen identified nucleoid protein SlmA as ch oper regulator. SlmA, a TetR family member, typically transcriptional repressor, was not previously implicated in regulation. In vitro, SlmA binds ch oper promoter; in vivo, this interaction is required for oper transcriptional activation and chob utilization. Mutations disrupting distinct SlmA functions show DNA-binding, not nucleoid occlusion, is critical for transcription activation. This study reveals SlmA as novel transcriptional regulator in V cholera, in addition to division licensing role.
Researchers have developed a nonlinear programming (NLP) framework for solving parameter estimation problems in dynamic biological systems modeling. These problems are computationally challenging due to highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations and numerous experimental data and parameters. The proposed framework utilizes cutting-edge tools that are computationally efficient, robust, and user-friendly. It employs a time-discretization approach: i) avoiding repetitive model simulations, ii) algebraic computation of model derivatives, and iii) computationally efficient interior point solvers exploiting sparse and structured algebra. This approach is demonstrated on synthetic gut microbiome models. An instance with 156 parameters, 144 equations, and 1704 data points is solved in under 3 minutes, whereas an off-the-shelf solution requires 7 hours. Large instances show the framework's scalability, solving 2352 parameters, 2304 equations, and 20352 data in under 15 minutes. The framework is flexible and user-friendly, applicable to various biological systems, enabling uncertainty quantification, observability diagnosis, model selection, and outlier handling.
A study was conducted to evaluate the use of the nCounter high-throughput gene expression system to understand West Nile virus (WNV) dissemination and the inflammatory response in the outbred Swiss Webster (SW) mouse model over the course of infection. Mice were intraperitoneally injected with NV and tissues (spleen, lung, liver, and brain) were analyzed for gene expression changes using the nCounter Inflammation gene kit, which contains 179 inflammation-related genes. Protein levels of a subset cytokine/chemokine genes were determined using multiplex detection (Biolex) and compared to RNA levels. Results showed that Ccl and Ilb were differentially expressed in all tested tissues except kidney. Stratification of infected (NV+) versus non-infected (−) tissues allowed differentiation of systemic gene response from tissue-specific responses arising from NV infection. Significant decrease in C was found in− spleen, while Il was upregulated, Il was downregulated in− lung, and M were downregulated in− liver. In NV+ livers, Stat, T2, chemines Ccl, C, C, C, C, Il, Il, Il, and Il were upregulated. In− tissues, C and C were upregulated. Gene and protein kinetics for C, C, C, C, and C correlated with presence of virus. The study demonstrated the utility of nCounter for rapid identification of gene changes in mice with NV infection.
In 2014, an outbreak of rabies occurred in Maputo and Matola cities, Mozambique, prompting an investigation into the epidemiology, clinical features, and risk factors of human and animal rabies bites. From April to July 2014, 14 cases of human rabies were reported in Maputo (n=10), Matola (n=3), and Boane (n=1), all with a history of recent dog bites. Only one of the 14 rabid dogs was immunized. A total of 819 animal bites were registered, with 64.6% (529/819) from Maputo and 97.8% (801/819) attributed to dogs, of which 27.0% (126/467) were immunized. Factors associated with human rabies included age <15 years, bites by stray dogs, deep wounds, bites to the head, by unimmun dogs, lack of soap and water use, and post-exposure prophylaxis. In Map and Matola, control measures for rabies were poor, with cases strongly associated with bites by stray and unacc dogs and irregular post-ex measures.
Researchers identified a new gene, SCN9, encoding Nav1.7, associated with febrile seizures (FS) in a large Utah family linked to chromosome 2q24. A mutation in a conserved amino acid, p.NY641, in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II was found in 21 affected members, but not in ethnically matched controls. The mutation was introduced into the murine Sc9 ortholog using homologous recombination, resulting in reduced thresholds for electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures and increased corneal kindling rates in homozygous Sc9NY/NY mice. This supports SCN9 p.NY as disease-causing in this family. SCN9 was also analyzed in 92 unrelated FS patients, revealing highly cons Nav.7 missense variants in 5%. One child with FS later developed Drav syndrome, and SCN1 was sequenced, revealing a heterozygous frameshift. Subsequent analysis of 109 Drav patients yielded Nav.7 missense in 8%, in conserved amino acids. Six Drav patients with SCN miss variants had either miss or site SCN1 mutations, while three had no SCN mutations.
Researchers have long sought to understand how complex tissue shapes arise through growth, particularly when growth occurs preferentially along specific orientations, raising the question of how these orientations are specified. Two theories propose that orientations are either specified by stresses in the tissue's axial system or molecular polarity system. The axial system has been explored through computational modeling, while the polarity system is less understood. This study develops a polarity-based system, the Growing Polarised Tissue (GPT) framework, treating tissue as a continuous material with regionally expressed factors interacting under genetic control. Polarity is established by signals propagating through the tissue, anchored in regions termed polarity organisers under genetic control. Growth rates parallel or perpendicular to polarity are specified through a regulatory network. Resulting growth depends on specified patterns within mechanical constraints. This leads to emergence of features not specified by regulatory networks. Growth influences spatial arrangements and orientations, allowing complex shapes from simple. Asymmetries emerge through polarity interactions. The GPT framework is applied to a growing Snapdragon, illustrating hypotheses testable by simulation. Combinatorial interactions between orientations and growth, key in polarity systems, have been exploited to generate observed shapes.
Researchers investigated the consequences of interference between multiple CD8+ T cell escape mutations in early HIV infection. During HIV infection, CD8+ T cell responses are elicited simultaneously, exerting selective pressure on different parts of the virus's genome, leading to mutations that escape recognition and are beneficial to the virus. Some studies show that later escape mutations emerge, the slower they go to fixation. This pattern of escape rate decrease (ER) can arise from distinct mechanisms, particularly in populations with high mutation rates among strains, resulting in delayed fixation times of beneficial mutations compared to sexual reproduction. 

A multi-locus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination was developed as a null model for interference. An interference-free model assuming neutral evolution before immune elicitation was also derived. Interference between equally advantageous mutations generated the ER pattern. Number of loci and recombination rates affected ER, explained by exponential decline of escape rates over time. ER in HIV individuals was consistent with both interference-free and interference effects. Interference effects should be considered when analyzing escape mutations. Estimating escape and selective coefficients by interference cannot be overcome by sampling sizes due to estimation shortcomings under interference regimes. Accounting for competition between mutations demands novel methodologies based on strains rather than frequencies.
Researchers have developed a multiscale model to quantify the in vivo antitumor efficacy of cisplatin-based double therapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCL) patients. The 5-year survival rate for advanced NSCL patients can be as low as 1%. Preoperative chemotherapy is crucial to eliminate micrometasis and improve operability. In silico experiments suggest optimal treatment protocols based on patient-specific data. A reliable predictions require a prior estimation of drugs' cytotoxicity on cancer cells. A mechanistic model of cancer response to treatment was applied to estimate cell efficacy of cisatin-based regimens. The model incorporates mechanisms of uncontrolled proliferation, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and resistance. Methodology uses tumor volumetric data at two points before and during treatment, accounting for microenvironment and repulation effects. Sensitivity analysis established growth rate and fraction as key features for accurate estimates. The methodology was applied to 13 NSCL patients receiving cisatin with gemcitab, vinlb, or docax in neoadjuvant context. Input values were guided by literature on cancer kinetics. Latin hyper sampling compensated for patient uncertainties. The work provides a framework for estimating in vivo cell killing of chemotherapies. Correlation with molecular profiles could serve as basis for personalized predictions.
Bacterial biofilms exhibit high levels of antibiotic tolerance, a phenomenon distinct from well-characterized inherited resistance mechanisms. The physiological heterogeneity of biofilms leads to the formation of specialized subpopulations that may be more tolerant to antibiotics. Researchers used transposon mutagenesis to identify biofilm-specific mutants in Escherichia coli and found that starved biofilms showed greater tolerance to fluoroquinoloneloxacin than planktonic counterparts. Amino acid auxotrophic mutants demonstrated that biofilm tolerance was dependent on SOS response to amino acid and carbon source, and partially on stringent response leucine starvation. Biofilm tolerance did not involve SOS toxin-antitoxin systems associated with tolerant persisters. Fluoroquinoloxacin tolerance increased with biofilm age, dependent on SOS response. The study shows SOS response in nutrient-deprived biofilm microenvironments is a mechanism for bio-specific tolerance to fluoroquinoloxacin.
Researchers have identified cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a crucial regulator of Plasmodium falciparum meroite invasion of human erythrocytes. The invasion of erythrocytes by P. falciparumeroites requires specific interactions between host and parasite ligands localized in apical organelles called micronemes. The study found that exposure of meroites to a low potassium environment, typical of blood plasma, activates a bicarbonate-sensitive cytoplasmic adenyly cyclase, raising cytosolic AMP levels and activating protein kinase, which regulates micron secretion. Additionally, cAMP was shown to regulate meroite cytosolic calcium levels via an Ep pathway, and increases in both c and Ca2 were found to be essential for micron secretion.
Strongyloides stercoris, a soil-transmitted threadworm, is one of the most neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). A review of 20 years of studies on S. stercis global prevalence in populations and risk groups was conducted. A literature search of PubMed articles from January 1989 to October 2011 was performed, including studies on infection prevalence. A Bayesian analysis was carried out to obtain country-specific estimates and compare disease ratios in risk groups, accounting for diagnostic sensitivities. 354 studies from 78 countries were included, with 62.4% community-based, 34.2% hospital-based, and 11% refugee/immigrant studies. World maps with country data are provided. In Africa, Asia, and South America, resource-poor countries, S. stis information is lacking. Meta-analysis showed association between HIV/alcoholism and S. stis (OR:2.17, CI:1.18-4.01; OR:6.69, CI:1.47-3.38). Findings show high prevalence in selected countries and regions. S. stis is prominent in risk groups. Adequate information is lacking from many countries.
Researchers have investigated the role of stochastic noise in circadian rhythms, specifically how it influences cell-autonomous oscillations and entrainment to external cues. However, few studies have examined the impact of clock perturbations on stochastic noise due to the difficulty in measuring cell-autonomous noise directly. This study proposes using population-level bioluminescence recordings as a measure of stochastic noise, applicable to high-throughput circadian screens. Using fibroblast data, it is shown that higher single-cell noise results in faster population damping, and that damping can be changed dose-dependently by small molecule modulators. A mathematical model explains this change at the single-cell level. The method is applied to a genome-wide siRNA screen, revealing stochastic altered independently of period and phase. The unperturbed clock is hypothesized to be optimized for robust rhythms, with few perturbations capable of increasing amplitude and lowering noise simultaneously. The study highlights the importance of considering circadian perturbations on stochastic, particularly for small-molecule therapeutics development.
Researchers have identified the bacterial protein Fts as a promising target for developing new antibiotics to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The protein is essential for bacterial cell division, and its inhibitor PC723 has shown activity against Staphylococcus aureus in vitro and in vivo. However, its mechanism of action and effect on other bacterial species is unclear. This study examined the binding pocket of PC723 using Pocket, a method that scores similarity between small-molecule binding sites based on 3D structure and molecular dynamics. Results showed species and nucleotide state significantly impact binding site properties, with disparate environments for non-Staphlococcus species. Pocket analysis of S aureus bound to GTP with resistance mutations predicted PC723 prefers Staphlocus in nucleotide state. Simulations of FZ dimer indicated polymerization enhances PC723 binding. These findings demonstrate binding can vary across species, genetic variations, and polymer states, informing FZ inhibitor development.
Researchers have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic core (NTD) and catalytic core (CCD) domains of HIV-1 integrase (IN) in complex with the binding domain (BD) of lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF), also known as PC4 and SFR1 interacting protein 1 (PS1) transcriptional coactivator 75. This structure extends the known IN-LED interface, revealing primarily charge interactions between the NT of IN and BD. A constellation of acidic residues on NT is characteristic of lentiviral IN, and mutations of positively charged residues on BD affect interaction with lentiviral IN tested. The novel NT-BD contacts are critical for stimulation of lentiviral DNA integration by LED in vitro and during early steps of HIV-1 replication. A mutant HIV-1 IN was engineered to function only with complementary LED mutant. The findings provide structural basis for lentiviral IN-LED interaction and enable development of LED-based targeting for gene therapy.
Research on the evolution and phenotypic selection of cancer cells has revealed that the intrinsic kinetics of cells in different organs dictate their behavior, which is inherited by cancer cells and determines initial tumor progression dynamics. Genetic and epigenetic alterations can change cell kinetics, leading to favorable alterations that increase cellular fitness and accelerate tumor progression. A cellular automaton model was developed to track the evolution of the malignant subpopulation of cancer stem cells (CSCC), which exclusively initiate and sustain tumors. Traits explored include cell migration, invasion, spontaneous death due to genetic mutations, symmetric stem cell division, and telomere erosion. The study found that proliferation is the strongest modulator of growth, with increased potential yielding larger non-stem cancer cells that compete with CSC, inhibiting division, while reduced proliferation loosens inhibition and facilitates CSC division. The CSC subpopulation becomes heterogeneous, dictating population dynamics varying from dormancy to progression. Clonal diversity in single biopsies represents a small proportion of total phenotypes.
Researchers investigated the emergence of novel zoonotic infectious diseases in humans, which appear as sporadic and spatially and temporally restricted outbreaks, such as influenza A(H1N). They used mathematical models to describe adaptation scenarios with spatial heterogeneity within the human population, focusing on the probability of emergence and waiting time for a successful event. Analytical expressions were derived for the probability of introduction and waiting time to emergence, as well as statistical properties of emergence, including outbreak size distribution. The results were compared to a stochastic model previously studied computationally. Spatial heterogeneity was found to have a weak effect on outbreak size and emergence risk for typical connection strengths between communities. For example, a village connected to a city by 10 commuters a day is effectively part of the city for emergence and outbreak distribution. Empirical data on commuting patterns showed most communities are at least this interconnected. Spatial effects are likely dominated by host biology adaptation for plausible ranges. Implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections were discussed.
Influenza A Virus Migration and Persistence in North American Wild Birds

Wild birds have been linked to the emergence of human and livestock influenza. However, predicting the spread and emergence of disease, as well as formulating preparedness plans, have been hindered by a lack of knowledge of viral movement between host populations. The patterns of spread and risk posed by wild viruses remain unpredictable. This study analyzed genomic data, including 287 newly sequenced avian influenza A (A) virus samples over a 34-year period of continuous surveillance of North American migratory birds. A Bayesian statistical framework was used to test hypotheses of viral migration, population, and genetic reassortment patterns. Results showed that despite high prevalence of Charadriiform in Delaware host, this population did not significantly contribute to North American A diversity. In contrast, Anseriform viruses in Alberta represented A diversity in North Anser. A may be restricted to migratory flyways over short time, but large-scale analysis showed long-term persistence independent of birdways with migration throughout North America. Long-term surveillance provided insights for predictive models of pandemic preparedness and livestock protection.
Researchers have developed a novel monoclonal antibody, MAb S/1391, that targets a common antigen site on the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A viruses. This antibody shows heterosubic cross-reactivity, meaning it can neutralize and inhibit multiple subtypes of influenza A viruses, including H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13. In enzyme-linked immunosorb assays, MAb S/1 showed broad reactivity to these subtypes. The antibody also demonstrated neutralization and hemagglination-inhibition activities against specific strains of H1, H, H, and H subtypes of influenza viruses. Mutant viruses that escaped neutralization by MAb/1 were selected from Aichi/68 (H2), AAd/57 (2), and A/33 (1) strains, and sequence analysis revealed amino acid substitutions at positions 156, 158, and 193. Molecular modeling showed these amino acids are located on the globular head of HA, forming a conformational epitope adjacent to the receptor-binding domain. Passive immunization of mice with M/1 provided heterosubic protection. This study demonstrates M/ binds a common antigen shared among HA subtypes and neutralizes infectivity in vitro and in vivo by affecting attachment to cells.
A three-year cohort study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin in controlling Strongyloides stercoral infection in an Australian Aboriginal population. The study involved 259 adults living in a remote community in northern Australia, where the initial prevalence of S. stercis was 35.3%. Participants were diagnosed using a commercial ELISA test with a lower threshold than the recommended, and treated with iverectin. Follow-up was conducted at 6 months and 3 years post-treatment. The results showed that iverectin was highly effective in reducing the prevalence of S. stis, from 35.3% to 5.8% (McNem's chi2 = 56.5, p<0.001). The use of a lower ELISA threshold for treatment was also validated in this setting. However, a small group of subjects remained persistently positive on ELISA despite treatment. The study suggests that control of S. stis in this cohort is feasible through pharmacological treatment alone.
Prion diseases are caused by misfolded isoforms of the prion protein, PrP, which are hypothesized to be encoded by strain-specific conformations of PrP. Prions can interfere with each other, with long-incubation (blocking) strains inhibiting the conversion of short-incation (non-blocking) strains. However, it is unknown if long-incation strains can interfere with each other. This study investigated co-infection of animals with combinations of longation strains and found no evidence of interference. To exclude the possibility that inability to interfere in vivo was due to failure to infect common neurons, protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain (PMCA) was used. Consistent with animal studies, PMCA indicated co-infecting strains amplified independently, suggesting lack of interference not due to failure to target same cells, but inherent property of strains. PM reactions seeded with longation contained higher levels of Pr compared to seeded with shortation. Mechanistically, abundance of Pr not limiting in vivo or vitro in strains with low conversion to amplify independently.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive model to compare the roles of ordered and disordered protein regions in alloster regulation. Intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDRs) are common in alloster regulation, and it was previously thought that disorder maximized alloster coupling. The model reveals that the Monod-Wy-Wyman-Change (MWC) pathway, which involves an order-to-disorder transition, has a higher probability of alloster effect than the Adiabatic Mean field (AM) pathway, which involves disorder-to-order transition. This suggests a complex role of IDRs in regulatory proteins. An analytical formula for maximal alloster coupling is derived, showing that stable or unstable states are unfavorable for alloster, aiding in alloster drug design.
Researchers have investigated the role of β-caten in prostate cancer development and progression. Prostate cancer is a leading cause of death in Western men, but few genetic alterations driving its initiation and progression have been identified. β-caten is crucial for developmental processes and implicated in tumorigenesis in various tissues, including prostate. However, studies on human cancer samples are unclear on its role. In vivo studies in embryo and adult were conducted to understand β-caten's role in normal and neoplastic prostate. Gene deletion revealed that epithelial βaten is required for embryonic prostate growth and branching, but dispensable in adult. During development, βaten controls number of progenitors in epithelial buds and regulates genes, including c-Myc and Nk3.1. Deletion βaten in Pten model of castration-resistant cancer showed it dispensable for progression. Complementary overexpression, in vivo protein stabilization showed βaten promotes squamous epith during development, absence androgens. βaten overexpression with Pten drove invasive carcinoma with squamous metaplas. Studies demonstrate βaten essential for prostate and inherent high levels in epithelia drive squamous differentiation. Additionally, βaten overexpression promotes cancer in clinically relevant model. These data provide pathways to lethal disease in humans.
Researchers conducted a study to explore the factors influencing informed consent in a biomedical research setting in a low-income country with high disease burden. The study focused on a family-based genetic study among people with podoiosis (non-filar elephantiasis) in southern Ethiopia, adapting a rapid assessment method validated in The Gambia. The qualitative methodology involved focus group discussions and in-depth interviews with podoiosis patients, non-patients, community workers, researchers, NGO staff, and community leaders. The study found that the use of everyday language, addressing participants' expectations, and information presentation techniques significantly impacted comprehension of research information. Approaching podo patients via trusted individuals and preceding community sensitization were optimal communication methods. Poverty, absence of treatment facilities, and participants' trust in the NGO hindered genuine consent. The study suggests that researchers should evaluate consent processes to provide comprehensible information and support decision-making on a study-by-study basis.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of T lymphocyte proliferation in the thymus and spleen of mice to understand the impact of genetics and aging on the immune system. They used single-cell multicolor flow cytometry to analyze the incorporation of thymidine analogue during pulse-chase-pulse experiments in vivo and DNA content. A mathematical model based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) simulated the evolution of single cell behavior during various durations of labeling, allowing data fitting and estimation of proliferation rates and cell cycle durations in subpopulations. The model was validated with other pulse-chase experiments. Results showed T cell proliferation is heterogeneous with a specific signature depending on genetic origins, cell stages in thym and sple, and altered with age. The model inferred proliferation and cell phase durations from 5-ethyl-2-deoxyuridine (EdU) data, revealing cell heterogeneity and specific signatures.
Researchers have identified a mitochondrial tRNA mutation in mice that recapitulates the molecular hallmarks of a disease-causing mutations in humans. The mutation, an m.373G>A in the mt-tRNA gene, affects the tRNA's ability to be charged with isoleucine, leading to abnormal folding. This is similar to a human mutation, m.429T>C in the mt-t gene, which causes disease. The researchers found that cells with the mouse or human mutant tRNA have increased mitochondrial biogenesis and ROS production as a compensatory response. They propose that the pathogenic mechanism and compensatory mechanism explain the mutation's penetrance. This allows for the evolution of tRNAs where two deleterious alleles can be fixed in two steps, not requiring simultaneous mutation of both.
In mammals, dosage compensation is achieved by doubling the expression of X-linked genes in both sexes, with X-inactivation in females. The regulation of the active X chromosome may be controlled by DNA-based or epigenetic mechanisms that double X output in response to autosomal factors. To determine if X expression depends on ploidy, X-linked and autosomal gene expression was compared in human triploid cells using arrays. The X:autosome ratio was 1 in diploid cells, but lower (0.81-0.84) in triploid with one X and higher (1.32-1.4) in triploid with two X's. X-linked expression in triploid does not respond to autosomal nor achieve balance. Unbalanced X:aut ratios may contribute to triploidy phenotypes. Autosomal levels per gene were similar triploid diploid, indicating no autosomal effect. Triploid with two X data support doubling X expression. However, triploid single X expression adjusted presumably by epigen that senses X:autos ratio. This may act subset genes expression relation autosomal critical. A range X expression relation ploidy was found, and subset (~7%) had levels proportional autos.
The dN/d ratio, a measure of evolutionary pressures on proteins, was originally developed for distantly diverged sequences. However, it is often applied to single population samples, where differences represent segregating polymorphisms. This study examines the expected dN/d ratio in a single population under selection and finds it is insensitive to the selection coefficient. The hallmark of positive selection, dN/d>1, is violated within a population. The relationship between selection and d/d is not monotonic, making it impossible to infer pressures from d/d. This has implications for interpreting d/d in population-genetic samples.
Researchers investigated the impact of natural selection on genetic divergence between species, focusing on both closely and distantly related species. Studies have shown that genetic diversity within species is reduced at sites under selection, but its effect on inter-species divergence is unclear. This study examined whether selection affects divergence between closely and distantly related species. Results showed that divergence between closely related species, such as humans and primates, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively with recombination rate. Divergence between distantly related species, such as humans and rodents, is negatively correlated with functional and positively with background selection estimates from primates. These patterns persist after accounting for confounding factors. Coalescent models indicate that background selection in the ancestral population can explain a large proportion of variance in divergence, even with small ancestral polymorphism contribution. Findings reveal that selection indirectly affects divergence between closely and distantly related species, contrary to previous intuition. Purifying selection may drive some patterns, but would require more of the genome under selection than believed. This work has implications for understanding genomes and interpreting genetic variation.
Researchers have investigated the role of the CK2 kinase in the regulation of the Drosila circadian clock. Phosphorylation is a key mechanism for regulating protein stability and activity in circadian clocks, influencing the speed and strength of molecular oscillations through transcriptional activators and repressors in negative feedback loops. In Dila, CK phosphorylates and destabilizes the PER and TIMELESS proteins, inhibiting CLOCK transcription activity. This study reveals CK also targets CLOCK directly, downregulating its activity. Downregulating the catalytic subunit of CK induces CLOCK degradation, even in the absence of PER and TIME. Unexpectedly, the regulatory subunit of the CK holoenzyme is not required for CLOCK regulation. Downregulation of CK activity decreases CLOCK phosphorylation and increases PER and TIME transcription. These results indicate CK inhibits CLOCK degradation while reducing activity. Since CK promotes CLOCK degradation, CLOCK stability and transcription activity result from counteracting effects of CK and CK.
Researchers investigated the role of cruzain, a cysteine peptidase, in the interaction between Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, and its invertebrate host Rhodnius prolix midut. They treated T cruzi epastigotes with anti-cruain antibodies and a panel of cystine peid inhibitors, cystatin, antain, E-64, leupept, iodetamide, and CA-074-OM, and measured adhesion to R. prolix midut ex vivo. All treatments, except CA-OM, decreased adhesion, with cystatin showing a dose-dependent reduction. Comparison of adhesion among T cruz isolates revealed isolate G, with low active cruzain, adhered less than D28 and CLner. Transgenic epastotes overexpressing endogenous cruzain inhibitor, pAG, chasin, had reduced activeain and adhered 73 less than wild-type. Adhesion pAG was partially restored by exogenousain. In vivo colonization, pAG parasites had lower levels than wild after passage in insect showed drastic increase in surfaceain expression.
Cytoplasmic dyne is a microtubule-dependent protein that plays a crucial role in mitotic processes, including centrosome separation, metaphase chromosome congression, anaphase elongation, and chromosome segregation, as well as interphase vesicle transport and organel positioning. Despite its importance, the mechanisms regulating this microtub motor are not well understood. A Caenorhabditis elegans cytoplasm dyin heavy chain mutants were screened with a genome-wide RNA interference library to identify dyin-specific suppressors. Twenty genes were isolated that suppress dyin mutants but not other conditional loci, twelve of which exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when reduced in wild-type. Many suppressors, including dyin light chains, localize to subcellular sites with dyin heavy chain. Knocking down four putative dyin accessory chains suppresses heavy mutants, suggesting some chains regulate heavy function. Twenty-nine additional genes, when reduced, suppress not only dyin but also unrelated loci, were identified. These results indicate conserved non-essential genes contribute dyin during mitosis.
In the ciliate Paramecium tetra, programmed genome rearrangements (PGR) occur during somatic differentiation, where DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) drive the process. The germline nucleus is transmitted to the progeny, while the somatic nucleus, essential for gene expression, is destroyed and a new somatic nucleus differentiates from a copy of the germline. In Paramecium tetra, the somatic nucleus development involves massive GR, including the elimination of at least 45,000 germl sequences (Internal Eliminated Sequences, IES). I excision proceeds through a cut-and-close mechanism: domestic transposase PigMac is essential for DNA cleavage and DSB at excision involves Ligase IV, a component of non-homous endjoining (NHE) pathway. A huge number of programmed DSB must be repaired during this process to assemble functional somatic chromosomes. To understand DNA cleavage and DSB coordination during GR, Ku, the actor of HE-mediated repair, was focused on. Two Ku70 and Ku80 paralogs are encoded in P genome: tetra Ku70 and Ku80 are produced during sexual and localize in new somatic nucleus. RNA interference shows Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer essential for somatic recovery. PigMac-dependent cleavage abolished at IES in Ku80 depleted, resulting IES retention somatic genome. PigMac and Ku70/K80 co-pur complex overproduced heterologous system.
Researchers investigated the early mechanisms of pathology in prion disease by analyzing the transcriptional dynamics of hippocampal CA1 neurons in infected mice. The study found that gene expression in these neurons is dynamic and characterized by distinct phases, with a major cluster of genes altered preclinically returning to basal levels or reversing during clinical disease. This cluster contains a signature of N-methyl-aspart acid (NMDA) receptor signaling and activation of neuroprotective pathways. Genes involved in neuronal projection and dendrite development were also altered, leading to a decline in synaptic protein expression. Deregulated microRNAs such as mi-132, mi-124, mi-16, mi-26, mi-29, and mi-140 followed similar expression patterns. This study provides the first in-depth look at preclinical response of hippocal neurons to prion replication. Findings suggest prion stimulates a programmed response, mediated by NMD receptor activity promoting cell survival and neurite remodeling, but terminated before clinical onset in hippocampus, indicating a critical juncture.
Researchers have developed a computational model, known as the Petri model, to simulate the development of granulomas in mice infected with Leishmania donani, a protozoan parasite that causes visceral leishmaniasis. Granulomas are focal accumulations of inflammatory cells in the liver where the parasite is eventually eliminated. The model was validated with data from experimental studies in mice and assessed for robustness through sensitivity analysis. The model accurately represented the progression of disease and changes in granoma composition over time. In silico experiments revealed a previously unknown level of granuloma diversity in anti-lemanial activity. Simulations of IL-10 deficiency in lymphoid and myeloid cells suggested a dominant regulatory role of IL-10 produced by Kupffer cells at the granoma core.
A computational model of transcriptional regulation is proposed, treating the transcriptional machinery as a device with transcription factors as inputs and expression as output. The model is parameterized to approximate arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, equality, and inequality. These approximations depend on parameter sets and are tunable. Networks of arithmetic genes can be combined to perform more complex computations, demonstrated by simulating a network detecting time-vary signal elevations. Analytic functions can be approximated by allowing multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter.
Chikungunya virus (CHV), an RNA virus from the Togaviridae family, is transmitted by mosquitoes in both sylvatic and urban cycles and causes Chikunya fever (CHF), a febrile illness associated with debilitating outcomes. CHV was introduced to Brazil in 2014 through two independent introductions: the Asian/ibbean genotype through the North and the ECSA genotype through the Northeast. Following introduction, both genotypes established urban cycles among naive populations, causing outbreaks in the Americas. This study sequenced CHV genomes from a recent outbreak in Northeast Brazil using an in-house Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) protocol, detecting multiple CHV genotypes from clinical samples. Results show both Asian/ibbean and ECSA genotypes expanded, cocirculating in Northeast Brazil. Additionally, NG data supports simultaneous infection by these genotypes, suggesting coinfection may be more common in highly endemic areas.
The study investigates the regulation of horizontally acquired DNA by the bacterial modulator HNS, which plays a crucial role in bacterial colonization of various niches, including the human host. HNS targets both core and horizontally acquired (HGT) genes, silencing their expression in response to external stimuli such as osmolarity and temperature. The research reveals that HNS differentially modulates core and GT DNA, with the plasmid R27-encoded HNS protein selectively silencing GT genes without interfering with core regulation. In contrast, chromosomal HNS requires a helper protein, Hha, to silence GT DNA, while core genes are modulated by H homodimers. The presence of H-like proteins is restricted to Enterobacteriaceae, and conjugative plids encoding HNS variants have been isolated only from this family. The HNS system in Enterobacteria presents unique features. The ability to selectively discriminate between core and GT DNA may maintain horizontally transmitted DNA silent, giving bacteria a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments, including host colonization.
Comparative profiling of Leishmania modulation in gene expression between species and host backgrounds has revealed conserved gene content and synteny across the genus, with only a small number of genes differentially distributed between species. Genome sequencing of L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis identified these differentially distributed genes, but it was unknown if they were expressed in disease-promoting intracellular amastigotes or conserved between species. Customized oligonucleotide microarrays confirmed all differentially distributed genes were expressed in intracellular amastotes, with few regulated at the RNA level. A large-scale gene expression study in L. brazensis showed ∼9% of genes regulated RNA during its life cycle, consistent with other Leish species. Comparing amigote expression between species confirmed Leish transcriptomes undergo little regulation, identifying conserved genes differently regulated between species in host. Host influence on parasite expression was investigated by comparing RNA profiles in L. amastigotes from wild-type (BAL/c) or immunocompromised (Rag−/−γ−) mice. Dissemination from site was enhanced in Rag−−γ− background, but RNA profiles unperturbed. These findings support Leish amigotes adapted for intracellular survival, undergoing little modulation at RNA level. Species-specific virulence and pathogenic factors may be limited to differentially distributed or regulated conserved genes, subject translational/postlational controls.
Researchers have developed a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay, named LPhimerus, for detecting Amphimeris DNA in human stool samples. Amphimer is a fish-borne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimer spp, which has been reported as endemic in the Pacific coast of Ecuador with high prevalence in humans and animals. Current diagnosis relies on stool examination to identify parasite eggs, but lacks sensitivity, and morphology may be confused with other liver and intestinal flukes. No immunological or molecular methods have been developed for specific detection of Amphimer spp in clinical samples. A Limer targeting sequence of Amphimer internal transcribed spacer 2 region was designed. DNA from adult worms recovered animals was used to optimize molecular assays. Conventional PCR was performed with primers F3 to verify amplification of Amphimer target sequence. LAMP was optimized with different mixtures and temperatures, set as Limer. Sensitivity and specificity of PCR and LAMP were evaluated. Detection limit was 1 pg genomic DNA. Field testing was done with 44 stool samples from endemic areas. 25 were microscopy positive for Amphimer eggs. Molecular testing F3 was ineffective with DNA fecal samples. Parameters for sensitivity and specificity were calculated for Limer assay, 76.67% and 80.77%, respectively. A specific and sensitive LAMP for Amphimer in stool was developed, named Limer, with potential for field diagnosis and surveillance in areas.
Researchers have identified a novel role for the SNARE protein Ykt in autophagosome-lysosome fusion in Drosophila. Unlike the previously known SNARE Syntax17, Ykt forms a complex with Snap29 and Vamp7 to facilitate autophag-lysosome fusion through interactions with the tethering complex HOPS. Unexpectedly, loss of Ykt leads to a large accumulation of autophagosomes that cannot fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes. The absence of Sy5, Ykt's partner in ER-Gol trafficking, does not prevent autys formation, indicating a direct role for Ykt in fusion. Ykt localizes to lysosomes and autys, forming a SN complex with Sy17 and Snap. V7 can outcompete Ykt from this complex, and overexpression of V7 rescues the fusion defect in Y6 loss-of-function cells. A mutant Y6 with an R amino acid change in its transmembrane domain retains normal autagic activity and restores viability, unlike palmitoylation or farnesylation mutants. Both Y6 and V7 are required for autag-lys fusion and are mutually exclusive subunits in Sy17-Snap complex, suggesting V7 is directly involved in membrane fusion and Y acts as a non-conventional SNARE in this process.
Haemophilus influenza (NTH) is a common inhabitant of the human nasopharyngeal mucosa, but can cause opportunistic infections in the upper and lower respiratory tracts. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) play a crucial role in host defense against bacterial infections. NTH's virulence is partly due to its ability to evade bactericidal effects of host-derived AMPs. The Sap (sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides) transporter enables NTH to resist AMP, but the underlying mechanism was unknown. Previous research showed periplasmic protein Sap bound AMP and was required for NTH virulence in vivo. This study aimed to elucidate Sap's role in AMP resistance. Antibody-mediated neutralization of AMP in vivo showed Sap directly counteracts AMP lethality during NTH infection. It was hypothesized Sap delivers AMP to the inner membrane for transport into cytoplasm. AMPs localized to NTH cytoplasm were susceptible to cytoplasmic peptase activity. In contrast, AMP accumulated in periplasm of bacteria lacking functional Sap complex. These data support Sap-mediated AMP import, a novel strategy to reduce periplasm and inner membrane accumulation of host peptides.
Researchers investigated the role of degradation in regulating the activity of MarA, a transcription factor that controls stress response genes in E. coli. coli. MarA has a short half-life compared to other proteins, and its degradation is mediated by the protease Clp. To understand the impact of degradation on Mar's activity, the researchers used CRISPR to knockdown Clp and engineered Mar to be resistant to degradation. Results showed that degradation affects both the rate and maximum of Mar's downstream targets can achieve. In the context of multi-gene regulation, a trade-off between these properties was observed, indicating that perfect fidelity and instantaneous coordination cannot coexist.
Researchers investigated the impact of MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MK-2) deficiency on the immune response to Leishmania major infection in C57BL/6 mice. In a previous study, MK-2 deficient mice were found to be more susceptible to infection due to elevated Arginase-1 and reduced iNOS activity in macrophages and diminished TH1 response. However, in this study, MK-2 deficient mice showed a similar healing response to wild-type mice in terms of lesion size and parasite numbers after infection. Analysis of immune responses revealed reduced TH1 response in MK- mice with lower parasite specific IgG2 levels, lower frequency of IF-γ and TN-α producing CD4 and CD8 T cells, and lower stimulated spleen IFγ production compared to wild-type. Notably, MK- mice also had reduced IL-4 production in spleen and lymph node cells and parasite-specific IgG in serum, indicating general cell hypo-responsiveness. The TH1/TH balance was unaltered in MK mice compared to wild-type. Despite MK macrophages being more permissive to L growth due to reduced iN and increased Argase-1, L/IFNγ activation was effective in controlling parasite in both MK and wild-type macroages. Consequently, no change in disease phenotype was observed in MK mice.
The mammalian pancreas is a branched organ that exhibits non-stereotypic branching patterns, unlike most glands. Its ductal network undergoes a transformation from unconnected micromicules to a mesh of interconnected ducts and finally to a treelike structure. This ductal remodeling is poorly understood, both microscopically and macroscopically. Researchers investigated the network properties at different developmental stages and found that the pancreas exhibits stereotyp traits at each stage, with network properties changing over time to optimize exocrine product delivery to the duodenum. In silico modeling showed that pancreatic development can be deconstructed into two conserved rules applicable to other glands. The early network is characterized by noisy, redundant connections as micromules form. The transition is attributed to network pruning based on fluid flux through the pancreas to duod.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive study to understand the structural and dynamic features of kines motor proteins, which drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformation changes that mediate movement along microtubules. They analyzed 114 experimental structures and used conventional and accelerated molecular simulations to map the dynamics of the kines motor domain. Three distinct conformation clusters were identified: ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5-inhibitor-bound, differing in the orientation of key elements such as microtub binding α-α5 loop, subdomain and α2-β-β-β motor tip. Group membership did not correlate with the bound nucleotide, but with distinct necker orientations. Accelerated simulations of ATP, ADP, and nucleotide Eg5 showed that all states sample major conformations observed in crystals. Differences in distal sites were evident, with necker, loop, and α-5 subdomain motions in ATP bound simulations absent in AD. Dissection of couplings revealed a network between active site, microub interface, and necker loop, loop 13. Simulations showed mutations G325, G326 in loop reduced flexibility and disrupted couplings. Results indicate ATP, AD conformations are intrinsically accessible regardless of state, supporting a model where necker docking leads to tighter microub, nucleotide regions. Simulations highlighted critical conformation changes, alloster coupling dist sites.
The Lux bioluminescent reporter system, originally developed for bacterial cells, has been adapted for use in eukaryotic cells and whole biosensors, allowing for real-time measurements without euthanasia. However, interpreting biolumcent data is challenging due to its nonlinearity and enzyme dynamics. A new computational approach has been developed to infer gene levels from light output, based on a mathematical model of Lux activity, including LuxAB, LuxC, and Fre reactions, with improved mechanisms for protein synthesis and turnover. The model was calibrated with data from Photorhabdus luminescens and literature data for LuxC, revealing previously unreported inhibition of the Lux reaction. Simulations show biolumcent profiles can differ from gene expression, with transient peaks similar to experimental data. By incorporating the model into a Bayesian scheme, promoter activity can be reverse-engineered from biolumcence.
Researchers have elucidated the crystal structure of Coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) in complex with a capsid binder G3 (G3), which inhibits the replication of enterovirus 71 (EV71) and CVA16, major causes of hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) in children. The structure reveals key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor. In silico docking was performed to investigate interactions with next-generation capsid binders NLD and ALD, showing potent inhibitors of a panel of enteroviruses with pharmacological properties. A meta-analysis was conducted using available structural information to gain insight into features required for capsid binders to interact and confer broad-spectrum enterirus activity.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the serpin inhibitor Necrot plays a crucial role in regulating the humoral response to fungal and Gram-positive infections. Following immune challenge, a proteolytic cascade is activated through the Toll receptor, leading to the synthesis of antibiotic peptides in the fat body and their export to the hemolymph. Necrot turnover in Drosila is rapid, synthesized in the fat body, but its site of degradation was unclear. Using a temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutation, researchers demonstrated that Necrot is removed from the hemolymph in two cell types: glial and pericardial macrophages. Necrot uptake increases rapidly after 30 minutes, peaking at 6-8 hours. Co-localization with anti-Nec, anti-AP5, and 7 antibodies showed the serpin is processed through multivesicular bodies and delivered to the lysosome, co-localizing with ubiquitin-binding protein H. Nec does not co-local with 11, indicating the ser is not re-exported from macrophages. Mutations blocking late endosome/lysosome fusion (dor, car) cause Necrot-positive endosomes accumulation even without infection. Knocking down the Drosila ortholog of mammalian LDL receptor with dsRNA identified Lp1 as enhancer of immune uptake. Necrot from hemol is blocked by chromosomal deletion L1. The study identifies cells and receptor responsible for Necrot uptake and degradation in Drosila. Scavenging ser/protein complexes may regulate proteolytic cascades.
In sea urchins, Nodal signaling plays a crucial role in establishing left-right (LR) asymmetry by preventing the formation of the rudiment on the right side. However, the opposing pathway to Nodal signaling during LR establishment is unclear. This study reveals that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, but not the small micromeres. By perturbing BMP activities, it is demonstrated that BMP signaling is required for the expression of left-sided genes and formation of left-sided structures. In contrast, Nodal on the right inhibits BMP signaling, controlling LR separation and apoptosis of small miceres. The findings indicate that BMP is a positive signal for left-sided development in seaurch, suggesting conserved opposing roles of Nodal and BMP in LR asymmetry across deuteromes.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is strictly synchronized with the host cell cycle, with infected G0/G cells supporting immediate early (IE) gene expression and progressing to the G1 phase, where they arrest. In contrast, S phase cells can be infected but block IE expression, and this inhibition is relieved when cells re-enter G1. During latent infection, IE expression is also inhibited, and reactivation requires overcoming this block. We found that the S phase block can be overcome by genotoxic stress and DNA replication inhibitors, implicating checkpoint-dependent pathways in IE repression. Checkpoint rescue requires p53, and absence mimicked by proteasomal inhibition in a p53-dependent manner. Cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 is downstream of p53, suggesting a role in IE repression in S and S phases. CD inhibition alleviates repression independently of p53, and also overcomes block in quiescent NT2 cells. Timely CD activity secures cycle specificity of HCM IE program and prevents latent establishment.
HIV-1 elite controllers (EC) are individuals who naturally restrict HIV-1 replication through functional HIV-1-specific T cell responses. However, the mechanisms supporting the development of effective HIV-specific T cell immunity in these patients are unclear. Dendritic cells (DC) play a crucial role in priming and expanding HIV-specific T cells through cytoplasmic recognition of HIV-1. However, HIV-1 evades intracellular recognition in DCs in most individuals. This study reveals that exposure of DC from EC to HIV-1 triggers rapid and sustained production of type I interferons and upregulation of interferon-stimulated effector genes. Emergence of cell-intrinsic immune responses is associated with reduced SAM1 and LEDGF75, and accumulation of viral transcripts, but inhibited by reverse transcription blockade or siRNA silencing cytoplasmic sensor cAS. Importantly, cell-intrinsic recognition of HIV-1 in DC from EC translates to stronger stimulation and expansion of HIV-specific CD8 T cells. These findings suggest a role of cell-in type I interferon secretion in dendritic for induction of HIV-specific CD8 cells and may be beneficial for eliciting T immunity against HIV for preventative or therapeutic purposes.
Researchers have developed a buoyancy-based screening method to identify Drosophila larvae with increased levels of stored fat, revealing 66 genes that contribute to fat storage, including Sir2, a member of the sirtuin family. Sirtuins regulate carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by deacetylating key proteins, but their role in energy homeostasis under normal feeding conditions is unclear. Knockdown of Sir in larval fat increases fat levels, and genetic mosaic analysis shows Sir restricts fat accumulation in fat cells autonomously. Metabolic enzyme changes in Sir mutants indicate a shift from catabolism. Surprisingly, Sir is upregulated under starvation, but mutants survive better than wild-type under amino-acid starvation with sugars provided.
Researchers studied the first embryonic division of 42 nematode species, including Caenorhabditis elegans, to investigate the evolution of mitotic spindle behavior during asymmetric cell division. Asymmetric cell division is crucial for generating cellular diversity, and the cleavage plane's orientation is often perpendicular to the mitotic spindle, which determines daughter cell size. Despite conserved properties in spindle positioning across distantly related species and cell types, little is known about the underlying mechanisms' robustness. The study recorded 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabdis and 15 non-Caenorhabdit species, providing a collection of subcellular phenotypes to study evolution of cellular processes across species. Analysis of spindle positioning revealed intra- and inter-species variations in degree of asymmetry and parameters, including spindle oscillation, elongation, and displacement. Notably, these parameters changed with no apparent direction in phylogeny, except for transverse oscillations, an innovation at Caenorhabdis base. Changes were unrelated to embryo size variations. Importantly, elongation, displacement, and oscillation evolved independently. This contrasts with Caenorhab elegans studies, revealing unrecognized spindle mechanics changes. The study demonstrates conserved process of asymmetric division over nemode evolution, while spindle parameters combine in various ways.
Bacterial Evolution: Distinct Responses and Roles for Identical Omp Proteins of Salmonella Typhimurium and Escheria coli in the Acid Stress Response

Research has shown that the evolution of new gene networks is a primary source of innovation for bacteria to explore and exploit new niches, including pathogenic interactions with host organisms. The archetypal DNA-binding protein Omp is identical in Salmonella Typhurium serovar Typhurium and Escheria coli, but regulatory specialization has resulted in different environmental triggers of Omp expression and divergent Omp regulons. Specifically, omp mRNA and Omp protein levels are elevated by acid in S. Typhurium but not in E. coli. This differential pattern is due to differences in the promoter regions of the omp genes and the E. coli omp orthologue can be acid-inducible by introduction of appropriate sequences from S. Tyurium.

The Omp regulon in S. Tyur overlaps with E. coli at 15 genes, including many horizontally acquired (virulence) genes that E. coli does not have. Omp binds its targets in higher abundance when DNA is relaxed, occurring in S. Tyur as a result of acid stress, a requirement for optimal expression of virulence genes. Genomic targets of O do not share strong nucleotide consensus; we propose O ability to recruit genes to regul arises from modest specificity in targets with preference relaxed allowing cooperation with topology-based allost to modulate transcription response acid stress.
Researchers have identified a novel effector protein, named Nuclear Effector (NUE), secreted by the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis. Analysis of the bacterium's genome revealed a SET domain-containing protein, which functions as a histone methyltransferase. The protein is secreted via a type III secretion mechanism during infection and translocates to the host cell nucleus, where it associates with chromatin. In mammalian cells, expression of UE reconstitutes nuclear targeting and chromatin association. In vitro assays confirmed UE is a histone methyltransfer that targets histones H2, H3, and H4, as well as auto-methylates itself. Mutants deficient in auto-methylation showed diminished activity towards histones, suggesting autoethylation enhances enzymatic activity. This is the first description of a bacterial effector targeting mammalian histones.
Researchers investigated the impact of inbreeding on human height in a study of 35,000 individuals from 21 populations. They found a significant inverse association between genome-wide homozygosity and height, equivalent to a 3cm reduction in height in offspring of first cousins compared to unrelated individuals, after controlling for socio-economic status. The effect was highly significant (χ²=83.89, df=1, p=5.2×10-20). However, heterogeneity was observed among populations, with consistent direction but varying effect sizes. This may reflect biological heterogeneity, influenced by variance in population homozygosity and chance of recessive genotypes inheritance. The study suggests multiple rare, recessive variants influence height.
Researchers investigated the role of monocyte (MO) subpopulations in the immune response to Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Monocytes display distinct phenotypes and functions that change during inflammatory states. The study hypothesized that specific MO subpopulations are induced during malaria and associated with anti-parasitic activity. Blood samples from healthy individuals exposed to malaria and patients with acute uncomplicated malaria were analyzed by flow cytometry to characterize MO phenotypes. In vitro antibody-dependent cellular inhibition (ADC) assay evaluated MO function. At admission, CD16+ and CCR2+CXCR1 MO were high in most patients. CCR and CXR on CD14high MO defined two patient subgroups with differing in limiting parasite growth through ADC. Patients with highest CDhiCCR+CX1 MO and highest ADC activity had lower parasitemia (0.14±0.34%) compared to second group (1.30±3%; p=0.005). Data showed patients' MO can exert ADC activity during malaria. Results reveal complex relationships between MO phenotype and function in malaria patients and healthy individuals, suggesting discrete subpopulations induced during infection are associated with anti-paritic activity.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Uganda to investigate the relationship between Schistosoma mansoni infection and HIV susceptibility in men. The study included 34 HIV-uninfected men who underwent elective circumcision, 12 of whom were positive for S mansoni eggs in stool and 12 were negative for both eggs and antigen. Blood and foreskin tissue samples were analyzed for T cell subsets by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. S mansoni-infected men had higher frequencies of Th1 (22.9% vs 16.5%), Th17 (2.3 vs 1.5%), and Th22 (0.5 vs 0.3%) cells in blood compared to uninfected men (p<0.05, <0.05, <0.01). Th17 cells in blood of mans-inf men produced more cytokines (28.1 vs 16.3%, p=0.046). However, these differences were not observed in foreskin tissue. S mansoni infection was associated with increased HIV-susceptible Th, Th, and Th cell subsets in blood, but not foreskin.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between Wolbachia, a symbiotic bacteria, and filarial nematodes, parasites that cause diseases such as river blindness and elephantiasis. Depletion of Wolbach through antibiotic therapy leads to defects in nemode development, fertility, and viability, suggesting it as a potential treatment approach. However, the basis of this relationship is not well understood. This study used confocal microscopy to examine the response to Wolbach depletion in adult nematodes, embryos, microfilariae, and fourth-stage larvae. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, was observed in germline and somatic cells, embryos, and microilar, but not in hypermal cells, which contain Wolbach. Apoptosis occurred in cells not previously infected by Wolbach, indicating non-autonomous induction. Disruption of hypermal cytoskeleton occurred after Wolbach depletion. Apoptosis pattern correlated with nemode processes affected by Wolbach depletion, including embryogenesis and sterilization, lasting months after worm death. This study provides a cellular explanation for reduced microilar loads and interrupted transmission after antibiotic therapy.
Malaria-causing Plasium falciparum parasites require extracellular pantoate for proliferation, which is converted to coenzyme A (CoA) via a five enzymes, including pantoate kinase (PfK). Anti-malarial pantoate analogs, such as pantoate and CJ-801, kill the parasite by targeting Co biosynthesis. However, the mechanism of action is unknown. Researchers found that parasites treated with panto or CJ-801 became resistant to these analogs. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in one putative Pan gene (PfK1) in resistant lines. These mutations altered PK activity, conferring a fitness cost, consistent with PK coding a functional enzyme essential for growth. Mutants showed different sensitivity to new anti-malar pate analogs, with one being hypersensitive. This suggests different pate classes have distinct mechanisms: some inhibit biosynthesis while others inhibit utilizing enzymes.
Genome-wide association studies were conducted in African American individuals from four cohorts (n=6,247) to identify genetic variants associated with the PR interval, a measure of atrial and atrioventricular conduction time. Genotyping was performed using the Affymetrix 6.0 microarray, and imputation was done for 2.8 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using YRI and CEU Hap II phase panels. A strong signal was observed within the SCN5A gene, encoding the cardiac sodium channel, with genome-wide association (p<2.5×10^-8) in two cohorts and meta-analysis. The signal explained 2% of PR variability in African Americans (β=5.1 msec per allele, 95% CI=4.1-6.1, p=3×10^-23). This SNP was also associated with PR (β=2.4 per allele, 95 CI=1.8-3, p=10^-16) in individuals of European ancestry (n=14,042), but with smaller effect and explained 0.5%. Meta-analysis of cohorts identified genome-wide associations in SCN10 (rs801), ME1 (10855), and TB5 (725) that correlated with SNPs in European and Asian studies. African was associated with increased PR (13.3 msec, p=.009) in one cohort but not others.
Tomato mosaic virus (ToMV), a positive-strand RNA virus, replicates its genomic RNA in replication complexes formed on intracellular membranes. A previous studies showed that host seven-transmembrane protein TOM1 is necessary for efficient MV multiplication. This study reveals that small GTP-binding protein ARL, along with TOM, co-purifies with FLAG-tagged ToMV 180 replication protein from solubilized membranes of MV-infected Nicotiana tabacum cells. Solubilized MV-infected cells expressing FLAG-tagged A8 co-pur with TOM and MV180 replication proteins, and the fraction showed RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity transcribing MV RNA. Uninfected cells TOM co-pur with FLAGged A8 less efficiently, suggesting complex containing MV proteins, TOM, and A8 formed on membranes in cells. Arabidopsis A8 consists four members. Simultaneous mutations two A8 genes inhibited MV multiplication. In vitro MV translation-replication system, lack TOM or A8 inhibited replicative RNA production, indicating TOM and A8 required for negative-strand synthesis. MV180 protein coexpressed with TOM and A8 in yeast, 5-capping activity detected in membrane. This activity undetect or weak when180 protein expressed alone or with TOM or A8. Results suggest TOM and A components of MV replication play crucial roles toward activation synthesizing and capping functions.
In the locust olfactory system, inhibitory interneurons play a crucial role in shaping the firing patterns of principal neurons, specifically Kenyon cells (KC). Two inhibitory motifs, feed-forward and feedback, have been identified, with distinct anatomical and functional differences. A subset of lateral interneurons (LHNs) provide feed-forward inhibition to KCs to maintain sparse firing, essential for olfactory learning and memory. However, a single inhibitory cell, the GABAergic neuron (GN), is the primary source of inhibition in the mushroom body, mediated by a feedback (FB) loop including KC and GN. A model of the locust olfactory system was used to compare the effects of feed-forward and feedback inhibition. Both motifs maintained KC responses and provided optimal odor discrimination, but only feedback inhibition produced a response consistent with in vivo data. This suggests that feedback inhibition is the primary source of inhibition to KCs. The study provides general rules for feed-forward versus feedback inhibition and highlights the GGN's potential as the primary source of inhibition. Understanding inhibitory motifs' impact on postsynaptic activity could reveal unknown inhibitory structures in biological networks.
A novel dual real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assay has been developed for the diagnosis of lyssavirus infection, including rabies in animals and humans. Traditional post-mortem diagnosis of rabies relies on immunofluorescence and virus isolation, but molecular techniques such as PCR-based methods are increasingly used for diagnosing rabies in humans and epidemiological analyses. However, achieving high specificity and sensitivity while accounting for lyavirus genetic diversity remains a challenge. The combo RT-q method combines two technologies: a probe-based TaMan-qPCR for detecting RAB species (pan-RV-qPCR) and a reaction using intercalating dye SYBR for other lyss species (panly-qPCR). The assay was evaluated with a large panel of animal samples covering all genetic variability and all lyss species characterized to date. It was also evaluated for human rabies diagnosis on 211 samples (76 positive and 135 negative), including saliva and brain biops. The method detected all human rabies cases and confirmed sensitivity of skin biopsy (91.5%) and saliva (54%) for intravital diagnosis of rabies. The method was implemented in two rab reference laboratories in endemic countries (Cambodia and Morocco). This RT-q method is a validated tool for rab diagnosis in humans and animals and a promising for lyavirus surveillance.
In the Eastern Region of Ghana, an outbreak of tset-transmitted trypanosomias resulted in over 50% losses of domestic pigs in 2007. To control the disease, a trial was conducted from May to October 2007 to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated mosquito nets in controlling tset. Two villages were selected: one as control with 14 pigs and one experimental with 24 pigs protected by insecticide-treated nets. The 100 cm high, 150 denier polyester fences with 100 mg/m deltamethrin and UV protector were attached to timber poles and planks. Bi-monthly monitoring of tset densities with geo-referenced traps showed a 90% reduction in the protected village within two months, with further reductions exceeding 95% in subsequent months. The control village tset population remained unaffected, displaying seasonal variations. Fifty pigs from each village were ear-tagged and given curative treatment with diminazene acate 3.5 mg/kg after blood samples taken. Initial trypan prevalence was 76% in protected and 72% in control, decreasing to 16 in protected and 84 in control after three months. After six, 8% of protected were infected compared to 60 in control.
A growing movement to promote reproducibility and transparency in biomedical research has emerged, emphasizing access to raw data, protocols, replication of studies, systematic reviews, and documentation of funding and conflicts of interest. A survey of 441 biomedical articles published between 2000-2014 assessed reproducibility and transparency indicators. Results showed that only one study provided a full protocol and none made raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare (n=4) and 16 studies were included in systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Most studies lacked funding and conflict information. Disclosure of conflicts decreased from 94.4% in 2000 to 34.6% in 2014, while reporting increased from 0 in 200 to 15.4 in 201 and from 5.6 in 200 to 50 in 201. Clinical medicine articles were more likely to lack funding information and have private funding compared to other fields.
Inhalation of Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of primary pneumonic plague, results in a highly lethal disease with mortality rates approaching 100%. The disease progression of pneumonic plague is biphasic, consisting of an initial pre-inflammatory phase characterized by bacterial growth in the absence of host inflammation, followed by a pro-inflammatory phase marked by neutrophil influx, inflammatory cytokine storm, and tissue destruction. Research using a FRET-based probe to quantify effector protein injection by Y. pestis type III secretion system reveals that bacteria target alveolar macrophages early in infection of mice, followed by a shift in host preference to neutrophils. Neutrophil influx fails to limit bacterial growth in lung and is responsible for severe inflammation during lethal phase.
A study was conducted in an urban area of Southeast Brazil to evaluate the performance of serology in identifying asymptomatic Leishmaniasis (VL) infection in a cohort of 136 participants with a two-year follow-up period. Blood samples from 97 positive and 39 PCR-negative individuals were collected, and none progressed to disease from asymptomatic state. Controls included samples from 22 healthy individuals and 8 patients with kala-azar. Molecular techniques (PCR and hybridization) confirmed Leishmania presence in all kalaazar patients and 86% of cohort. Kala patients showed high reactivity in ELISA, whereas asymptomatic individuals low reactivity against tested antigens. Compared to molecular methods, L. amazon and L. infant antigens showed higher sensitivity (49.6% and 41%) than r39 (26.5%), but r39 had higher specificity (73.7%) than L. amazon (52.6) and L. infant (36%). Low agreement among antigens used (kappa0.10). Serological tests were inaccurate diagnosing asymptomatic infections compared to molecular methods, leading to misclassification in population studies. Studies using serology to estimate prevalence, evaluate programs or identify Leish infection risk factors may have compromised results.
Researchers have developed a method to analyze the expression of retrotransposons in mouse embryonic stem cells using Illumina and Affymetrix gene microarray data. This approach allowed them to identify histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac1) as a component of the retrotranson silencing machinery in these cells. They also found retrotransons targeted by other silencing mechanisms such as DNA methylation, E-mediated histone modification, and Ring1/Eed-containing polycomb repressive complexes in embryonic stem cells. The study suggests that multiple silencing mechanisms target different retroons in embryonic cells, and that different copies of the same retroon can be sensitive to different silencing mechanisms. The researchers also identified retroon sequence elements targeted by silencing machineries. The study highlights the complexity of retroon silencing in embryonic and germ cells.
Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY) plays a crucial role in regulating flowering time. CRY-interacting bHL1 (C1) interacts with CRY in response to blue light to activate Flowering Locus T (FT) transcription. In vitro, C1 binds canonical E-box (CGT, also known as G-box) with higher affinity than non-canonical-box (CAN) sequences. However, in vivo, C1 binds chromatin region FT promoter containing non-canonical sequences. This study shows CRY also interacts with at least C5 in response blue, but not darkness or other wavelengths. Genetic analysis demonstrates C1, C2 C4, and C5 redundantly activate FT transcription and are positive regulators C2-mediated flowering. C1 and other C proteins form heterodimers, some heterodimers have higher affinity C homodimers non-canonical-box in vitro assays. This explains C1 and other bind canonical-box higher, associated noncanonical FT vivo. Consistent hypothesis C proteins similar roles C2-mediated blue signaling, C expression regulated by light. Study demonstrates C redundantly regulating C2-dependent, different C formodimers interact non-canonical vivo.
A study evaluated the economic impact of overseas and domestic treatment options for intestinal parasitic infections among US-bound refugees from Asia, where hookworm, Trichuris truria, Ascaris lumbricoid, and Strongloides stercalis are endemic. These infections are rare in the US and may be underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed, leading to serious consequences. An economic model was developed to estimate the cost and health impacts of four interventions on an annual cohort of 27,700 US-bound Asian refugees: 1) No program, 2) US domestic screening and treatment, 3) overseas albendazole and ivermect presumptive treatment, and 4) overseas albazole domestic for strongloides. The model estimated long-term effects of parasitic infections on health measures included outpatient cases, hospitalizations, deaths, and quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The "No" option was the least expensive ($165,923 per cohort) and least effective (145 cases, 4.0 hospitalizations, and 0.67 deaths over 60-year for one-year). Overseas albazole and iverect option ($418,824) was less expensive than domestic treatment ($3,832,572) or overseas albazole domestic for stronglo ($2,182,483). The most effective option was overseas alb and iverect, which reduced cases and hospitalizations by 80% at estimated cost $458,718 per death averted or $2,21924,036 per QY gained relative to No. Overse presumptive treatment for US-bound refugees is cost-effective and less expensive than domestic treatment. Addition of iverect to alb reduced prevalence stronglo and probability rare fatal disseminated.
Researchers have identified a new species of microsporidian parasite, Nematoda displere, that infects the nematode Caenorhabdis elegans and exhibits a unique tissue tropism compared to previously described parasites of this host. Nemat displere can invade and replicate in multiple tissues, including the epidermis, muscle, and intestine of C elegans, with the majority of replication occurring in the muscle and epider. In contrast, two closely related microidian pathogens, N parasii and N sp1, exclusively invade and replicate in the intestine. The Nemat displere genome diverges from N paras and sp1, with over 10% of its encoded proteins belonging to a species-specific family of R-domain containing proteins of unknown function. These proteins may mediate interactions with the host. The life cycle of Nematere includes pathogen entry, intracellular replication, and exit. This discovery provides a whole-animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different tissue niches.
The Cockayne syndrome complementation group B (CS) protein plays a crucial role in transcription-coupled DNA repair, and mutations in CS are associated with Cockayne syndrome, a disease characterized by premature aging, sun sensitivity, and neurological, and developmental defects. CS is a member of the SWI/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler family, but its chromatin remodeling activity and its role in DNA repair were unknown. This study demonstrates that CS repositions nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner in vitro, and this activity is enhanced by N1-like histone chaper, a new CS-binding partner. Functional analysis of CS domains and derivatives show chromatin remodeling by CS and N1-like chaper is required for transcription-cou DNA repair. Additionally, chromatin remodeling and repair mediated by CS are separable activities. The collaboration between CS and N-like histone chaper adds to understanding of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaper regulation of chromatin structure. This study provides insights into CS chromatin remodeling in transcription-c DNA repair and Cockayne syndrome mechanisms.
Researchers have created a comprehensive map of epigenetic variation in the human genome by identifying clusters of CpG sites with high inter-individual variation, termed Variably Methylated Regions (VMRs), in five purified cell types. VMRs preferentially occur at enhancers and 3' untranslated regions (UTRs). The majority of VMRs have high heritability, but a subset shows low herit, forming co-regulated networks that differ between cell types and are enriched for transcription factor binding sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue. In T cells, a network of 95 co-regulated VMRs was defined, enriched for genes in T-cell activation; in fibroblasts, a network of 34-regulated VM comprising four HO gene clusters was enriched for growth control; and in neurons, a network of 18 VMRs was enriched for synaptic signaling. Experimentally, genetically-identical fibroblasts were cultured under varying conditions, demonstrating that some VM networks are responsive to environment, with methylation at loci changing in a coordinated fashion dependent on growth. Environmentally-responsive VMs showed strong enrichment for imprinted loci (p<10-80), indicating sensitivity to conditions. This study provides a detailed map of epigenetic variation, showing both genetic and environmental causes underlie variation.
Researchers evaluated the performance of a newly developed Panbio Dengue Early Rapid test, which detects deng virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1), in combination with a commercial IgM/Ig rapid test for deng diagnosis. The study included 198 laboratory-confirmed positive and 100 negative samples from Vietnam and 263 positive and 30 samples from Malaysia. In Vietnam, the test sensitivity and specificity were 69.2% (95% CI 62.8 to 75.6) and 96% (95 CI 92.2 to 98.8), respectively. In Malaysia, performance was similar with 68.9% sensitivity (95 CI 61.8 to 76.1) and 96.7 specificity ( CI 82.8 to 99.9) compared to RT-PCR. Combining the Deng Early test with Ig/Ig test increased sensitivity to 93%. The tests were compared at each day post-illness, showing differentiation between antigen and antibody markers. This study demonstrates that using deng NS antigen in combination with anti-protein IgM and IgG serology increases sensitivity of acuteeng diagnosis, extends detection window to early samples, and enhances utility of rapid immunochatographic testing foreng.
Researchers have developed a new computational method, Trans, to predict the conserved helices of functional RNA structures, including transient, pseudo-knotted and alternative structures. Current RNA prediction methods assume a unique functional structure and do not account for features required for folding in vivo. To understand how RNA structures form in vivo, sophisticated or reliable methods are needed. There are few experimentally validated RNA structures, and existing computational programs predict co-transcriptional folding, but make simplifying assumptions and do not capture all influences on RNA folding. The method investigates if evolutionarily related genes fold similarly in vivo. Trans detects conserved helices of statistical significance and evaluates comprehensively. It predicts features of reference structures, including pseudo-kotted and alternative configurations, and identifies unstructured subsequences bound by molecules, providing evidence for new helices defining folding pathways. This supports that homous sequence not only assumes similar RNA structure but also folds similarly. Predicted features differ from thermodynamic equilibrium methods, unlike existing folding pathways. Trans works in a comparative way, not predicting function over time, but highlighting conserved features and not requiring cellular environment knowledge.
Plant immunity is a crucial for protecting plants from pathogenic microbes. The Arabidopsis immune network, which controls inducible immunity, must function effectively even when its components are targeted by pathogen effectors. To achieve this, the network relies on buffering, allowing different parts to compensate for each other's loss. This buffering is based on interactions within the network, which are challenging to study using genetic methods. A reconstitution of the Arabidopsis immune network, which mediates Pattern-Triggered-Immunity, was achieved by disassembling and reassembling it stepwise. This revealed systems-level mechanisms underlying the Arabid transcript response to flagellin-22 (fl22). The mechanisms show widespread interactions among sub-networks, called sectors, in the fl22 transcriptome. Many interactions result in buffering. Regulatory mechanisms show patterns for jasmonate (JA), ethylene (ET), phytoalexin4 (PAD), and salicylate (SA) sectors controlling transcription to fl22. These mechanisms are not detectable by traditional single-gene null-mut analysis. Similar pathogenic perturbations, nullut effects on signaling are buffered by the network.
In Drosophila, the central nervous system develops from a single-layered neuroepithelial sheets through a process of patterning mechanisms that subdivide the uniform epithelia into distinct domains, allowing for increased neuronal diversity in a controlled spatial and temporal manner. The embryonic neuroepith patterning of the optic placode gives rise to the larval eye primord, consisting of two photoreceptor (PR) types: primary and secondary, as well as the opticlobe primord, which develops into prominent ganglia during larval and pupal stages. A genetic network regulates the balance between larval eye and opticlobe precursors, as well as primary and secondary precursors. Proneural factor Aton (A) specifies larval precursors, while orphan receptor Tailless (T) is crucial for opticlobe specification. Hedgehog and Notch signaling act upstream of A and T to coordinate precursor specification in a timely manner. Spatial placement of A and T boundary is required for precise primary and secondary precursor numbers. Notch also controls binary cell fate, acting in a cascade of transcription interactions to define PR subtype.
Human ß-Defensin 1 (hBD) is a ubiquitously expressed endogenous antimicrobial peptide that exhibits distinct activities in its oxidized and reduced forms. Researchers investigated the antimicrobial mechanisms of hBD, discovering a previously unknown net-like structure surrounding bacteria treated with the reduced but not oxidized form of hBD. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a network-like structures surrounding bacteria treated with the reduced form of hBD, but not the oxidized form. A transmigration assay demonstrated that hBD-derived nets capture and inhibit bacterial transmigration, independent of killing. The presence of nets prevented migration of hBD-resistant pathogens and remained stable in human duodenal secretion with high protease amounts. In contrast, cysteine is necessary for net formation. The redox-dependent mechanism serves as an additional action for hBD, differing from net formation by other defensin, such as Paneth-derived human-defin 6 (HD). hBDred and hBDox have distinct antimicrobial profiles and functions, with only the reduced form providing additional protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular structures preventing invasion.
Lowe syndrome and Dent-2 are genetic disorders caused by mutations in the OCRL gene, which encodes the inositol 5-phosphatase OCRL. Despite understanding the cellular functions of OCRL, the underlying cause of renal tubulopathy in both disorders, characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, is unknown. Researchers investigated the role of OCRL in endocytosis in the zebraf pronephric tub, a model for mammalian renal tubule. They found that OCRL deficiency causes endocyt defect, coinciding with reduced megalin levels and accumulation in endytic compartments, indicating reduced recycling in endytic pathway. Early endytic compartments and vacuolar endosomes were reduced in sub-apical proneph cells. Cell polarity in proneph tub was unaffected in mutant embryos. OCRL-deficient embryos showed mild ciliogenesis, not accounting for endocyt defect. Catalytic activity of OCRL was required for tubular endyt, and endytic defect rescued by PIPK. Results indicate OCRL required endytic in vivo, supporting hypothesis endytic responsible for tubopathy in Lowe and Dent disease. PIPK revealed as potential target for Lowe and Dent disease treatment.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Kilbero Valley, Tanzania, to investigate the presence and determinants of interepidemic Rift Valley Fever (RVF) transmission in livestock. The study took place approximately four years after the 2007 RV outbreak in Tanzania. Serum samples from 1,680 cattle and sheep were tested for RV virus (RVV) antibodies using ELISA kits, detecting IgM and IgG. Interviews with herd owners provided information on determinants. The overall seroprevalence was 11.3%, with 5.5% in animals born after the 2007 outbreak and 22.7% in present during the outbreak. A linear increase in prevalence was observed in postepid cohorts. Nine ELISA positive samples were also positive for RV IgM antibodies, indicating recent infection. Spatial distribution of serreval showed hotspots. No significant difference in serreval was found between sexes born after the epidemic (6.1% vs 4.6% for females and males, p=0.158), but was significant during the outbreak (26% vs.7.8 for females and males, p<0.001). Animals >15km from the floodplain were more likely to have antibodies than those <5km (OR 1.92, 95%CI 1.04-3.56). Species, breed, herd composition, and grazing practices were not associated with serositivity.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, conserves a contractile vacuole complex (CVC) to regulate osmolarity. This obligate intracellular pathogen also relies on surface proteins to invade hosts. Researchers used genetic and biochemical approaches to study VC's contribution to trafficking glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins to Trypanosoma cruzi's plasma membrane and host invasion. T. cruzi Rab11 (GFP-TR11) localized to VC, while a dominant negative mutant (DN) tagged GFP-TRDN localized to cytosol and epimastigotes were less responsive to hypo-osmotic and hyperosmotic stress. Mutant parasites differentiated into metacyc forms and infected cells. GPI-anch transialase (TTS), mucins 60-200K family, and trypastig small antigen (TSS II) co-localized GFP-TR to VC during intramastigotes to trypastogenesis. Muc 35/50 family co-localized VC during metacgenesis. Parasites GFP-TRDN prevented TS, not other proteins, reaching plasma and were less infect compared wild cells. Incubation mutants exogenous recombin active, not TS, sialic donor before infecting cells partially rescued infectivity trypast.
A Phase III clinical trial was conducted to compare the immunogenicity and safety of a purified chick-embryo rabies vaccine (PCV) administered according to a shortened post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) 4-site/1-week intradermal regimen with the currently recommended 2-site Thai Red Cross (TR) regimen. The study enrolled 443 healthy individuals aged ≥1 year, randomized into four groups to receive intradermal PCV according to one of the two regimens, with or without human rabies immunoglobulin (HR) administration at the first visit in adults. Rabies virus neutralizing (RV) antibody concentrations and percentages of participants with RV concentrations ≥0.5 IU/mL, considered adequate following PEP, were assessed up to day (D) 365 post-vaccination. Noninferiority of the 4-site/1 regimen to the 2/TR regimen was demonstrated at D49, with a lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference in percentage of participants with RV concentrations >5%. Of 443 participants receiving the 4/1 regimen, 88 received HR; 442 received the 2/TR (88 HR). All achieved adequate RV concentrations by D14. At49, the difference between 4/1 and 2/TR was -1 (95CI: -4-0); noninferiority concluded. RV geometric concentrations 18 IU in 4/ and 12 IU in 2 at D, declined in all. Concentrations were lower with HR administration than without. The regimens had similar safety profiles. Of 15 events in 4/ and 19 in 2, none were vaccination-related. Data suggest the 4/ might alternative current, with benefits efficiency and compliance.
Researchers investigated the dynamic and spatial organization of the salience network (SN), a brain region crucial for detecting and attending to goal-relevant events, using high-resolution fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project and graph-theoretical techniques. The study found that the SN's large-scale dynamics are characterized by several distinct properties: high flexibility in time-vary connectivity with other networks, including the frontopetal network, cingulateopular network, ventral and dorsal attention networks, and spatial variability in functional interactions. The SN maintained high network centrality over time, indicating its role as a hub for facilitating cross-network interactions. Time-vary connectivity profiles of the SN differed from other prefrontal control systems. Temporal flexibility of the SN predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility. These findings were replicated in a second dataset, demonstrating robustness. The study provides new insights into the SN's functional architecture and its unique ability to facilitate interactions with multiple systems, supporting various cognitive processes in the brain.
The study investigated the role of the SV40 protein VP4 in the release of non-enveloped virus SV40 from host cells. SV40 virions assemble in the nucleus and must be released without being encapsulated by cellular membranes. The process involves the controlled insertion of viral proteins into host membranes, making them permeable to large molecules. VP4 is a late-expressed gene product that corresponds to the time of cell lysis. Water-soluble VP4 was expressed and purified as a GST protein from bacteria. Purified VP efficiently bound and disrupted biological membranes. VP perforated membranes by interacting with the bilayer, demonstrated by flotation assays and release of fluorescent markers into unilamellar vesicles or liposomes. The hydrophobic domain of VP was essential for binding and disruption. VP preferred membranes with lipid composition similar to plasma over nuclear membranes. Phosphatylethanol inhibited membrane activity. Disruption by VP involved formation of ∼3 nm pores in mammalian cells, including permissive SV host.
Researchers have developed a DNA-based vaccine, pcANS, containing the NS1 antigen from the Dengue virus (DENV), which induced protection against DENV in mice. The study aimed to elucidate the role of cellular and humoral responses in this vaccine-induced immunity. pcANS elicited robust anti-NS antibodies and T cell responses, conferring protection against DENV. Passive immunization with anti-NS antibodies provided partial protection against low viral loads, but not high doses. pcANS also activated CD4 and CD8 T cells, with IF-γ production and cytotoxic activity by CD8 T cells, but CD4 cells' contribution to protection was not evident. Depletion of CD4 cells in immunized mice abolished protection. Transfer of CD4 cells with anti-NS serum from vaccinated mice showed similar survival rates to pcANS-immunized mice. The study demonstrates that pcANS-induced immunity requires cooperation between CD4 T cells and humoral immunity.
In Gram-positive bacteria, cell-to-cell communication primarily relies on extracellular signaling peptides that trigger responses through two-component systems or direct binding to cytoplasmic effectors. The latter comprise the RNPP family, including Rgg, Rap, Npr, Prg, and Plc, which regulate processes such as sporulation, conjugation, and virulence. RNPP proteins are targets for new antibacterial agents, characterized by a TPR peptide-binding domain and Rap proteins with an N-terminal H-type DNA-binding domain and transcription activity. This study elucidates the structure-function of ComR, a new RNPP member controlling natural transformation in Streptococcus. Com is activated by pheromone X, the mature form of ComS-inducing peptide. Crystal analysis of Com from Streptoccus thermus with mutational and in vivo assays reveal a molecular mechanism. XIP induces HTH domain release and Com dimerization for DNA binding. This mechanism is conserved and specific to Com orthologs, demonstrating Com is not a Rap but a new RNPP member. Identification of X and Com residues for activation is crucial for antagonistic control among streptocci.
Researchers have successfully characterized the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC, a member of a family of neurotransmitter receptors, through electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography. The study reveals that ELIC is activated by a class of primary amines, including the neurotransmitter GABA, at high to millimolar concentrations. These ligands bind to a conserved site, evoking currents that desensitize over time. The protein forms cation channels with properties similar to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, characterized by high single channel conductance and comparably simple behavior.
Researchers have investigated the progression from eczema/atopic dermatitis (AD) to asthma, a process known as the "atopic march". They found that mice with skin-barrier defects develop AD-like inflammation and are susceptible to asthma, similar to humans with AD. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSL) overexpressed by skin keratinocytes drives bronial hyperresponsiveness. In an AD model, mice with keratin-specific deletion of RBP showed high systemic TSL levels and severe asthmatic phenotype after allergen challenge. Elimination of TSL signaling blocked the atopic march, indicating high TSL levels sensitize lung to inflammation. Outbred K-TSLg mice with high TSL developed no skin pathology. Epidermal T was sufficient to trigger atopic, sensitizing lung to allergens without epicutaneous sensitization. The study suggests treating skin-barrier defects and inhibiting systemic TSL may prevent asthma in AD patients.
Researchers have developed an approach that integrates multiple omics data with bioinformatics tools to analyze the genome of Thermotoga marima, a hyperthermophilic bacterium. Whole-genome sequencing, transcription start site (TSS) determination, transcriptome, and proteome profiling data were generated and analyzed with bioinformatics tools to improve gene annotation, elucidate transcription units (TUs), identify putative non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and determine promoters and ribosome sites. This analysis revealed distinctive features of T. marima genome compared to other bacteria, including a high number of genes per TU (3.3), paucity of putative ncRNAs (12), and few TUs with multiple TSS (3.7%). Quantitative analysis of promoters and ribosome sites showed increased conservation relative to other bacteria. The 5'UTRs followed an atypical bimodal distribution of "short" 5'UTs (11-17) and "common 5'UTs (26-32). Transcription regulation was limited by lack of intergenic space for most TUs. A fraction of annotated genes were expressed independently of growth and a correlation of mRNA/protein was observed (Pearson r=0.63, p<2.2×10-16-test). These properties are hypothesized to reflect the organism's hypermophilic lifestyle.
A study investigated the influence of contextual information on visual perception, specifically on the perception of a target bar in a display. Observers judged whether a target bar was present at the center of a display, with either with or without contextual bars. Results showed that observers were more likely to perceive a target when context was weak rather than strong. When context perceptually grouped with the target, weak contextual bars biased observers to perceive target relative to no context, whereas high-contrast bars, regardless of grouping, biased to no target. A Bayesian model of visual inference accounted for the data, illustrating context influences perception in two ways: (1) biasing prior belief in target presence according to grouping principles, (2) biasing internal model of likely contrasts caused by target. Data suggest context does not influence perceived contrast despite influence on target presence, implying areas beyond primary cortex responsible for inferences.
Researchers have investigated the paradox of cooperation in the production of costly goods in nature, where cooperation is vulnerable to exploitation by defectors who benefit from the good without contributing. The depletion of the common good can lead to population collapse and destruction of cooperation. However, in a structured population with small size, cooperation is favored due to increased variability in cooperator frequency across locations. Cooperators in co-dominated locations grow more than defectors in def-dominated locations, allowing cooperators to outgrow defectors globally. This raises the possibility that defectors can lead to conditions that rescue cooperation from def-induced destruction. Using an individual-based model of birth, death, migration, and mutation, three mechanisms are demonstrated: 

First, defector-induced collapse leads to occasional cooperator extinction, allowing cooperators to grow. Second, empty locations, either pre-existing or created by defector extinction, favor cooperation as they allow cooperator but not defector migrants to grow. Third, resource limitation induced by defectors selects for adaptive mutations to limitation. These mutations, initially low or continuously generated, favor cooperation by reducing population size. In a structured population, small sizes precipitated by defectors provide a mechanism for cooperation persistence.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen, poses a significant challenge to the mucosal barrier, particularly in patients with compromised epithelial barriers. Research has shown that P. aeruginosa interacts with polarized epithelium, adhering predominantly at multicellular junctions, where it attaches to extruded apoptotic or apoptotic bodies. This binding is independent of cell death type, as P. aerugin also binds to necrotic cells. Furthermore, P aerugin is internalized through efferocytosis, a process where epithelial cells engulf and dispose of extruded apoptotic cells. Intracellularly, apoptotic cell debris and P. aerugin inhabit an eocytic phagosome, which acquires lysosomal features and is ultimately killed. The study proposes elimination of P. aerugin through eocytosis as a host defense mechanism. Findings may be relevant to cystic fibrosis, characterized by increased apoptotic cells and ineffective eocytosis.
During Drosophila embryonic development, the gonad is formed from two distinct cell types: Primordial Germ Cells (PGCs) and somatic Gonadal Precursor (SG) cells. PGs form at the posterior of the blastoderm stage and are carried inside the embryo during gastrulation. To reach SG, PGs must traverse the midgut and migrate through meserm. A combination of repulsive and attractive cues from SG guide migration. The hedgehog (hh) pathway, specifically the shifted (sh) gene, plays a crucial role in directing PG migration. sh encodes a secreted protein facilitating long-distance transmission of hh through proteoglycan matrix after release from basolateral membranes of hh-expressing cells in wing disc. sh is expressed in gonadal meserm, loss and gain-of-function experiments show it is required for PG migration. The hmg-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway generates the PG attractant by SG and other tissues when hmg is ectically expressed. Production of this attract depends on sh and a second hh gene, g1. The PG attractant is linked to hh, as ectopic hmg in nervous system promotes release/transmission of hh from cells into mesermal layer, where hh contacts migrating PGs. Potentiation of hh by hmg depends on cholesterol.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of a recombinant adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) HIV-1 vaccine in eliciting cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell responses in HIV-negative individuals and chronically infected patients, including long-term non-progressors (LTNP). The study measured granzyme B target activity and HIV-1-infected CD4 T-cell elimination in vaccine recipients and compared to HIV-negative individuals and chronically infected patients, including a group of LTNP. Results showed detectable HIV-specific CD8 T-cell recall responses in vaccinees at a median 331 days post-immunization. The magnitude of responses did not correlate with the number of vaccinations or cytokine-secreting T-cells by ICS assays. However, cytotoxic capacity of CD8 T-cells in vaccine group was significantly less than LTNP but overlapped with progressors. Significantly higher cytotoxic responses were observed in recipients with HLA class I alleles B*27, B57, or B58, associated with immune control HIV replication in chronic infection. These findings suggest HLA I alleles may lead to better outcomes in chronic infection and immunization due to efficient priming HIV-specific CD8 T cytotoxic responses.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between the emergence of shared intentionality and the advancement of cumulative culture in humans. A model was developed to study the co-evolution of intentional behavior and cumulative culture, revealing that rapid technological progress is linked to the emergence of joint intentional behavior. Conversely, in the absence of opportunities for significant technological improvement, the ability to engage in joint behavior is selected against. This suggests a unified mechanism for the emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a potential cause for species diversity in prevalence of such behavior. The model shows that shared intentionality and cumulative culture co-evolve together, with rapid technological advancements driving joint behavior. In the absence of technological opportunities, joint behavior is selected against. This indicates that shared intentions and collaborative behavior are linked to technological progress.
Oligoastoteratozoospermia and Infertility in Mice Deficient mi-34/c and mi-449 Loci

Male fertility relies on the production of high-quality, motile spermatozoa in abundance. Alterations in any of these metrics cause oligoastatozoospermia, a leading to human subfertility. Post-meiotic spermatogenesis, including meiotic and terminal spermiogenesis stages, are transcriptionally inert, indicating the importance of post-transcriptional microRNA (miRNA) gene regulation. The expression of the miRNA enzyme Dicer peaks in spermatogenesis and meiosis, with critical functions in spermatogenesis. An expression screen identified two miR loci of the mi-34 family, mi-34 and mi-449, highly expressed in post-meiotic male cells. Reduction of mi-34 in spermatozoa has been associated with reduced fertility in humans. Deletion of mi34 and mi449 resulted in oligoastatoospermia in mice. mi-34/449 deficiency impairs meiotic and terminal stages of sperm maturation. Analysis of mi-34-449- pachene spermatocytes revealed deregulated genes highly enriched for mi- family targets.
Escherichia coli Nle 191 (Ec) has been used therapeutically for over a century, but the determinants of its probiotic properties remain elusive. Ec produces two siderophore-microins (Mcc) responsible for antagonistic activity against other Enterobacteraceae and synthesizes genotoxin colactin encoded by pks island. Colactin is a virulence and putative proarcin compound. To decouple antagonistic activity of Ec from genotoxicity, we demonstrated p-encoded ClP, peptase that activates colact, is required for antagonistic activity of Ec. Analysis of ClP mutants revealed activity linked to transmembrane helices of ClP and periplasm peptase domain, indicating transmembrane domain involved in aspect Mcc biosynthesis or secretion. Single amino substitution in Cl inactivates genotoxic but maintains antagon activity. In vivo salmonelis model, this mutant reduced clinical signs and fecal shedding of Salmonella similarly wild type, whereas ClP mutant neither protected nor outcompeted path. ClP-dependent antibacterial effect observed with E coli strains carry truncated M gene cluster and p island. Siderore-M synthesis required glucosyltransferase IB in salochelin production. This interplay colact, saloch, and biosynthetic pathways suggests genomic islands co-selected played role evolution E coli phyroup B. Co-evolution Ec illustrates fine between pathogenic probiotic activity and need address effectiveness safety probiotics. Decouling antagon from genotoxic by inactivating ClP pease opens safe use Ec.
Cryptococcus neoformans, an opportunistic pathogen responsible for cryptococcal meningitis, causes hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. Glycans, essential for fungal survival and pathogenesis, are synthesized in the secretory pathway, while their precursors, nucleotide sugars, are produced in the cytosol. Nucleotide transporters solve this problem by exchanging nucleotides for nucleosides. The major virulence factor of C. neoans is the anti-phagytic polysaccharide capsule, composed of xylose, a monosacide absent in yeast. U1 and U2 transport UDPxy, a xylose donor, with distinct subcellular localization and kinetic parameters, also transporting UDPgalactose. U1 and U2 are necessary for xylose incorporation into capsule and C. neo disease in mice, but not fungal viability in infection.
Researchers have developed an open-access global database for mapping and surveillance of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), aiming to support control and elimination efforts. Disease estimates are crucial for targeted interventions and monitoring, but a georeferenced global database for NTDs was lacking. The database was created by systematically searching literature, contacting Ministries of Health, and institutions in schistosiasis-endemic countries for location-specific data, extracting, geferencing, and storing in a MySQL database with a web interface. Initially, it contained over 12,000 geferenced schosomiasis surveys from 35 African countries (http://www.gd.org). It has expanded to a global repository including other NTDs, such as soil-transmitted helminiasis and lemanias. The database offers opportunities for disease modeling, targeting interventions, monitoring, and surveillance, as well as geostatistical analyses of distribution in space and time.
Researchers investigated whether chronic helminth infections exacerbate Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) infection in a rat model. Helminths induce a Th2 immune response and immunosuppressive environment, which can suppress Th1 immunity necessary for MT control. Studies were conducted in cotton rats, a natural host for Litomoides sigmodis and model for MT. Immunological, histological, and mycobacterial cultures were assessed two months after MT challenge in rats with and without L sigmodis infection. Sple cell proliferation and interferon gamma response to purified derivative were similar between coinfected and MT-only animals. Contrary to hypothesis, MT loads and lung granuloma size were not increased in coinf animals. These findings suggest filaria do not exacerbate MT in cotton model.
Researchers investigated the function of the DEG/ENa channel pp23 in Drosophila melanogaster, a large family of ion channels involved in responding to environmental cues, mating, feeding, and threats. They found that pp23 is expressed in a subset of sexually dimorphic gustatory chemosensory bristles, distinct from those related to feeding. Disrupting pp23 or inhibiting pp23-expressing neurons did not affect gustatory responses, but blocking pp23 neurons or mutating pp23 delayed and reduced male courtship initiation and intensity. Mutations in pp23 altered male response to female-specific pheromone (7,11)-heptadiene. These findings suggest pp23 and cells play a role in the sensory system determining sexual behavior in Dophila.
Researchers investigated the process of mitochondrial tRNA import in the unicellular green alga Chlamdomonas. Mitochondria from various phyla, including protozoa, fungi, plants, and humans, import tRNAs from the cytosol to ensure proper translation. However, the understanding of this process is incomplete, and questions about its regulation remain unanswered. A correlation was found between mitochondrial codon usage and the amount of imported tRN in Chlamdomonas. This led to the hypothesis that tRNA import might adapt to the mitochondrial genome. To test this, the Chlamdomas mitochondrial genome was modified with mutations to alter cod usage. Results showed that cod modification reduced translation levels and subsequent respiratory complex activities, linked to limited tRNA pool in mitochondria. This indicates tRNA import is not rapidly regulated in response to genetic changes, suggesting it is not a dynamic process. Instead, steady-state tRNA levels result from co-evolution between import mechanism and translation machinery requirements.
Researchers have identified new patterns of glucose dysregulation in individuals with diabetes and prediabetes using continuous glucose monitoring (CG). Current methods for quantifying glucose dysregulation are limited by relying on single-point measurements or average measures of overall glycemia, neglecting glucose dynamics. The study used CG to evaluate frequency, types, and patterns of postprand glucose elevations between individuals given identical nutrient challenges. Insulin resistance measurements highlighted variable physiology underlying glycemia between individuals. An analytical framework grouped individuals into specific glycemic patterns, called "glucotypes," revealing heterogeneity within traditional glucose regulation categories. Individuals considered normoglyc by standard measures exhibited high variability with CG, with glucose levels reaching predabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time, respectively. Glucose dysulation, characterized by CG, is more prevalent and heterogeneous than thought, affecting normlyc individuals. Specific glyc responses reflect underlying physiology. Interindividual variability in responses to standardized meals highlights glucose regulation's personal nature. Phenotyping developed a model for glucose dysulation mechanisms and a web tool for visualizing user-uploaded CG, classifying individual patterns into glucotypes.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Raf-like MAP kinase kinase (MAPK) EDR1 in regulating plant defense responses and cell death in Arabidopsis. They found that EDR1 negatively regulates the MK4/MK5-PK/MP6 kinase cascade, a key component of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway involved in plant defense. EDR physically interacts with MK4 and MK5, and this interaction requires the N-terminal domain of E1. This interaction leads to a decrease in MK4/M5 protein levels and reduced MP3/6 kinase activity in ed1 mutants compared to wild-type plants. Furthermore, ed1 mutants exhibit increased MP3/6 kinase activity and protein levels. Overexpression of MK4 or MK5 rescues ed1 resistance to mildew-induced cell death, while mutations in mp3, m4, and m5 suppress ed1-mediated resistance. These findings indicate that E1 associates with MK4/M5 and negatively regulates the MAP cascade to modulate plant innate immunity.
Researchers have developed a computational framework based on Gaussian processes to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases, with a focus on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever in Turkey between 2004-2015. The framework leverages the structure of similarity matrices to achieve an efficient implementation. In comparison with standard machine learning algorithms, random forests and boosted trees, the Gaussian process outperformed under temporal, spatial, and spatiemporal prediction scenarios. The study demonstrates the potential of the framework to inform public health policy decisions.
Rift Valley Fever (RV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic disease prevalent in Africa and the Middle East, causing significant human deaths and economic losses due to high mortality rates among infected livestock. Outbreaks of RV are sporadic and influenced by seasonal and socioeconomic factors. A three-patch model was developed to investigate RVV transmission dynamics among ruminants with spatial movements. Findings indicate that in Northeast Africa, human activities associated with Eid al-Adha festival, combined with climatic factors such as rainfall and hydrological variations, contribute to disease transmission and dispersal. Sporadic outbreaks occur when two events coincide: 1) livestock influx into high-risk areas for RV due to festival demand and 2) abundant mosquitoes. These factors impact severity of RV outbreaks. Numerical results show disease dynamics over short and long periods, particularly during festival time. Patterns of outbreaks in each patch influenced by festival and seasonal factors: number of imported livestock, animal transportation speed between patches, and death from sacrifices. Simulations demonstrate increased risk of outbreaks when festival starts earlier than usual, particularly in patch where ceremony held.
In Azerbaijan, the incidence of human anthrax underwent significant changes from 1984 to 2010. An analysis of data on livestock outbreaks, vaccination efforts, and human anthrax cases during the Soviet and post-Sov governance periods revealed a notable shift in the spatio-temporal distribution of the disease. From 1984 to 1995, the annual incidence rate increased by 11.95%, followed by a decline of 35.24% after the initiation of preemptive livestock vaccination in 1996. Spatial analysis indicated geographic variation in reporting, with cases concentrated in the west initially and shifting eastward over time. The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to marked changes in the distribution of human anthrax in Azerbaijan. Despite decreased incidence, continued control measures in livestock are necessary to mitigate its occurrence.
Researchers have investigated the interaction between polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and the Shaker voltage-gated potassium (KV) channel, a protein that regulates potassium ion flow across the cell membrane in response to changes in electrical potential. PUFAs have been shown to modulate the channel's voltage sensitivity, offering potential treatment for refractory epilepsy through a ketogenic diet. However, the exact mechanism of PUFA interaction with the channel remains unclear. This study used molecular dynamics simulations to examine the interaction between the Shaker channel in open and closed states and a PU-rich lipid bilayer. Results indicate a putative PU binding site in the open state at the protein-lip interface near the extracellular S3 and S4 helices of the voltage sensor domain. The PU tail interacts with non-specific hydrophobic interactions in the proteinip core, while the carboxyl head interacts with polar/charged residues at the extracellular S and S helices, including the S-S linker. In contrast, saturated fatty acids showed increased conformational flexibility in polyunsaturated tails compared to saturated chains, explaining specificity of PU action on channels.
Researchers have developed a pipeline to screen for anti-parasitic agents targeting Cryptosporidium parv's inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). Cryptosporium parv causes significant disease in children in developing countries and severe enteritis in AIDS patients, with limited treatment options. The parasite's intractability has hindered drug development. Genome sequencing identified potential targets, including IMPDH, but testing has been challenging. A genetically engineered Toxoplas gondii was used as a model for C. parum infection to validate the first screen, providing a larger window than possible with C. par assays. A fluorescence-based host proliferation and C. par growth assay with automated imaging was established for throughput. The pipeline was used to evaluate C. par IMP inhibitors, identifying 1,2,3-triazole ethers with selectivity in T. gondii and anti-parasitic activity.
A genome-wide association study was conducted to investigate the genetic factors influencing tooth development in humans. Tooth development is a complex process linked to growth and development of the craniofacial complex, and abnormalities are common, with tooth agenesis being the most frequent anomaly. The study analyzed data from 4,564 individuals from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort (NF1966) and 1,518 from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPC). Five loci associated with tooth eruption time and number at one year were identified at a significance level of P<5×10−8, and five at a suggestive level of P<5×10−6. The identified loci included genes related to tooth and organ development, such as KCNJ, DA, HOXB, RADL, IGF, HM, and MS. Four of the identified genes are implicated in cancer development. A variant in the HO gene was associated with occlusion defects requiring orthodontic treatment by age 31.
Researchers created two mouse models, Ts3Y and MsY, to study the effects of partial trisomy and monomy of the Hspa-App region on chromosome 21, which is associated with Down syndrome. TsY has a tandem duplication, while MsY has a deletion of the Hspa-App interval. The study found that trisomy and monomy of this region affect locomotion, muscle strength, and balance. Gene expression in skeletal muscles was altered, with changes in energetic metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis. Genes were downregulated in TsY and upregulated in Ms. Shift in muscle metabolism correlated with change in mitochondrial proliferation, but not respiratory function. Mitochondrial ROS production decreased in MsY, while membrane permeability increased in Ts. The Hspa-App region controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles due to changes in Gabpa, N1, and Atpj. Results indicate copy variation in Hspa-App impacts locomotor activity by altering muscle function.
A quantitative model of the GIRK1 channel reveals that basal and evoked activities are controlled by unequal stoichiometry of α and β subunits. GIRK channels, activated by β subunits from Gi/o proteins, regulate heartbeat and neuronal excitability and plasticity. Both neurotransmitter-evoked (evoked) and neurotransmitter-independent basal (bas) GIR activities are physiologically important, but mechanisms of bas and evoked are unclear. A quantitative model of GIR1 function was developed to unveil underlying mechanisms. Single-channel and macroscopic GIR1 currents and surface densities of GIR and β were characterized in Xenopus oocytes. The model accurately recapitulates bas and evoked in Xenopus, HEK cells and hippocampal neurons; predicts dose-dependent activation of GIR by coexpressed β and accounts for inverse bas-ev correlation. Modeling indicates 3-4 β dimers are available for each GIR channel, while G decreases from 2 to less than 1 per GIR as density increases. The persistent β/channel but not α ratio supports association of GIR with β, consistent with recruitment of β but not α by GIR to the surface. A stoichiometry of 4 β but only 1 α per GIR channel is suggested. The unequal association of GIR with subunits and cooperative gating by β underlie complex basal and agon-evoked activities, allowing GIR to act as bidirectional detector of β and α.
Researchers have developed a novel computational model, PredTALE, to predict the targets of transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) secreted by plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria. TALEs are transcriptional activators that support bacterial virulence by binding to specific DNA sequences in host cells. Each TALE has a modular DNA-binding domain composed of tandem repeats with variable di-residues (RVDs) that determine target specificity by binding to contiguous nucleotides. The PredTA model accounts for recent findings on TALE targeting, including frame-shift by aberrant repeat lengths and flexible target orientation relative to transcription start sites. It also considers dependencies between adjacent RVD positions. Parameters were learned from quantitative data generated over the years. The model was benchmarked using RNA-seq data from Xanthas infection in rice, showing improved performance compared to previous approaches. PredTA predicted novel putative virulence targets, but also identified orphan TALEs not predicted by other tools. Orphan TALEs may be due to incomplete annotations, suggesting promoter-wide genome scans for boxes. Promoter-wide scans recovered known targets, but combined with RNA-seq detected putative independent of existing annotations.
Researchers have identified 24,189 non-synonymous amino acid changes in the human mitochondrial genome, but only a small subset has been functionally evaluated, while the majority's pathogenicity was assessed in-sil by software. These tools showed incongruent results, prompting the development of APOEE, a machine-learning algorithm that outperforms existing methods in estimating mitochondrial non-syn genome harmfulness. APOEE was trained on a manually curated set of variants and evaluated on a test set, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict pathogenicity.
Dengue virus (DENV) nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) plays a crucial role in the development of thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage during DENV infection. Thrombocytopenia is a characteristic of both mild and severe DENV disease and correlates with disease severity. Previous studies have shown that DENV NS1 can stimulate immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and cause endothelial leakage. This study investigated whether DENV NS can directly induce platelet activation and thrombocytopenia. DENV, but not Zika virus culture supernatant, induced P-selectin expression and phosphatidserine (PS) in human platelets, which was abolished when NS1 was depleted. Recombinant NS from all four DENV serotypes showed similar effects, blocked by anti-NS F(ab)2, anti-TLR antibody, TLR antagonist (Rhodobacteroid lipopolysaccharide, LPS), and TLR inhibitor (AK242), but not polymyxin (LPS inhibitor). DENV NS activated platelets promoted adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced platelet aggregation, plate adhesion to endothelial cells, and phagocytosis by macrophages. DENV-induced thromocytopenia and hemorrhage were attenuated in TLR knockout and wild-type mice when NS was depleted from DENV.
Researchers conducted a mathematical analysis of the dynamic control mechanisms regulating blood pressure and volume homeostasis, focusing on the arginine vasopressin (AV), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RA) systems. The study revealed two distinct regulatory mechanisms: one affecting blood pressure through vasoconstriction and the other through blood volume regulation. Both systems consist of negative feedback loops with a single equilibrium that can be stable or lead to oscillatory instability. A subsystem involving ANP and AV stimulation of vascular smooth muscle is a candidate for a monotone system with multiple feedback, showing oscillatory potential when all feedback delays are comparable.
Fibrin Networks Regulate Protein Transport during Thrombus Development

Thromboembolic disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Researchers have been investigating mechanisms to stop thrombus growth. This study identifies a novel mechanism related to thrombus formation, specifically protein transport through fibrin, a component of thrombus. Experiments and simulations showed that network permeability and diffusivity are key factors in protein transport through fibrin. In vivo studies in mice, non-occluding thrombi were covered by fibrin (fibr cap). Simulations using microfluid devices, accounting fibr cap permeability, demonstrated thrombin inside throm was washed through fibr network, limiting platelet exposure on throm surface throm. Fibr cap restricted platelet approach to throm core, limiting plate activation and throm growth. Fibr cap prevents small throm in 600 km vessels from developing into life-threatening events.
Researchers investigated the role of invariant natural killer T (iKT) cells in controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. They found that iKT cells are activated during infection, but their ability to limit microbial growth was previously unknown. The study showed that iKT activation, measured by CD25 upregulation and IFγ production, was primarily driven by IL-12 and IL-18 when co-cultured with infected macrophages. However, iKT control of M growth was CD1-dependent and did not require IL-12, IL-18, or IFγ. This indicates that conventional activation markers do not correlate with iKT effector function during M infection. iKT control of M replication was also independent of TNF and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. A novel mediator of iKT antimicrobial activity was identified: granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). iKT produced GMF in vitro and in vivo in a CD1-dependent manner during M infection, and GMF was necessary and sufficient to control M growth. GMF is a novel iKT antimicrobial effector function and may play a role in cell immunity against M.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic fungal pathogen, is a common component of the human intestinal flora. To understand its colonization, researchers studied genes expressed by the fungus within the host. The EF1 gene, encoding a putative transcription factor, was highly expressed during C. albicans growth in the intestinal tract. Unexpectedly, an ef1 mutant exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract, a model of commensal colonization, whereas EF1 overexpressing strain reduced colonization of the intestinal and oral cavity of athymic mice, modeling mucosal candidiasis. When inoculated into the bloodstream, both ef1 and EF1 overexpress strains caused lethal infections. In contrast, mutants attenuated in virulence following intravenous inoculation exhibited normal intestinal colonization levels. Expression of several genes dependent on EF1 during laboratory growth was observed, but E1-independent expression during murine intestinal growth. Results show EF1 regulated colonizing level, favoring commensalism over candidias. Different genes required different niches and pathways regulating expression during host colonization differ from characterized laboratory growth.
Immunization with irradiated sporozoites is the most effective strategy against malaria liver stages, but the mechanisms behind its success are unknown. Researchers investigated the role of antigen presentation in CD8+ T cell responses against malaria liver parasites. Using TCR transgenic cells specific for the circumsporozoite protein, a vaccine candidate, they found sporozoite antigen persisted for 8 weeks after immunization, despite irradiated sporites' inability to replicate or differentiate beyond liver stages. Antigen was detected in lymphoid organs, dependent on CD11+ cells. Prolong antigen presentation enhanced CD8 T response in several ways: reduced primed cells' exposure time in vivo reduced memory population size, fully developed cells expanded in immunized mice but not transferred naïve, and antigen primed naïve cells, including thymic emigrants, to become effector cells eliminating parasites in liver. Optimal CD8 immunity against malaria liver stages requires prolonged sporite antigen presentation.
Researchers investigated the potential of polymyxin B (B) as a treatment for leishmaniasis, a disease caused by Leishmania amazonensis, by encapsulating it in biodegradable nanocarriers (PBCPs) to enhance its internalization in infected macrophages. PBCPs were fabricated through anionic polymerization and characterized by Dynamic Light Scattering (size, ζ-potential, Nanoparticle Analysis (size/concentration, vertical cell release rate, drug incorporation, and indirect protein determination, and in vitro viability. Nanoparticles coated with polymyxin B (PBC-pol) had a size of 261.5 ± 25.9 nm, low polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.79 ± 0.17, and were stable for 45 days. The drug release from PBC-pol was 6-7 times slower than free polymyx B, favoring a prolonged release profile. In vitro, polymyx B alone reduced amastigote infection in macrophages at 10 μg/mL, but not eliminating parasites at higher concentrations, limiting its application as adjuvant leishicidal therapy or antimicrobial coating. The nanocar PBC also showed leishicidal effect surpassing polym B activity, but no antimicrobial activity was detected. Polymyx B retained activity against E. coli, Pseudomonas, and Klebsiella, adding antimicrobial properties to nanoparticles. This delivery system demonstrated antileishial and antimicrobial properties for the first time, aiding concomitant prevention/treatment of secondary infections caused by cutaneous L. amazon, preventing disfiguring or disabling lesions.
A cohort study was conducted in Belo Horizonte, Brazil to investigate prognostic factors for death from visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The study analyzed data from the Reportable Disease System-SIN (Brazilian Ministry of Health) on clinical manifestations of the disease from 2002-2009. Due to changes in the SIN platform, two models were created: Model 1 (2002-2009, 111 deaths, 777 patients) and Model 2 (2007-2009, 49,327). Multivariate regression identified variables associated with death in each model. Model 1: weakness (OR 2.9, CI 1.3-6.4), Leishmaniasis-HIV co-infection (2.4, CI 1.2-4.8), and age ≥60 (2.5 CI 1.5-4.3). Model 2: bleeding (3.5 CI 1.2-10.3), other infections (3.2 CI 1.3-7.8), jaundice (10 CI 3.7-27), and age ≥60 (3 CI 1.4-7). A prognostic score was developed using Model 2 variables. Performance was evaluated by sensitivity 71.4, specificity 73.7, PPV 28.9, NPV 94.5, and AUC 75.6.
Plants rely heavily on receptor-like kinases (RLs) for perceiving and integrating external and internal stimuli. The Arabidopsis regulatory leucine-rich RL (L-RL) BAK is involved in hormone responses, innate immunity, and cell control. A novel allele of BAK, bak-1, regulates three BAK-dependent pathways differentially. Innate immunity mediated by BAK-dependent RKs FLS and EFR is severely compromised in bak-1 mutants. However, bak-1 mutants are not impaired in BR or cell control. FLS and E have low kinase activity and cannot phosphorylate BAK in vitro. Kinase activity is dispensable for ligand-induced heteromerization of F or E with BAK in planta. Specific suppression of F and E signaling in bak- is due to B interaction with ligand RK but requires B activity. Our results demonstrate phosphorylation-dependent control plant growth, immunity, and cell by RL BAK, revealing differences in mechanisms underlying ligand RD and non-RK regulation.
Researchers have developed a computational approach to model the heterogeneous response of cancer cells to anticancer treatments. This approach combines time-lapse cell microscopy and flow cytometry data to render the proliferative process through the cell cycle and subsequent generations during treatment. The model describes the functional activity of main pathways causing arrest, repair, and death in each phase. A framework was created to apply different modules in each phase and test at the complexity justified by data. The method was challenged with time-course measures in parallel with flow cytometry and time-lapse microscopy in X-ray treated human ovarian cancer cells, spanning a range of doses. A model of treatment including dose-response effect was built, combining modules with a strategy fitting all data different doses and platforms. The model provided the first complete in silico rendering of cycling following X exposure, providing quantitative measures of dose-dependence G1, S, and G2 checkpoint in generations, reconciling radiation effects and new insights.
Coenzyme Q (Co) is a crucial electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, and its deficiency has been linked to various human diseases. The biosynthesis of Co involves polyisopren diphosphate production, requiring enzymes encoded by PD1 and PD2 genes. Homozygous mutations in these genes in humans lead to severe neuromuscular disease and nephrotic syndrome in PD2 deficiency. Research on mice with a missense PD2 mutation (Psskd) reveals a kidney disease attributed to Co biosynthetic defect. Co9 and Co10 levels in kidney homogenates from Psskd mutants are lower than controls. Disease originates in glomerular podocytes, as seen in Podin/Pss knockout mice, but not in tubular epithelium or hepatocyte knockouts. Liver conditional knockout mice have no disease despite undetectable Co levels, impaired respiration, and altered metabolism. Data suggest disease manifestations relate to tissue-specific respiratory capacity, with glomer podocytes most sensitive to PD2 impairment.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between developmental lineages and phenotypic robustness in organisms. Phenotypic robustness is the ability of an organism to maintain its form and function despite environmental and genetic perturbations. Development has been considered a key component of robustness, but the underlying mechanism was unclear. The study focused on determinative developmental lineages of protostomes and deuterostomes, finding that their cellular composition is only modestly affected by cell deaths. Several features of these lineages, including shallowness, topology, early ontogenic appearance of cells, and non-clonality of cell types, contribute to robustness. Simulations of lineage evolution demonstrated that robustness arose as an adaptation to random cell deaths during development. These findings reveal general principles of determinative developmental lineages and a new concept of phenotypic robust, with implications for development and evolution.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput platform for phenomics, called EmbryoPhen, to study embryonic development in aquatic species. The platform consists of an Open Video Microscope (OpenIM) that captures high-resolution videos of embryos under controlled conditions, and Embryo Vision (EmbCV), a Python package that extracts phenomic data on morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits during development. Embryoen was tested in experiments assessing responses to environmental changes in temperature and salinity in two species, the pond snail Radix bica and the amphipod Orchestia gammellus, using over 30,000 images of 600 embryos. The platform can capture functional, temporal, and spatial responses in the earliest life stages of development.
Malaria parasites (Plasium spp.) undergo significant changes in metabolism during their life cycle between mosquito and human hosts, adapting to different nutritional environments. This adaptation involves a shift from glycolytic metabolism in asexual stages to tricarboxylic acid (TCA) metabolism in mosquito stages. Researchers used stable isotope labeling, targeted metabolomics, and reverse genetics to study stage-specific changes in Plasium berghei carbon metabolism and its impact on survival in blood and mosquito stages. Glutamine serves as primary input for T metabolism in both asexual and sexual stages, crucial for gametogenesis. Glutamine catabolysis and key reactions in intermediary metabolism and CoA synthesis are essential for ookin toocyst transition in mosquito.
Researchers have identified a common motif in biological signaling pathways that enables the differentiation between pulsatile and sustained signals in gene regulation, known as the inherent feedforward loop (ILFIL). This motif consists of an input that simultaneously activates an output and an inhibitor of the output. With appropriate parameters, it exhibits temporal adaptation, desensitizing the system to sustained inputs. This property allows for distinguishing between signals with varying temporal profiles. A new study examines the IIL's ability to process oscillatory signals through quantitative modeling. The results show that the system's ability to translate pulsatile dynamics is limited by two constraints: the kinetics of IL components dictate the input range that can be decoded, and a match between network parameters and signal characteristics is required for optimal processing. The study elucidates one mechanism of information processing in natural networks and has implications for designing synthetic circuits for this purpose.
Researchers have developed improved methods for the quantification, propagation, purification, and long-term storage of Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, a leading cause of serious febrile illness in Southeast Asia. This obligate intracellular bacterium can only be cultured in mammalian cells and requires specific methodologies for propagation and analysis. A clinical isolate of O. tsugamushi was grown in mouse embryonic fibroblast (L) cells, and bacterial growth was measured using an O. tsugushi-specific qPCR assay. Conditions for improved viability and growth were monitored in terms of bacterial number after cultured in mammalian cells. A standardized method for comparing viability of O. tsugushi after purification and propagation under various conditions was established. The study presents a body of data supporting improved techniques for propagation, purification, and storage of the organism. This will be useful for clinical isolation and in vitro biology experiments.
A study investigated the safety and efficacy of the antiparasitic drug praziquel (PQ) in children aged 1-5 years, who are currently excluded from schistosomiasis control programs due to lack of P data in this age group. One hundred and four Zimbabwean children aged 1-5 were treated with P tablets, and side effects were assessed by caregiver questionnaire 24 hours post-treatment. Efficacy was determined 6 weeks post-treatment through schosome counts in urine. Pre-treatment S haobium infection in 1-5 olds was 14.6 eggs/10 ml and prevalence was 21%. Three point eight percent of children reported side effects within 24 hours of P treatment, including stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation. P treatment significantly reduced schosome levels in 1-5 olds with an egg reduction rate of 99% and cure rate of 92%. This was comparable to efficacy in 6-10 olds where egg reduction was 96 and cure was 67. P is safe and efficacious in 1-5 olds as in 6-10 olds, the drug of choice for schosomiasis control.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide functional screen in Drosophila to identify genes involved in Ras-driven epithelial tumorigenesis, a process responsible for ~30% of human cancers. The screen revealed multiple evolutionarily conserved pathways controlling Ras-driven tumorigenesis, with human orthologs of fly genes significantly downregulated in thousands of primary tumors, indicating potential prognostic markers for epithelial tumors. Among the top 100 candidate tumor suppressor genes, 80 were validated in secondary Dophila assays, including known and novel genes cooperating with Ras-driven tumenesis. Low expression of confirmed hits correlated with KRAS mutation and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. The top candidate, Tetrasin family member T29b, was mechanistically characterized, regulating EGFR signaling, epithelial architecture, and restraining tumor growth and invasion.
Researchers investigated the wtf gene family in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, previously linked to meiotic drivers in wild isolates, and found that wtf13 is a meiotic driver in lab stocks. wtf13 induces spore death in offspring that do not inherit it by producing a diffusible poison and spore-specific antidote. A second wtf gene, wtf-2, arose spontaneously in the lab and encodes an antidote to w13. w-2 does not indiscriminately prevent spore death, instead rescuing only spores that inherit w-2. This allows w-2 to selfishly gain transmission advantage while dampening w13 drive. The study establishes a novel paradigm for meiotic suppressors and provides insight into drive mechanisms and evolution.
Researchers have developed an algorithm to predict gene expression levels in individuals based solely on their genotype data. The algorithm uses training data from a set of individuals to predict gene expression in unseen individuals given their genotype in the genomic vicinity of the gene. Predictions are robust and consistent between training and test sets, even when individuals are from distinct populations. The number of predictable genes is relatively small due to ignoring factors like environmental and sequence variation. However, predictions are robust, indicating the degree of predictability of genes can be known in advance. An extension incorporates different types of genomic annotations to weigh importance of variants, showing higher weights for variants near genes and high GC content improve predictions. Predicted genes have higher expression and variability across individuals, providing insight into characteristics of predictable genes from cis variation.
A study investigated the competitive interactions between virulent and avir clones of Plasmodium chaudi in immuno-competent and immuno-deficient mice using dynamical based Bayesian inference. The goal was to determine whether suppression of avir clone AS by vir clone AJ was due to clone-specific differences in immune clearance of meroites and parasitised red blood cells (RBCs), loss of meroites and parasised RBCs, RBC preference, R infection rate, burst size, or within-R interference. Mathematical models were parameterised and fitted to experimental data, revealing that only the ratio of background loss of meroites to invasion of mature RBCs was clone-specific. This ratio was the same in single-clone infections but different between clones in mixed infections. The difference was largest in immuno-compet mice and smallest in imm-def mice, explaining why suppression was alleviated in imm-def mice. Suppression occurred early in infection, before peak parasitemia. Results suggest innate immune clearance of meroites is likely mediator of competitive interactions between vir and avir clones. In mixed infections, interaction between clones and innate response induces changes in meroite clearance. This interaction is unknown, but refinement of model with other datasets may reveal it.
Researchers have proposed a new model, Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification (ODIR), to explain the generation of interstitial inverted duplications, a type of copy number variation (CNV) in the genome. This model suggests that replication errors at existing short, interrupted inverted repeats in genomic sequences create an extrachromosomal, autonomously replicating dimer, which integrates into the genome through homologous recombination, resulting in CNV without distal chromosomal loss. To test the feasibility of this model, a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches were used in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In vitro experiments showed that lagging and leading strands can be ligated to create closed forks at short inverted repeats, resulting in a hairpin linear duplex that replicates in vivo to form an inverted dimer plasmid. This plasmid integrates into the genome through homolog recombination, creating an inverted triplication. This model can explain human de novo, inverted amplicons with 2:1 mixture of sequences from homologues, a feature of plasm intermediate from one homologue integrating into other prior meiosis.
Researchers have investigated the process of translation initiation in cells infected with the influenza virus. They found that the virus can initiate translation at non-canonical start codons in response to stressful stimuli in mammalian cells. This can lead to the production of novel immune epitopes. The study analyzed the extent of alternate initiation in cells infected with influenza and found that selection against non-canonical initiation at CUG codons in virus lineages adapted to mammalian hosts. Ribosome profiling with lactimidycin was used to experimentally delineate initiation sites in human epithelial cells infected with influenza. Several alternate initiation sites in influenza mRNAs were identified, all occurring at AUG codons downstream of canonical codons. One candidate start site truncates 14 amino acids from N-terminus of N neuraminidase, resulting in loss of cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane domain. Truncated neuraminase is expressed on surface during infection, enzymatically active, and conserved in N1 lineages. No globally higher alternate initiation on host transcripts upon infection or antiviral response detected, but subset induced by antiv response enriched alternate sites.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHE) is a bacterial pathogen that causes severe diarrhea and potentially fatal hemolytic uremic syndrome, with no effective treatment or prophylaxis. HE and other enteric pathogens utilize type III secretion system (TSS) to inject virulence effectors into host cells, subverting cell function to promote disease and transmission. However, mechanisms of effector binding to host proteins and disrupting intestinal epithelial cell function are not fully understood. This study identifies E. coli O157:H7 Nle1 and Nle2 as TSS effectors that bind human ribosomal protein 3 (R3), a subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-enhancer of activated cells (NF-κ) transcription complexes. N1 and N2 co-localize with R3 in cytoplasm, not nuclei. N-terminal of N1 and N2 binds N-terminus R3. N1 and N2 are autophosphorylated Ser/Thr kinases, binding R3 independent of activity. N1 reduces R3 nuclear abundance without affecting p or p65 NF-κ subunits or phosphorylation/abundance inhibitory NF-κ chaper Iα N1 represses R3/NF reporter, not R-independent reporters. In contrast, N2 stimulates R3 and AP reporter. A region N1 (40-45) is responsible for inhibitory activity N toward R3. Deleting N from E. O:H produces hypervulent phenotype in gnotic pig model Shiga toxin E infection. N may disrupt host immune responses binding cofactor host transcriptional complexes.
A novel approach to modeling protein-DNA interactions is presented, focusing on transcription factor (TF) binding to its target DNA site. The traditional position-specific scoring matrix (PSM) model assumes independence between binding positions, but this simplification does not hold in many cases. A feature-based models (FMs) are introduced, a probabilistic method for TF-DNA interactions based on log-linear models, using sequence features to represent binding specificities where each may span multiple positions. The mathematical formulation of the model and an algorithm for learning features from binding data are developed. A discriminative motif finder is devised to discover novel FMs enriched in target sequences compared to background. The approach is evaluated on synthetic and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) dataset of Harrison et al. High-throughput TFIP data from mouse and human are analyzed, revealing features in binding specificities of mouse and human TFs, with FMs explaining TF binding better than PSMs.
Researchers investigated the regulation of the sympathetic nervous system in humans and chimpanzees, focusing on the adrenergic α2 receptor (AD2) gene, which acts as an inhibitory modulator of the sympathetic nervous system. Knockout mice lacking this gene exhibit physiological and behavioral changes associated with the fight-or-flight response, suggesting its importance in regulating stress response. Domesticated chickens show evidence of positive selection for this gene. The study found lower expression of AD2 in humans and chimpanzees compared to other primates. Three-dimensional chromatin structure analysis revealed a cis-regulatory region with accelerated in humans and chimpanze, with distinct histone marks in rhes macaque but not humanzee, and repressive marks in human brain samples. This region contains neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRS) motifs with polymorphisms. Genotyping analysis of population data showed both polymorphic alleles fixed in humans and chimpanze but not bonob, while ancestral allele present in macaque. CRISPR/C9 genome editing and reporter assays demonstrated derived nucleotides repress AD2, likely increasing NRS binding. Additionally, signatures of recent selection for lower AD2 expression in humans were detected. The study suggests selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic nervous activity in humans and chimpanze evolution.
Researchers conducted a comparative analysis of gene expression in two independent lineages of C4 photosynthetic plants, Cleome and Zea mays, which diverged 140 million years ago. They developed a new informatics framework to compare gene expression in species lacking reference genomes and identified 3,335 conserved genes in leaf and photosynthetic development. The study found that genes encoding the C cycle are recruited into networks by photosynthesis-related genes. Despite independent origins, both species use homologous transcription factors to induce C photosynthesis and maintain specific gene expression. A core molecular signature associated with leaf photosyn and maturation is shared among angiosperms derived from the common ancestor of monocots and dicots. The analysis reveals insight into molecular convergence of complex phenotypes and parallel evolution of transactors in C photosynthesis. Exploiting natural variation in complex traits can identify regulators. Shared transcription factors in C lineages are targets for engineering C pathway in C crops like rice.
An Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreak occurred in West Africa from 2013-2016, spreading to Europe and North America, infecting several healthcare workers (HCW). Understanding EBO infection patterns in different body compartments is crucial for developing countermeasures and comprehending human-to-human transmission pathways. This study longitudinally explored EBO-specific negative sense RNA (neg-RNA) and positive RNA (posRNA), including replication (intermediate-RNA) and messenger (mRNA) molecules in upper and lower respiratory tracts compared to plasma in a HC infected with EBO in Sierra Leone, hospitalized at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases "Lazz Spallani" (INMI) in Rome, Italy. Results showed persistence of pos-R and negRNAs in longitudinally collected lower respiratory specimens after plasma clearance, suggesting local replication. This study aims to enhance knowledge on EBO features contributing to human-to-human transmissibility and develop effective interventions. Further investigation is needed to understand clinical significance of replication in respiratory tract.
Researchers investigated the attenuation of Machupo virus (MAC) and Junin virus (JUN) using a recombinant chimeric virus (rMAC/Cd1-G) expressing the glycoprotein from the Candid1 (Cd1) strain of JUN. The study aimed to determine the role of different domains of the glycoprotein in attenuation and immunogenicity. A previous study showed that rMAC with a single F1 substitution in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of glycoprotein was attenuated in a murine model, but genetically unstable, and the T mutation alone was not sufficient to fully attenuate JUN. To investigate further, the researchers rescued rMAC expressing the ectodomain glyprotein from Cd1 alone (MC1), the TMD with F1 substitution (MC2), or the T of Cd (3). All rMAC exhibited similar growth in cultured cells. In mice, MC displayed significant reduction in lethality compared to rMAC. MC was detected in brains and spleens of MC-infected mice, associated with tissue inflammation. In contrast, animals survived MC and MC infection without detectable virus in organs, producing neutralizing antibodies against Cd. The study suggests the indispensable role of each glyprotein domain in full attenuation and immunogenicity of r/Cd-G.
Researchers investigated the function of the centromere histone 3 (CH3, also known as CEN-A) in Arabidopsis, a plant species. CH3 is crucial for the proper segregation of sister chromatids during mitosis and meiosis. To understand its functional constraints, a null allele of CH was complemented with various mutant alleles, each introducing a single amino acid change in the histone domain. Many transgenic lines displayed wild-type growth and fertility on self-poll, but exhibited postzygotic death and uniparent inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants. Mutations in the histone domain of CH3 resulted in centere failure, reproducing genome syndromes with chimeric CH3 and CH3 from diverged species. A single point mutation was sufficient to generate haploidy, providing a method for identification of non-transgenic haploids in mutagenized collections. An in silico search identified a point mutation in CH in an Arabidopsis line, A86 within the histone domain. This nongenic line, fertile on selfoll, produced postg death and unarent haplo when crossed wild-type.
Researchers investigated the role of alternative splicing in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) into cardiac precursors. They modified the H9 hESC line to allow for the selection of pluripotent ESCs by neomycin resistance and cardiac progenitors by puromycin resistance. Microarray data from undifferentiated ESCs and cardiac and neural precursors were used to identify isoforms with cardiac-restricted or common/neural differentiation patterns. Splice events corresponded to cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle control as well as ser/threonine kinase and helicase genes. Novel changes in protein and microRNA site architecture were predicted to affect function and expression, including isoforms opposing cell arrest in ESCs and promoting signaling and development in cardiac precursors.
Researchers investigated the role of trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase Ots B (Ots2) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) as a potential target for antimicrobial therapy. They created a conditional mutant of M. tuberculosis that allowed for the regulated silencing of the oB gene, which encodes the O enzyme responsible for converting trehal-6-phosphate (TP) to trehalose. The study found that oB is essential for the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro and during the acute phase of infection in mice, but not during the chronic phase. This suggests that M. tuberculosis remodels its trehal metabolism during infection. Blocking oB led to the accumulation of its substrate TP, which is toxic and causes cell self-poison. Blocking TP production in a mutant lacking the other enzyme in the trehal pathway, O, abrogated oB's essentiality. TP accumulation caused the upregulation of over 800 genes, likely due to increased RNA stability and neutralization of ribonuclease activity. A genome-wide screen for synthetic lethal interactions with o identified numerous genes, suggesting potential targets for combination therapies with oB inhibitors to prevent resistance.
Researchers have identified Trypanosoma cruzi proline racemase (TPR) as a potential target for improved chemotherapy against Chagas disease, a life-threatening illness affecting 11-18 million people. Current treatments have limited efficacy and safety profiles. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed conformation changes associated with substrate binding to TPR expose residues eliciting host mitogenic cell response, contributing to parasite persistence and immune evasion. However, standard simulations cannot capture long-time motions relevant to conformation characterization. Accelerated molecular dynamics extended simulation was used to capture large-scale motions of functional relevance. Conservation and fragment analysis identified conformation epitopes near transient binding pockets. Newly identified open TPR conformations and closed-open interconversion mechanism advance understanding of TPR function. This study contributes to rationalization of mitogenic cell response and provides insights for structure-based drug discovery.
Researchers have developed an inducible and reversible genetic system to study gene function in mice. The system, called iKO, enables the target gene to be turned on or off by treating mice with doxycycline. It consists of two genetically modified mouse lines: a knockout (KO) with a doxycycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous gene and a line with doxycine-inducible cDNA of the gene inserted into a tightly regulated (TRE) genomic locus. This locus occurs infrequently in the genome and a method was developed to introduce genes into TRE of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells by recombinase-mediated insertion. Both KO and TRE lines were engineered for high-throughput, large-scale and cost-effective production of iKO mice. As proof of concept, iKO mice were created in apolipoprotein (ApoE) gene, allowing sensitive and quantitative phenotypic analyses. Results showed reversible Apo transcription, plasma levels, cholesterol, and atherosclerosis progression, and regression. The i system demonstrates stringent regulation and versatility, easily incorporating other techniques and wide applications.
Researchers conducted a study to investigate the genetic response of the placenta to Trypanosoma cruzi infection in a mouse model. They infected C57/Bl6 mice with two different strains of the parasite: K98, a non-lethalotropic strain, and V, isolated from a human case of congenital infection. The study used functional genomics microarray analysis to compare the placentas of infected and uninfected mice. The results showed that the "secretory granule" pathway was downregulated in both infected groups, while "inmate immune response" and "response interferon gamma" pathways were upregulated in V but not K. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed downregulation of metabolic and macromolecular transport processes in infected placentas and opposite regulation of signaling pathways: overpresent in V and downregulated K. The study also found stronger tropism to the placenta by V strain, with detection of parasite DNA and RNA. This study is the first to describe the genetic response of placental environment to T cruz infection in a murine model and suggests a strong parasite-dependent immune response, detrimental to cellular metabolism, which may prevent congenital transmission risk.
Sindbis virus (SINV) polyarthritis, also known as Ockbo disease in Sweden and Pog disease in Finland, has been recognized in northern Europe for approximately 50 years. The virus is primarily found in tropical and subtropical regions, but has been suggested to cause recurring outbreaks in northern Europe. Seven-year cycles of SINV outbreaks have been reported, based on human cases. To identify a more objective outbreak signal, mosquito and SINV prevalence in vectors were evaluated in an endemic area in Sweden. Mosquitoes from the Riveräl floodplains were collected in 2001, 200, and 2002, and assayed for virus on cell culture. Obtained isolates were sequenced, and nucleotide sequences analyzed using Bayesian clade and joining analysis. One SINV strain was found in 200, four in 200, and 15 in 200, with increased infection rates in both enzotic and bridge vectors in 200. Maximum likelihood infection rates were 1.0/1000 in enotic Cx torrentipiens and 0.62/100 in bridge Aedes in 200, compared to 0.9/100 and 0/100 in 200 and 0/100 and 0.32 in 200. Sequence analysis showed all isolates belonged to SINV genotype I (S-I). Genetic analysis revealed four S-I clades maintained in Riveräl floodplains over years. Increased S-I prevalence in vectors constitutes a valuable marker for scrutinizing hypothesized seven-year S-I outbreaks and mechanisms.
In the locust olfactory system, dense, synchronized spike trains of neurons in the antennal lobe (AL) are transformed into a sparse representation in the mushroom body (MB), a region associated with memory. Recordings in vivo from the MB demonstrated highly specific responses to odors in Kenyon cells (KCs). Typically, only a few KCs from the recorded neurons population responded reliably to a specific odor. Different odors induced distinct responses in KCs. A biologically plausible model explored the possibility that plasticity controls synaptic weights to the MB to ensure KC specificity to familiar odors. Plasticity at synapses between AL and MB efficiently regulated tuning to selectively filter AL output and condense to sparse in MB. Activity-driven plasticity drove specificity, reliability, and persistence of odor representations, suggesting plastic role in processing and testable prediction at AL-MB synapses.
The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene (ST) study aimed to identify functionally associated genes involved in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) by analyzing transcriptional profiles of liver, skeletal muscle, and visceral fat tissues from atherosclerotic and unaffected arterial walls of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery. Two-way clustering of 278 transcription profiles resulted in 60 tissue clusters, with 395 genes. Atherosclerotic lesion and visceral fat clusters segregated patients into groups differing in coronary stenosis extent (P=0.008 and P=0.000). Associations with atherosclerosis were validated by carotid atheros expression profiles. One cluster relating caridosis (P=0.04) and 27 genes relating coronaryenosis were confirmed (n=16, P<−27−30). Genes in transendothelial migration leukocytes (TE) pathway were overrepresented in atherosclerosis module (A). In independent cohorts, A was enriched CAD by 1.8-fold (P0.004). Transcription-factor L domain binding 2 (L2) was identified as A regulator, supported by subnetwork, cellular and expression L2, and TE genes in L2-deficient wall. A appears important atherosclerosis development, with L2 merits CAD research.
Researchers have investigated the molecular mechanisms of the circadian clock in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis using genetic studies. They found that the KaiC protein, a central component of the circadian clock in cyanobacteria, is involved in both activating and repressing its own transcription. Over 24 hours, KaiC undergoes different phosphorylation states during the day. The study aimed to determine which phosphorylation state of KaiC promotes KaiC expression and opposes transcriptional activation. A combined transcriptional/translational feedback loop (TT/PT) model was developed, considering four phosphorylation states of Kai and transcriptional/translational feedback. Of 32 tested models, only one two-loop mechanism reproduced experimental observations, including effects of Kai gene knockout or overexpression. Phosphorylated Kai hexamers activate and unphosphorylated Kaiam suppress KaiC transcription. The model suggests that the peak ratio of positive and negative components of Kai expression is key to the two-loop model's response to Kai gene removal or overexpression. Parallels are drawn between the proposed TT/PT model and two-loop structures in the mammalian clock.
Researchers investigated the distribution of HIV-2 reservoirs in central memory CD4 T cells in individuals with attenuated HIV-2 infection. The study included 12 antiretroviral-naive individuals, 6 non-progressors and 6 progress, from the ANRS CO12 cohort. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were sorted into monocytes and CD4 subsets: naive, central memory (TCM), transitional (TM), and effector memory (TEM). HIV-2 reactivation was tested in 30-day cultures of CD8-depleted PBMC. HIV-2 DNA was quantified by real-time PCR. HIV-2 was undetectable in monocytes from all individuals and quantifiable in TM from 4 individuals (median: 2.25 x 10^6 cells) but in TC from only 1 (1.75 x 10^6). HIV- DNA in PBs (median: 1.94 x 10^6) correlated with TM (r=0.66, p=0.01) but not TC. HIV reactivation was observed in cells from 3 individuals. CCR5 co-receptor was distributed similarly in populations from individuals and donors. TC had lower CX6 transcripts (p=0.002) and higher TR5 (p=0.004) than TM. HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 by lack of monocyte infection and limited TC associated with lower CX6 and higher TR5.
A unifying Mechanistic Model of Selective Attention in Spiking Neurons

Researchers have long sought to understand how visual attention affects the activity and selectivity of cortical neurons. A new model, called the Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC), provides a mechanistic description of selective attention processing in the cortex. The model is mathematically implemented at the level of individual spiking neurons, with computations for selective attention mapped to specific neuron types and laminar circuitry. ARC is used to simulate studies of attention in macaques, quantitatively matching several forms of attentional modulation.

ARC demonstrates that shifts of spatial attention cause neurons to exhibit shrinking receptive fields and increased responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features. The effect on contrast-response is better explained as response-gain than contrast-gain. Unlike past models, ARC unifies forms of attention modulation, consistent with available data and makes specific predictions.
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a complex and heritable arrhythmia, with over 35 genes reported to be associated with it, but most identified through small candidate gene studies with limited replication. This study aimed to investigate the contribution of coding variation to AF susceptibility using whole-exome sequencing data from a large community-based sample of 1,734 individuals with AF and 9,423 without AF from the Framingham Heart Study, Cardiovascular Health, Atherosclerosis in Communities, and NHLBI-G Exome Sequencing Project. The sample consisted of individuals aged 59-73 years, with 8,656 (78%) of European ancestry. After adjusting for multiple testing, none of the 99,404 common variants evaluated were significantly associated with AF. A common missense variant in SYN2 (rs3819, p.Pro707Leu, odds ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.13-1.43, P6x10-5) was the most significantly associated, located at a known AF susceptibility locus and in linkage disequilibrium with a marker from prior analyses. No significant associations were observed between rare variants and AF in gene-based tests. Individuals with AF did not display statistically significant enrichment for common or rare variation in previously implicated AF genes. The study found no associations between coding variants and AF, suggesting large-effect variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying AF. A variant in SYN2 requires further evaluation to determine causality to AF. Large sample sizes or populations enriched for genetic effects may be required to identify biologically meaningful variation underlying AF.
Between 1990 and 2011, a total of 121 human alveolar echinoccosis (AE) cases were detected in Poland, with 83 (68.6%) classified as confirmed, 16 as probable, and 22 as possible. The detection rate of AE increased over the two decades. The average age at diagnosis was 47.7 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 0.86:1. The disease was fatal in 23% of patients, with an average age at death of 54.1 years. Four foci of AE were found, involving 9 patients, and 76 cases were diagnosed in an advanced stage. The liver was the primary location of AE in all cases, with spread to other organs observed in 24.8% of patients. Albendazole was used to treat 94 patients, with 73% undergoing surgery, including 15 liver transplants.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanism of the zinc-sensing zinc uptake regulator (Zur) protein in Escherichia coli to understand how microorganisms respond to dynamic changes in zinc availability. They solved the structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PnuABC promoter, revealing that the metal-regulatory protein represses gene expression by cooperative binding to adjacent dimers encircling the core of Zur-regulated promoters. Cooperativity in protein-DNA interactions requires a pair of salt bridges between Arg52 and Asp49. Analysis of the protein-DNA interface discovered a new member of the Zur-regulon, plG, which is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc-dependent manner. The plG promoter forms complexes with one or two dimers with less protein-DNA cooperativity than other regul promoters. In vitro-DNA binding affinity varies significantly across four-regul promoters, with a 10,000-fold difference in binding constants. In vivo, the degree of repression parallels this trend, with a 100-fold difference in transcript copy number between wild-type and Δur strains.
Rift Valley fever (RV) is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that causes significant morbidity and mortality in ruminants. In 2008-2009, a RV outbreak affected the whole island of Madagascar, including the Anjoabe district in the highlands. An entomological survey revealed the absence of Aedes among potential RV virus (RVV) vector species in the area, and low mosquito abundance due to unfavorable climatic conditions during winter. No serological nor virological signs of infection were observed in wild mammals, suggesting absence of RVV reservoir. However, three serological virological follow-up in cattle showed RVV circulation. A spatial deterministic metapulation model combined with cattle network was designed to reproduce local conditions using observational data. Three scenarios were analyzed: (i) RVV overwintering via direct transmission between vemic cows, vectors absent during winter, (ii) low vector circulation via residual population without direct transmission, (iii) combination of both. Multi-model inference resulted in incorporating low vector-borne transmission and direct between animals. Predictions satisfactorily reproduced observations, 84% attributed to vector-b transmission, 16 to direct. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis.
The Asian tiger mosquito, Aedes albopictus, is an invasive and aggressive daytime-biting species that poses a significant public health threat in its expanding range. To understand its historical and contemporary movements in the Indo-Pacific region, researchers analyzed 13 microsatellite loci from 911 individuals and mitochondrial COI sequences. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) was used to test competing invasion routes of Ae. albictus within the Southeast Asian-Australian region. Results indicate Ae. albict was introduced to New Guinea via mainland Asia, colonizing the Solomon Islands via Papua New Guinea or Asia. The incursion into northern Australia's Torres Strait was seeded from Indonesia. A recently colonized population in the Torres Islands shows rapid genetic changes, possibly due to drift or a secondary invasion from an unknown source. High genetic structure and gene flow exist between geographically distant populations, driven by human dispersal. The species' structure in the region favors dispersal by human movements. This study expands the species' native range, revealing more spatial structure than previously shown. ABC analysis provides the most probable invasion history in the Australasian region.
In a cross-sectional study conducted in the Mwanza region of North-West Tanzania, researchers investigated the impact of Schistosoma mansoni infection on the quality of life and physical fitness of 572 school-aged children. The prevalence of S. mansoni infection was 58.7% with a mean intensity of 207.3 (95% CI 169.2-245.4) eggs per gram. Most infections were light (56.5%), while 16.4% had heavy infections. Girls had significantly higher mean intensities than boys (247.4 (95% CI 189.2-305.6) vs 153.2 (110.6-195.8); P=0.004. Anemia was present in 30.1% with no sex difference. Stunting and wasting were less than 10% of the population. No association was found between S. mans prevalence or intensities and anthropometry, anemia, or spleen pathology in univar or multivar regression. However, infected children had lower emotional PQL (77.3 (74.5-80.1) than uninfected (82.7 (79.9-85.5); P=0.033) and higher VO2 (51.4 (51.0-51.8) compared to uninf (50.8 (50.3-51.3); P=0.042). In multivar regression, age, S. mans, hemoglobin, and VO max were predictors for emotional PQL, while predictors for VO max were PQL, height, age, and hemoglobin. S mans was not retained in multivar regression on VO max. S mans infection affected emotional quality of life but not physical fitness.
Leptirosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the spiroch Leptira, with wild rodents, including the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), serving as asymptomatic reservoirs. Experimental studies on Leptira colonization in rats have used intraperitoneal inoculation, but knowledge of rat-rat transmission requires natural inoculation routes, such as mucosal or subcutaneous. This study compared the effects of subcutaneous and mucosal inoculation to intraperitoneal inoculation during Lept infection in adult rats. Infection characteristics were studied using Leptira isolation, serology, and histological analyses. Lept infection was asymptomatic via each inoculation, with similar antibody production regardless of colonization. Renal colonization rates were 8/8, 5/8, and 1/8 for intraper, mucosal, and subaneous inoculation, respectively. Mucosal inoc was more efficient for renal colonization with urinary excretion than subaneous, and induced slower infection than intraper.
Researchers have identified a novel role for Annexin A2 (AnxA) in modulating the inflammatory response during polymicrobial sepsis, a disease characterized by excessive inflammation, tissue injury, and organ dysfunction, and high mortality. AnxA is a multifunctional protein that inhibits pro-inflammatory responses by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-17 signaling. In a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis models, An2-/- mice exhibited increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil infiltration, but decreased bacterial clearance and survival. An2 deficiency also led to increased ROS and IL-17 levels. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that cysteine 9 of AnxA is crucial for regulating ROS levels, and ROS is responsible for elevated IL-17 and exaggerated response. Depletion of IL-17 via CRISPR/Cas KO downregulated inflammation and conferred protection against seps in An2/- mice. This study reveals a previously unknown function of AnxA in inflammatory response in polymicrobial seps models via An2-ROS-IL-17 axis, providing insight into the pathophysiology of seps.
Researchers investigated the role of microRNA-155 (miR-155) in the anti-HIV-1 effects of Toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulation in macrophages. Macrophages play a key role in HIV-1 pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Polyinosine-polycidylic acid (poly I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ligands for TLR3 and TLR4, respectively, are known to decrease HIV-1 infection in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). The study found that poly I:C and L-stimulation of MDs abrogated infection by CCR5-using macrophageotropic HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudyped HIV-1 virions, while TLR, TLR or TLR agonists partially reduced infection to varying extent. Suppression of infection did not correlate with differential effects on CD or CCR expression, type interferon induction, or pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Integrated viruses were detected in unstimulated TLR and T9-stimulated cells, but not TLR or T4-stim MDs, suggesting alteration post-entry preintegration events. Microarray analysis and reverse transcription PCR found increased mi-155 levels in MDs upon T4 but not T-stimulation, and mi-155 inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly I-stimulated MDs. Ectopic mi-155 expression diminished HIV-1 in primary MDs and cell lines. Poly I-stimulation and ectopic mi-155 resulted in accumulation late products and undetectable or low integrated viruses 2TR circles. Reduced mRNA and protein levels several HIV factors involved trafficking/import preintegration (AD, TN, Nup, LED/p) found poly I-stim and mi- transfected MDs, reporter suggested authentic mi- targets.
Plants use daily light-dark cycles to regulate various physiological processes, including growth. In Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings, hypocotyl growth rates peak at different times of day depending on external photoperiod and internal circadian clock. However, interactions between light, circadian clock, and growth-promoting hormone pathways in growth are not well understood. To determine transcriptional component of rhythmic growth, Arabidopsis thaliana seedling transcriptome was analyzed under multiple growth conditions and mutant backgrounds using microarrays. A group of hormone-associated genes are co-expressed when hypocotyl growth is maximal. This correlates with overrepresentation of cis-element CACG in hormone promoters, sufficient to confer diurnal and circadian patterns in vivo. Circadian and light mutants show both internal hormone signaling and external coincidence with darkness are required for wild-type growth. Data suggest circadian controls growth by permissive light hormone levels at proper time.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to control Chagas disease vectors, such as Rhodnius prolix, by genetically modifying the insect microbiota to deliver RNA interference molecules to the gut. They used Escherichia coli HT115(DE3) expressing dsRNA for Rhodni heme-binding protein (RH) and catalase (CAT) to feed nymph and adult triatomine stages. RH is an egg protein and CAT an enzyme expressed in all developmental stages. The RNA interference was systemic and temporal. Concentrations of E. coli 115(DE) above 3.35 × 10^7 CFU produced significant RH and CAT gene knockdown in nymphs and adults. RH expression in the body was reduced by 99% three days after feeding, returning to normal levels 10 days after. CAT expression was reduced 99% and 96 in ovary and midgut, respectively, five after ingestion. Mortality increased 24-30 in first instars fed RH and CAT. Molting rates reduced 100 in first and 80 in third instars fed RH or CAT RNA. Oviposition reduced 43 RH and 84 CAT. Embogenesis arrested 16 RH and 20 of eggs. Feeding 105 CF/mL natural symbion Rhodoccus rhodii express RH-specific RNA reduced RH 89 and oviposition. Modifying insect microbiota induce RNA R prolix may result paratogenic strategy sustainable control.
Fever in pregnant women attending antenatal clinics on the Thaiurmese border was investigated from January 2004 to May 2006. A total of 409 febrile episodes occurred in 5.0% (438) of 117 pregnant women. Malaria was the main cause in 55.5% (227). A cohort of 203 women had detailed investigations and follow-up. Arthrop-borne diseases, ricketial infections, and dengue and zoonotic disease leptpirosis accounted for nearly half of febr illnesses, 47.3 (96). Coinfection was observed in 3.9 (8) of women, mostly malaria and ricketia. Pyonephritis 19.7 (40) was also a common cause of fever. Once malaria pyoneph and respiratory illness were excluded, one-third of remaining febr infections were caused by ricketia or leptpi. Scrub murine typhus was associated with poor outcomes, including stillbirth and low birth weight. One woman died without laboratory confirmation.
Researchers investigated the relationship between maternal age and recombination rates in humans using a panel of 600,000 genotyped markers in 69 French-Canadian pedigrees, revealing recombination events in 195 meioses. They observed general patterns of variation in fine-scale recombination rates previously reported in humans, but found a significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age, driven by chromosome-specific effects. This effect was localized to the middle of chromosomal arms and subtelomeric regions. The study suggests that recombination protection against non-disjunction becomes less efficient with advancing maternal age, contributing to higher aneuploidy rates in older women. A model reconciles findings with associations between maternal age and recombination in trisomies.
Researchers have developed a novel immunization strategy to induce innate immunity in macrophages in vivo, which provides long-lasting protection against opportunistic infections in individuals with compromised adaptive immune systems. Unlike traditional trained immunity models, this approach generates an innate-like memory phenotype in macrophages that persists for at least 70 days post-immunization and confers complete protection against secondary challenge in the absence of adaptive immune cells. RNA sequencing analysis of IFN-γ-primed macrophages revealed rapid upregulation of IF-γ and STAT1 signaling pathways following secondary challenge. Enhanced cytokine responses were pathogen-specific, dependent on histone methylation and acetylation, and correlated with increased STAT1 binding to promoter regions of genes associated with anti-fungal immunity.
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play a crucial role in transcriptional regulation and developmental processes in both plants and animals. In Arabidopsis, depletion of different PR components causes both overlapping and unique phenotypic defects. This study investigated the molecular mechanisms determining target specificity and functional diversity of PRs. Quantitative changes of tri-methylation at H3K27 in Arabidopsis mutants of various PR components were compared. CURL LEAF (CL), a major catalytic subunit of PR2, coordinates with members of PR1 in suppression of distinct developmental programs. Expression of flower development genes is repressed in seedlings via non-redund role of CL, associated with LIKE ETCHROMIN PROTEIN1 (LHP). In contrast, expression of embryo development is repressed PR-catalytic subunits AtBMI and AtRING in common with PR-catal enzymes CL or SWINGER (SW). This context-dependent role of CL corresponds with H3me profiles and associated co-occupancy of motifs transcription factors (TFs), including M box and A-related. Different PR members regulate distinct developmental programs and specificity modulated by TFs.
Researchers have investigated the "trigger loop" (TL) of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II, a subunit that plays a crucial role in substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation. To achieve this, they quantitatively phenotyped nearly all single variants of the TL at individual residue level. The study revealed three classes of mutants with distinct phenotypes linked to transcription defects or stress, with varying distributions among TL residues. Mutations disrupting the intra-TL hydrophobic pocket, proposed to facilitate substrate-trigger TL folding through destabilization of a catalytically inactive state, showed phenotypes consistent with pocket disruption and increased catalysis. Additionally, allele-specific interactions among TL and TL-proximal domain residues supported the contribution of the funnel and bridge helices (BH) to TL dynamics. This study combines structural and phenotypic data for high-resolution dissection of transcription mechanisms and evolution, and can be applied to other essential yeast proteins.
Researchers investigated the ability of rabies virus (RV) to invade the central nervous system (CNS) through hematogenous spread, in addition to neuronal transport. They infected mice intramuscularly (i.m.) or intravenously (i.v) with dog-associated DOG or silver-haired bat-associated SB RV. Clinical signs of rabies and virus spread were monitored using immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). i.m. infection with both variants caused lethal encephalopathy, while i.v. infection with SB resulted in lethal infection. qPCR showed no differences in virus loads in spinal cord or brain after i.m or i.v infection of SB. Immunohisto analysis revealed i.v administered SB directly infected the brain, with earliest affected regions being hypothalamic nuclei connected by neurosecret fibers to circumventricular neurohypophysis and median eminence. The study suggests hematogenous spread of SB can lead to fatal encephalopathy through retrograde invasion of CNS at neuro interface of hypothalamus-hypysis system. This alternative mode of spread has implications for post-exposure prophylaxis of rab, particularly silver bat-associated RV.
The H1N1 subtype of the influenza A virus has caused significant morbidity and mortality in humans since the 1918 global pandemic and continues to present day. Despite its impact, the evolutionary history of H1N1 is not well understood, particularly regarding the virological basis for notable epidemics of unusual severity in the 1940s and 1950s. A study of 71 complete genome sequences between 1918 and 200 reveals segmental reassortment played a role in the evolution of H1N1 since 1918. An H1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassort, which may explain the antigenic evolution of this virus. The 1951 influenza epidemic may have been associated with reassortant H1 viruses. Intra-subtype reassort appears to be a significant process in the evolution and epidemiology of HN1 influenza virus than previously thought.
A computational model of the ventral tegmental (V) circuitry and nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor function was used to investigate the mechanism of nicotine's reinforcing action. Nicotine stimulates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nACh) and increases dopamine (DA) output from the ventral tegmental area (V). Two theories exist: direct stimulation of DA cells through ACh activation or inhibition through desensitization of ACh on GABA interneurons. The model shows that αβ2-containing ACh receptors on DA or GABA cells mediate acute nicotine effects. Both in vitro and in vivo data are accounted for, and conditions for direct or inhibition to be the origin of DA increases are predicted. Experiments are proposed to disentangle both mechanisms. Endogenous acetylcholine input crucially determines evoked DA response for both mechanisms. The ventral tegmental area mediates nicotine's acute rewarding properties through acetylcholine dependence.
A randomized, double-blinded phase II trial was conducted in Kabul, Afghanistan from 2004 to 2008 to investigate a novel treatment for anthrocutaneous leishmanias (ACL) caused by Leishmania L. trop infection. The study involved 200 patients with ACL, who were randomly assigned to two groups: one received high-frequency electrocauterization (EC) followed by moist-wound treatment (MWT) with polyacrylate hydrogel, and the other received EC without sodium chlorite (DAC-055). Patients under 5, with facial lesions, pregnancy, or comorbidities were excluded. The primary outcome was time for complete epithelialization. Biops for parasitological and immuno histological analyses were taken before EC, after wound closure, and 6 months later. The mean time for wound closure was 59.1 days in the first group and 54.2 days in the second, with no significant difference (p=0.83). In patients with Leish-positive biops, DAC-055 caused faster epithialization (37.2 vs 58.3 days, p=0.08). Superfections occurred at the same rate (8.8%) in both groups, except for one patient with ulcer (10.2 in the first, 18.5 in the second, p=0.158), confined to cases with high parasite loads after healing. DAC-055 showed lemanicidal effect on amastigotes in vitro. The EC plus M protocol led to rapid closure, lower relapse rate compared to intraional injections.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila S2 cells to identify factors impacting RAS-mediated MAPK activation, leading to the discovery of 101 validated hits, including previously known regulators of the pathway. Epistasis experiments revealed new factors acting at various points along the pathway, including a protein modulating RAF activation and others influencing MEK and MAPK expression. Unexpectedly, most hits worked downstream of ME, specifically affecting MAPK levels, primarily through constitutive splicing. Two representatives of this group were characterized, found to regulate MAPK alternative splicing. This study provides a comprehensive view of factors modulating R/MAP signaling in Dophila, indicating pathway output is not solely reliant on classical events like RAF activation, but also MAP regulation. Additionally, splicing components can impact alternative splicing.
A retrospective study of 498 Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gatt isolates was conducted in Thailand to gain a better understanding of cryptococcosis in the country. The isolates were sourced from clinical, environmental, and veterinary samples, with 485 C. neoans and 13 C. gatt strains analyzed. The majority of strains (68.9%) were from males with a mean age of 37.97 years, with 88.5% of C. neoans and 37.5% C. gatt from HIV patients. URA-RP and M PCR fingerprinting revealed C. neoans type V (94.8%) regardless of source, with types II (2.4%), IV (0.2%), I (0.2%), and II (2.4%) found less frequently. Multilocus Sequence (ML) analysis identified 20 sequence types (ST) in the C. neoans/Catt species, with Thai isolates part of the global population, ST for Catt and ST82, 83, 137, 141, 172, and 173 unique to Thailand. Most Catt isolates were ST=VGb, identical to the virulent Vancouver outbreak, indicating Thailand as a stepping stone for global spread. The study found greater diversity and range of major types amongst Thai cryptococcal isolates than previously reported.
Researchers have investigated the role of transcription factor (TF) variation in the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks across 12 Drosophila species over 45 million years. They focused on the largest class of metazoan TFs, C2-His2 zinc finger (CH-ZF), and found that a significant fraction of CHF-1-1 orthologs exhibit variations affecting their DNA-binding specificities. Additionally, they identified diverging DNA-contact residues in 44% of shared domains between D melanogaster and other species. These diverging residues, found in 70% of D melanaster CHF genes and 26% of annotated TFs, show evidence of constraint, being conserved across phylogenetic clades and evolving slower than other residues. Variations were rarely found as polymorphisms within D melanaster population, indicating rapid fixation. Predicted specificities of these domains change across phylogen distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. Proteins with conserved CH domains are enriched in developmental functions, while those varying exhibit no enrichments. This study suggests a subset of dynamic and understudied TFs contribute to regulatory variation in Dophila and metazoa.
Researchers have developed serotype-specific PCR assays for Salmonella enterica serotypes Typhi and Paraty A, the causative agents of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, to accelerate diagnosis and overcome the lack of typing sera and reliance on culture in some cases. The assays' sensitivity and specificity were validated on a large collection of strains representing the targeted serotypes and other bacteria causing similar symptoms. A family of repeated DNA sequences, CRIS (clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats), was used as a serotype target. A conventional multiplex PCR and EvaGreen-based real-time singleplex assays were developed for detection and differentiation of serotypes Typhi and Paraty A from cultured isolates. The assays achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity after validation on 188 serotype Typhi and 74 ser Paraty A strains from diverse genetic, geographic, and time origins and 70 strains of frequently encountered in bloodstream infections, including 29 Salmonella serotypes and 42 other species.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch signaling in the differentiation of CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells during infection with Leishmania major, a protozoan parasite. Notch receptors Not1 and Not2 are expressed on CD4 T cells and regulate cell development, but their role in Th1 polarization is unclear. Mice with T-cell specific deletion of Not1, Not2 (Not2CD4) were infected with Leish major and developed unhealing lesions and uncontrolled parasitemia. Susceptibility correlated with impaired IFγ secretion by lymph node CD4 T cells and increased IL-5 and IL-13 cytokines. Mice with single inactivation of Not1 or Not in T cells were resistant to infection and developed a Th1 response, showing CD T cell expression Not or Not is redundant in Th1 differentiation. Notch signaling is required for IFγ secretion by Th cells, independent of CSL/RBPκ, Not major effector. Mice with RBPκ deletion in T cells developed IFγ-secre Th cells, killed parasites and healed lesions. This study demonstrates a crucial role for RBPκ-independent Notch in Th1 differentiation following Leish infection.
A study investigated the relationship between Schistosoma mansoni infection and susceptibility to systemic SHIV C infection in rhesus macaques after mucosal exposure. Individuals living in sub-Saharan Africa represent 10% of the world's population, but 2/3 of all HIV/AIDS cases, suggesting a disproportionate HIV infection rate in the region may be linked to helminthic infections. This study tested the hypothesis that parasite infection increases HIV susceptibility in a relevant in vivo model. Two groups of rhes monkeys, one normal and infected with Schosoma, were challenged intrarectally with decreasing doses of R-tropic clade sim-human immunodeficiency virus SH-C. Systemic infection occurred in parasitized monkeys at viral doses subfect in normal hosts. The 50 animal infectious SH-C dose was 17-fold lower in parasitized compared to controls. Coinfected animals had higher viral loads than controls, as well as viral replication in CD+ central cells.
Researchers have developed a biophysical model to study the effects of acetylcholine (ACh) modulation on neural excitability and its impact on cortical activity patterns. The model consists of Hodgkin-Hux-type neurons with an M-current regulated by ACh, demonstrating three distinct functional regimes: localized, asynchronous, traveling, and synchronous activity patterns. These regimes qualitatively match experimentally observed cortical activity during slow wave sleep (SWS), REM, and waking states. During SWS, traveling patterns occur in the cortex, while in other states, stationary patterns are present. The model shows that regulation of ACh level can account for dynamical changes between regimes. Reduction of A-current magnitude recreates the reduction in spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) and shift in phase response curve (RC) observed in presence of ACh. When SFA is minimal (waking or REM state, high A), patterns are localized and easily pinned by network inhomogeneities. When S is present (decreasing A), traveling activity arise. Further decrease in A leads to high synchrony within waves. The model also shows A level determines network sensitivity to synaptic heterogeneity. These regimes may have functional significance: stationary patterns may encode external input as memory, while traveling could lead to synaptic regularization.
Researchers investigated the impact of mutations in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway on the development of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). They analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 171 EAC patients and found that non-synonymous mutations affected the TLR pathway in 25/171 (14.6%) of tumors (p= 8.7x10-5). TLR mutant cases were associated with more proximal and metastatic disease, suggesting clinical significance. Rare mutations were identified in Barrett's esophagus samples. The findings were validated in an external EAC dataset with non-syn TLR pathway mutations in 33/149 (22.1%) tumors and other tumor microbiomes in the COSMIC database (10,318) including uterine endrioid carcinoma (188/320, 58.8%), cutaneous melanoma (377/988, 38.2%), colorectal adenocarcin (402/151, 26.5%), and stomachocarcin (151/579 26.1%). TLR4 was the most mutated gene with eleven in 10/171 (5.8%) EAC tumors. TLR mutants E439, S570, F703, and R787 had impaired reactivity to lipopolysaccharide with reduced signaling in lucifer reporter assays. The study shows TLR genes are recurrently mutated in EAC and TLR mutations may play a role in disease in a subset of patients.
Researchers investigated the development of taste cells in mice using a combination of in silico and in vivo analyses to understand the molecular regulation of the taste system. They found that taste receptor calcium signaling molecules (TRMs) colocalized within the developing circumvallate papillae (CVP) and used computational analysis to identify a common regulatory network for TRM transcription. Hes1 was identified as a likely regulatory factor and its function examined in vivo. Expression analyses showed that decreased nuclear H1 correlated with type II taste cell markers. After E18, the CVP of H1-/- mutants had 5-fold more TRM-immunactive cells than the CVP of wild-type littermates. The study suggests H1 plays a role in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing buds.
Researchers investigated the relationship between ethylene and auxin in regulating root growth in rice seedlings, a monocotyledonous plant differing from dicotyledonous Arabidopsis. They found that transcription activation of OsIL on YUC8 expression and indole-3-pyruvic acid (IPA)-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Using an inhibitor of YUC activity, which regulates auxin biosynthesis via conversion of IPA to indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), they showed ethylene-inhibited primary root elong is dependent on Y-based auxin biosynthesis. A rice mutant, rein-1, insensitive to ethylene, was identified with Y8RE7 truncated at C-terminus, reducing auxin biosynthesis. Overexpression of YRE7 enhanced ethylene sensitivity in roots. Y7 catalyzed IPA to IAA conversion, C-terminal truncation of Y7 reduced enzymatic activity, indicating Y7 required for IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis and eth-inhibited elong. Ethylene induced Y7 expression and promoted auxin accumulation in roots. Low IAA concentrations rescued eth response in rein-1, demonstrating eth-in elong depends on IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. Genetic studies revealed Y7-mediated auxin biosynthesis functioned downstream OsIL, directly activating Y7 expression.
A nationwide epidemiological study was conducted in Saudi Arabia to investigate the trend of nontuberc mycobacterial (NT) diseases, which are reportedly increasing globally. The study collected 527 isolates over 24 months, identifying species through probe assays and 16S rRNA, 16-23S ITS, rpo, and hsp gene sequencing. Results showed 76.5% of isolates were from Saudi citizens, 34.2% were over 60 years old, and 65.3% were male. 75.1% were pulmonary, with 44.7% clinically significant. 34 NT species, including 17 rare, were identified, with M. simiae (22.6%), M. fortuit (18.1%), and M. absus (17.8%) predominant. M. riyense, a rare species, was found in 27 cases. Rare events like mycobacteremia, abscess, peritonitis, and ascites were caused by M wolii, hatic, duii, and mac respectively. Diabetes (p-0.04) and TB history (p-0.001) were risk factors for NT diseases.
Yeast cells' chronological lifespan is dependent on the accumulation of carbohydrates mediated by Yak1, Mck, and Rim15 kinases. When yeast cells are starved of glucose or other macronutrients, they exit the mitotic cell cycle and acquire characteristics specific to quiescent cells to ensure longevity. Researchers used starvation-specific reporters to screen a yeast library of genes encoding signaling proteins. Apart from previously characterized Rim15, Mck, and Yak1 kinases, the SN1/AMP complex, cell integrity pathway, and cell cycle regulators were necessary for quiescence establishment and lifespan extension. Quies entry requires integration of starvation signals via multiple pathways. Signaling mutants and single, double, and triple mutants of Rim15, Yak1, and Mck correlate with carbohydrate accumulation and cell cycle status. Removal of glycogen and trehalose biosynthetic genes, especially GSY and TPS, abolishes carbohydrate accumulation and reduces lifespan. Overexpression of GSY and T1 or trehalose supplementation ameliorates lifespan defects in Rim15y1 or Rimck mutants. Intracellular reactive oxygen levels are controlled by Yak, Rim, and Mck, and mediate TOR-regulated carbohydrate accumulation and lifespan. Data support metabolic reprogramming to accumulate energy and antioxidant systems coordinated by Yak, Rim, and Mck to ensure quies and lifespan.
Influenza A Virus Hemagglutinin Glycosylation Compensates for Antibody Fitness Escape Costs

Seasonal influenza A and B viruses persist in human populations despite widespread immunity due to rapid antigenic evolution. Understanding the mechanisms of antigenic evolution is crucial for designing durable vaccines and therapeutics. Researchers used primer error-correct viral sequencing to reveal an unexpected role of hemagglutinin (HA) glycosylation in compensating for fitness defects from anti-HA antibody escape. Antibody-free propagation of antigenic escape viruses selected mutations modulated receptor binding through N-glycans addition to the HA globular domain. These findings expand understanding of viral mechanisms maintaining fitness during antigen evolution include glycan addition. High-definition sequencing revealed novel adaptive mechanisms.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of ventricular myocyte models to investigate the possibility of forward rate dependence, a property of antiarrhythmic drugs that would theoretically overcome reverse dependence on heart rate. They simulated populations of myocytes with varying properties and analyzed results statistically to predict rate-dependent effects on multiple parameters. The study tested 40 parameters in each model and assessed action potential (AP) duration at slow (0.2 Hz) and fast (2 Hz) rates. The analysis identified various forward rate-dependent (FR) ionic perturbations and specific mechanisms, including an increase in L-type calcium current FR accompanied by indirect rate-dependent changes in delayed rectifier potassium current. Comparison across models revealed inward rectifier potassium and sodium-potassium pump as likely targets for FR prolongation. Statistical analysis showed models with minimal rate changes in AP shape have little FR potential, whereas those with large shape changes have considerable FR. This study provides insights into determinants of AP duration dependence and a strategy for designing beneficial antiarrhythmic drugs.
Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PAS) is a method used to investigate whether genetic polymorphisms associated with a phenotype are also associated with other diagnoses. This study developed a new approach to perform PW based on ICD-10 codes and biological results, using a quantitative trait as a criterion. The approach was tested on thiopurine-methyltransferase (TPM) activity in patients treated with thiopur drugs. Two methods were developed for ICD-10 codes: I-10 hierarchy and mapping to existing I-9M PW codes. Eleven biological results were analyzed using discretization algorithms. The methods were applied to patients with TP activity from a clinical warehouse of a French hospital between 200 and 201. Data after initiation of thiur treatment were analyzed and groups compared according to TP level. A total records were analyzed representing I-10 codes and biological results. Results from I-9 PW codes and I-10 codes were concord. Cross-validation with biological results validated I phenotypes. Iron-deficiency anemia and mellitus were associated with high TP activity p and respectively. An original method was developed to perform PW on quantitative using I-10 codes and biological results to identify phenotypes. In pharmacogenomics, PW allows identification of subgroups requiring personalized management.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of stem cell transplantation on motor and sensory outcomes in animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI). One hundred and fifty publications using 45 different stem cell preparations met the inclusion criteria, with only one using autologous stem cells. Allogenic stem cell treatment improved motor function by 27.2% (95% CI 25.0-29.3) in 5,628 comparisons and sensory function by 26.3 (95 CI 7.9-44.7) in 473 comparisons. Heterogeneity in sensory outcomes was largely due to stem cell biology. Differentiation, implantation route, and intravenous delivery favored better outcomes. Cell implantation did not improve sensory outcomes in females, but was enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. A dose-response relationship supported biological plausibility. Motor outcomes showed little effect from stem biology, with heterogeneity due to experimental design and outcome measures. Location, injury method, and immunosuppression impacted outcomes. Reporting bias was higher than in neuroscience, but still suboptimal. Motor studies without blinded outcome assessment overestimated efficacy. Recent preclinical literature suggests stem-cell therapies may offer promise, but internal validity and publication bias likely lower efficacy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the patterns and dynamics of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) reinfection after treatment. The review included 154 studies, with 51 providing STH infection rates pre- and post-treatment, and 42 reporting determinants of predisposition to reinfection. The results showed that Ascaris lumbricoid (A. lumic) reinfection prevalence reached 26% (95% CI: 16-43) at 3 months, 68 (95 CI 60-76) at 6 months, and 94 (95 CI 88-100) at 12 months post-treatment. Trichuris trura (T. trura) reinfection prevalence was 36 (95 CI 28-47) at 3, 67 ( CI 42-100) at 6, and 82 ( CI 62-100 at 12 months. Hookworm reinfection was 30 ( CI 26-34 at 3, 55 CI 34-87 at 6, and 57 CI 49 at 12. Prevalence and intensity of reinfection were positively correlated with pre-treatment status. STH reinfections occurred rapidly after treatment, particularly for A. lum and T. tr. The study suggests frequent anthelmint drug administrations are needed to maximize the benefit of preventive chemotherapy.
Researchers investigated the deregulation of metabolic processes in nonalcoholic liver disease (NAFLD) using a novel approach called Minimum Enrichment Analysis (MiA) applied to mouse and human omics data. NAD is a spectrum of diseases ranging from simple steatosis to complex nonal steatohepatitis. Traditional pathway analysis requires predefined maps, which can be biased due to differing annotations and cannot capture complex interactions. MiA generates minimal networks (Mi) from genome-scale metabolic networks (Gs) for any target metabolite, allowing for unbiased analysis. MiA was applied to identify deregulated Mi in NAD phenotypes, such as fatty liver and inflammation in humans and mice, using liver transcriptomics data. Key deregulations were found in cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, and hexadecate synthesis in both humans and mice. Regulators of hydrogen peroxide synthesis differed between humans and mice. Specific MiNs characterized different NAD phenotypes. MiA is applicable to any G and target metabolite, making it flexible for studying metabolism in any disease or organism.
Primacy coding, a method of encoding odor identity by the types of receptors that respond earliest, provides a compact and efficient representation that can be interpreted by the brain. A model simulations and statistical analysis show that the encoded information depends on the number of receptor types in the primacy representation, but not the size of the receptor repertoire. The representation is independent of odor intensity, and the transmitted information is useful for olfactory tasks similar to experimentally measured. Interestingly, a smaller receptor repertoire can be advantageous for discriminating odors. The model suggests overly sensitive receptors can dominate the response, making the array useless, allowing prediction of receptor adaptation to environmental changes. Primacy is more useful than binary or normalized coding, as sparsity of representation is independent of odor statistics, unlike alternatives. This efficient representation is independent of intensity, aiding odor identification in the olfactory cortex.
Researchers investigated the neutralization profiles of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (bnMA) against HIV, specifically PG9, PG16, PGT, and P152, which have shown unusual non-sigmoid slopes and plateaus at 100% neutralization. The study aimed to determine the extent of non-sigmoid slopes and plateaus 100 for bnMA in general. A panel of 278 pseudoviruses in a CD4 T-cell (87 CCR5 CX4) assay and 117 viruses in TZ-bl assay were used. Results showed that bnMA targeting various epitopes of the spike had neutral profiles at least one that plateaued 90. Across both panels, bnMA targeting V apex of Env and gp were most likely to show neutral curves plateau 100. Conversely, bn targeting high-mann epitopes were less likely to show behavior. CD binding Abs also showed this relatively infrequently. Incomplete neutralization was observed in PBMC-grown virus panel from patient swarms. Five bnMA were compared against 18-virus clones in 293 cells PBs and assayed TZ-bl. Plateaus 90 were seen both types virus with no patterns. Incomplete neutralization and nonigmoid neutral curves possible all bnMA wide viruses assayed cell lines primary cells implications use antibodies therapy vaccine design.
Cancer cells exhibit distinct metabolic traits, including aerobic lactate production from glucose (Warburg effect) and glutamine utilization, along with impaired mitochondrial electron transport. To understand how these rearrangements contribute to cancer cell proliferation, a model of human central metabolism was used for constraint-based simulations. Sampling the feasible space yielded numerous simulated cells with varying glutamine and glucose uptake rates. In a subset of proliferating cells, glucose fermentation to lactate occurred in the presence of oxygen at high glutamine rates, while glucose oxidation decreased and lactate production from glutamine increased. This phenotype emerged when carbon exceeded oxygen's oxidizable amount. Flux Analysis showed this pattern optimizes biomass and ATP production, requiring branched TCA cycle, glutamine reductive carboxylation for lipid and protein production, and redox-controlled reactions. In a K-ras cell line, glutamine metabolic changes were experimentally assessed, validating computational predictions through Flux Balance. Findings provide insight into metabolic reprogramming underlying cancer growth.
Researchers investigated the interactions of the prion protein (Pr) and its mammalian paralogs, Doppel (PrPnd) and Shadoo (Spr), in a cell culture model permissive to prion replication. They found a similar physiological environment for the prion family members in neuroblastoma cells and direct interactions between them. The study also confirmed interactions between Pr and the cell adhesion molecule laminin, Na+/K ATPases, and protein disulfide isomerases (PDI). Experiments showed that Pr interactions with PDIs extend beyond the endoplasmic reticulum and may play a role in PrSc accumulation. A hypothesis was proposed that Pr organizes its environment through binding to adhesion molecules with immunoglobulin-like domains, recognizing oligann-bearing membrane proteins.
During influenza virus infection, a robust type 1 pro-inflammatory cytokine response is typically induced, but type 2 cytokines are also produced. Type 2 cytokines are linked to asthma exacerbation, but may also provide protection. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a type 2 cytokine essential for eosinophil maturation and egress from the bone marrow. In a mouse model of influenza infection, IL-5 was released into airways and eosinophils accumulated in lungs, particularly during recovery. The source of IL-5 was group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC) in lungs. Eosin accumulation after virus clearance was due to rapid expansion of c+ IL-5 producing ILC. IL-5 production by ILC was enhanced with IL-33 receptor subunit ST2 expression. NKT and alveolar macrophages (AM) produced IL-33 enhancing IL-5 from ILC.
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (NT) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa. However, the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of NT disease in Asia are not well-documented. This study retrospectively identified 102 cases of NT infections in an infectious disease hospital in Southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013. Clinical records were accessed to evaluate demographic and clinical factors associated with NT infection and identify risk factors with death. Multi-locus typing and antimicrobial susceptibility was performed on organisms. Results showed 71% of NT patients were HIV-infected, 90% were adults, 71 were male, and 33 reported intravenous use. 26/92 (28%) patients with known outcome died, HIV was associated with death (p=0.039). Enteridis Sequence (ST) 11 (48/89) and Typhimium (ST 19,34, 44) (26/23) were most identified serovars. Tyim was common in HIV-infected (p=0.003). Isolates HIV-inf were likely exhibit reduced susceptibility trimethoprim-sulfamox than HIV-negative (p=0.037). NT disease is severe in Vietnam with high mortality. In sub-Saharan, HIV risk death factor, majority burden HIV-inf adult men.
Researchers have developed an artificial neural network (ANN) method to identify viral and phage structural proteins, which are crucial for viral survival and pathogenicity. These proteins are involved in lysogenic conversion, nutrient redistribution, and cell lysis, and their analysis provides insights into viral impact on microbial communities and human health. However, phage ORFs are diverse, with over 70% dissimilar to annotated genes in GenBank. Accurate identification is essential for disease detection, diagnosis, vaccine development, and environmental understanding. Unlike enzymes, structural proteins are challenging to detect from sequence data due to low conservation, few conserved catalytic sites, and limited data. The ANN method uses amino acid frequency to classify viral proteins, achieving high specificity and sensitivity. Adding isoelectric point as a feature improves classification, especially for major and tail proteins. Experimentally validating predictions, several ORFs with no similarities were examined by transmission microscopy, forming structures resembling virions. This ANN is a new tool for identifying phage and prophage proteins undetectable by bioinformatic analysis.
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSH) is a oncogenic virus with a large genome encoding over 85 proteins, including unique and conserved herpesviral proteins. SH ORF20, a member of the herpesiral UL24 family, has unknown function and role in the viral life cycle. OR20 encodes three uncharacterized isoforms predominantly localized in nuclei and nucleoli. Quantitative affinity purification coupled mass spectrometry (q-APMS) identified OR20 interacting partners, including ribosomal and interferon-stimulated gene (IS) oligenylate synthase-like (OL) protein. Both endogenous and transiently transfected OL co-immoprecipitated OR20, conserved among OR20 isoforms and UL24 homologs in herpesviruses. Characterization OL partners q-MS identified similar interactome OR20. OR20 and OL copurified 40 and 60 ribosomal subunits, coexpressed associated polysomes. OR20 did not affect translation, but enhanced R-I expression endogenous OL IR-dependent IFN-independent manner. OL characterized IS antiviral activity against some viruses, role gammaherpesviruses unknown. OR20 and OL expression induced after reactivation latently infected HuLTSH.219 cells. Intriguingly, OL enhanced KSH infection. During KSH OR20 mutant, OL-dependent infectivity lost.
In a prospective study conducted at the Children's Emergency of Irrua Teaching Hospital in Nigeria, researchers investigated the prevalence of Lassa fever virus disease (LVD) in febrile children with and without convulsions in an endemic area with multiple virus lineages. A total of 913 feile children aged 1-15 years were admitted over a year, of whom 373 (40.9%) had fever, and 108 (29%) presented with convuls. The overall prevalence of LVD was 13/373 (3.5%; 95% CI 1.9, 5.7) in feile admissions, 3/108 (2.8%) in cases and 10/265 (3.8) in controls. The odds ratio of LVD in cases versus controls was 0.73 (95 CI 0.2, 2.7). Vomiting and bleeding were significantly associated with increased prevalence of L. L is an important cause of undifferentiated fever in children in endemic areas, but not significantly associated with convuls fever.
Researchers investigated the role of the karri receptor KAI2 in drought resistance in Arabidopsis thalian, a model organism commonly used to study plant biology. Drought significantly reduces crop yields worldwide, making it essential to identify new factors that regulate drought resistance. Karri (KARs) are butenol compounds found in smoke that promote seed germination and improve seedling growth under stressful conditions. Mutations in the KARRINSENSITIVE2 (KAI) gene, encoding the karri receptor, resulted in hypersensitivity to water deprivation. Transcriptomic, physiological, and biochemical analyses of k2 plants revealed increased water loss and drought-induced membrane damage, enlarged stomatal apertures, and higher cuticular permeability. Additionally, k2 plants had reduced anthocyan biosynthesis during drought and hypersensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA) in stomatal and cotyledon assays. Genome-wide transcript analysis identified genes associated with observed physiological and biochemical changes in k2 under well-water and dehydration conditions. Data suggest crosstalk between ABA and K2-dependent pathways in drought responses. Comparison to strigact receptor d14 (DWAR14) indicated stract also contributes to drought adaptation, but not cuticle development. Findings suggest chemical or genetic manipulation K2 and14 may improve drought resistance.
Researchers have investigated the role of insulin signaling in the growth, development, maturation, and egg production of adult Schistosoma japonicum parasites. They focused on the insulin receptors (SIR) of Schistosoma japonicum, which were previously cloned and partially characterized. The study found that human insulin binds to the L subdomain (insulin binding domain) of recombinant SIR1 and SIR2 (SLD1 and SLD2) produced using the Drosophila S protein system. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knock down the expression of SIR in adult Schosoma japon in vitro, resulting in reduced transcription levels of downstream genes in the insulin pathway associated with glucose metabolism and schosome fecundity. Additionally, a decrease in glucose uptake was observed in SIR-knockdown worms compared to luciferase controls. In vaccine challenge experiments, rSLD and SLD reduced growth, intestinal granuloma density, and faecal production in Schos japon in mice with low dose infection. These findings emphasize the potential of SIR as vaccine candidates against zoonotic schosomiasis in China and the Philippines.
Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a significant cause of disability in the Pacific region, affecting over 96% of the 1.7 million population at risk of infection. Mass drug administration (MDA) has reduced lymphatic filariasis prevalence, but vector biology complicates the MDA strategy in some regions. The goal of LF elimination cannot be attained via MDA alone in some areas. Obligate mosquitoes provide additional targets for breaking the LF cycle, but existing methods are ineffective for controlling the primary vector, Aedes aegypti, in the South Pacific. This study demonstrates that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in Aedes aegypt (CP strain) stably infected with endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria from Aedesalbopictus. The CP strain is bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays show CP males are equally competitive, leading to population elimination when introduced into wild Aedes aegpt populations.
A study was conducted to quantify the burden of Rhodesian trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Uram District, Tanzania, a highly endemic area for the disease. Data from 143 patients admitted in 2004 for treatment at Kali Health Centre were analyzed. Direct and indirect costs incurred by patients and health services were calculated. Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) were estimated using methods from the Global Burden Disease Project and previous H estimates, assuming 45% underreporting. The estimated DALYs for AT in Uram with and without weighting were 215.7 (95%CI:155.3-287.5) and 281.6 (95%CI:209.1-362.6) respectively. When 45% underreporting was included, results were 622.5 (95%CI:155.3-109.9) and 978.9 (95%CI:201.1-187.8). The cost of treating 143 patients was estimated at $15,514, with patients paying $3,673 and health services $11,841. Indirect non-medical costs for 143 patients were estimated at $9,781. The study shows AT imposes a significant burden on rural communities in Tanzania, highlighting the need for location-specific disease burden estimates in countries like Tanzania, where diseases are often concentrated in certain areas.
Mice lacking the Ngly1 gene, a de-N-glycosylating enzyme, exhibit embryonic lethality in C57/BL6 background. However, deletion of the Eng gene encoding endo-β-N-acetylglucosidase, another de-glycosylase, rescues this lethality. This enzyme removes GlcNAc from glycosylated Asn residues. C57/6 mice crossed with ICR outbred strain partially rescues embryonic lethality of Ng1-deficient mice. Viable Ng1-deficient mice in C57/6 and ICR background show severe symptoms of NGL1-deficiency. Defects are suppressed by Eng deletion in C57/6 and ICR background. Ng1/Eng-deficient (C57/6) and Ng1-def (57/ICR) mice resemble symptoms of N1-def patients. These findings suggest Ng1 or Ng1Eng-deficient mice as models for N1 pathogenesis and cytoplasmic ENG as therapeutic target.
Researchers investigated the role of gene expression noise in the patterning of the hunchback (hb) gene in fruit fly (Drosophila) segmentation. The hb gene is activated by a maternal gradient of the Boid (B) protein, and its regulation is subject to intrinsic noise, which can lead to variable expression variability. To understand how this noise is controlled, the study characterized the dependence of hb mRNA and protein output on promoter structure and transcription dynamics. A stochastic model of the hb promoter was developed, varying the number and strength of B and hb self-regulatory binding sites. Parameters were fit to data from wild-type (WT), self-regulatory mutant hb14, and lacZ reporter constructs with different portions of the promoter. The model was corroborated experimentally. Results showed that WT self-regulatory hb noise is primarily dependent on transcription and translation dynamics, not B fluctuations. Constructs lacking self-regulation indicated multiple B binding sites in the promoter and their strengths also buffer noise. The model was robust to variation in B binding site number across species. This study identifies how promoter structure and dynamics reduce hb noise, features common in many genes, contributing to understanding of reproducibility and determinacy in early development.
Researchers have quantified the strength of selection against Neanderthal introgression in modern humans by developing a novel method to estimate genome-wide selection strength and density using Neander allele frequencies in modern human genomes. They found that East Asians had higher initial Neander ancestry than Europeans after accounting for selection. The majority of purifying selection against Neander ancestry acts on weakly deleterious alleles, which were likely neutral and segregating at high frequency in Neanderals but became selected against in human populations of larger size. These alleles had small individual effects but imposed a heavy load on early human-Neander hybrids. Effective population size may play a greater role in shaping introgression than previously thought.
Researchers have investigated the control of stochastic gene expression by host factors at the HIV promoter, specifically the long terminal repeat (LTR), which orchestrates various aspects of the viral life cycle, including gene expression and replication, and establishment of a latent state. After integration into the host genome, fluctuations in viral expression amplified by the Tat feedback loop contribute to either a productive or inactive state. In a fraction of cells harboring an integrated HIV-1 provirus, bimodal gene expression is dynamic, switching between active (Bright) and inactive (Off) modes, contributing to establishment and maintenance of latency. The HIV promoter contains cis-acting Sp and NF-κ elements regulating expression via recruitment of activating and repressing complexes. The interplay of positive and negative factors modulates stability of Bright and Off modes and viral expression sensitivity to fluctuations in Tat loop. Using lentivirus variants with mutations in Sp and NFκ elements, researchers employed flow cytometry, mRNA quantification, pharmacological perturbations, and chromatin immunoprecitation to reveal differences in contributions to gene regulation. Sp sites stabilize both Bright and Off states, mutation promoting noisy expression and reduction in histone acetylation deacetylation. NFκ sites exhibit distinct properties,κ I serving a stronger role than II. Sp site plays a role in recruitment of p300 and Rel to promoter. Analysis of 362 clonal cell populations revealed mutations in Sp sites yield 6-fold higher frequency bifcation compared to wild-type. Each Sp and NFκ site differentially contributes to regulation, Sp functionally modulating transcription noise and maintenance of model latency.
Accurate genome-wide identification of orthologs is a crucial in comparative genomics, with numerous orthology projects developed in recent years. However, few have compared their accuracy, and several have not been systematically evaluated. Orthology is typically assessed in terms of function, despite phylogeny's original definition. This study collected results of nine orthology methods (CO, KOG, Inparan, OrthM, Ensembl Com, Homene, Round, EggG, and OMA) and two standard methods (bidirectional best and smallest) and compared their predictions with respect to phylogeny and function using six tests. Phylogenetic or functional analysis with high specificity found OMA and Homene best. At lower specificity but higher coverage, OrthM outperformed Ensembl and to extent Inan. Egg's large coverage can be for broad grouping, but not specific phylogen or function. In methodology, Ensembl's complex approach outperformed pairwise, even phylogen tests. Bidirectional best often outperformed complex projects. This study provides guidance for orth users, introduces methodology to verify, and sets standards for future approaches.
Researchers have developed a computational drug repurposing pipeline to discover new therapeutics for schistosomiasis, a neglected disease caused by parasitic helmin infection. The current treatment, praziquel, is 40 years old and mass administration is leading to drug resistance. The pipeline used phenotypic screening to identify protein kinases as new targets, essential in parasite biological processes. The kinome of Schistoma japonicum, S mansoni, and haematium were elucidated and compared to the human kinome to identify unique targets. Existing inhibitors were explored to suggest novel schosidal agents, including bosutin, dasatin, imatinib, vandatin, saratin, tideus, alvid, dinlib, and 22 new targets CHK, CDC, WEE, PA, MEK. Primary and secondary targets of approved drugs in Schoma were suggested for novel therapeutics development.
Researchers investigated the binding-induced folding of the pID domain of the transcription factor CREB to the K domain of the coactivator CBP. A topology-based G-type model predicted a coupled folding and binding mechanism with the existence of partially bound intermediates. Transition-path and Φ-value analyses revealed that the binding state resembles the unstructured state in solution, indicating CREB becomes structured after committing to binding. The structure change following binding is reminiscent of an induced-fit mechanism, contrasting with models where binding occurs to pre-structured conformations existing in the unbound equilibrium. Increasing the amount of structure in the unbound pID reduced the rate of binding, suggesting a "fly-casting-like" process. Inclusion of attractive non-native interactions formed non-specific complexes that enhanced the rate of binding but did not change the mechanism. The study explains how unstructured can confer an advantage in target recognition. Simulations are in agreement with a reported nuclear magnetic resonance study and aid experimental kinetics interpretation.
A systematic review was conducted to analyze the prevalence and intensity of Schistosoma mansoni infection in children in Latin America and the Caribbean countries (LAC) from 1942-2014. The study aimed to assess progress towards the World Health Assembly's 2012 resolution WHA65.21 goal of eliminating schistosomiasis. A systematic search of PubMed, LILACS, and EMBASE databases yielded 132 full-text articles meeting the criteria, providing 1242 prevalence and intensity data points, mostly from Brazil (69.7%). Studies published after 2000 revealed 'hotspots' of high prevalence in Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia. These countries require updated epidemiological status to redesign national programs and target elimination of Schistoma mans transmission by 2020. Antigua and Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted transmission, but require dossier compilation and follow-up surveys to verify status. Heterogeneity in methodologies for monitoring and evaluating schosias programs hindered cross-national and chronological comparisons. Standardization of monitoring and evaluation methods are recommended using WHO guidelines. Improved epidemiological data by age and sex are needed to meet regional elimination goals.
Heterosexual transmission of HIV-1 is characterized by a genetic bottleneck that selects a single viral variant, the transmitted founder (TF), during transmission events. Researchers sequenced 167 full-length viral genomes and generated 40 infectious molecular clones (IC) including TF and non-transmitted (NT) HIV-1 subtype C variants from six heterosexual transmission pairs at the time of transmission. Consensus-like genomes sensitive to antibodies were selected during transmission in these pairs. The TF variants did not demonstrate increased viral fitness in terms of infectivity or replicative capacity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and monocyte-derived dendritic (MDC) cells. Additionally, resistance of TF to antiviral effects of interferon-α (IF-α) was not significantly different from nonmitted variants from the same pair. In vitro replicative capacity and IF-α resistance did not discriminate transmission potential viruses in quasis of chronically infected individuals.
Lymphangiogenesis and Lymph Remodeling Induced by Filar Parasites: Implications for Pathogenesis

Lymphatic dilation and dysfunction occurs in murine models infected with filarial parasites, even in the absence of an adaptive immune system, whereas severe lymphedema and elephantiasis requires an intact immune response in human infections. Human lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or patient serum showed significant proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures in vitro. Live parasites or filarial antigens induced LEC proliferation and differentiation. Serum from microfilar positive patients with chronic lymphatic obstruction showed increased LEC proliferation compared to uninfected individuals. Differentiation of LEC into tube-like structures was associated with increased matrix metalloproteases and inhibition of TIM (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteases). Gene expression by live parasites in LEC compared to parasite-exposed LEC showed filarial altered expression of genes involved in cellular organization and junction pathways, decreasing transendothelial transport assessed by FIT-Dextr.
Researchers have developed a method to directly sequence the genomes of individual bacteria without culturing them in a laboratory. This is significant because only a small fraction of environmental bacteria can be grown in a lab settings. A technique called Multiple Displacement Amplification (DA) was used to obtain sufficient DNA from a single cell, eliminating the need for culturing methods. A microfluidic device was used to isolate Escherichia coli and amplify genomic DNA in 60-nanol reactions. Results showed that reducing DA volume lowered nonspecific synthesis from contaminant DNA and primer interactions. Quality of amplification was assessed by qPCR and compared to standard 50-μl volumes. Amplification bias was reduced in nanol volumes, providing even sequence representation. Single-cell amplicons from both microl and nanol volumes provided high-quality data by high-throughput pyrosequencing, demonstrating direct sequencing from single cells.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of hantavirus transmission in the Atlantic Forest biome, focusing on the role of Sigmodontinae rodents as hosts and the impact of landscape structure on havirus host populations. They analyzed 283 rodent capture records and used geographically weighted models to test predictors of havirus host variation. Results showed that havirus host proportions were positively influenced by landscape diversity, not habitat type or agricultural matrix. Local mammal diversity also positively correlated with pathogenic havirus host proportions, indicating habitat plasticity may be more important than competition with native species. Sugarcane plantations increased rodent host proportion, while defaunation did not correlate with pathogenic havirus genotypes. The match between host hotspots and human vulnerability was 17%, coldspots 20%. Spatial land use influenced havirus hosts across the Atlantic Forest. Findings suggest disease surveillance should be reinforced in southern and southeastern regions with high host and vulnerability. Rodent community dynamics and disease interactions may be more complex than hypothesized.
Researchers investigated the role of BCL proteins in the induction of apoptosis in cells infected with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis virus, Dengue virus, and Zika virus. They found that survival of infected cells depends on BCL, a pro-survival BCL protein, due to suppression of the expression of another pro-surival protein MCL. Treatment with BCL inhibitors or deficient BCL gene expression induced BAX/BA-dependent apoptosis upon flavivirus infection. Flivirus attenuated cellular protein synthesis, leading to reduction of short-lived proteins like MCL. Inhibition of BCL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, suppressing viral dissemination and chemokine production. The study also examined the role of BCL in death of JEV-infected cells in vivo. Deficiency of BCL gene and administration of BH mimetic compounds increased survival after JEV infection and suppressed inflammation. The results suggest BCL plays a crucial role in survival of cells with flaviviruses and B may be a novel antiviral target to suppress Fliviridae viruses.
A study estimated the economic impact of canine rabies in Vietnam from 2005 to 2014. Canine rabies is a significant public health concern in Asia due to high human deaths and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) costs, and low investment in dog vaccination. The study aimed to quantify the societal burden of canine rabies in Vietnam, including direct and indirect costs for dogs, livestock, and humans. Data from interviews, literature, reports, and primary collection were used to estimate the economic impact of canine rabies over the 10-year period. Direct and indirect costs for P, vaccination, efforts, livestock, and disability-adjusted life years (DALs) were incorporated into the analysis. The study found that the total economic impact of canine rabies was $719 million over the 10-year period, with 92% attributed to P-related costs. Canine rabies resulted in 36,560 to 45,700 disability-adjusted life years (DALs) and 914 human deaths. The mortality rate was 0.11 deaths per 100,000, lower than reported for Asian countries. The cost per dog vaccinated was $1.75. The results indicate that canine rabies in Vietnam is consistent with the burden reported in Asia, with high P expenditures and low vaccination investment.
The Type II Secretion System (TSS) is a complex that facilitates the secretion of fully-folded proteins across the bacterial outer membrane. A key component of this machinery is the secretin, a multi-subunit outer membrane protein that forms the secretion pore. Research has identified three distinct forms of TSS based on the characteristics of their secretin pores. A comparative analysis of two forms, Klebsella-type and Vibrio-type, revealed that they differ in the pilot protein that mediates transport and assembly into the outer membrane. The crystal structure of novel pilot Asp from Vibrio cholera was determined, showing convergent evolution where Asp is functionally equivalent yet structurally unrelated to pilotins in Klebsella and other bacteria. Asp binds a specific sequence in Vibrio secretin, enhancing secretin assembly kinetics. Homologs of Asp are found in all Vibrio species and few Escherich and Shella strains with Vib-type TSS.
Researchers investigated the role of three transmembrane outer proteins, Omp36, O37, and O47, in the pathogenesis of leptospirosis, a disease caused by the bacterium Leptira. These proteins were identified on the surface of the bacterium and their ability to bind to host tissue components was assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The study found that O37 bound to elastin, a protein found in skin and blood vessels, with high affinity, as well as to other proteins such as fibrinogen, fibrinogen, fibronectin, and laminin. The binding to elastin was dose-dependent and saturable, with a dissociation constant of 104 nM for human elastin and 152 nM for aorticin. The binding was also enhanced by antibodies against O37, suggesting that O37 plays a role in Leptira binding to elastin and that host antibodies may promote rather than inhibit adherence to elastin-rich tissues. O37 was recognized by sera from patients with acute and convalescent leptpi and Leptira-infected hamsters, and was detected in pathogenic but not saprophytic Leira. This suggests O37 is a novel elastin-binding protein of pathogenic Leptira, potentially promoting attachment to host tissues.
Researchers have isolated two broadly neutralizing antibodies, 4E10 and 2F, from HIV-1 infected individuals that recognize epitopes in the membrane-proximal external region (MP) of gp41, which are transiently exposed during viral entry. These antibodies bind to the viral membrane-proximal region and induce a conformational change, resulting in a stable complex. A model was developed to calculate the probability of an antibody disabling gp41 trimer during the pre-fusion intermediate, when epitopes are first exposed. The model predicts that for effective neutralization, the time to disable epitope must be less than the time the antibody remains in conformation, approximately 5 minutes or less for 4E and 2F. The study investigated the role of avidity in neutralization and found that 2F IgG, but not 4E, is more effective at neutralization than its fragment. This is attributed to 2F interacting more stably with the viral membrane than 4. The model elucidated parameters that determine the ability of antibodies to disable epitopes and proposed an extension to analyze neutralization data. The extended model predicts dependencies for neutralization on constants that characterize antibody binding, rate of gp41 fusion, and number of gp bridging the virus and target at start pre-fusion. Analysis indicates a small number of gp bridges must be disabled to prevent fusion.
A longitudinal study was conducted in three hyperendemic onchocerciasis foci in Mali and Senegal to assess the effectiveness of ivermectin treatment in controlling the disease and interrupting transmission. Participants received 15-17 years of annual six-monthly ivermectin treatment. The study aimed to evaluate residual infection levels and transmission, and determine if treatment could be safely stopped. Skin snip surveys were conducted in 131 villages, examining 29,753 individuals and 49,600 blackflies for Onchocerca volulus larvae using a DNA probe. Results showed a declining trend in infection and transmission post-treatment. In two sites, microfilar and vector infectivity rates reached zero 3-4 years post-treatment. In the third site with high pre-treatment levels, infection and transmission declined to low levels 3-5 years post-treatment. All indicators fell below elimination thresholds. The study demonstrated the feasibility of onchercias elimination with iverectin in some African foci.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism by which non-enveloped viruses, such as human rhinovirus, deliver their genetic material across cell membranes. Rhinivirus, a common cause of the common cold, is a member of the picornavirus family, which includes poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease. During picavirus entry, the myristoylated capsid protein VP4 is released and interacts with the cell membrane, facilitating genome delivery into the cytoplasm for replication. A recombinant C-terminal histidine-tagged rhinivirus VP4 was produced and shown to induce membrane permeability in liposome models. Size-exclusion studies, crosslinking and microscopy demonstrated VP4 forms a multimeric membrane pore, allowing single-stranded RNA transfer. Permeability induced by recombin VP was influenced by pH and comparable to that induced by infectious virions.
Francisella tularens (Ft) is a highly infectious, Gram-negative bacterium that causes tularemia, a disease classified as a class A select agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Human isolates of F. tularens produce lipid A similar to Francisella novicida (Fn), a pathogen of mice. Researchers identified three enzymes required for lipid A carbohydrate modifications: mannose (mF1), galactamine (m2), and both (mK). Mutants lacking galactamine (m2) or galosamine/mannose (mK) were attenuated in mice via pulmonary and subcutaneous infection routes. Aerosolization of mutants m2 and mK provided protection against wild-type (WT) Fn, while subcut administration of mK provided protection from WT Fn. Infection of alveolar macrophage line mK induced higher TNF-α and MIP-2 compared to WT Fn. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) from TLR4 and TLR2 knockout mice infected mK produced higher IL-6 and M-2 than MM infected WT. However, IL-6 and M-2 were undetectable in MM from MyD−/− infected either. My−/− were susceptible to mK infection. The m mutant's ability to activate pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine production and innate responses via MyD signaling may be responsible for attenuation, inducing protective immunity.
Researchers have investigated the role of Era, a ribosome-associated GTPase, in Staphylococcus aureus. Era is a conserved across domains of life and essential in many species, but its function in ribosome assembly is unclear. The study found Era is not essential in S. aureus, but important for 30S ribosomal subunit assembly. Era interacts with 16S rRNA endonuclease Y and DEAD-box RNA helicase C. Era and C are required for growth at suboptimal temperatures and rRNA processing. Era and C form interactions with ppG synthase Rel, with Rel impacting Era GTP activity and C helic activity. In its G-bound form, Era acts as a hub on the ribosome, directing enzymes in r processing and subunit assembly. This activity is hindered by stringent response components, contributing to slowed growth.
Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) induces vascular insufficiency in experimental animals through unknown mechanisms. This study investigates the role of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in this process. Mice deficient in NOS (N−/−) show increased sensitivity to LT, while deficiencies in other NOS isoforms (N and eN) have no effect on LT-mediated mortality. The increased sensitivity of N−/− mice is independent of macrophage sensitivity to toxin or cytokine responses and can be replicated in N-sufficient wild-type (WT) mice through pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme with 7-nitindazole. Histological analyses reveal LT-induced changes in heart morphology of N/− mice with novel inter-fiber spaces but no cardiomyocyte apoptosis. LT-treated WT mice show no histopathology at light microscopy. Electron microscopy of LT-treated mice reveal pathological changes in hearts of both N/ and WT, varying in severity and timing. Endothelial necrosis, degeneration, interocyte edema, myament degeneration, and sarcoplasmic reticulumistae are observed in LT-treated WT and N− mice. Biomarkers of cardiac injury (myoglobin, cardiacponin, and fatty acid protein) are elevated in LT mice rapidly (6h after injection) and concentrations reported in mice. Cardiac protective therapy and allopin have no effect on LT mice. Surprisingly, nitric scavenger carbox-PT shows some protection against LT. Echocardiography LT mice indicate reduction in fraction following treatment in N− and WT, indicative of contractile heart function. The heart is an early target of LT in mice and N plays a protective role against LT cardiac damage.
Researchers have developed a method for introducing targeted genetic mutations in parasitic nematodes, a group of parasites that infect over 1 billion people worldwide and cause common neglected diseases. The lack of genetic tools has hindered understanding of parasitic nemat biology, particularly the ability to generate gene disruptions and mutant phenotypes. This study reports CRISPR-C9-mediated gene disruptions in the human parasitic worm Strongyloides stercalis. The S. stercalis twitch gene, unc-22, was disrupted, resulting in nematodes with severe motility defects. Unc-22 mutations were resolved by homology-directed repair when a template was provided. Omission of repair resulted in deletions at the locus. Unc-22 mutations were heritable, passed through host and recovered mutant progeny. A similar approach was used to disrupt the unc-22 gene in the parasitic nemode Strongyloides ratti. Results demonstrate applicability of CRPR9 to parasitic nemodes, enabling studies of gene function in medically relevant previously intractable parasites.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to describe the effects of ribosome drop on ribosome density and protein synthesis rate during translation. Ribosome drop occurs when cells are under stress, such as amino acid starvation or aminoacyl-tRNA depletion due to high recombinant protein expression, affecting protein expression efficiency. The model shows ribosome premature termination leads to non-intuitive ribosome profiles, such as increased density from 5' to 3' end. Ribosome drop's effects on translation rate are mRNA-specific and quantified, showing mRNAs with ribosomes are less affected than those without. Among mRNAs without ribosomes, resilience to drop correlates with elongation rate, fast codons being less affected. A genome-wide analysis of S. cerevisiae reveals mRN coding translation machinery proteins, highly codon-biased and fast cod, are resilient to ribosome drop. Under physiological conditions, mRN coding regulatory stress proteins are less resilient to ribosome drop.
The World Health Organization's strategy to control soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in children is based on morbidity control through routine deworming of school and pre-school children. However, transmission persists due to reservoirs of infection in untreated individuals and environment, necessitating continued deworming for extended periods. Alternative strategies, such as mass drug administration (MDA), are being explored to accelerate interruption of transmission. The DeW3 trial tests the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission, with three years of treatment followed by two years surveillance. Given reinfection rates, two years is considered adequate to assess bounce or interruption. This study investigates criteria to determine interruption earlier. A stochastic individual-based model simulates De3 community cluster-randomized trial, comparing control (annual treatment of children with MDA) to intervention (community-wide biannual with M). Simulations were run for Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm (Necator american). Prevalences at six months after last M and impact of M levels were evaluated to assess likelihood of bounce or elimination. Results suggest clusters should be assessed after two years, unless interruption ruled out by low coverage. Models indicate homogenous estimates following high M across clusters do not allow discrimination between bounce or interruption within 24 months of M cessation.
Researchers evaluated a conjugate vaccine for cholera made from Vibrio cholera O1 Ogawa-specific polysaccharide (OSP) and recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain (Tc). The vaccine, called OSP:Tc, was tested in mice for its ability to induce protective immunity against cholera. The study focused on serogroup specificity, which is determined by OSP of lipopolyschar (LPS). Polysacides are poorly immunogenic, especially in young children. Mice were immunized intramusly on days 0, 21, and 42 with OSP:Tc or OSP only, with or without dmLT, a non-toxigen immunoadju derived from labile toxin Escheria coli. Significant IgG antibody responses to OSP were detected after single immunization in mice receiving OSPc with or without adju. AntiPS responses were detected after second immunization in these cohorts. No OSP or antiPS responses were detected in animals receiving unjugated OSP or without immunju, and receiving immunju alone. Responses were highest with immun with adju. IgM responses were detected in mice OSPc with or withoutju, and unconjug OSP. AntiPS and vibocidal responses were in all cohorts except immunju alone. No IgA responses developed any group. Administration OSPc and adju induced memory cell targeting OSP and 95% efficacy in mouse lethality cholera model.
Candida albicans inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence through suppression of pyochelin and pyoverine biosynthesis. Researchers investigated the interaction between Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a neutropenic mouse model of gastrointestinal colonization and dissemination. They found that Candida albicans suppresses the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by inhibiting the expression of pyelin and pyoverine genes, which play a critical role in iron acquisition and virulence. Deletion of the pyelin and pyine genes in Pseudomonas aerosa attenuates its virulence. Heat-killed Candida albicans had no effect on Pseudas aeruginosa, whereas Candida secreted proteins directly suppressed pyoverine and pyelin expression and inhibited Pseud virulence in mice. Suppression of the pyelin and pyine genes had no effect on Pseudasas ability to colonize the GI tract but decreased its cytotoxic effect on colonocytes. Oral iron supplementation restored Pseud virulence in Pseudas and Candida colonized mice. These findings provide insight into bacterial-fungal modulation of virulence in the intestine.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the complexity of the inoculum and the rate of reversion to wild-type (WT) virus in SIV and SHIV infections. They found that escape mutant (EM) viruses, which evade CD8+ T cell recognition, are frequently observed in HIV-1 and SIV infections. These EM viruses are often less replicatively fit compared to WT virus, as demonstrated by reversion to WT upon transmission to a naive host and association with lower viral load in vivo in HIV-1 infection. However, the rate of reversion is highly variable. The study quantified reversion to WT of a series of SIV and SH viruses containing minor amounts of WT in pigtailed macaques using PCR. Infection with mixes of EM and WT containing ≥10% virus resulted in rapid outgrowth of WT at SIVag CD8 cell epitopes within 7 days of infection. In contrast, biologically passaged SHIV229 viruses with smaller proportions of WT or molecular pure EMIV239 demonstrated delayed or slow reversion. WT was not detectable ≥8 days post-inoculation and ≥ weeks to become dominant quasis. Delayed reversion was associated with lower viral loads. The diversity of the infecting inoculum determines the timing of reversion to WT, which predicts infection outcome. Delayed reversion of fitness-reducing CD8 cell escape mutations suggests opportunities to reduce pathogenicity during early infection.
Researchers have investigated the evolution of cadmium resistance in natural populations of yeast strains collected from the Dead Sea of Evaporation (EC) in Israel. They found that these strains exhibit extremely high tolerance to cadmium, a heavy metal that is toxic to most organisms. The primary cause of this resistance is an enhanced function of a metal efflux pump, PCA1, which removes cadmium from the cell. Molecular analysis revealed that mutations in the promoter region of the PCA1 gene are responsible for this enhancement, while mutations in the coding region have a minor effect. Experiments showed that single nucleotide substitutions in the PCA1 promoter significantly increase its activity and enhance cadmium resistance. A comparison with other yeast species showed that the critical nucleotides found in EC strains are conserved and functionally important for cadmium resistance in other species, suggesting they represent an ancestral type. However, these nucleotides diverged in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, where cadmium is low or absent. This study provides an example of a selective sweep in yeast populations driven by a trade-off in metal resistance.
Researchers investigated the relationship between oncogenic pathways and prognosis in gastric cancer (GC), the second leading cause of global cancer mortality. Using gene expression signatures, they mapped patterns of oncogenic activation in 301 primary gastric cancers and identified three major pathways: proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-caten, deregulated in over 70% of cases. These pathways were functionally validated in a panel of gastric cancer cell lines. Patient stratification by oncogenic pathway showed reproducible and significant survival differences in multiple cohorts, suggesting pathway interactions influence disease behavior. Gastric cancers can be taxonomized by oncogenic activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups. Predicting pathway activity by expression allows study of multiple pathways simultaneously in primary cancers, not achievable by other platforms.
Researchers used Stress-induced DNA duplex destabilization (SIDD) analysis to predict sites susceptible to strand separation under superhelical stress in the Escherichia coli K12 genome. They found that strongly destabilized sites occur preferentially in intergenic regions, including known or inferred promoters, but rarely in coding regions. This study investigates whether genes in different functional categories have characteristic SIDD in their upstream regions. Results show that strong S sites in E. coli12 are statistically overrepresented in upstream of genes encoding transcription regulators. Specifically, regions of genes responding to physiological and environmental stimuli are more destabilized than those not involved in these responses. If a pathway is controlled by a transcription regulator with a destabilized 5' flank, genes in that pathway also have strongly destabilized S sites in 5' flanks. This association is observed in 38 of free-living bacteria, but only 4 of endosymbion or obligate parasitic bacteria. S sites upstream genes may be involved in transcriptional responses to environmental changes altering superelicity. The authors propose S sites are active participants in superically mediated mechanisms governing gene expression changes in response to physiological or environmental changes.
High-mob group (H) proteins are a class of eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins characterized by the H-box motif, which play a crucial role in regulating genes involved in developmental and metabolic pathways. In the filamentous ascomete Podospora anina, 12 H-box genes have been identified, with four previously characterized as mating-type genes controlling fertilization and fruit-body development, and one encoding a factor involved in mitochondrial stability. Systematic analysis of the remaining uncharacterized H-box genes revealed that none were essential for viability, but seven involved in the sexual cycle. Two H-box genes, PaMG5 and Pa9, display distinct functions: Pa5 is an activator of mating-type genes in P anina, while Pa9 is a repressor of specific to stationary phase, notably hyph anastoses. Transcriptional analysis of H-box genes in H-box strains indicated Pa5 is central to a network regulating mating-type and mating target genes. Genetic analysis revealed this network also controls fertility genes not regulated by mating factors. This study highlights the role of H-box in sexual reproduction in fungi, with 11 of 12 members involved in the cycle. Pa5 and Sp11 are conserved transcriptional regulators of mating genes, despite diverging 550 million years ago. Two-box, SO9 and its regulator S, also play a role in sex determination in mammals. The Pa and Sp mating genes and upstream factor form a H-box module analogous to S/SOX, revealing commonality of sex regulation in animals and fungi.
A study was conducted to investigate the persistence of Ebola virus in the body fluids of survivors in Sierra Leone during the 2013-2016 epidemic. The study aimed to address the lack of data on virus persistence in survivors' fluids and transmission risk, including sexual transmission. An observational cohort study was implemented during the epidemic response in Sierra Leone to determine virus persistence in survivors' fluids. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase assessed Ebola virus persistence in semen of 100 adult men within five months of protocol initiation. The second phase evaluated persistence in multiple fluids (semenstrual fluid, blood, breast milk, urine, rectal fluid, sweat, saliva, tears) of 120 men and 120 women. Data informed national and global guidelines in real-time, demonstrating the need for semen testing among Ebola survivors. The study accelerated implementation of such programs in affected countries and informed persistence of Zika virus studies.
Researchers have used fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments to study the chemotaxis sensory system of Escherichia coli, a type of bacteria, to understand how it responds to chemical stimuli in its environment. By analyzing dose-response curves from these experiments, they predicted the chemical gradients the bacteria typically encounter in their natural environment. The researchers applied Weber's law and its generalizations, Weber-Fech law and fold detection, to predict average gradients experienced by cells. To obtain full distributions of gradients, they used information theory and simulations, accounting for transmission limitations from internal and external noise. The study found broad distributions of exponential gradients lead to log-normal stimuli and maximal velocity. These results provide a step towards understanding complex, experimentally inaccessible cellular environments like the human intestine.
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are crucial for the long-term supply of blood cells due to their multipotency and self-renew capacity. However, evidence suggests that genetically identical HSCs differ in lifespan, and lifespan is predetermined and H-intrinsic. Lifspan is defined as the time H gives rise to mature blood cells. This raises the question: what controls lifespan of Hs within same animal exposed same environment. A new model based on reliability theory accounts for diversity of lifans of Hs. Clonal repulation experiments and computational-mathematic modeling tested small-scale molecular failures at H population level. Best fit data provided by model where repulation kinetics H largely anti-persistent mean-reverting processes. Failure rates increase during population division events counteracted by repair processes. Long-run crossover from anti-p to persistent occurs due slow increase mean rate selfnew leads clonal extinction. This suggests capacity Hs self-limit. Lifespan each H depends amplitudes frequencies fluctuations rate. Short longer Hs differ preprogram dissipate perturbations.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism by which antibodies prevent tissue damage caused by migrating helminth larvae. Approximately one-third of the world's population suffers from chronic helmin infections, with no effective vaccines available. Antibodies and activated macrophages play a crucial role in immunity against helmin infections. However, the mechanisms by which antibodies target these multicellular parasites were unclear. The study found that helmin-specific antibodies induce rapid trapping of migrating helmin larvae and prevent tissue damage following infection with the murine parasite Heligomosomoides polygyrus baker (Hp). Mice lacking antibodies or activating receptors harbored highly motile larvae, extensive tissue damage, and less Arginase-1 expressing macrophages around larvae. Antibodies induced Fc and complement adherence macroph to larvae in vitro, resulting in complete immobilization. Antibodies with helmin reprogrammed macro to express wound-healing genes, including Arginase, and Arginase product Lornine impaired larval motility. Arginase expression in vitro and in vivo occurred independently of IL-4α signaling.
Researchers have developed a new, non-invasive method to visualize DNA dynamics during the early stages of double-strand break (DSB) processing in living cells. Chromosome breakage poses a significant threat to genome integrity, and homologous recombination (HR) with an intact copy of the broken locus is the most accurate repair method. The mobility of broken DNA has been observed to increase during the search for a donor copy. However, observing chromosome dynamics during the initial steps of HR, particularly the resection from DS ends that generates recombinogenic strands, requires a system that does not interfere with the process and is relative to few kilobases of DNA that undergo processing. Current visualization tools, based on fluorescent protein binding to specific sites, have the drawback of highly repeated and lengthy protein stretches obstructing chromatin function. The new method uses oligomerization rather than multiplicity to form visible foci and was applied to HO cleavage of the MAT locus on Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome III, providing real-time analysis of resection in living cells. Monitoring dynamics of chromatin next to DS revealed transient confinement of damaged chromatin during early resection, consistent with need to keep ends in contact. Resection in y70 mutant began ∼10 minutes earlier than wild type, defining commitment to homology-dependent repair.
Researchers investigated the frequency and timing of Trypanosoma cruzi reinfections in humans living in areas with active vector-borne transmission of Chagas disease. They used stochastic agent-based models to estimate the rate of re-infection and assess the frequency of reinfections during the acute and chronic stages of the disease. The models were fitted to epidemiological data from Argentinean villages where 56% of humans were infected with different genotypes of T. cruzi. The best model predicted 0.032 (0.008-0.042) annual reinfections per individual, with 98.4% occurring in the chronic phase. In 20% of re-infections, the parasite escaped the adaptive immune response after primary infection. Annual reinfection rates during the chronic stage were 14% (4-18%) and 60 (21-70) after 5 and 30 years, with individuals reinfected 1-3 times. These low rates were attributed to the inefficiency of the stercarian mode of transmission rather than an efficient immune response.
A study investigated the relationship between pre-existing immune responses to deng virus (DENV) and the outcome of subsequent infection in a cohort of Thai school-aged children. Blood samples were collected from children who experienced subclinical DENV infection or developed deng illness. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were stimulated with DENV in vitro, and cytokine secretion was measured using a multiplex bead array. Significant differences in cytokine production were found based on DENV type and clinical outcome. Subjects who developed symptomatic DENV infection had higher secretion of IL-15 and MCP-1, while IL-6 was produced by all symptomatic subjects versus 59% with subclinical. Lower levels of IL-12, IL-2, MIP-α, RANT, GM-CSF, and TNα were found in symptomatic subjects. These findings indicate distinct pre-existing immune responses to D associated with clinical outcome. Higher levels of some cytokines in symptomatic and other cytokines in subclinical suggest both protective and pathologic profiles.
In the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, Hedgehog (H) forms an extracellular gradient that organizes patterning along the anterior-posterior axis and specifies at least three different domains of gene expression. Contrary to the prevailing view that H functions as a classical morphogen, a direct correspondence between the borders of these patterns and H concentration has not been demonstrated. This study provides evidence that interpretation of H signaling depends on the history of exposure to H and that a single concentration is sufficient to support multiple outputs. Mathematical modeling predicts that at steady state, only two domains can be in response to H, suggesting the boundaries of two or more gene patterns cannot be specified by a static H gradient. Computer simulations suggest a "overshoot" of the H gradient, a transient in which H profile is expanded compared to H-state. Temporal examination of H target gene expression shows patterns expand anteriorly then refine, providing in vivo evidence for overshoot. The H network suggests overshoot results from H-dependent upregulation of receptor Patched (Ptc). Altering the network such that P is no longer upregulated in response H-signaling activation, patterns of expression, distinct in wild-type discs now overlap.
Researchers conducted an N-ethyl-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis screen to identify mice with enhanced locomotor activity and isolated a new mutation, Lightweight (Lwt), which disrupts the homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans (C. eleg) unc-79 gene. Lwt/L homozygotes are perinatal lethal, while Lightweight heterozygotes are hypersensitive to acute ethanol exposure. Experiments in C. elegans demonstrate conserved sensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants, extending to unc-80 and nca-1;n-2 mutants. Lightweight heterozyotes exhibit altered response to anesthetic isoflurane, similar to unc invertebrate phenotypes. They are hyperactive in novel environments, smaller than wild-type, and consume more food with lean body composition. Lightweight heterozyotes also consume more ethanol than wild-type littermates. The combination of hypersensitivity and increased ethanol consumption in Lightweightozy mice with conserved sensitivity in C. elegans unc-79, unc-80, and n-2 mutants suggests a conserved pathway influencing alcohol behaviors in humans.
Researchers have identified the Anopheles gambiae's immune response to Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for malaria, as a potential source of anti-malaria mechanisms. One such mechanism is the Imd pathway, a conserved signaling pathway with anti-P. falcum activity. Silencing cas, a negative regulator of Imd, or overexpressing rel, an I-controlled NF-kappa transcription factor, confers resistance to A. gambiae mosquitoes. However, unexplored aspects of this mechanism are crucial for malaria control. Using RNA interference, cas and other Imd components were silenced, genes participating in anti-P signaling regulated by cas were identified, representing potential targets for pathway overactivation. Imd is most potent against ookinete stage, with activity against early oocysts and lesser against lateocysts. Cas silencing alone induces robust-P response in absence gut microbiota. Imd components TEP, APL, and LR1 in infection-dependent defense were established, highlighting laboratory versus natural intensity relevance.
Researchers investigated the anti-fibrotic potential of bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BSCs) in a mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis caused by Paroccidioides brasiliensis infection. BSCs were isolated from BAL/c mice and administered intravenously to mice infected with P. brasiliensis at 8 weeks post-infection. A control group received itraconazole (ITC) two weeks before BSC administration. Animals were sacrificed at 12 weeks post-infection. Histological examination showed increased granulomatous areas in BSC-treated mice. Fibrocy count, soluble collagen, and collagen-α, T-β, MMP-8, and MMP-15 expression increased in BSC-treated mice. Combined BSC/IT therapy decreased TIM-1 and MMP13 expression in infected mice. Human fibroblasts stimulated with lung supernatants from infected BSC-transplanted mice showed higher collagen expression. The study suggests that late infusion of BSC into infected with P. brasili does not have anti-frotic effect, possibly due to interaction with fungus promoting collagen and tissue remodeling.
A recent study investigated the seasonal dynamics of phlebotine sand fly species that transmit Leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infant in the Mediterranean region. The research aimed to understand how climate change affects the spread of the disease, as sand fly activity is typically seasonal and sensitive to climate variations. From 2011-2013, a consortium of eight countries conducted entomological investigations at sites where L. infant transmission was reported. Sand flies were collected using CDC traps and sticky traps, with collections replicated over one season to reduce weather effects. Data from 99,000 specimens were analyzed, describing the seasonal dynamics of 56,000 sand flies from six species: P. periciosus (Portugal, Spain, Italy), P. aasi (France), P. neglect (Greece), P. bb (Cyprus, Turkey), P. balicus, and P. kaki (Georgia). Time of fly appearance and disappearance differed between sites, with varying densities. Significant correlations were found between latitude/mean temperature and first fly appearance (April-June) and density trend (single peak July-Aug, multiple May-Sept). A 3-modal trend was recorded for P. bb in Cyprus, a novel for L. infant vector. Adult activity ended September-November, without latitude/temperature correlation. The period of exposure to L infant in the region, inferred from adult densities, was a bell-shaped curve with a peak July-Sept, and May-Oct for 99% values. No risk transmission occurred Dec-March. Nocturnal activity peaked 11-2 am, with annual variations. Consecutive collections provided homogeneous patterns, proposing sentinel areas for monitoring. Higher risk L infant transmission was June-Oct (97% density), but not equally distributed, with earlier waves in southern territories.
Orientia tsutsamushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, is an obligate intracellular bacterium that primarily infects endothelial cells, but also replicates in monocytes isolated from healthy donors. Microarray analysis revealed that O tsugamushi alters the expression of over 4,500 genes in monocytes, including upregulation of type I interferon, interferon-stimulated genes, and genes associated with M1 macrophage polarization. Otsamushi induced apoptosis-related genes and promoted cell death in a small percentage of monocytes. The type I interfer response and apoptosis and M-associated cytokine expression were essential for these changes. In patients with scrub typh, microarray analysis showed upregulation of 613 genes, including interferon-related and M1 polarization features, similar to tsamushi-stimulated monocytes in vitro. This is the first demonstration that monocytes are polarized in vitro and ex vivo following Otsamushi exposure.
Researchers have investigated the neural mechanisms underlying ants' ability to navigate complex environments using visual memory. The mushroom body, a critical component of the insect brain, has been primarily studied for its role in olfactory tasks, but its function in visual memory is unknown. A spiking model of the mushroom body circuit, initially developed to describe fruit fly olfactory association, was applied to desert ants (Cataglyphox vel) and found to account for their rapid learning of visual routes in natural environments. The model's key principles, including one-shot learning of sparse codes, enabled estimation of the mushroom body's storage capacity to hundreds of images.
Arabidopsis thaliana plants employ an innate immune system to protect against disease, which shares similarities with animal innate immunity but also has unique mechanisms, particularly at the physiological level. One such mechanism is the ability to produce new organs to replace damaged ones. Researchers studied pathogen-triggered leaf abscission in Arabidopsis thalian leaves infected with Pseudomonas syringae, a bacterial pathogen lacking a type III secretion system, which failed to elicit abission response, suggesting abission is triggered by effectors. HAESA/ESA2, INFRESC, and NED are required for pathogen-triggered abission. Phytoalexin deficient, disease susceptibility, salicylic induction, and senescence plants with mutations in defense and salicy acid signaling and NahG transgenic with low salicy failed abission. Bacteria contacting abission zones trigger strong abission, but long-distance signals from infected tissue to abission alert abission of danger. A threshold model proposes leaves handle minor infections by limiting growth, but when out of control, leaves are shed. Salicy may regulate both pathogen and drought abission.
Starburst amacrine cells (SACs) in the retina play a crucial role in detecting image motion direction, generating larger dendritic Ca2+ signals when motion is directed towards their dendritic tips compared to the opposite direction. To investigate the underlying mechanisms of direction selectivity (DS) in SAC dendrites, electrical responses to expanding and contracting circular visual stimuli were measured via somatic whole-cell recordings and quantified using Fourier analysis. The results showed fundamental and especially harmonic frequency components were larger for expanding stimuli, indicating direction selectivity persists in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists, suggesting inhibitory interactions are not essential. The presence of harmonics indicates nonlinearity, with the relationship between harmonic amplitudes and potential indicating activation of voltage-gated channels. Ca2+ changes in SAC dendrites evoked by voltage steps monitored by two-photon microscopy suggest the distal dendrite is tonically depolarized relative to soma, due to resting currents mediated by tonic glutamgic synaptic input and high-voltage-activated Ca+ channels at rest. Compartment modeling indicates dendritic DS in SAC can be computed by dendrites relying on voltageated channels and dendritic voltage, providing spatial asymmetry for discrimination.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the infective dose and virulence of 43 human pathogens from diverse taxonomic groups. They found that pathogens using locally acting molecules require a lower infective dose than those using distantly acting molecules. Contrary to predictions, locally acting pathogens were not less virulent than distantly acting ones. Instead, virulence was negatively correlated with infect dose and higher in pathogens infecting skin compared to ingested or inhaled. The study suggests that broad comparative analyses can explain variation in parasite traits such as infect dose and virulence, highlighting the importance of mechanistic details.
Researchers investigated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the development of the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni, which causes schistosomiasis in approximately 200 million people worldwide. The study focused on the miR-277/498 family, which was found to be significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult stage. A novel miRNA, sma-mi-498, was identified, located proximal to smi-277 and proposed to form a miRNA cluster. Hairpin structures for both miRNAs were compatible with the miRNA pathway. Expression of smi-277/498 was upregulated in adults, while their predicted targets were downregulated in adults but not in immature females. smi-498 was expressed in tegumental cells near the oesophagus and throughout the male body. The study suggests mi-277/498 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation during juvenile development and may be involved in female schistosome sexual development.
Researchers conducted a 5-year surveillance of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV) in a cave inhabited by horseshoe bats in Yunn Province, China, discovering 11 new strains with full-length genomes. The study revealed high diversity in the S, OR3, and OR8 genes among S-CoVs in this location. Notably, strains with high similarity to SARS-Co in the hypervar-terminal (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S gene, OR3 and OR8 were found. Additionally, S-CoVs with similarity to human S-Co in OR3 and split OR8a and 8 were discovered. S-Co from this cave were more closely related to S-Co in non-structural genes OR1 and 1 compared to those elsewhere. Recombination analysis showed frequent recombination events in and around OR8 between S-Co. It is hypothesized that S-Co progenitor may have originated from sequential recombination between S-Co precursors. Cell studies demonstrated three identified S-Co with different protein sequences can use human ACE as receptor, indicating close relationship to S-Co. This study provides insights into S-Co origin and highlights preparedness for future S-like diseases.
Researchers have investigated the impact of density-dependent fecundity on the faecal egg reduction test (FECRT) for detecting drug resistance in hookworms. The FRT, which measures faecal egg output before and after treatment, is being considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a means to detect resistance emergence. Studies on canine hookworms show that density-dependent egg production responds dynamically to treatment, affecting drug efficacy and resistance measurements. Surviving worms may increase egg output post-treatment, underestimating drug efficacy in FRT. The degree of underestimation depends on worms' ability to increase output, constrained by pre-treatment levels, varying among hosts. Different cases have distinct pre-FEC densities, potentially affecting phenomenon's impact on efficacy measurements. This highlights the need for new resistance methods examining drug effects on isolated worms in vitro or genotypic changes.
Researchers investigated the role of epithelial heparan sulfate (HS) in regulating Sonic Hedgehog (SH) signaling during lung development. They found that deletion of HS synthase1, an enzyme responsible for producing HS, resulted in abnormal lung branching morphogenesis, characterized by expanded tips and reduced branching, along with mesenchymal developmental defects. Further analysis revealed increased fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10) expression and FGF signaling in mutant lungs, suggesting a non-autonomous mechanism. This was consistent with reduced SH signaling, which suppresses F10 expression. Reactivating SH in mutant lungs rescued the tip phenotype and attenuated F signaling. Importantly, reduced SH activity was not due to decreased Shh expression or protein stability, but reduced biologically active SH proteins in both mutant epithelium and wild-type mesenchym cells. The study highlights HS as a key regulator of SH signaling in lung morphogenesis.
Paired-end sequencing is a technique used to detect genome rearrangements and structural variations on a genome-wide scale, particularly for copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions and translocations, which are common in cancer and produce novel genes. Researchers investigated how much sequencing is required to detect rearrangement breakpoints and localize them precisely using theoretical models and simulations. A formula was derived for the probability that a fusion exists in a genome given paired-end sequences. This formula was used to compute fusion probabilities in breast cancer samples, accurately predicting genes with a small number of large fragments. The ability to detect genes depends on gene distribution lengths and sequencing strategy parameters impact breakpoint detection, localization, and fusion detection, even with errors suggesting false rearrangements. Results will calibrate future sequencing efforts, especially large-scale cancer studies enabled next-generation technologies.
Chemotaxis, the process by which cells move in response to chemical stimuli, is composed of three interrelated processes: motility, sensing, and polarization. A mathematical model was developed to describe these processes using reaction-diffusion equations and a mechanical model of the cell's cortex. The model consists of three modules: an excitable network for random migration, a local excitation-inhibition module for gradient response, and a polarization module linked to the cytoskeleton for persistent movement. The excitable network responds to uniform and gradient stimuli through local excitation and global inhibition, biasing direction. The polarization module allows stimulated cells to move persist and cells in gradients to acquire distinct front and back sensitivity. Varying feedback loop strengths in the model recreates behaviors of genetically altered cell lines.
Tudor domain-containing protein 6 (TD6) plays a crucial role in the development of elongated spermatids and male fertility. Research has shown that TD6 interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) in meiotic phase I spermatocytes, supporting splicing. TD6 also associates with spliceosomal protein Sm in the absence of RNA and arginine methylation. In TD-deficient spermatocytes, PR5 association with Sm and arginine methylation of Sm are reduced. TD deficiency impairs assembly of spliceosomes, resulting in 3.5-fold increased levels of U snRNPs in the nucleus. Spliceosome maturation deficiencies correlate with decreased numbers of SMN-positive bodies and Cajal bodies involved in snRNA maturation. Transcript analysis of TD-deficient spermatocytes reveals high numbers of splicing defects, including aberrant intron and exon usage as well as aberrant splice junctions.
A Bayesian Model for Acquisition and Clearance of Bacterial Colonization Incorporating Within-Host Variation

Bacterial populations that colonize a host can play significant roles in health, serving as reservoirs for transmission to other hosts and emergence of invasive strains, highlighting the importance of understanding acquisition and clearance rates of colonizing populations. Current studies of colonization dynamics have been based on assessment of whether serial samples represent single or distinct colonization events. A common solution to estimate acquisition and clearance rates has been to assume a fixed genetic distance threshold below which isolates are considered same. However, this approach often fails to account for within-host population diversity, time intervals between measurements, and uncertainty in estimated rates.

A Bayesian model is presented that provides probabilities whether strains should be considered same, allowing determination of clearance and acquisition from genomes over time. The method models within-host population using genetic simulation and inference using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The method is validated with simulations and demonstrated in practice by analyzing methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates from a longitudinal study.
Plants generate new organs through the activity of stem cell populations called meristems, including shoot apical meristems that initiate leaves and flowers, and lateral merist in highly ordered, spiraled or whorled patterns via phyllotaxis. Auxin transport plays a major role in this process. Current hypotheses propose that hormone transporters of the PIN family create local auxin maxima at precise positions, leading to organ initiation. To explain auxin transport to distinct regions, concepts have been proposed, including canalization, where transporters amplify and stabilize existing fluxes, and a shoot apical meristem hypothesis where hormone is transported to areas with highest concentrations. This implies two different mechanisms for PIN allocation, based on sensing flux and concentration. Patterning requires interaction of hundreds of cells, making intuitive estimation of scenarios impossible. Computational modeling provides a means to test complex hypotheses. A simulation shows flux-based hypothesis explains auxin at shoot meristem, unifying auxin control in plants.
Researchers have developed a new approach to refine wet lab experiments using in silico searches to identify diagnostic peptides for visceral leishmaniasis. They combined high-quality sequenced genomes and bioinformatic tools with lab experiments to create improved point-of-care tests for early detection and surveillance. Previous studies showed IgG as a biomarker for clinical status in rapid diagnostic tests using crude antigen, but replacing it with specific antigens led to more robust results. Immunoblots revealed Leishmania donovani proteins detected by IgG from patients. Mass spectrometry identified antigens and searched for constitutive expression and accessibility to B-cells. Selected candidates had epitopes mapped in silico, and high-scoring ones were screened in peptide arrays. The most promising was tested in RDT prototypes with VL and non-endemic control sera. Over 90% of proteins from immunobl did not meet criteria and were excluded. Epitope mapping from shortlisted proteins identified the most reactive, with 84% (95% CI 60-97) sensitivity for IgG in Sudan VL sera RDT. None from non-endemic sera were positive. In silico searches reduced lab output, focusing on promising candidates with protein features. Predicted epitopes were screened in arrays, identifying the most promising for IgG and specificity with limited sample. This proof-of-concept strategy supports diagnostics for discovery, applicable to robust IgRDT for clinical status in VL.
A study of 317 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from six countries (157 from Syria, 66 from Pakistan, 47 from Lebanon, 43 from Saudi Arabia, 2 from Ethiopia, and 2 from Iran) was conducted to investigate the incidence of caseating granulomas, which are typically associated with mycobacterial infections such as tuberculosis (TB). The study found that 195 (61.5%) of the patients had granulomas, which were categorized into three types: caseating (25.2%), suppurative (4.6%), and tuberculoid with necrosis (70.2%). Caseating and tuboid granuloma groups differed significantly in geographical distribution, with more cases in Saudi Arabia (p<0.0001). Histologically, both groups differed in the distribution of Ridley's pattern (RP), with RP3 in caseating granulomas (31% vs 15%) and RP5 in tuboid granuloma (38 vs 19%). Time to healing (RP) was shorter in tuboid vs case (4.0 vs 6.2 months). Parasitic index, species, and other variables did not differ between granuloma groups. A notable 18.2% of all CL cases had caseating granulomas, suggesting CL should be considered in differential diagnosis for caseating granulomas in endemic regions.
Researchers have identified a gene, Zfp69, a zinc finger transcription factor, as a candidate for the diabetogenic effect of QTL (quantitative trait locus) Nidd1, associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes in mice. This QTL is contributed by the SJ, NON, and NZ strains in outcross with New Zealand Obese (NZ) mice. A 2.1 megabase critical interval on chromosome 4 confers the diabetic phenotype, identified by interval-specific introgression of SJ into diabetes-resistant C57/BLJ and subsequent cross with NZO. Analysis of 10 genes in the interval by sequencing, qRT-PCR, and RACE-PCR revealed allelic variance of Zfp69. In NZ and C57/BLJ, a retrotransposon ILTRa in intron 3 disrupts gene formation of a truncated mRNA lacking coding for KR and Znf2 domains, whereas diogenic SJ, NON, and NZ alleles generate normal mRNA. The diogenic ZfpSJ allele with B6 background produces hyperglycemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased plasma triglyceride levels. The human Zfp orthologue, ZNF642, mRNA is increased in adipose from type 2 diabetes patients.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive model to predict cell differentiation in the vertebrate hematopoietic system, a complex system with many branching pathways and cell types. The model integrates regulatory and signalling networks controlling cell differentiation, using available qualitative data and a logical formalism for dynamical analysis. To handle the network's size and complexity, an original reduction approach with stable state identification was used. Simulations were performed in various environments to assess effects on cell differentiation, resulting in stable states corresponding to Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg subtypes. Additionally, transient hybrid cells co-expressing combinations of Th, Th, Treg, and Th17 markers were found to exist in environment-dependent manner. The model highlights the nature of these cell types and their relationships with canonical subtypes. The model can be used to explore novel pathways in silico.
Researchers have developed a quantitative model to understand the mechanisms controlling genome-wide patterns of transcription factor binding during Drosophila development. Transcription factors bind to thousands of genomic regions with varying affinities, but the forces determining their binding location, timing, and extent are not well understood. A thermodynamic model of transcription factor binding was used to evaluate the contribution of biophysical forces of five regulators of early embryonic-posterior patterning in Dophila melanogaster. Predictions based on DNA and protein affinities alone achieved a correlation of 0.4 with experimental measurements in vivo. Incorporating cooperativity and competition among factors and spatial patterning modeling had little effect on accuracy. A major source of error was prediction of events not occurring in vivo, attributed to reduced chromatin accessibility. Experimental measurements of genome-wide DNA accessibility were incorporated, restricting binding to open chromatin, improving predictions to 0.6-0.9 for various factors across target genes. The model was used to quantify roles of sequence, accessibility, and cooperativity. Results show that in open chromatin, binding can be predicted by sequence specificity of individual factors, with minimal interactions. A combination of experimentally determined chrom accessibility and computational models may predict binding of any transcription factor with precision.
Researchers have investigated the role of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHL) transcription factors, Daughterless (Da) and Extramacrochaete (Em), in regulating cell cycle progression in Drosophila imaginal discs. These factors are involved in cell proliferation and their activity is often deregulated in cancer cells. A genetic analysis revealed that Em controls the G2/M transition and proliferation in epithelial cells through Da. The main activator of this transition is the Cdc25 phosphatase, string. Ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced Em or high Da levels rescues proliferative defects in mutants. Additionally, evidence shows Da as a transcriptional repressor of string. These findings define a mechanism where Em controls proliferation by regulating Da, which transcriptionally represses string.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing phosphoproteomics data from interventional experiments to identify key proteins and signaling networks involved in cell growth and development. Phosphoproteomics is a tool for determining relative phosphorylation levels on a large scale, but differs from proteomics due to limited detectable sites per protein. The pipeline includes phosphopeptide analysis, network analysis, and causal discovery to compensate for missing values in proteomics studies. A dataset was generated using SILAC (Stable Isotope Labeling with amino acids in culture) with kinase-dead mutations. The pipeline was applied to Saccharomyces cerevisiae filamentous growth, identifying 5 high-confidence proteins and 19 hub proteins, including P2 and Hsp42, involved in stress responses and filament growth. Nine have direct or indirect involvement in filament growth. Four predicted proteins, N1, P2, P12, and R2, were validated by phenotypic experiments showing differential growth. The pipeline presents a systematic approach for discovering networks using phosphrote data and suggests candidates for further investigation. The methodology is applicable to other interventional studies via different platforms.
Researchers investigated the regulation of the X chromosome in the male germline of Drosophila melanogaster. They found that dosage compensation, the equalization of X gene expression in males and females, is absent in most of the Doph male germl. Microarray analysis revealed no evidence of X-specific inactivation during meiosis. The expression of a transgene driven by an autosomal promoter was reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus autosomes, but this difference was established premeiotic and persisted meiotic cells. The magnitude of the X-autosome difference in transgene expression could not be explained by dosage compensation, suggesting a previously unknown mechanism limits expression from X during spermatogenesis in Doph.
Researchers have investigated the early stages of Citrobacterium rodent infection, a mouse model for human diarrheal disease caused by Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). The pathogenesis of both species relies on forming intimate epithelium-adherent microcolonies, known as "attachment/effacement" (A) lesions, which must self-renew through continuous re-infection of the regenerating epithelium. The study found that colonic epithelial A microcolonies are clonal populations, dependent on local growth to persist. In wild-type mice, microies are established within the first 18 hours of infection, shaping intestinal geography and severity despite luminal presence. Mechanistically, resistance to A lesion formation is mediated by TLRMy88/Tr-dependent signaling, induced by virulent C. rodium in a gene-dependent manner. Data show that C. rodium pathogenesis in vivo is restricted to a short window determining disease severity.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the overlap between two populations when only a fraction of each population's objects are sampled. This is a common issue in data collection and sequencing techniques. Current methods for estimating overlap under subsampling have biases and uncertain results. The new method, based on Bayesian inference, accounts for subsampling rates and provides unbiased Bayes-optimal estimates of overlap. It also quantifies the uncertainty of these estimates and can be used in planning to balance sampling effort and uncertainty. The method is a special case of the general diversity problem, relevant in ecology and epidemiology of malaria. It assumes the total number of objects, species, or genes in each population is known.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms regulating the active state of eukaryotic kinases, enzymes that phosphorylate proteins to regulate cellular functions. The catalytic core of eukotic kinases oscillates between open, intermediate, and closed conformations, but the intramolecular interactions controlling this state were unclear. Using cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a model, biochemical, biophysical, and computational methods defined a set of conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions regulating these mechanics. A salt bridge between lysine from the β-strand and glutamate from α-helix and electro interaction between phosphorylated loop and α-helix and hydrophobic residues of Regulatory Shell were identified. Contrary to previous thought, conserved β-lysine was not essential for phosphorylation but for active state.
American Samoa conducted seven rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) from 2000-2006 under the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (LF). The World Health Organization recommends post-MDA surveillance using Transmission Assessment Surveys (TAS) for epidemiological assessment of recent LF transmission. This study compared the effectiveness of two survey designs for post-M surveillance: a school-based survey of children aged 6-7 and a community-based survey targeting people ≥8. In 2016, a systematic school-based TAS was conducted in 29 elementary schools and a cluster survey in 28 villages on two islands of American. Data were collected on demographics and risk factors using questionnaires, and geo-locations of schools and households. Blood samples were tested for circulating filarial antigen (CA) using Alere Filariasis Strip. Descriptive statistics were performed for variables. The school TAS (n=114) identified 9 antigen-positive children with an overall CA prevalence of 0.7% (95 CI: 0.3-1.8). The community survey (n= 7,711) identified 102 antigen people with an overall CA of 6.2% (95 CI 4.5-8). Adjusted village prevalence ranged 0-47.1. CA increased with age and was higher in males. Of 86 antigen community members, 25.6% were microfilaric. School TAS had limited sensitivity 0-23.8 and negative predictive value 25-83 but high specificity 83-100 and positive value 0- for identifying villages with transmission. The community survey identified more antigen individuals of all ages and foci of high prevalence. Both surveys confirmed recrudence of transmission.
In zebraf, sex determination is a complex and polygenic process influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. Germ cells, specifically oocytes, play a crucial role in sex determination, as animals lacking oocytes develop as males. Research has shown that oocytes are also necessary for maintaining the female phenotype in adult zraf. However, the mechanisms by which oocytes control sex and maintain the sexual phenotype are unknown. This study targeted two oocyte-produced signaling molecules, Bmp and Gdf9, and found a novel role for Bmp in maintaining female differentiation in zraf. Females lacking Bmp develop normally but switch to males during the mid-to-late juvenile stage and become fertile. Mutations in aromatase c19a1 revealed estrogen production is necessary for female development, and Bmp's function in sex maintenance is linked to regulating estrogen biosynthesis via promoting estrogen-producing granulosa cells in the oocyte.
Hox proteins play a crucial role in controlling morphogenesis along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals by regulating specific sets of target genes. Within their broad expression domains, individual Hox proteins control cell diversification and patterning and target gene expression in a localized manner, sometimes in a single cell. To achieve high regulatory specificity, it has been proposed that Hox proteins co-operate with other transcription factors to activate or repress their targets in a context-specific manner in vivo. However, few of these factors have been identified. The regulation of the death gene reaper (pr) by the Hox protein Deformed (D) is analyzed, suggesting that activation of pr in the anterior maxillary segment is achieved through a combinatorial interaction of D with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer. Context-dependent combinations of H proteins and other factors on small H response elements (HRE) may be responsible for spatio-temporal expression of H targets. A large number of factors are likely directly involved in H regulation in vivo.
Plants recognize and respond to pathogen attack through the recognition of pathogen-specific molecules at the cell surface and inside the cell. Pathogen effectors, or virulence factors, are monitored by intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) sensor proteins in plants and mammals. This study investigates the genetic requirements for defense responses of an autoactive mutant ADR-L2, an Arabidopsis coiled-coil (CC)-NB-LRR protein ADR-L2 functions upstream of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation in several defense contexts and acts as a "helper" to transduce specific activation from sensor NB-LRs. This activity does not require an intact P-loop. ADR-L2 and two related members are required for unregulated cell death in l1 mutant. ADR-L function is P-dependent in this context. An autoactive mutation A1-LD484 was generated in a homology motif M. ADR-L484 expression leads to dwarf plants with increased resistance and high SA levels. Morphology requires intact P, suggesting A-L484 phenotypes reflect NB activation. A-L484 was used to define requirements. Signaling from A484 does not require NAD oxidase and is regulated by E1 and At1 transcription. Regulation of A484 is correlated with outputs; these are SA-dependent and -independent. Requirements resemble SA-dependent signal amplification and death observed in LSD. Importantly, A484 autoactivation is controlled by E and SA separable but linked.
Researchers have identified two components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway in Arabidopsis, SUVH and ID2, which interact with the protein MOR6 to mediate transcriptional silencing. SUV and ID2 can act in the same pathway as MOR6 or synergistically with MOR6 to silence genes. Additionally, ID2 interacts with MOR6 to silence a subset of MOR6 target loci. Other RDM components, including Pol IV, V, R2, and DRM2, are also required for silencing a subset of MOR6 loci. MOR6 was previously shown to silence genes through heterochrom condensation. The study found that the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex SW3, SW3, and SWD interact with MOR6 and SUV9, mediating silencing. These results suggest RDM components are involved in methylation and MOR6-mediated heteroch condensation. This study links methylation to heteroch condensation, enhancing silencing at methylated regions.
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) plays a crucial role in modulating phenotypes in vertebrates, including flies and plants, suggesting its capacity to buffer genetic variation. In vertebrates, H90's protective function may account for variable penetrance and severity of heritable developmental malformations. Using zebraf as a model, H90 inhibition did not induce heat shock or perturb phenotype in wild-type strains. However, it increased severity of recessive eye phenotype caused by paxb mutation and decreased severity caused by su mutation. A new spectrum of severe eye malformations, anophthalmia, microphthalm, and nanthalmia, was uncovered by limited H90 inhibition. Inbreeding offspring from unaffected parents led to elevated malformation frequencies, indicating oligogenic nature. Unlike Drosoph, H90 inhibition decreased stability in zraf, shown by asymmetric anophia, microphthalm, nanthalm, and sunrise phenotypes. paxb mutation analysis suggests H90 buffering mechanism. zraf studies imply mild H90 perturbation at developmental stages underlies variable penetrance and express of anomalies where genotype and environment interact.
Researchers have identified and characterized N-terminal acetylated proteins in Drosophila melanogaster. Amino-terminal acetylation is a common post-translational modification where the N-terminus of a nascent polypeptide chain becomes acetylated after the removal of the initiating methion residue. The study analyzed amino-terminal peptides from Drosila K167 cells and detected over 1,200 mature N-termini, revealing that N acylation occurs with similar frequency in insects as in humans. A sole determinant of acylation was identified as the X PX rule, indicating acylation under all circumstances. This rule was used to genetically engineer proteins to study the biological relevance of ac presence or absence of acetyl group, creating an assay to probe functional importance of acylation. The assay was applied by expressing mutated transgenes in cell lines and flies. A strategy was developed to systematically study relevance of acylation in cells and organisms. The PX rule appears to be valid in lower and higher eukaryotes, suggesting it can be used to study acylation in all species.
Researchers investigated the termination mechanism of RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, focusing on its ability to recycle from termination to initiation for abundant tRNA production during cell proliferation and cancer. Two tRNA-mediated systems were used to screen for mutants with gain and loss of termination phenotypes, resulting in 122 point mutations mapped to a 3.9 Å structure of the RN III elongation complex (EC). Mutations clustered in the active bridge helix and loop, pore, and funnel, indicating involvement of the cleavage domain of the C subunit in termination. Purified RN III from a readthrough (RT) mutant exhibited increased elongation rate, supporting a kinetic model where elongation inversely relates to termination efficiency. Mutants showed correlations in vitro and in vivo, and surprisingly, amounts of transcription in vivo. A tRNA reporter with processing defect and strong terminator was used to rule out differences in RNA decay, indicating mutants synthesized more RNA than wild-type cells, exceeding elongation rate. Increased activity was unrelated to RN III repressor M1. Results showed active center elements of III, including C, are termination determinants, and some activating overall transcription. Similar mutations in cancer suggest an unforeseen mechanism III activation in disease.
Researchers have developed a method to predict protein-protein interactions mediated by SH2 domains using the structure of SH-phosphopeptide complexes and the FoldX algorithm. This approach aims to address the limitation of current experiments, which only covering a fraction of all protein interactions. The method was compared to experimentally derived consensus and substitution matrices for known in vitro and in vivo targets of SH domains, showing similar performance. Predictions were made for a set of human SH domains with known secondary structure and phosphorylation state. Validation was done using literature-derived SH interactions and a probabilistic score from naive Bayes integration of coexpression, conservation, interaction in other species, shared partners, and functions. Predictions led to new hypothesis for SH domains role in signaling.
Researchers have identified a protein called cyclophilin 40 (Cy40) that has the ability to dissolve toxic amyloid aggregates, which are a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. These aggregates are formed when the microtubule associating protein (MAP) tau is abnormally accumulates into toxic oligomers and amyloid deposits. Intrinsically disordered proteins like tau are enriched with proline residues that regulate secondary structure and aggregation. The orientation of proline residues is regulated by cis peptid-proly isomerases (Pases). The study found that Cy40, a Pase, dissolves tau amyloids in vitro. Additionally, Cy40 reduced amyloid-positive oligomeric species in a mouse model of tau accumulation, preserving neuronal health and cognition. Nuclear magnetic resonance (MR) revealed Cy interacts with tau at rich proline sites. Cy40 also interacted and disaggregated other aggregating proteins with prolines. Moreover, Cy40 lacking Pase activity prevented disaggregation in vitro. A unique property of Cy40 permits disaggregation to occur in energy-independent manner.
Researchers have investigated the process of heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria filaments, a form of cellular differentiation in multicellular organisms, using a systems biology framework. They formulated a set of differential equations to describe the evolution of molecular concentrations in a single cyanobacter under nitrogen deprivation. This allowed them to study the behavior of a single cyanacter under different conditions and simulate cyanobacteria filaments by coupling their genetic circuits via diffusion. The results showed that including diffusion and external conditions in the model reproduces the formation and sustainment of heteryst patterns in cyanobacteria as observed experimentally. The study aimed to bridge the gap between macroscopic and microscopic processes of heteryst and nitrogen deprivation in cyanacteria. The model was able to capture the essential dynamics of heteryst formation and sustainment in cyanobacteria filaments.
Despite the success of the Community-Directed Ivermect (CDI) program in combating oncherciasis in Africa, the disease remains a significant problem in Cameroon, with prevalence above the transmission threshold in some areas. A study investigated the relationship between people's beliefs and perceptions of onchiasis and their adherence to iverectin in three regions of Cameroon. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three districts with high onchias prevalence, with 30 participants selected per district. Adherence to iverect was similar in Bang and Bafia (55.0% and 48.8%, respectively) and lower in Yassi (40.7%). Among factors related to program and disease representations, perceptions of the program were most influential on adherence. Those with a negative opinion of iverect distribution were less compliant than those with a positive opinion (40% vs 55 in Bang, 48 vs 62 in Bafia, p 0.01). Negative appreciation of community distributors' commitment also affected adherence (22 vs 53 in Bang, 33 vs 59 Bafia, 27 vs 47 Yassi p 0.01). Misconceptions about onias transmission included lack of hygiene in Bafia and Yassi, while Bang believed onias due to sugar consumption (31 vs 5 in Bafia and Yassi p0.001). Local authorities should focus on education and community involvement to improve adherence.
Researchers investigated the relationship between DNA methylation, genetic variants, and protein biomarkers for various diseases, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. They analyzed DNA methylation data at 470,000 positions and over 10 million SNPs in relation to 121 protein biomarkers in 698-103 samples. Epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses were performed, integrating biomarker, DNA methylation, and SNP data. The study identified 124 loci with significant associations, with effect sizes up to 0.22 units per 1% DNA methylation change and 4 units per allele copy in EW and GWAS. Most GW loci were cis-regulatory, while EWAS loci were trans. Eleven EWAS loci associated with multiple biomarkers, including NL5 with CXCL, CX9, IL-12, and IL-18 levels. EWAS signals overlapping with GWAS were driven by genetic variants, while EW signals were confounded by smoking. Cis-regulatory SNPs for biomarkers affected DNA methylation, but not vice versa. The study found associations between biomarkers and DNA methylation at numerous loci, likely reflecting genetic variants, environmental exposures, or disease pathogenesis secondary effects.
Researchers investigated the impact of varicella zoster virus (VZV) on natural killer (NK) cells, which play a crucial role in anti-viral immunity. VV productively infects NK cells, but its effect on NK function was unknown. The study found that VV impairs NK's ability to respond to stimulation in vitro, leading to loss of cytotoxic and cytokine responses. Not only VV-infected NK cells, but also V-negative NK cells exposed to VV in culture were inhibited. This impairment depended on direct contact between NK and VV-infected cells. Profiling NK surface receptors by flow cytometry showed stable expression. Inhibited cells still released cytotoxic granules when stimulation bypassed receptor/ligand interactions and signalling, suggesting V paralysed NK from responding. Examination of degranulation cascade components showed perturbation following VV. In addition to degranulation, IF-γ and TNF production were repressed by VV co-culture, most strongly in V-infected NK. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) also infects NK in cell-associated manner and renders NK unresponsive to stimulation, but differentially cytokine production compared VV. Findings contribute to understanding pathogen inhibition of NK function and reveal VV immune manipulation strategy.
Apparent motion (AM) is a phenomenon where two stimuli presented at different locations evoke a perception of a stimulus moving between them. The neural basis of AM is thought to be increased activation of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons tuned to locations along the path. However, evidence remains inconclusive. Masking, reduced detectability of stimuli along AM path, has been taken as evidence for V1 activation. AM-induced responses interfere with physical stimuli along path, impairing perception. Masking can also be explained by predictive models, predicting responses match spatio-temporal prediction of stimulus along path.

A study found AM affects target detection, limiting performance at high contrast. Masking strongest when target identical to inducer orientation. A V-like population model of early processing was developed, based on contrast normalization. AM activation in V is too small to cause masking or perceived motion. The model predicts suppression early responses during AM, consistent with predictive coding framework.
Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) oncoprotein Tax plays a crucial role in the transformation of CD4+ T cells by promoting cell proliferation and survival, primarily through the activation of the NF-κB pathway and induction of NF-κ target genes. To understand the underlying mechanism of HTL-1-mediated transformation, it is essential to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Tax-induced IK activation. Previous studies have proposed multiple mechanisms for Tax-induced IK activation due to the blending of primary Tax-induced IK events and secondary IK events induced by cytokines secreted by Tax-induced IK-NF-κ activation. To resolve this, Tax-stimulated IK activation was reconstituted in a cell-free system to dissect the essential components for IK activation by Tax and the underlying biochemical mechanism. Tax was found to be a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase, catalyzing the assembly of mixed-link polyubiquitin chains with Ubc2, Ubc5, or U7. These mixed-link polyubiquitin chains are responsible for IK activation by binding to the NEM subunit of IK. This study reveals the biochemical function of Tax in IK activation, utilizing minimal ubiquitination components for NF-κ activation.
A systematic review of the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment in alien species was conducted using Bayesian meta-analytical methods. The study included a broad range of taxa, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants, long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. A positive effect of propagule pressure on establishment was found in all tested hypotheses. However, establishment was most dependent on propagule pressure in the range of 10-100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was primarily associated with analytical approaches, with evidence of larger effects in animal introductions than plant introductions. No variation was accounted for by study scale (field to global) or methodology (observational, experimental, or proxy) used.
Interleukin-17 (IL-17), a cytokine implicated in chronic and severe inflammatory diseases, enhances the production of pro-inflammatory mediators by attenuating the decay of encoding mRNAs. The degradation of these mRNAs depends on proteins (AUBPs) that target AU-rich elements in the 3'-untranslated region of mRNAs, facilitating either decay or stabilization. A novel ribonucleoprotein complex forms between AUB and microRNA (miR16), leading to target mRNA degradation. Notably, IL-17 attenuates miR16 expression and promotes binding of stabilizing AUB over destabilizing AUB, reducing mRNA decay. This indicates mi16 independently of sequence directs competition between degrading and stabilizing AUB for mRNAs. Approximately 8% of the human transcriptome is affected by AUB expression, and mi16 is ubiquitously expressed. IL-17 may affect additional cellular processes beyond inflammation.
In Uganda, both chronic and acute forms of Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) are present, with the acute form traditionally confined to the southeast and the chronic to the northwest. However, acute AT has spread to new districts, linked to infected cattle movement. Cattle are long-term reservoirs of human-infective T. rhodesiense, showing few signs of morbidity yet posing significant health risk. This study examined the relationship between T. rhodesense infection in humans and T. brucei in cattle at village level in Kaberido and Dokolo Districts, Uganda. Villages with reported cases of sleeping sickness had higher odds of T. brucei infection than non-case villages (OR:2.94, 95%CI:1.38-6). Cattle age significantly affected likelihood of T brucei infection: 18-36 months (OR:3.51,95:1.63-7) and over 36 (OR:4.20,95:2.08-8) had higher odds than under 18 months. Village sleeping status significantly affected T. rhense detection in cattle, with higher likelihood in case villages (OR:25,95:1.2-520). Higher average T bruce prevalence (>16.3) in herd associated with T. rhense detection (OR:25,95:1-520).
The study investigates the role of the NS complex in regulating housekeeping genes in Drosophila melanogaster. The complex is composed of four members: NS1, NS3, MBD2, and MCR2. ChIP-seq analysis reveals that 85.5% of NS-bound genes are constitutively expressed across cell types. Histone modifications H4ac, H3me2, H3me, and H9 are abundant in promoter regions of NS-targeted genes. These genes have well-defined nucleosome-free regions and broad transcription initiation patterns. ChIP-seq of RNA polymerase II in NS1 and NS3-depleted cells shows both proteins are required for efficient recruitment to NS-target promoters. This coincides with reduced TBP and TFIIB binding, indicating optimal pre-initiation complex recruitment. Genes losing most Pol upon NS knockdown are enriched in Replication Element (RE). The study demonstrates the MO-containing NS complex regulates housekeeping genes by modulating Pol transcription initiation.
Researchers have developed a transgenic mouse model to study facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FD), a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by epigenetic regulation of the D4 macrosatellite repeat. Individuals with FD generally have more than 10 repeats in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4, while the most common form FD (FD1) is caused by contraction to fewer than 10 repeats, associated with decreased epigen repression and variegated expression of DUX, a germline transcription factor encoded in the repeat. The transgenic mice carry D4 arrays from FD1 and control alleles, recapitulating epigen and D4 expression seen in patients and controls, respectively, including high D4 in germline, incomplete epigen repression in somatic tissue, and FD-specific varieg D4 in sporadic muscle nuclei with D4 chromatin relaxation. The mice also show D4 activates similar gene groups in muscle as in human muscle. These mice represent a valuable model for FD and will study molecular mechanisms and test new interventions.
Researchers have developed a malaria vaccine candidate, Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1), which provides protection against certain strains of the parasite, but not others. To overcome this limitation, they investigated the structural basis of cross-strain inhibition. A vaccine containing four diverse AMA1 proteins (3D, F, VO, HB, and Wm) elicited polyclonal antibodies that inhibited invasion of both vaccine and non-vaccine strains of Plasmodium falciparum. Comparing polyclonal anti-Q with strain-specific monoval 3D AMA, Q induced higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies associated with conserved domain-3 and reduced domain-2 responses. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies (m) against Q reacted with a cross-reactive epitope at the rim of hydrophobic domain-1; this epitope mapped to conserved AMA and encompassed the 1-loop. mbs binding the 1-loop (10, 4, 8 and 4) were ~10-fold more potent than AMA-inhib m and mode of action was inhibition AMA binding to ligand R2. Unlike epit of 3D-specific m, the 1-loop inhibitory was partially conserved across strains. Another m, bound domain-3, was broadly inhibitory and blocked proteolytic processing AMA. m was weakly inhibitory but synergized with strain-transending m, which binds close hydroobic on cons and inhibits R2 binding AMA. Novel susceptible regions and epitopes identified can improve antigen breadth and inhib response AMA vaccines. Vaccination with diverse proteins provides coverage by redirecting response conserved epitopes.
Researchers have identified a mechanism that regulates the timing of mitotic spindle displacement in cells, a process crucial for unequal cell division. The mechanism involves the anaphase-promoting complex (APC), its activator Cdc20/Fizzy, its target cyclin, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). In Caenorhabditis zygotes, mitotic spindle displacement begins at a precise time after chromosomes congress to the metaphase plate. Reducing proteasome function, APC, or C20/Fizzy function delays spindle displacement, while inactivating CD in metaphase causes early spindle displacement. Displacing spindle from this mechanism results in premature displacement of incompletely assembled spindle components. The study shows that in this system, spindle positioning is delayed until APC inactivates CD, ensuring spindle does not move until fully assembled. This is the first demonstration of mitotic timing spindle displacement in animal cell division. The link between cell cycle and asymmetric division might be evolutionarily conserved, as spindle displaced at similar stage mitosis in diverse systems.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide scan to investigate genetic adaptations to high-altitude hypoxia in Tibetan and Andean populations, who have lived in high-altitude regions for millennia. These populations exhibit unique physiological responses to low oxygen levels, including circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations. The study aimed to identify genetic basis of these adaptations by examining genomic regions associated with altitude-related phenotypes and genes involved in oxygen metabolism. Four statistical methods were used to detect signatures of natural selection, identifying candidate genes and regions in each population separately. Results showed distinct patterns of adaptation between Tibetans and Andeans, with evidence of selection in different genes or regions. One gene, EGLN (PH2), involved in oxygen sensing, showed selection in both populations, but with differing variation patterns. Key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes were implicated in adaptation in Andans, while different chromosomal regions in Tibetans. Data suggest genetic role in high-altitude adaptation and provide basis for future studies to confirm selection-nominated genes and regions in adaptation.
Double-strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA are hazardous events that can arise from environmental stress or replication errors. Efficient repair of DSBs is crucial for cell survival, but faulty repair can lead to genetic instability, making the choice of DSB repair pathway significant. This study reveals that inverted repeats (IRs) near DSBs can channel repair into a pathway that leads to gene conversion instead of break-induced replication (BIR) pathway, resulting in instability. IRs ability to form unusual structures in single-strand DNA, formed by DSB resection, explains their effect. IRs form two types of structures, depending on spacer length separating IRs. IRs with long (1-kb) spacers are involved in intermolecular single-strand annealing (SSA), forming dimers, while IRs with short (12-b) spacers participate intramolecular SSA, forming fold-back (FB) structures. Both structures interfere with accurate DSB repair by conversion and channeling DSB into BIR, promoting genomic destabilization. Protein complexes process FB containing short (12-b) versus long (1-k) ssDNA loops differently. FB with short loops are processed by MRX-Sae2, while Rad1-Rad10 processes long loops. This study uncovers mechanisms of genomic destabilization from re-routing DSB into unusual pathways by IRs. Given IR abundance in human genome, findings contribute to understanding IR-mediated destabilization with human disease.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing both acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts, with chronic infections thought to be caused by biofilms. Biofilms are structured, multicellular microbial communities encased in an extracellular matrix enabling long-term survival in the host. This study aimed to develop an animal model for in vivo study of P. aerugin biofilms in Drosila melanogaster. Drosila were orally infected with P. aerugin, and biofilms localized and visualized in dissected at 24 h post-infection. Biofilms had a characteristic structure and extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysacide. P. aerugin cells from in vivo biofilms showed increased antibiotic resistance to planktonic cells. Biofilm formation was dependent on expression of exopolysacide genes, as pel:: mutant failed to form biofilms. The:: mutant was more virulent than PA1, while hyperbio strain (Z3) demonstrated less virulence than PA1, indicated by survival of flies at 14 postinfection. Bio formation by PA1 and in the crop was associated with induction of dipteric, cecin A and antimicrobial gene expression 24 postin. Infection with non-bio forming resulted in decreased gene expression. These results provide insights into host-pathogen interactions during P. aerugin infection Dila and highlight Dila as model for study P aerugin bio in vivo.
Researchers investigated the genetic factors contributing to the variation in expression of the vasopressin 1 receptor 1 (Av1) gene, which plays a crucial role in mediating vasopress-mediated behaviors. The study focused on the proximal 5' flanking sequence and polymorphic microsatellite element in the Av1 gene. Using homologous recombination in mice, they found that the proximal 5' flanking sequence modestly contributes to differences in vasopress receptor 1 (V1R) distribution. They also confirmed that variation in V1R impacts behavior in the forced swim test. Additionally, they discovered that the Av1 microsatellite structure influences Av1 expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring some inter- and intra-species differences in V1 patterns in voles. This is the first evidence that polymorphic microsatellites near behaviorally relevant genes contribute to diversity in brain expression, providing a mechanism for generating diversity at both individual and species levels. However, results suggest that many species-specific patterns are mediated by elements outside the 5' flanking region of the gene.
In a study on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, researchers investigated the mechanisms of genome instability caused by impairment of messenger RNA (mRNA) biogenesis and Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (A) (AID). The study focused on the transcription of switch regions of immunoglobulin genes in B cells, which generates stable-loops that are targeted by A, leading to class switch recombination (CSR) and translocations with c-MYC responsible for Burkitt's lymphomas. In yeast, stable-loops are formed co-transcriptionally in mutants of TH, a conserved complex involved in mRNA biogenesis. The researchers devised a chromosomal system based on mammalian switch regions and c-MYC to analyze chromosomal rearrangements in wild-type and TH mutants. They found that A acts on heterologous and c-M transcribed sequences, leading to double-strand breaks (DSBs), which cause chromosomal translocations via Non-homous Joining (NHE). A-induced translocations were enhanced in TH null mutants, indicating A-mediated DS depend on-loop formation. The study provides insights into the role of m bi in preventing rearrangements and A-mediated genome instability, and shows that urac residues produced by A-deamination are processed into DS and chromosomal rearrangements by conserved DNA repair functions from yeast to human cells.
In Escheria coli coordinates cell division and chromosome replication to produce viable progeny by positioning its division apparatus relative to nucleoids. However, cells lacking this positioning can still propagate. This study investigates how E. coli partitions chromosomes during asymmetric divisions. Time-lapse imaging shows DNA translocase Fts pumps 80% (3.7 Mb) of chromosome between daughters at 1700±800 bp/s, with rare pauses and no reversals. Most movement occurs at late division when ZipA dissociates from septum and septum constricts to 250 nm. Data suggests constriction enables DNA translocation by Fts.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework for selecting the optimal set of peptides for epitope-based vaccines using integer linear programming (ILP). Epitope-based vaccines have various applications, including therapeutic and prophylactic approaches for infectious and cancer diseases. The development of an epitope-based vaccine relies on knowledge of target-specific antigens from immunogenic peptides, called epitopes, which are key components of the vaccine. Due to regulatory, economic, and practical concerns, the number of epitopes in a vaccine is limited. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding epitopes are highly polymorphic, with each patient having a unique set of MHC I and II molecules. A combination effective for one person may be ineffective for another, making optimal epitope selection crucial. The framework uses IL to formulate various vaccine design problems and identify optimal epitopes from a set of predicted or experimentally determined epitopes. It selects the set with maximum likelihood of eliciting a broad and potent immune response. The IL approach allows flexible formulation of numerous design variants. Immunological requirements, such as coverage of epitopes per antigen, coverage of MHC alleles, and avoidance of high mutation epitopes, are translated into constraints or modifications of the objective function. The algorithm outperforms a greedy strategy and evolutionary algorithm with runtimes of seconds for typical sizes.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in facilitating HIV-1 transmission to the cervico-vaginal tissue in an ex vivo system. IL-7 is a cytokine present in semen, and its concentration is increased in HIV-1-infected individuals. The study simulated an in vivo situation by depositing HIV-1 on cervico-vaginal tissue with IL-7 concentrations comparable to those in semen of HIV-1-infected men. Results showed IL-7 enhanced HIV-1 replication in cervico-vaginal tissue and lymphoid tissue explants. Analysis of infected cells revealed IL-7 reduced CD4+ T cell apoptosis by decreasing apoptotic marker APO2.7 and increasing anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. IL-7 also increased cycling CD4 T cells, as evidenced by Ki-67 staining.
Researchers studied the response of Aedes aegypt cells to Zika virus (ZIK) infection, focusing on the role of RNA interference (RNAi) pathways in controlling arbovirus infections. Two RNAi pathways, PI-interacting RNA (piRNA) and exogenous short interfering RNA (exiRNA), produce virus-derived small RNAs of 25-29 and 21 nucleotides, respectively. The exi pathway is considered key to mosquito antiviral response. In Aedes aegti cells, ZIK-specific siRNAs were produced and loaded into exi effector protein Argonaute 2 (Ago2), but Ago knockdown did not enhance virus replication. Enhanced ZIK replication was observed in D2-knockout cells, indicating exi pathway involvement in antiral response. ZIK-specific pi-sized RNAs were detected, but lacked pi signature and bound Ago3, not Pi5 or Pi6. Silencing Pi proteins showed Ago, Pi5, or Pi6 knockdown did not enhance ZIK replication, only Pi4 displayed antiral activity. ZIK capsid C protein amplified reporter alphavirus replication, unlike yellow fever protein, which inhibited exi pathway.
Researchers conducted a study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to investigate the species of Sporothrix associated with sporotrichosis, a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenii. The study aimed to determine if Sporrix brasiliensis was linked to atypical clinical manifestations of sporrichosis. A cross-sectional study analyzed 50 Sporrix isolates from patients with different clinical manifestations using phenotypic and genotypic methods. Results showed distinct clinical and therapeutic responses between Sporrix brasili (45 cases) and Spor schenii sensu stricto (5 cases). Sporrix brasili was associated with disseminated cutaneous infections, mucosal infections, and hypersensitivity reactions, whereas Spor schii presented less severe, localized disease. Patients with Sporrixili required shorter itraconazole treatment (16 weeks) compared to Sporii (24 weeks). These findings suggest Sporrix species are linked to different sporrich manifestations and Sporili is effectively treated with itraazole.
Recent studies have suggested that a significant portion of the mammalian genome is transcribed is not accounted for by annotated genes. To investigate this, researchers used single-end and paired RNA-Seq and tiling to assess the quantity and composition of Poly+ RNA in human and mouse tissues. Relative to tiling, RNASeq identified many transcribed regions outside known exons and non-coding RNAs, with most being introns, suggesting they are pre-mRNA fragments. Chromosomal locations of intergenic regions in RNASeq are near genes, consistent with alternative splicing and polyadenylation, promoter and terminator transcripts, or new exons. Reads bridging splice sites identified 5,544 new exons, affecting 3,554 genes. Remaining regions correspond to single reads with characteristics of low background noise or small transcripts (median length=111 bp) present at high levels, displaying conservation and originating from open chromatin. Bona fide intergenic transcripts exist, but their number is low compared to exons, and genome is not as pervasively transcribed as reported.
Researchers have developed a computational and experimental method to enhance the thermostability of the flavin mononucleotide-based protein Bacillus subtilis YLO domain by 31°C, expanding its applicability in thermophilic systems. A five-step approach was employed: single mutant screening to identify thermost candidates, experimental evaluation to confirm positive selections, computational redesign around thermost regions, experimental reevaluation, and multiple combination. The method is simple and effective, applicable to proteins where other methods face difficulties, providing a tool to improve thermost.
Researchers investigated the diversity of Lutzia sand flies and their infection rates by Leishmania and Wolbachia species in Barro Island, Panama. Lutzia flies are the primary vectors of leishmaniasis, a protozoan disease, in the New World. In the Panama Canal watershed, cutaneous leishias is a health threat to residents and tourists. The study aimed to determine which Lutzia species are present, their relationships, and how they are infected by Leish and Wolia to mitigate the disease impact. DNA sequences were used to determine the diversity and phylogenetic relationships of Phleominae in the understory of Barro Island. The CO1 DNA barcode gene supported morphology-based species determinations, revealing two cryptic species, Lu. sp. vespilion and Lu. gzi. ITS-1 primers detected Leish in 43.3% of Lu. trapi, 26.3% Lu. gzi, and 0% other sand species. The ITS-1 sequence from Leish Lu. trapi and Lu. gzi was 93% similar to Leish viannia in GenBank, a species unknown in Panama but recognized as cutaneous leish vector in northern and central America. Distinct Wolia strains were detected in three sand species, including Lu. trapi, co-occurring with Leish. Two species, members of separate clades, carried Leish at high frequency, likely vectors of leish to humans or mammals. A single Leish, Le. naiff, was identified in both species, known to cause cutaneous in America but not reported in Panama, suggesting its range expansion or introduction. Leish and Wolia in Lu. trap identifies a vector as potential target for Wolia population control.
Researchers have investigated the mechanisms underlying human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) reactivation in dendritic cells (DCs), which is crucial for understanding the devastating consequences of CMV infection. They found that mitogen- and stress-activated kinase (MSK) family is involved in ERK reactivation, and this response is dependent on CREB binding to the viral major early promoter (MP). CREB binding to MP serves as a target for MS recruitment. MS-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is required for histone demethylation, allowing CMV exit from latency. Data suggest that CRE binding to MP is necessary for MS kinase recruitment, initiating chromatin remodeling at MP for reactivation. CRE also promotes chromatin modifications conducive to viral expression and acts as a transcription factor. Inhibiting interaction between CRE and MS could be a therapeutic strategy.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the protein NOL11 in ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development in vertebrates. N11 is highly expressed in the developing cranial neural crest (CNC) of amphibians and mammals, and its knockdown in Xenopus results in impaired pre-rRNA processing, increased apoptosis, and abnormal craniofacial cartilage development. Inhibition of p53 rescues the skeletal phenotype but not the ribosome biogenesis defect, indicating an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for removing ribosome-impaired craniofacial cells. Excessive activation of this mechanism impairs craniofac development. The study reveals a novel requirement for N11 in craniofac development and the first model of a ribosopathy, providing insight into the relationship between ribosome proteins and cranfac cell survival.
Researchers have developed a high-density protein microarray to identify seroreactive proteins of Leptira interrogans serovar Copenhagen, the causative agent of leptospirosis, a zoonotic disease worldwide. A total of 274 individuals, including 80 acute-phase, 80 convalescent, and 114 healthy subjects from regions with high, endemic, and no transmission of leptpi were investigated. The microarray comprised 61% of the Leptira interrogans proteome. Nitrocellulose blot assay validated the accuracy of the microarray results. Sixteen antigens were found to discriminate between acute cases and healthy individuals from regions with high transmission of leptpi, and 18 antigens distinguished convales cases. Some identified antigens, such as Lip32, non-identical domains of Lig, Gro, and Lo22, are known to be recognized by human sera, validating the serodiagnostic approach. Novel antigens, including hypothetical LIC15, showed sensitivity and specificity for both acute and convalescent patients. This study is the first large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with naturally acquired leptiral infection and novel seragnostic leptiral antigens recognized by leptpi cases. Identified antigens may be used in new test development and improvement of current assays for diagnosing neglected tropical disease. Further research is needed to assess utility in deployable diagnostic platforms.
Researchers investigated the role of melanization in the defense against the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana in the malaria vector mosquito Anopheles gambia. Melanization, a potent effector mechanism in arthropods, was found to form on all stages of the fungus, including conidia, germ tubes, and hyphae, but did not inhibit growth. However, silencing TEP1 and CL8, key regulators of melanization in A. gambiae, abolished melanization on hypha but not germinating conidia or tubes. A layer of hemocytes surrounded germinating conidia but not hypha, suggesting melanization of early stages is cell-mediated, while late is humoral dependent on T1 and CL8. Microscopic analysis revealed T1 association with hypha surfaces and requirement of both T1 and CL8 for phenoloxidase recruitment. Fungal proliferation was rapid in T1 and CL8 knockdown mosquitoes, exhibiting increased sensitivity to B. bassiana infections.
Researchers investigated the potential of known mammalian Dengue virus host factors (DENVFs) inhibitors to block Dengue virus infection in the mosquito vector Aedes aegypt. Four compounds, bafilomycin (BAF), myopholic acid (MA), castanospermine (CAS), and deoxojirimycin (DN), were tested for their ability to inhibit DENV infection in the mosquito midgut and salivary gland. Injection of BA (5µM) and MA (25µM) prior to feeding on virus-infected blood reduced DENV titers in the midut by 56% and 60, and in the saliv gland by 90 and 83, respectively, while CAS and DN had no effect. Ingestion of BA and MA through sugar or blood meal also resulted in virus inhibition. RNA-mediated silencing of vacuolar H+-ATase (vPase) and inos-5-monophosphate degenase (IMP) genes reduced DENV infection, indicating BA and MA inhibition occurred through these DENVFs. Timing of BA and MA administration was crucial, treatment after virus exposure diminished antiviral effect. This study provides proof-of-principle that chemical or RNA-mediated depletion of DENV vP and IMP can suppress DENV in adult Aegipt, potentially reducing transmission.
Researchers investigated the role of cell volume in neuronal dynamics, particularly in the context of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization. They developed a model that incorporates cell swelling, ion concentrations, and oxygen supply into the Hodgkin-Hux spiking dynamics, demonstrating a transition between seizure and spreading states in response to osmotic pressure changes. The study revealed a dynamical parameter that separates seizure from depression, and another that demarcates depression from anoxic depolar. The model highlights the neuroprotective role of glial buffering against seizures and depression, and provides insights into anoxic depolar and cell swelling during ischemia. The results suggest that seizures, depression, and anoxicolar lie along a continuum of neuronal membrane dynamics, requiring consideration of ion concentrations, homeostasis, and osmotic response. A unified framework is proposed for a range of neuronal behaviors, potentially relevant to understanding and developing interventions for pathological states.
Paracidioides brasiliensis, the causative agent of paracidiomycosis, a prevalent mycosis confined to Latin America, triggers an inflammatory response in murine bone-derived dendritic cells through the activation of the NLRP inflamome, a cytoplasmic multiprotein complex. This results in the release of IL-1β, a pro-inflammatory cytokine essential for host defense against opportunistic infections. However, the role of IL-1 in primary fungal infections, such as P. brasili, is not well understood. 

 Murine dendritic cells respond to P. brasili yeast cells by releasing IL-1 in a Syk, casp-1, and NLR family member NLR3 dependent manner. P. bras-induced NLR3 inflamome activation is dependent on K+ efflux, ROS production, phagolysosomal acidification, and cathepsin release. Mice lacking IL-1 receptor demonstrate that IL-1 signaling plays a role in killing P. bras by murine macrophages.
Toxoplas gondii, a brain-tropic parasite, infects nucleated cells, including astrocytes and neurons in vitro, but primarily resides in neurons in vivo. In vitro studies showed that interferon-γ-stimulated astrocytes, but not neurons, clear intracellular parasites, suggesting neurons are persistently infected in vivo due to their inability to clear intracellular parasites. A novel Toxoplas-mouse model was used to mark and track host cells interacting with parasites, even transiently. Toxoplas showed a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection. This predction persisted in IF-γ depletion, infection resistant to the mechanism by which murine astrocytes clear parasites, and when parasites were directly injected into the brain. These findings, combined with prior work, indicate neurons are not incidentally infected but Tooplas's primary in vivo target.
Researchers have developed a free-boundary model to explain the behavior of cells undergoing lamellipodial motility, a type of cell movement characterized by the extension and retraction of the cell membrane. The model focuses on the interplay between actin-myosin contractility, force balance, and myosin transport. The model accounts for isotropic contraction proportional to myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous adhesion. Contraction generates a spatially graded actin flow, which reinforces contraction via myin redistribution and retraction of the lamellip boundary. Actin protrusion at the boundary counters retraction, and the balance of protrusion and retraction shapes the lamipodium. The model reveals that motility initiation depends on three dimensionless parameters: myosin-dependent contractility, characteristic adhesion length, and actin protrusion rate. When contractility is strong, cells break symmetry and move steadily along straight or circular trajectories, and motility is sensitive to boundary conditions. A parameter space scan shows that contractile motility supports cell turning in conditions with short adhesion and fast protrusion, causing myos accumulation in a small region at the rear, destabilizing cell symmetry.
Researchers have developed a novel technique to assess the confidence levels of protein-protein interactions (PPI) in networks obtained from experimental studies, addressing the challenges of noise and incompleteness in these networks. High-throughput methods such as yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) and tandem affinity purification (TAP) have generated vast amounts of PPI data, but with high false positive and false negative rates, estimated at 64% and 43-71% for YH, respectively, and comparable for T. The new approach utilizes geometric graphs as the best model for PPI networks, achieving 85% specificity and 90 sensitivity. It assigns confidence scores to physical-protein interactions in the human P network from BioGRID, predicting 251 interactions, with a significant fraction corresponding to shared Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Predicted interactions were validated in the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) and BioGRID's newer release.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism contributing factor to the pathogenesis of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), a neurodegenerative disease caused by non-coding CT repeat expansions. In addition to the sense-expanded transcript, antisense transcripts also play a role in disease progression. A Drosila model was established to investigate the interaction between CTG and CAG repeats. Studies showed enhanced toxicity in flies co-expressing CTG and CAG repeats. Expression of both transcripts led to pathogenesis and generation of dcr-2 and ago-dependent 21-nt repeat-derived siRNAs. These small RNAs targeted C-containing genes, such as Ataxin-2 and TATA-binding protein (TBP), which have CAG repeats in both fly and human. The findings suggest that generation of triplet-derived siRNAs may enhance toxicity in repeat diseases with antisense transcription.
Researchers have investigated the phylogeny and virulence of Pectobacterium sp. SCC3, a soft rot pathogen isolated from a diseased potato in Finland in the 1980s. Genomic and proteomic analysis revealed that SCC3, previously classified as Pectacterium carotovorum, is now accurately classified as Pobacter wasiae. Phylogenetic analysis of P. carotorum and P. wasiae strains indicates that P. wasiae has been present in potato fields worldwide. A combination of genomic and in planta experiments identified features distinguishing SCC3 and P. wasiae from other soft rot bacteria, including the absence of a type III secretion system contributing to virulence in other rot species. Experimentally confirmed virulence determinants include the putative transcription regulator SirB, two redundant type VI secretion systems, and horizontally acquired clusters Vic1 and Vic2 with predicted virulence genes. The genome also revealed traits related to life in planta or specific conditions, such as a benzoic/salicylic acid carbox methyltransferase of eukary origin. This study provides a basis for further investigation of virulence distribution and phylogeny of soft bacteria and potentially other bacteria.
Researchers investigated the changes in mitochondrial protein expression in cells with depleted mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) using network analysis of gene expression data. Mitochondrial proteins are encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, but little is known about changes in nuclear-encoded proteins (mtome) in dysfunctional states. The study analyzed mt-depleted (ρ) mitochondria using quantified proteomics data and modularized into functional networks to examine systemic properties of dysfunction. Two predominant sub-networks of upregulated and downregulated proteins were identified, exhibiting distinct biological processes. Downregulated modules involved typical mitochondrial functions, while upregulated proteins were responsible for mtDNA repair, regulation, and protein transport. Comparison of proteome and transcriptome data showed ρ cells attempted to compensate for mt depletion by modulating protein expression and transport. Results demonstrate protein composition changes remodel mitochondrial networks in response to cellular dysfunction, providing a framework for understanding how cells respond to mitochondrial dysfunctions.
Researchers have developed a method to deduce the kinetics of protein synthesis in vivo from transition rates measured in vitro. The method has two components: the kinetic distance concept, which quantitatively compares kinetics of multistep processes in different environments, and minimization of kinetic distance between in vitro and in vivo processes. The kinetic distance depends logarithmically on transition rates and can be interpreted in terms of free energy barriers. The method is applied to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression, described by a cod-specific Markov model with three pathways for tRNA binding. Transition rates are determined in vitro, then in vivo rates are predicted by minimization and validated by three sets of in vivo data: cod-dependent speeds, dynamics, and missense frequencies. Agreement is found between theory and experiment without adjusting parameters. In vivo rates lead to smaller error than vitro rates, primarily due to improved tRNA selection. The method is computationally simple and can be applied to biomolecular processes with in vitro kinetics.
Researchers investigated the evolution of Helicobacter pylori during infection in hosts and families by sequencing 39,300 bp in 78 gene fragments from 97 isolates. The study included 34 pairs of sequential samples from 0.25 to 10.2 years apart and single isolates from 29 individuals (average age 45) from 10 families. Sequence diversity increased over time in a clock-like manner in sequential isolates. Approximate Bayesian computation estimated mutation, recombination rates, recombination tract length, and diversity. Results showed short-term mutation rate 1.4×10^-6 to 4.5×10^-6 per nucleotide per year, with recombination introducing three times as many substitutions as mutation. Long-term rate over millennia 5-17 lower due to non-synonymous removal by purifying selection.
Researchers have discovered that melanopsin, a pigment found in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, plays a significant role in visual perception beyond driving reflex responses such as circadian entrainment and pupillary movements. Using new reporter lines, they found melanin projections extend to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the origin of thalamocortical neurons, and support physiological responses in the GN and cortex in mice lacking rods and cones. Chromatic stimuli isolated melanin responses in intact mice reveal melanin input to 40% of LGN neurons activated by light. Melanin input increases firing rate of these neurons. Melan knockout mice confirm melanin required for irradiance encoding. The study establishes melanin photoreception as a source of sensory input to the thalamocortical system, providing irradiance information, allowing responses in the absence of rods and cones. Melanin ganglion cells are a potential origin of visual perception and may support vision in retinal degeneration.
HIV-1 infection leads to a significant depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells, which play a crucial role in regulating isotype switching and transepithelial transport of antibodies. This study investigated the impact of CD4+ cell depletion on humoral responses to mucosal antigens in HIV-1-infected individuals. A comprehensive analysis of systemic humoral responses to intestinal microbiota revealed reduced IgG responses to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, but not Bacteroid antigens. Intestinal secretions from antiretroviral-treated HIV-1-infected individuals showed elevated IgM and decreased IgA/Ig and IgG/Ig ratios to various microbial and food antigens. These findings indicate reduced mucosal B cell competence for class recombination from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their capacity to react to gut antigens. Decreased microbiota-specific IgA and IgG may contribute to microbial translocation across the mucosal barrier and systemic dissemination, driving chronic inflammation in HIV-1-infected individuals.
Populations of species in ecosystems are constrained by the availability of resources in their environment, leading to a balance between the growth of one population and reduction of others. Traditional models of biodiversity assume incremental changes due to births and deaths of individuals. This study proposes an alternative mechanism driven by abrupt reduction in size of a single species, freeing resources for others. This may be relevant for communities with strain collapses caused by bacteriophages or infectious diseases. The emergent dynamics is characterized by 'diversity waves' triggered by collapses of dominating populations. Diversity peaks at the beginning of each wave and decreases exponentially. Species abundances have bimodal time-aggregated distribution with lower peaks of collapsed or newly introduced species and upper not yet collapsed. Most waves have multiple peaks. A self-organized peak structure has long-term memory across waves, resulting in scale-free time-aggregated distribution with exponent 1.7. The model is robust to variations in rules such as diffusion, species-specific growth and extinction rates, and bet-hging strategies.
Chemotaxis in Escherichia coli, a paradigm of simple behavior, has been extensively studied due to its significant competitive advantage and high evolution rates in bacteria. The chemaxis system is expected to be optimized as bacteria follow gradients by performing temporal comparisons of chemector concentrations along runs, an efficient strategy given their size and speed. Concentration differences are detected by a sensory system and transmitted to modulate flagellar motors, decreasing tumble probability and reorientation if perceived change is positive. Regulation of tumble probability is sufficient to explain chemactic drift up the gradient, assumed only mechanism of E coli. coli chemaxis. This study uses simulations to predict an additional navigation mechanism in E coli. Experimentally observed dependence of tumbling on motor number suggests tumble probability and reorientation also depend on swimming direction along gradient. Mean tumbling angles up and down gradient predicted by model differ, resulting in enhanced cellular velocity along gradient. A new level of coli chemaxis optimization arises from flagellar switching and tumbling angle fine-tuning. Similar strategy likely used by peritously flagellated bacteria, another level bacterial chemaxis development.
Medullary thymic epithelial (mTE) cells play a crucial role in establishing tolerance by presenting self-peptides to autoreactive thymocytes and diverting them into regulatory T cells. Activation of the NFκB pathway in TE precursors is necessary for TE maturation and medullary formation. This study reveals that Stat3 signaling also contributes to TE development and homeostasis. Constitutively active Stat3 in the TE compartment increases TE cellularity, bypassing positive thymocyte signals for medull formation. Conditional deletion of Stat disrupts medull architecture and reduces TE numbers. Stat does not affect TE proliferation, but promotes survival of immature MHCloCDlo TE precursors. In contrast, alterations in the TE compartment do not affect cortical cellularity or organization.
Researchers used an in silico approach to identify 511 small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) in Clostridium difficile, a common cause of nosocomial diarrhea, to understand their role in physiology and pathogenesis. In parallel, RNA-seq and 5-end RNA-seq were used to identify C difficile RNAs and their transcription start sites at three growth conditions: exponential phase, stationary, and starvation. This approach identified 251 putative RNAs, including 94 intergenic trans-regulators, 91 cis-antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. Expression of 35 RNs was confirmed by gene-specific approaches. Some RNs, including antisense, may control C difficile autolytic activity showed phase-dependent expression. 16 c-diMP-responsive ribwitches were expressed, with evidence for regulatory control of motility and biofilm formation. Abundant RNs encoded by C CRIS loci may be important for C survival in phage-rich gut. This study provides a basis for future characterization and identification of mechanisms of RNA-based regulation in this emergent enteropath.
The hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein downregulates the abundance of liver-specific microRNA-122 (mi-122) by promoting its destabilization via inhibition of GLD-2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. This decrease in mi-122 expression results in dysregulation of its functions, including its proviral activity for HCV. High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies reveals that the 22-nucleotide (nt) prototype mi-122 is modified at its 3' end by 3'-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. The proportion of mi-122 bearing a single nucleotide tail of ribonucle decreases in liver specimens from HCV patients. Single-nucle-tailed mi-122 isomers display increased miRNA activity and stability compared to 22-nt prototype mi-122. The 3-terminal extension is catalyzed by unique nucleotidyl transfer activity of GL-2, capable of adding single ribonucle without preference adenyl to mi-122 3 end. HCV protein inhibits GL-2 and interaction with GL- in cytoplasm is responsible for mi- downregulation.
Researchers have identified a pattern of age-consistent acquired immunity against Trypanosoma brucei in Serengeti, a species of trypanosome that causes disease in humans and livestock in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite some species showing clinical tolerance to trypanosomes, there has been no evidence of acquired immunity to natural infections until now. The study found a distinct decrease in prevalence of T. brucei s. l. infection in wild lions that is consistent with an exposure-dependent increase in cross-immunity following infections with a more genetically diverse species, T. congense lat. The causative agent of human sleeping sickness, T. bruce rhodesi, disappears by 6 years of age in response to cross-immunity from other trypan, including non-pathogenic subspecies T. bruce bruce.
Researchers used mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis to test the hypothesis that mechanistic models of human coagulation cascades, despite uncertainty, can be computationally screened for points of fragility, which could serve as therapeutic targets. A well-studied coagulation cascade model, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was developed and validated using 21 published datasets from different in vitro coagulation models. The model simulated platelet activation and thrombin generation in the presence and absence of anticoagulants were consistent with measured values, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across trials. Sensitivity coefficients, measuring robustness or fragility of mechanisms, were calculated using Monte Carlo. In the absence of anticoagul, factor X/activated factor X (FX) and thrombin-mediated platelet activation were found fragile, while IXIX andVIII activation and activity were robust. AntiFXa and thrombin inhibitors, classes of anticoagulants, such as antiFX inhibitors, have FDA approval for prevention of venous thromboembolism following surgical intervention and initial treatment deep venous thromosis pulmonary embol. In vitro and vivo evidence supports IXIX activity robustness. These results support computationally derived fragility of human cascades as basis for target selection despite uncertainty.
Bacteriophage therapy, the use of bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents to control pathogenic and problematic bacteria, relies on understanding nonlinear kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions. This study combines experimental and modeling approaches to examine kinetics of Campylobacterium jejuni, a foodborne pathogen, and a virulent phage in an in vitro system. Phage-insensitive C. jejuni populations arise, the first phage study to test in vitro models ph-bacteria interactions with ph-insensitive bacteria. A simple model fits data well, confirming inundation and proliferation thresholds are crucial for ph therapy. The model is fit to time series data to estimate thresholds and rate constants, revealing culture-density dependent phage infectivity features.
Researchers have identified a novel Toll-like receptor (TLR) in the snail Biomphalaria glabr, which plays a crucial role in the snail's immune response to the parasitic flatworm Schistosoma mansoni. Schistosomiasis, a disease caused by S. mansoni, affects over 260 million people worldwide, primarily in tropical and subtropical regions. S. mansoni undergoes larval development in specific snail hosts, a trait shared among digene trematodes. The snail immune response is vital for protecting against S. mansoni infection, but few specific snail immune factors have been identified and functionally characterized. This study reports the first functional characterization of a snail TLR, demonstrating its importance in the snail's cellular response to S. mansoni. The TLR, named BTL, was identified in a screen of snail cell surface proteins differing in abundance between B. glabr snails with varying susceptibility to S. mans. The resistant B. glabr strain (BS-90) displayed higher BTL levels than the susceptible (M-line) strain. BTL expression increased 27-fold in BS- snails challenged with S. mans, whereas M snails showed no increase. Knocking down BTL in BS- snails via siRNA oligonucleotides altered the resistant phenotype, with 43% of normally resistant snails becoming infected, shedding S. mans cercaria 1 week before controls. This study is the first characterization of a gastropod TLR, showing BTL is an important sn receptor influencing S. mansoni infection outcome.
Researchers have developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test to detect and quantify the presence of immunoglobulin G (Ig) antibodies against saliva proteins from the salivary glands of Aedes aegypt and Aedes polensis mosquitoes in human populations exposed to these species. A cross-sectional study in Tahiti and Moorea, where Aedes aegpt and Aedesynensis are present, found that 98% and 68% of individuals had IgG against Aegpt and Aynensis salivary gland extracts, respectively. In contrast, EL tests on a cohort from metropolitan France, not exposed to Aedes, showed 97% had no Ig against saliv gland extracts of either species. Analysis of cohorts from different entomological contexts showed no cross-reactivity between Aeg and Ayn saliv extracts. The Ig response to saliv extracts is a valid biomarker of human exposure to bites of Aeg and Ayn. This immunoepidological tool will enhance understanding of exposure to mosquito bites, identify areas of high disease risk, and evaluate vector control efficacy in Pacific and tropical settings.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis, has evolved to thrive within the intracellular environment of human macrophages. To understand this adaptation, researchers investigated whether the pathogen interferes with the host cell's metabolic machinery. Temporal analysis of metabolic flux in macrophages infected with virulent mycobacterial strains confirmed this interference. Subsequent analysis identified a subset of host reactions targeted by the pathogen, revealing a goal to integrate macrophage survival pathways with mycobacterial sustenance. This convergence of host and pathogen factors defined determinants of pathogenicity. Macrophage survival sensitized TB susceptibility to glycemic status, while pathogen ensured virulence contributed to pathology.
Researchers have investigated the role of ZHP-3, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of the yeast ZIP3 gene, in meiotic recombination and synaptonemal complex (SC) assembly. Z-3 is required for crossover recombination, ensuring proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division. During meiotic prophase, Z-3 protein localization is dynamic, shifting from the length of the SC to asymmetric localization on the SC and eventually to foci marking crossover events. A Z-3::GFP transgene partially complements a null mutation, showing separation of function; although the fusion promotes wild-type recombination levels, aneuploidy among progeny is high, indicating defects in meiotic segregation. The bivalent structure is perturbed in this mutant, suggesting segregation defect results from inability to remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers. smo-1 mutants exhibit similar phenotypes to Z-3::G at higher temperatures, and smo-;Z-3G double mutants exhibit more meiotic defects than single, consistent with SUM role in SC assembly and bivalent differentiation.
Aedes aegyptus, a tropical mosquito species, has invaded temperate regions worldwide, including parts of Europe and the US, posing a public health concern due to its ability to transmit exotic viruses and cause nuisance through aggressive daytime biting. This study investigated eco-climatic factors affecting Aedes aegyus abundance in metropolitan and suburban areas in Rome, Italy, one of the most infested areas in Southern Europe. Longitudinal monitoring was conducted along a 70km transect across the metropolitan area, using two spatial-temporal datasets: 20m and 300 circular buffers around sticky traps to collect mosquitoes. Results showed association between anthropized habitats and high abundance in both metropolitan and suburban areas, with "green" islands" hotspots in metropolitan areas, and bimodal dynamics with a peak in autumn due to heavy rains and permissive temperatures.
Researchers have investigated the role of phthiocer dimoceros (DIM) in the invasion of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) into macrophages. DIM are major virulence factors of Mtb, particularly during the early stages of infection when the bacteria encounter host macrophages. Using Mtb mutants lacking genes involved in DIM synthesis, the study found that DIM participate in receptor-mediated phagocytosis of M and prevention of phagosome acidification. The effects of DIM on membrane fluidity were demonstrated by experiments with cholesterol-depleting drugs, which abolished differences in phagocyt efficiency and phag acidification between wild-type and mutant strains. Insertion of a cholesterol probe in living cells showed that membrane hydrophobic core polarity changed upon contact with M, while lateral cholesterol diffusion remained unaffected. This effect was dependent on DIM and consistent with observed in membrane model. The study proposes that DIM control macrophage invasion by M by targeting lipid organization in host membrane, modifying biophysical properties. DIM-induced lipid changes favor receptor-mediated phocytosis of M and phagomal pH driving bacilli in protective niche.
Researchers have developed a novel analysis method to study the dynamics of small neural networks composed of a few neurons. Mean-field approximations, commonly used to study large networks, do not accurately describe small networks, leading to differences between approximation and real behavior. Many neuroscience problems involve mesoscopic networks of tens of neurons, but methods to describe small networks are rare, hindering understanding of neural dynamics at intermediate scales. A systematic analysis of small networks of homogeneous excitatory and inhibitory neurons was conducted. Local bifurcations of neural activity were studied using an analytically tractable approach, and global bifurcations were numerically determined. For strong inhibition, networks exhibit complex dynamics due to branching of neural equations through spontaneous symmetry-breaking. This change is a finite network effect, revealing differences between mesoscopic circuits and mean-field approximation. Symmetry-breaking enables mesoscopic networks to regulate functional heterogeneity, reducing detrimental effects of noise on cortical processing.
Researchers investigated the presence and viability of Leishmania parasites in extralesional sites during dermal leishiasis. To determine the clinical and epidemiological significance of Leish DNA in extraional sites, they examined whether the DNA derives from viable parasites. Leish 7RNA was used to estimate parasite burden and viability in extraional sites of dermal leishias patients. The feasibility of discriminating parasite viability by PCR of Leish 7RNA was evaluated with luciferase activity of transfected intracellular amastigotes in dose-response cytotoxicity assays. Monocytes, tonsil swabs, and skin aspirates of 28 cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishias patients were screened by DNA amplification/Southern blot. Positive samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR of Leish 7RNA genes and transcripts. 7RNA amplification coincided with lucase activity, confirming parasite viability. Of 22 patients with extraional DNA samples, Leish 7RNA genes or transcripts were detected in one or more samples 100% and 73% respectively. Gene transcript number from extraional tissues were comparable to lesions.7RNA were detected in 13/19 (68%) monocytes, 5/12 (42%) tonsil sw, 4/11 (36%) skin aspir, and 22/25 (88%) lesions; genes were quantifiable 15/19 (79%) monocytes, 12/13 (92%) tons sw, 8/11 (73) skin.
Researchers have investigated the relationship between chromatin features and DNA replication timing in Drosophila using a comprehensive dataset of 95 chromatin-binding proteins (CBPs) and histone modifications (HMs). They found that combinations of CBPs have moderate predictive power for replication timing, while pairwise interactions between HMs lead to accurate genome-wide predictions that can be further improved by CB. Independent feature importance analysis led to a simplified, biologically interpretable model of the relationship between chromatin landscape and replication, reaching 80% of full accuracy with six terms. Pairwise HMs predict differential replication across cell types.
Researchers investigated the spread of Dengue virus serotypes 1-3 (DENV-1), 2 (DENV-2), and 3 (DENV-3) in Brazil using a statistical analysis of complete genome sequences. The study found that new lineages of all three serotypes were introduced to the country at intervals of 7-10 years. Lineages of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 were most likely introduced from the Caribbean to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, then dispersed at a rate of approximately 0.5 km/day. The study combined analysis of evolutionary, epidemiological, and ecological data suggests that human and/or mosquito transportation, rather than Aedes aegypti infestation rates or geographical distances determine Dengue virus spread in Brazil.
Researchers investigated how differences in the antagonistic center-surround receptive field (RF) organization across three parallel sensory maps in weakly electric fish influence correlations between electrosensory pyramidal neurons' activities. They used a model based on anatomical differences in RF center size and overlap to predict large differences in correlations across maps, but in vivo electrophysiological recordings showed identical correlations across all three segments. To explain this, they incorporated RF surround effects into the model, varying surround size relative to center, and found multiple structures gave similar correlations. Incorporating physiological RF differences between maps in the model resulted in similar correlations. The study shows RF overlap alone does not determine correlations, impacting understanding RF's influence on neural activity.
Researchers investigated the impact of correlations between neurons' responses to repeated presentations of the same stimulus, known as "noise", on the population's ability to encode the stimulus. They considered a general setting for population coding and how information varies as a function of noise, with other aspects of the problem, such as tuning curves and heterogeneity, held fixed. The study yielded insights into the role of noise, summarized in the form of theorems and illustrated with numerical examples involving neurons with diverse curves. The main contributions are: (1) a generalization of previous results proving the "sign rule" (SR): if correlations between pairs of neurons have opposite signs to their signal, performance improves compared to independent case, for three metrics and arbitrary curves levels of heterogeneity; (2) the SR is not a necessary condition for good coding; a diverse correlations can improve, many violating SR, observed experimentally; and (3) a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for performance to be as good as without noise.
Researchers investigated the impact of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on the susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus to antibiotics in chronic coinfections. They used a panel of P aeruginosa isolates from burn and cystic fibrosis (CF) lung infections and found that P aerugin alters S aureus susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics in a strain-dependent manner. Three interactions were identified that either antagonize or potentiate antibiotic activity against S aureus: Las endopeptidase potentiates vancomycin uptake, rhomids facilitate proton-motive-independent vancom uptake, and 2-hepty-4-hydroquinoline Noxide (HQ) induces multidrug tolerance through respiratory inhibition and ATP reduction. Production of these factors varies between isolates corresponds to their capacity to alter Sus susceptibility. Vancom treatment of S aure mouse burn infection was potentiated by the presence of Las-producing P aerugin population. These findings demonstrate susceptibility is complex and dependent on both pathogen genotype and environmental interactions.
Researchers investigated the mechanism of thrombocytopenia, a condition characterized by low platelet count, in patients with deng virus (DENV) infection, which can lead to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. They found that patients with deng had higher plasma concentrations of von Wille factor (VWF), a protein involved in blood clotting, and platelets bound more VWF to their surface. The amount of VWF on platelets correlated with plate count. Sialic acid, a component of plate membrane, was reduced in deng patients, as shown by binding of lectins to platelets. Sial acid on plate is neuraminidase-sensitive, but deng virus lacks neuraminidase activity. No neuraminid activity was detected in deng patients' plasma or desial of transferrin. Plate sial was not altered by exposure to DENV proteins in vitro. However, VWF binding to glycoprotein 1 on platelets using V-activating protein resulted in sial removal by translocation of neuraminase to plate surface. Neuramin inhibitor oseltiv reduced V-induced sial. The study shows V binding to platelets in deng results in neurid-mediated sial and clearance.
Researchers have identified a new regulatory mechanism in the human genome, known as bidirectional promoters, where two adjacent genes with opposite transcription start sites are controlled by a shared regulatory region. These promoters are often associated with genes involved in DNA repair and may contribute to cancer development. A comprehensive analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) revealed a large collection of human genes under bidirectional promoters' control, with many functioning as alternative promoters or novel transcripts. A significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters was found in cancer-related genes, including breast and ovarian cancer. This promoter structure may regulate co-expression among groups of genes. Microarray data from 79 human tissues verified regulatory networks controlled by bidirectional promoters, with subsets containing similar transcription factor binding sites, including conserved ETS sites in ERBB, FCD, and BRCA.
Researchers conducted a whole-genome analysis of 37 species from 22 families of Diptera, including Drosophila melanogaster, to investigate the diversity of sex chromosome karyotypes. They found over a dozen different sex chromosome configurations, with the small dot chromosome being used as the sex chromosome in most species, suggesting it is the ancestral kary of Diptera. However, some species have undifferentiated sex chromosomes, others replaced the dot with a different chromosome, or incorporated up to three elements into sex chromosomes, and some have female heterogamy (ZW) sex. Transcriptome analysis showed dosage compensation evolved through upregulation of single X in males, but X chromosomes have fewer genes with male-bi expression, possibly due to sex-specific pressures.
A study investigated the presence of Zika virus (ZIK) antibodies in mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and those who gave birth to healthy babies in Hawaii between 2009-2012. Blood samples from 18 mothers who delivered babies with microaly and 12 who gave birth to healthy babies were tested for ZIK IgM and IgG antibodies using a commercially available ELISA kit. Results showed that 16.6% of mothers who delivered babies with microaly tested positive for ZIK IgM and 50% tested positive for ZV IgG. There was a trend towards significance between ZV and microaly. Mothers with ZV IgG antibodies were more likely to deliver babies with microaly than those without (OR 11.0, 95% CI 0.8-147.9, p.0.083). Similarly, ZV IgM positive mothers were more likely to deliver babies with microaly than those without (OR 6.8, 95 CI 0.2-195.1). These findings suggest a link between Z infection and microaly and presence of Z cases in the US as early as 2009.
Researchers investigated the transmission of Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU), the causative agent of Buruli ulcer (BU), in the Ashanti region of Ghana. Despite previous associations with slow-moving water bodies, the mode of transmission remains unclear. Variable Number Tand Repeat (VN) typing was used to differentiate MU from other mycobacteria. This study aimed to track MU infections to specific water bodies by matching VN profiles of human samples to environmental samples. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four endemic communities. Four VN loci in the MU genome were used to genotype environmental and human isolates. Sequencing confirmed polymorphism. MU was present in three types of water bodies, significantly higher in biofilm. Four genotypes, W, X, Y, and Z, were typed in both human and environmental samples. Other genotypes were only found in water. An animal was identified with characteristic BU lesion, confirmed MU infection. Findings suggest patients may have been infected from community water bodies. Further, evidence suggests small mammals within communities susceptible to MU. Infections.
This study investigates the global distribution and drivers of alien species richness, specifically focusing on birds, to understand the factors influencing the introduction and persistence of non-native species in various regions. An extensive database of alien bird species was analyzed to determine the determinants of global species richness within a taxonomic class. Results show that the origin and introduction of alien birds, as well as their identities, were primarily driven by European (mainly British) colonial activities. However, recent introductions have become more widespread, involving more species and countries, driven by increasing economic activities. Globally, alien species richness is highest at mid-latitudes and strongly influenced by anthropogenic factors, notably the number of introduced species (colonization pressure). Environmental factors also play a role, with native and alien richness being positively associated. Colonization pressure is key to understanding species richness, with areas of high native richness resistant to alien colonization at a global scale. The study highlights ongoing threats to environments from species introductions.
Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is a multi-HMG-box protein that plays a role in RNA polymerase I (RPI) transcription. However, its poor DNA selectivity and ability to form nucleosome-like complexes suggest a broader chromatin function. Depletion of UBF reduces rRNA genes, but not synthesis or proliferation, leaving RPI transcription unclear. Mouse deletion shows UBF is essential for embryo development. Conditional deletion in cells reveals UBF is essential for rRNA transcription and chromatin conformation. Loss of U prevents SL/TIFB initiation and RPI-R3/T1 complex recruitment, accompanied by H3K9, H1, and HPα, but not DNA methylation. Genes retain H4 and H2, suggesting active state. H1 binding is U-dependent, suggesting positive role. Unexpectedly, rRNA synthesis does not suppress 5, tRNA or snRNA, or several mRNA genes in ribosome biogenesis. Loss U induces somatic nucleolar body (NPB) formation, containing synthesis factors but not r loci.
Wingless/Wnt signaling plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and fate specification in metazoans, and its overactivation is linked to the development of most colorectal cancers. In the conventional model, Wingless secretion and movement are necessary for long-range signaling in tissue patterning. However, a recent study found that replacing wild-type Drosophila Wingless with a membrane-tether form produced viable adults with normal morphology, suggesting Wingless secretion and movement are dispensable for patterning. This study investigates the role of Wingless in the adult intestine, where gradients coincide with major compartment boundaries. Results show that Wingless is essential for regulating gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial cell specification, muscle differentiation, gut folding, and signaling with the Decapentapic pathway, all disrupted by Wing tethering. These findings support the requirement for direct, long-range Wingless action in patterning, relevant to development, tissue homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease.
Researchers have investigated the role of urokinase plasogen activator (uPA) in the pathogenesis of Group A streptococcus (GAS), a bacterium responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. They found that uPA contributes to plasmin recruitment and invasive disease initiation in vivo. In the absence of host plasogen activators, streokinase (S) is required for surface plmin acquisition by GAS. However, in the absence of S, uPA is sufficient for surface plmin acquisition by GAS when incubated with plasogen or human plasma. GAS also activates zym pro-uPA in human plasma. To assess uPA's contribution to invasive disease, a transgenic mouse model was used. C57/BL/6 and AlbG mice expressing human plasogen were more susceptible to invasive GAS than u− mice. The decrease in virulence in u− mice correlated with decreased dissemination and reduced surface plmin by GAS. These findings have implications for understanding GAS pathogenesis and targeting plmin activation in bacterial infections.
Helicobacter pylori exploits a unique repertoire of Type IV secretion system components for pilus assembly at the bacteria-host interface. The pathogenic island (cPA) of H. pylori encodes components of a Type IV secretion system (TSS) that translocates the oncoprotein Cag into gastric epithelial cells, and Cag is a specialized component of cTSS that binds host α5β1 integrin. Mass spectrometry-based co-purification revealed Cag, C (integrin-binding protein), and C (protein with sequence similarity to C) as encoded by contiguous genes in cPA and detectable on the bacterial surface. These proteins are required for C translocation into host cells and H. pyl-induced IL-8 secretion by epithelial cells, but are not homologous to TSS components in other species. Scanning electron microscopy shows these proteins involved in pilus formation between H. pyl and epithelial cells. Δag and Δ mutant strains fail to form pilus, whereas Δ strain exhibits hyperiliated phenotype and produces elongated pilus compared to wild-type. This suggests pilus dimensions regulated by. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide in, C, C, and is present in C, C, and C. Deletion motifs abrogates C translocation and IL-8 induction, and motifs C and are required for pilus formation. These results indicate C, C, C, and C components of T subassembly involved pilogenesis and highlight unique constituents H. pyl cTSS.
Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is a chronic disease in cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis, a member of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis group of bacteria. Vaccination is a potential long-term solution for controlling the disease, with a focus on developing a vaccine against bTB. Identifying biomarkers of tuberculosis remains elusive, and the goal is to identify host correlates of protection. Researchers hypothesized that studying global gene expression could identify in vitro predictors of protection to facilitate vaccine development. Cattle were vaccinated with BCG or heterologous B prime-adenoviral vectored subunit boosting. Protective efficacy was determined after M bovis challenge. challenge. RNA was prepared from PPD-stimulated PBMC from vaccinated-protected, vaccinated-unprotected, and unvaccinated control prior to Mbo challenge. Gene expression was determined by RNAseq. 668 genes were differentially expressed in vaccinated-protected compared to vaccinated-un and unacc control. Cytokine-cytokine interaction was most related to this dataset with IL22 identified as dominant of protection besides INFγ. Expression of these genes by RNAseq was evaluated by RTPCR in independent PB samples BCG vaccinated unacc. This confirmed IL as predictor of vaccine efficacy.
Researchers have investigated the role of centrosomal microtubule components in regulating microtule organization at non-centrosomal microtule organizing centers (ncMTO) in differentiated cells. They developed a tissue-specific degradation system to study the function of the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TRC) and AIR-1/Aurora at the apical MTO in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic intestinal epithelial cells. Results show that G-1/G3, a core component of γ-T, is required to recruit other γ-T components to the apical MTO, including MT1/MT1, which is characterized for the first time in animal development. In contrast, AIR-1 and MT recruit γ-T to the centrosome but not centrioles or apical MTO. Surprisingly, microtules remain organized at apical MTO upon γ-T and AIR co-depletion and depletion of other microule regulators. However, loss of G-1 removes dynamic microules marked by EBP/1 and remaining microules grow faster. These findings suggest distinct microule centers use different proteins for function and apical M is composed of γ-dependent and microules competing for limited resources.
Human genomes are diploid, inheriting one set of chromosomes paternally and one homologous set maternally, but most sequencing initiatives ignore this by not delineating nucleotide content of maternal and paternal copies. To address this, 11 phasing strategies were compared using the Genome-In-A Bottle (GIAB) version of NA78 as a standard. Approaches included laboratory-based assays and computational methods reconstructing information from sequencing reads or population haplotype frequencies. Metrics used to assess performance included switch rates, haplotype lengths, proportion of fully-resolved genes, phasing accuracy, and yield between pairs of SNVs. A hybrid approach combining population phasing, genome sequencing data, and reference haplotype frequencies provided fast and accurate phasing. Population-based phasing was enhanced with genome-wide data, and inclusion of parental genotypes reduced phasing errors by up to ten-fold. A majority voting scheme for consensus haplotype construction improved performance and coverage. Regions with phasing errors were associated with low polymorphism and SNV density.
Type-III secretion systems in Gram-negative pathogens, such as Salmonella enterica, facilitate the export of virulence factors and flagellar subunits from the cytoplasm into host cells. The flagellar type-III secretion apparatus relies on the proton motive force and ATP hydrolysis to energize substrate unfolding and translocation. However, research has shown that functional flagella can form in the absence of type-III ATPase activity. Mutations increased the proton motive force and flagellar substrate levels, bypassing the requirement for the Salmonella pathogenic island 1 vir-associated type-III ATPase. This suggests a role for type-III ATPases in enhancing secretion efficiency under limited substrate concentrations. The study reveals the dispensability of ATP activity in the type-III export process.
Researchers investigated the emergence of bistability in gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using a comprehensive in silico survey of over 40,000 simple networks formed by two transcription factor (TF) genes and their associated proteins, assuming elementary biochemical processes. They found that approximately 90% of these GR models exhibit bistability, including some without cooperative interactions commonly associated with bistable systems, and most identified through subnetwork analysis. Bistable networks were topologically sorted into a family based on presence/absence of biochemical reactions, revealing 11 minimal bistable networks (i.e., bistable without smaller subnetwork). The large number of unknown bistable topologies suggests bistability arises easily and is not lost through evolution. To demonstrate applicability, they integrated protein-protein, protein-DNA, and expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, identifying GRNs predicted bistable behavior.
Mutations in the HYAL2 gene, which encodes hyaluronidase 2, a protein responsible for degrading extracellular hyaluronic acid, have been identified as a cause of orofacial cleft syndrome in humans and mice. Orofacial cleft is a common birth defect with both genetic and environmental components, and the genetic etiology of this condition is not fully understood. The study found that mutations in HY2 destabilize the protein, leading to reduced levels of HY2 protein, consistent with clinical presentation in affected individuals. Investigations of Hy2- mice revealed craniofacial abnormalities, including submucal cleft palate, and coratri sinister and hearing loss in a proportion of Hy2- mice. These features were incompletely penetrant in humans. The findings identify a new genetic cause of orofacial cleft in humans and the first cause of coratri sinister in humans, highlighting the importance of HY2 and hyal turnover for normal development.
Researchers have identified the molecular composition of mechanosensory links in auditory hair cells, which are crucial for sound detection in the inner ear. These links connect stereocilia to transduction channels, allowing force to be converted into electrical signals. Previous models suggested a static composition of protocadherin 15 (PCD15) at the lower end and cadherin 23 (CD23) at the upper end. However, these links are subjected to sound-induced forces throughout life and can be disrupted, leading to hearing loss. Despite hair cells' ability to regenerate links and restore hearing, the molecular process was unknown. A novel implementation of backscatter electron microscopy allowed visualization of immuno-gold particles and stereilia, only a few nanometers in diameter, revealing two functional mechanotrans-mediating link compositions: PCD15/CD23 and PCD15PC15. During regeneration, shorter links with equal PCD15 at both ends appear first, mediating mechanotrans currents of normal amplitude but abnormal Ca2-dependent decay. The mature P15CD23 composition is re-established with complete adaptation recovery. These findings provide a mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanensory function in postotic hair cells, potentially identifying components of the mechanotrans machinery.
Researchers conducted a mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis of sera from adult patients with deng fever (DF) and deng hemorrhagic fever (DHF) at the critical and recovery phases of infection. The study identified 29 differentially expressed metabolites between DF and DHF, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Bile acids were 5-fold higher in DH compared to DF and correlated with higher levels of aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transamin (ALT), indicating liver injury in DH. Uric acid, the most abundant antioxidant in blood, was 1.5-fold lower in DH compared to DF, suggesting decreased endogenous antioxidant capacity and elevated oxidative stress in DH. In the recovery phase, eight metabolites remained significantly higher or lower in DH, including chenodeoxycocholic acid, a bile acid. This indicates prolonged liver impact of DENV in DH patients. The study revealed metabolic pathways linked to DH in critical and recovery phases, providing insights into host-DENV interactions between DF and DH. The findings advance understanding of DH pathogenesis and suggest novel targets for deng management.
Researchers have identified and characterized the guanine 5'-monophosphate reductase (GMPR) enzyme in Trypanosoma brucei, the parasite responsible for African trypanosomiasis. GR catalyzes the conversion of guanine 5'-monophosphate (GMP) to inosine 5'-monosphate (IMP), a crucial for purine nucleotide interconversion and intracellular balance. The study found GR localized to glycosomes in T. bruce bloodstream forms. Recombinant protein analysis revealed distinct enzymatic differences between T. bruce GR and host GRs. T. br GR contains a unique cystathion synthase (CBS) domain insertion absent in mammalian and bacterial GRs. Recombinant T. br GR catalyzed GMP to IMP conversion with NAD, exhibiting distinct affinities for G and NAD compared to mammalian GRs. Addition of monovalent cations K+ and NH4 enhanced T. br GR activity, whereas mammalian GRs were unaffected. Monophosphate purine analog ribavir inhibited T br GR, whereas mammalian GR showed little inhibition. These findings indicate distinct GR mechanisms in T. br and host organisms. Ribavir inhibited trypanosome proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting ribavir as a potential therapeutic agent against African trypanomias.
Researchers have used molecular dynamics simulations to study the binding of benzocaine and phenyto, two sodium channel blockers, to the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb. The study aimed to understand how these drugs interact with the channel and enter it, which is crucial for developing next-generation drugs that target specific types of sodium channels in the body. The simulations revealed two binding sites for both drugs, characterized by non-specific hydrophobic interactions: one above the activation gate and at the entrance to the lipid-filled fenestrations. Three independent methods confirmed these sites, with binding to the gate being slightly more favorable than the fenstration. The drugs were found to pass through the fenestrations with small energy barriers, suggesting this could be the hydrophobic route for entry. The study highlights the importance of specific residues in directing drugs through the fenestr and forming binding sites.
Researchers investigated the role of MyD88 signaling in the immune response to intestinal infection with the pathogen C. rodium in mice. My88-deficient mice are highly susceptible to various bacterial infections, but the specific contribution of My88 in intestinal immunity is unclear. A novel My88 knock-in model allowed cell-specific reactivation of functional My88 in My-deficient mice. My88 signaling in CD11+ dendritic cells activated dendritic cells (DC) and induced group 3 innate lymphoid cell (ILC) and colonic Th17/Th cell responses to C. rodium infection. Restricting My88 to other cells, including macrophages, T cells, or ILC did not induce effective responses. However, My88 expression in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) partially protected against infection, associated with enhanced epithelial integrity and antimicrobial peptide RegIII and acute protein SAA expression. My88 in DC and IEC is essential for full host response to C. rodium.
Modelling Anti-Ov16 IgG Antibody Prevalence as an Indicator for Evaluation and Decision Making in Oncherciasis Elimination Programmes

Onchiasis, a parasitic disease targeted for elimination in Africa through annual or biannual iverectin mass administration (MDA), relies on immunodiagnostic tools to determine if transmission is interrupted and treatment can stop. One such tool is the detection of human IgG antibodies in blood to Onocervulus-specific antigen Ov16. A mathematical model, ONOS, was extended to include Ov antibody output, assuming seroconversion triggered by first worm establishment in host, with sero occurring before or after maturation or start of mf production. Seroconversion in children is of interest, with seroreversion ignored for simplification. Yearly MDA reduces parasite acquisition in humans, lowering sero rate in newborns and children, while those serconverted remain positive. Microfilaria prevalence in 5+ and Ov antibody in children under 10 decline with M duration. Association between indicators and predicted elimination probability is influenced by endemic levels, serconversion trigger, and diagnostic sensitivity/specificity. Baseline levels and test characteristics affect interpretation of seropre data and endpoint M estimation. The study shows endpoint depends on endemic levels, to be considered in guidelines for stopping MDA.
Researchers have discovered that prion strains can change properties when propagated in different environments. In one study, swine-sensitive prions were propagated in PK cells in the presence of swainine, resulting in drug-resistant variants emerging. This suggests that prions comprise a quasi-population of variants with different properties, with the fittest being selected in a particular environment. Even after cloning, prion populations remain heterogeneous, indicating mutation-like processes occur at the conformation level. Brain-derived 22 prions are naturally swine-resistant, so it was not surprising that prions became sensitive after propagation in cells could revert to resistance. RMLions, both propagated in brain or PK cells, are swine-sensitive. Researchers investigated whether swine-resistant variants could be selected by propagation in presence of drug. This was not possible with standard PK cells, but certain PK sublines yielded swine-resistant, even swine-dependent (i.e., propagated rapidly in presence drug) populations. These could be passaged indefinitely in PK cells, absence drug, without swine dependence. Misfolded pr protein (Pr) associated with swine variant was cleared PK cells than drug-sensitive counterpart, indicating structural differences misfold Pr underlie pr properties. Propagation pr in inhibitory drug selects drug-resistant pr, even variants efficiently propagate presence drug. Conformation changes abnormal pr protein underlie adaptations.
Researchers conducted an exhaustive analysis of a genotype-phenotype space comprising 101 central metabolisms that encode all possible subsets of 51 reactions in carbon metabolism. Using flux balance analysis, they predicted the viability of these metabolisms on 10 different carbon sources, resulting in 102 potential phenotypes. Viable metabolisms with one phenotype comprise a tiny fraction of genotype space, but their numbers exceed 10^9 for phenotypes. Metabolisms with one phenotype form a network of genotypes extending throughout genotype space, where two genotypes can be reached through single reaction changes. Minimal genotype distance between different phenotypes is small, allowing metabolisms to reach novel phenotypes on new carbon sources through few genic changes. Exceptions exist for metabolisms with complexity near minimum viability threshold. Increasing complexity enhances potential for both conservation and innovation.
Researchers analyzed the genetic variation and phylogeography of the Triatoma dimata complex, a group of triatomine bugs that transmit Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite causing Chagas disease, across Mexico and the Neotropics. Two fragments of the ND4 gene were sequenced to determine haplog specificity. The study found lowest genetic diversity where there is most anthropic modification, and highest T cruz infection prevalence. Haplog 1 and 3 had higher T cruz prevalence than expected, while hap 2 had lower. Hap 1 and 3 had different DT and DTI frequencies, while hap 2 did not. All Neotrop haplogroups had moderate to high haplotype diversity, with greatest differentiation between hap 1 and 3. Divergence from the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was estimated between 0.97 and 0.85 million years ago. Effective population size of hap 1 and 2 increased between 0.02 and 0.03 million years ago. This study supports the ecological origin of the complex around the Tehuantepec Isthmus and recent divergence of three dimata haplog with differential T cruz infection and DT specificity.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFR) is a rod-borne disease caused by hantaviruses, primarily Hanta and Seoul virus, in China. Environmental factors significantly affect the risk of contracting havirus infections through their impact on rodent dynamics and human-rod contact. This study aimed to clarify environmental factors favoring rod-to-human transmission to inform effective FR prevention and control strategies. A 10-year (2006-2015) surveillance of rod hosts, havirus, epidemiological, and environmental data from satellite and meteorological stations, and rod-to rates were analyzed to quantify relationships among environmental, rod species, and FR occurrence. 709 FR cases were included. Rod species in Chhou, havirus hotspot, comprised Rattus norvegicus, Musculus, R flavius, and others (lose and Microtus calamorum). Species played different roles across land types, all associated with transmission. Some were with FR in forest and water bodies, R norveicus and flavius in grassland, and Mculus flavi in built. Community was associated with environmental variability. Predictive models based on significant factors validated a good fit: cultivated land predicted highest FR incidence, aligning with 2014-15 statistics. Spatial FR heterogeneity may be influenced by community, associated local conditions.
Activating mutations in the HRAS proto-oncogene, specifically in codon 12, can cause Costello syndrome (CS), a rare genetic disorder. Mutations in codon 12, particularly Gly12Val, have high transforming activity and are frequent in cancers, but rare in CS, leading to a severe and lethal phenotype. A novel germline GlyVal mutation, c.35_36GC>T, was identified in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated CS. Analysis of HRAS cDNA revealed high levels of exon 2 skipping. Using wild and mutant HRAS minigenes, c.35_36>T was confirmed to result in exon 2 skipping by disrupting a critical Exonic Splicing Enhancer (SE) and creating Exonic Splicing Silencer (SS). The HR exon 2 vulnerability is due to a weak 3' splice site, making exon 2 dependent on splicing stimulatory protein, SRS, binding to critical SE. Most CS and cancer-causing mutations are located here, affecting splicing differently. Results show that CS and somatic cancer phenotypes are determined not only by mutant HRAS transforming potential, but also exon 2 inclusion efficiency from HRAS mutations. A splice oligonucleotide (SO) blocking critical SE causes exon skipping and halts cancer cell proliferation. This reveals potential for anti-cancer therapies based on SO-mediated HR exon 2 skipping.
Researchers have investigated the role of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation in mammalian development, specifically focusing on the function of the methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) enzyme in this process. MET3 is a key component of the methyltransfer complex responsible for catalyzing m6 formation on RNAs. In this study, MET3 was inactivated in the mouse nervous system to examine its effects on development. The results show that MET3 knockout (KO) mice exhibit cerebellar hypoplasia, a condition characterized by underdevelopment of the cerebellum, due to increased apoptosis of cerebellar granule cells (CGs) in the external granular layer (EGL). MET3 depletion led to loss of mA modification, resulting in extended RNA half-lives and aberrant splicing events, causing dysregulation of gene expression and premature death of CGs. These findings highlight the importance of MET3-mediated mA in regulating mammalian cerebell development.
Researchers have investigated the role of transcription factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in regulating gene expression in embryonic stem (ES) cells. These factors are essential for maintaining the cells' ability to differentiate into any cell type in the developing embryo. The study found that combinatorial binding of these factors is associated with co-localization of the transcription coactivator H3 and increased expression of nearby genes in ES cells. The same loci bound by OCT, NAN, and SOX in ES cells drive expression in early embryonic development. Comparison of human and mouse ES cells revealed that less than 5% of individual binding events for OCT, SO2, and NANOG are shared between species. However, about 15% of combinatorial binding events and 53-63% of combinatorial binding at enhancers active in early development are conserved. The study suggests that combination of OCT, SO2, and NANOG is critical for transcription in ES and plays a role in embryogenesis by binding conserved developmental enhancers. Data indicate that rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual events, whereas "regulatory hotspots" bound by multiple factors and active in multiple tissues early development are under evolutionary constraints.
AML/ETO, a fusion protein resulting from a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21, is an oncogenic transcription factor that initiates acute myeloid leukemia by recruiting co-repressor complexes to DNA. It interferes with the function of its wild-type counterpart, A1, by targeting A1 binding sites. A1ETO's transcriptional regulation is complex, as it interacts with multiple transcription factors, including E-proteins, and targets other DNA sites. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling identified A1-dependent regulation. A1 was found to co-localize with A, demonstrating the fusion follows the binding pattern of the wild protein but does not primarily displace it. E-protein H's DNA binding profile was rearranged upon A1 expression, and the fusion co-localized with A and H on many regulated targets. H levels increased in primary and cell lines expressing A1.
Researchers investigated the role of histone acetyltransferase 2 (H2) in Leishmania donovani, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis. They found that H2 is constitutively acetylates histone H4 at lysine 10 (H4K10) in vitro and in vivo, and is essential for cell growth and survival. H2-depleted cells displayed cell cycle defects and poor survival in host cells. Real-time PCR and DNA microarray analyses revealed that downregulation of cyclins CY4 and CY9 were responsible for S and G/M phase defects in H2-depleted cells. Leish genes are arranged in unidirectional clusters, with genes coordinately transcribed as polyc units from divergent strand regions (dSRs) which initiate transcription on opposite strands. Investigating CY4 and CY9 expression in H2-de cells without other genes in polyc units being coordinately downregulated, found CY4 and CY9 have specific promoters. Chromatin immunoprecipitation with Hacetyl10 and real PCR suggested these promoters were activated cell-dependent. Nuclear-on analyses confirmed CY and CY were transcriptionally activated from own at specific stages. Two tiers of regulation exist: polyc units initiate at SR, likely constitutively, and subset have own promoters, some activated cell-dependent. Second tier sensitive H10 levels, resulting downregulation in H-de cells.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms underlying inferring others' intentions in social interactions by applying computational modeling to data from an economic game involving 16 pairs of volunteers. Participants were randomly assigned "player" or "adviser" roles, with the player performing a probabilistic reinforcement task and receiving information about a binary lottery from a visual chart. The adviser, with more information, issued a recommendation. The game's structure varied the adviser's incentives to provide helpful or misleading information over time. Using a meta-Bayesian framework, the players' behavior was best explained by hierarchical learning, inferring the adviser's intentions to optimize predictions about advice validity. Volatility estimates affected trial-by-trial variability: participants relied on estimates for choices when believing adviser intentions were stable. The model predicted players' interpersonal reactivity index (IRI) scores, adviser helpfulness ratings, and self-reported strategy. Results suggest humans employ hierarchical models to infer changing intentions, use volatility in decision-making, and integrate accuracy with non-social information.
Scrub typhus, a disease endemic in Asia, has shifted from a rural to urban setting in South Korea, particularly in Seoul, the country's largest metropolitan city. From 2010 to 2013, national notifiable disease data identified indigenous urban scrub typh in Seoul. Clinical features of patients were analyzed by comparing a hospital-reported cases to a control group. Chigger mites were collected in the city using a direct chigger-collecting trap and identified by phenic and 18 rDNA sequencing. Infection with Orientia tsutsugam was confirmed by 56-kDa antigen sequencing. Eighty cases of urban typhus were found in Seoul, with 56.8% from mountain areas, 20.5% from parks, 17% from vicinity of residence, and 5.7% from riversides. Eighty-seven chigger mites were collected in Gwan mountain, with 87.4% identified as Helenula miag and 9.2 as Leptromium scell. Pooled DNA from H miag mites yielded O tsugushi Bong strain. Twenty-six patients showed low APACHE score 3.4 ± 2.7, low complication rate 3.8%, and no hypalemia. Indigenous urban typh was identified in Seoul, with a subgroup having mild features. Chigger H miag infected O tsugushi within the city was found.
Researchers investigated the impact of the Caenorhabditis elegans HEN1 RNA methyltransferase homolog, HENN-1, on RNA interference (RNAi) pathways in the nematode. They found differential effects on two pathways that employ methylated RNA molecules: the 26 and 21 pathways. In the germline, stability of 21 RNAs, C elegans piRNAs, was mildly affected by loss of methylation, and introduction of artificial 21 target RNA did not destabilize non-methylated 21 RN. In contrast, 26 RN displayed reduced stability and responded to loss of H-1 by increased 3-uridylation. Within the 26 class, ER-bound RNAs were modified by H-, while AL-bound RN were not. Global expression analysis of mutants revealed mild effects, including downregulation of gerine-expressed genes. Data suggest apart from direct effects reduced 26 levels, effects on expression were indirect.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and high-throughput glycomics analysis on 2,705 individuals from three populations to investigate the genetic regulation of protein glycosylation. They found that variants in the Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1 (HNF1) and fucosyltransferase FUT6 and F8 genes influence N-glycan levels in human plasma. NF1 and its downstream target NF4 regulate the expression of fucyltransfer and fucose biosynthesis genes. NF1 is necessary and sufficient to drive the expression of these genes in hepatic cells. The study reveals NF as a master regulator of multiple stages in the fucylation process. This has implications for the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, and protein folding, as well as understanding mechanisms underlying cancer, coronary disease, heart, and metabolic disorders.
Researchers have investigated the role of single-stranded RNA in stabilizing the binding of Centromere Protein C (CPC), a key component of the kinetochore complex that attaches chromosomes to the cytoskeleton. The study found that a 122-amino acid region of CPC is responsible for DNA binding, and that this interaction is highly sensitive to single-stranded RNA. Long, single-stranded nucleic acids enhance CPC binding to DNA, and the types of RNAs that stabilize CPC binding match those present in kinetochores in vivo. Removal of the binding module with HIV integrase domain causes partial delocalization of CPC in vivo. The study suggests that centrom RNA recruits CPC to kinetore by altering DNA binding characteristics.
A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified genetic variants associated with birth weight (BW), childhood obesity (CO), and body mass index (BMI) in children. The placenta plays a crucial role in fetal development and postnatal health. This study examined the role of the placental transcriptome and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in mediating genetic causes of BW, CO, and CBMI. An integrative analysis of colocalization and meta-analysis revealed that GWAS loci associated with BW, CO, and CBMI were enriched for placental eQTL (6.76, 4.83, and 2.26 folds, respectively). Compared to eQTL in adult tissues, placental eQ significantly contributed to anthropometric outcomes at birth (BW) and childhood phenotypes (CO/CBMI). Six and one transcripts colocalized with BW, CO, and CBMI risk loci, respectively. The study found that placental transcription in utero likely determines postnatal body size, suggesting new possibilities for interventions to prevent childhood obesity.
A study was conducted in Malda district, West Bengal, India to investigate the prevalence and diagnosis of Post-Kala-azar Dermatitis Leishmaniasis (PKDL) in an endemic area. PKDL is a chronic, non-fatal disease that does not require much attention, but is relevant in the context of Visceralishmanias (VL) elimination. There is no standard guideline for diagnosis and treatment. The study aimed to determine the disease burden, compare diagnostic tools, and lesion regression pattern after treatment. Twenty-six PK cases were detected, with a prevalence of 27.5% among Leishmanial antibody positive cases. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) on skin smear showed 93.8% sensitivity, but is not used for routine diagnosis. PCR was highly sensitive (88.46%) for confirmation. Most lesions persisted after treatment, disappearing 6-12 months post-treatment. Two cases relapsed after 1.5 years milteine treatment. A significant number of PK patients remained undiagnosed without active surveys. Surveys are needed in other areas for VL elimination. PCR is helpful for diagnosis, referral at district or state level. A study with more samples is needed to determine if PK patients are parasite-free after treatment and which need longer treatment.
In the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, competence is a genetic program that enables horizontal gene transfer through transformation, allowing the exchange of genetic material between cells. This process is synchronized within the entire population and relies on the exported Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP), which generates a positive feedback loop. However, the coordination of this CSP-dependent switch is unclear. Researchers monitored competence development in real-time in four distinct pneumocococcal lineages and found that the population shift relies on a self-activated fraction that arises through a growth-dependent mechanism. CSP remains bound to cells during this event and the rate of competence corresponds to propagation between activated and quiescent cells. A two-step cell-contact mechanism was validated by measuring development during co-cultivation of strains altered to produce or respond to CSP. The membrane protein ComD retains CSP, limiting its diffusion in the medium. Competence initiator cells originate stochastically in response to stress, forming a subpopulation that transmits CSP by cell contact.
Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV) L2 protein acts as a chaper to facilitate the transport of the viral genome (vDNA) from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and eventually the nucleus, where replication occurs. To reach the nucleus, the L2/v complex must cross intracellular membranes. A system was developed using subcellular compartmentalization of BirA and its substrate to detect L2 translocation from incoming virions. L trans requires transport to the TGN and is strictly dependent on mitotic entry, coinciding with mitotic entry in synchronized cells. Cell cycle arrest retains L/v at T; only release and progression G/M enables trans across the membrane and infection. Microscopy of Ed-labeled vDNA reveals a rapid shift in v localization during mitosis. At G2/phase v exits the T to pericentricular location, accumulating prometaph where it begins to associate with chromosomes. By metaphase and anaph v is bound to mitotic chromosomes, ensuring distribution into daughter nuclei. Mutations in a defined chromatin binding of L block trans, suggesting trans dependent on chromatin promet. This is the first virus to couple penetration of membranes to mitosis, explaining tropism for mitotic keratinocytes.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to estimate the relative transmissibility of one strain of a pathogen to another by analyzing data from competitive mixture experiments where animals are co-infected with two strains. The method involves observing the mixture in each animal over time and multiple generations. This approach is demonstrated using influenza data from ferrets. Assessing the transibility between strains is crucial in three contexts: within human populations where novel strains compete for susceptible hosts, during pandemics where a novel strain competes with existing strains, and with neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) which can reduce transmission but promote drug-resistant strains. The framework also estimates the size of the transmitted inoculum. The method's applicability extends beyond influenza to other viral and bacterial pathogens.
Researchers investigated the convergence of light and abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana to understand how plants adapt to environmental cues. They found that BBX21, a B-box protein involved in seedling photomorphogenesis, also plays a role in ABA signaling. Genetic data showed BB21 acts upstream of ABA INSENSITIVE (ABI) and ELONGATED HYCOTYL5 (HY) in seed germination control. HY5 acts as a direct activator of ABI5, and BB21 interacts with HY. BB21 negatively regulates ABI5 by interfering with HY binding to the ABI promoter. ABI was shown to activate its own expression, while BB21 negatively regulates this activity by interacting with ABI. The study indicates BB21 coordinates with HY and ABI on the ABI promoter, integrating light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis.
The Mediator complex, a co-regulator of RNA polymerase II, is conserved across eukaryotes, has been studied in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. This study focused on the Med subunits Med31, Med20, and Srb/Med13. C. albicans Med shares functions with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schoscharomyces pombe, such as response to stresses and Med31's role in Ace2-regulated genes. However, C. albicans Med has additional roles in virulence gene transcription, including morphogenesis and pathogen-related genes like ALS. Med31,20, and Srb/M13 contribute to C. alb's virulence, filamentation, biofilm formation, and ALS1 is a target for biofilm development. Med also affects C. alb virulence in the worm model. Med31 and Srb13 regulate cell adhesion genes differently in S. cerevisiae and C. alb, repressing FLO in S. cereiae and activating ALS in C. alb. This suggests Med subunits regulate adhesion distinct between species.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms exhibit increased antibiotic tolerance compared to their planktonic counterparts, a phenomenon known as antibiotic tolerance. To investigate the contribution of the biofilm state and its genetic determinants to this phenotype, a genome-wide functional profiling was conducted on a heterogeneous population of Pseudomonas aeruginosa MPA1 in biofilm and plankic growth conditions with tobramycin. The study aimed to quantify the contribution of each locus to antibiotic tolerance in both states, identifying sets of mutations contributing to tolerance in biofilm or plankic settings. Results revealed differences and similarities between biofilm and plankic antibiotic tolerance. A mixed population design was used to replicate the complexity of natural biofilms, unlike previous studies, showing emergence of quorum-deficient mutants. The study found a significant contribution of the bio state to antibiotic tolerance, providing a basis for novel therapeutics against P aerugin biofilm infections.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm, called Flexible and Adaptive Model (FoS), to analyze complex biological systems with numerous interacting components and limited information about their dynamics. Traditional model selection algorithms evaluate multiple models against experimental data to identify suitable structures, but often rely on pre-selected models or exhaustive searches, which can be impractical due to the vast number of possibilities. The new algorithm combines local and non-local search methods to prevent getting stuck in local minima, accounting for structurally similar processes. It was tested on simulated data, showing flexibility in handling various structures, and applied to experimental data on CD4+ and CD8 T cell proliferation under different conditions. The analysis revealed dynamic changes in proliferation potential, reduced in 3D tissue cultures compared to suspension. The algorithm's flexibility in handling diverse structures makes it applicable to various biological problems and useful for evaluating complex model spaces.
A 12-month follow-up study was conducted in Bolivia to evaluate the effectiveness of benznidazole (BN) treatment in children infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease. The study involved 103 seropositive children living in areas with vector control, where the National Program for Chagas was implemented in 2006, reducing infections through vector control. 73 children received BN with 3 interruptions due to side effects. Serology, conventional PCR, and real-time PCR were performed on 7 blood samples taken before and after treatment. Among 57 who completed follow-up, 6 (11%) showed both PCR+ and qPCR+ (non-reactive), 24 (42%) PCR- but q+ (ambiguous), and 27 (47%) PCR- and q- (reactive). Th1/2/Th/17 cytokines levels were determined, with IL-17 significantly higher in seropitive before treatment compared to age-matched seronegative and decreased to normal level one year after. IL-17 levels were positively related to parasite counts by qPCR. At 12 months, IL-17 levels of non-reactive were higher than reactive or ambiguous, suggesting IL-17 useful for determining BN reactivity. Plasma IL-17 might be biomarker for persistent T. cruzi infection and chronic inflammation.
Neisseria meningitidis, the primary causative agent of bacterial meningitis, has a genome rich in repetitive DNA, with approximately 2% occupied by a diminutive transposon called Coria. Bioinformatic analysis identified eight subtypes of the element with four distinct transcriptional ends. Transcriptional analysis using PCR and lacZ reporter revealed two ends encode strong promoters. The strongest promoter activity is dictated by polymorphism Y128 at the right end of the element. Examples of elements drive transcription of adjacent genes, while others express non-coding RNAs. Pairwise comparisons of three meningocococcal genomes showed more than two-thirds of Coria elements maintain subtype at any locus due to recombination switching between elements in a single strain. Upon switching, a new allele spreads through population by natural transformation. This represents a previously unrecognized mechanism for variation in meningococcus. Strain-to-strain variability of Coria and encoded promoters allows widespread effects within population. Defining strength of promoters by subtypes provides resource to predict transcription effects of subtype at locus.
Research on the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostus has identified two orthologs, Chae and Vel, which regulate secondary metabolism and differentiation in response to light signals in Aspergillus spp. Chae and Vel are involved in the production of secondary metabolites, including the toxin Txin, which promotes virulence in maize with Texas sterile cytoplasm (Tms). Txin production is increased in the dark in wild-type (WT) and reduced in Chae and Vel mutants. Expression of the Txin biosynthetic gene Tox1 is upregulated in the dark in WT and reduced in Chae and Vel mutants. Txin and To1 expression are increased in Vel overexpression (OE) strains in the dark and Chae in light or dark, compared to WT. Chae and Vel regulate toxin production and virulence. Mutants and OE strains show altered virulence on Tms and normal cytoplasm maize, indicating Txin mediated virulence and pathogenicity affected. Deletion of Chae or Vel reduces H2O tolerance. Expression of CAT, a catalase gene, is reduced in Vel. Chae and Vel mutants show decreased aerial growth, asexual sporulation, and sterility. Chae OE are sterile, while Vel OE are more fertile. Ch and Vel repress 8-dihydroxynaphthalene (DH) melanin biosynthesis, melanization enhanced in Ch and Vel, reduced in OE. Chae and Vel regulate Txin biosynthesis, pathogenicity, virulence, oxidative stress, development, aerial growth, and negatively melan biosynthesis asexual differentiation.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of functional asymmetry in bacterial Nav channels, which have been characterized as functionally asymmetric but the underlying mechanism unclear. Crystal structures of several bacterial Nav channels have been published, and molecular dynamics simulations of ion permeation through these channels consistent with electrophysiological properties of eukotic channels. To address this question, non-equilibrium simulations and two-dimensional unperturbed landscapes were generated by umbrella sampling and Weighted Histogram Methods for ions traversing the selectivity of bacterial Nav channel. This provided new insight into selective permeation mechanism in Nav channels. Non-equilibrium simulations showed that two or three extracellular K ions block the selectivity of Nav in presence applied inward forces, but not outward. Block occurs in unstable minimum equilibrium unpurbed free energy of K ions can be locked by modest forces. In contrast, Na ions favor through selectivity as unit in "knock" permeation both inward and outward, no minimum two-dimensional free energy Na for block state. Predicted non-equilibrium work to break K block equivalent experimentally measured Nav to induce inward K currents.
A study compared the intracellular spread of rabies virus in the paralytic and furious forms of canine rabies at the early stages of the disease. Researchers measured viral colonization of the cerebral hemispheres, viral antigen within neuronal cell bodies, and RNA levels of cellular processes from neuronal bodies to track the spread of the virus across synapses. A cohort of naturally infected, non-vaccinated dogs (5 paralytic and 5 furious) were sacrificed shortly after illness onset. Measurements were taken at spinal cord, brain, and cerebrum levels and compared to rabies antigen in neuronal bodies. Results showed a decrease in rab viral antigen in processes in rostral direction following the pattern of rab antigen in neuronal bodies and percentage of involved bodies, with a delay in process following body involvement consistent with replication in region and transport to processes. More antigen was seen in processes in furious compared to paraly at all examined levels, even with similar amounts, percentages, and 100% positive neurons. This suggests intracellular transport may be slower in paraly, resulting in slower propagation. Possible mechanisms involve host differences in intracellular transport, potentially cytokine-mediated, given greater inflammation in paraly form.
Researchers investigated the role of the zinc-finger protein CTC in the regulation of gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster. CTC is known to act as an enhancer-blocking factor in vertebrates, but its function in Dophila has only recently been characterized. One endogenous CTC binding site was previously identified in the Fab-8 insulator at the Abdominal locus in the Bithorax (BX) complex. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray analysis was used to identify CTC binding sites in representative regions of the Dophila genome, including 3-M Adh, BX, and Antennedia. In vivo CTC binding enabled the construction of a CTC binding consensus sequence. CTC sites in BX mapped to known insulators Mcp, Fab-6, and Fab8, and additional presumptive insulators Fab-2, Fab-3, and Fab4. CTC is associated with all known or predicted insulators in BX except Fab7, suggesting a common CTC-dependent mechanism. Comparison with Polycomb target sites and histone modification supports BX regulation model.
Researchers have investigated the conformational changes that occur when a ligand binds to the enzyme peptidyl peptidase. This process, known as induced fit, is crucial for enzyme catalysis as it alters the local environment of the active site to align reactive groups for efficient catalysis and the transition state. The study used a slow, tight binding inhibitor-enzyme system, actin-peptidyl peidase. Crystal structures of the initial and final states were solved, as well as intermediate states captured during the process. Ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket led to closure of the site, which was further secured by additional interactions. Biochemical analysis of these data allowed reconstruction of the sequence of events from encounter to key binding of the enzyme. A "movie" of the process was created, which can be extrapolated to catalysis.
Researchers investigated the role of the thalamus as a gateway for sensory information transfer to the cerebral cortex, focusing on the interaction between cortical and thalamic cells during sensory processing. Using dynamic-clamp techniques in thal slices, they simulated a hybrid retino-thalamo-cortical pathway with biological cells and circuits, mimicking cortical input through stochastic excitatory and inhibitory conductances. The study found that the efficiency of sensory transmission depends on three factors: the number of thalamocortical cells, corticothalamic synaptic statistics, and correlation between thal relay cells. Counterintuitively, retocort signal efficiency increased with decreased correlation between thal cells, suggesting synchronized relay amplification by cortical feedback.
Researchers have identified a critical role for the putative DNA demethylase NM-1 in regulating meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans. NM-1 mutants exhibit reduced fertility due to defects in prophase I meiosis, resulting in reduced embryo production and increased incidence of males due to chromosomal segregation errors. In NM-1 worms, nuclear organization is disorganized at leptotene and zygot stages, cohesin complex is mislocalized at diplot and diak stages, and chromosomes are improperly condensed or lost by end diak. RNA sequencing of NM-1 germline reveals induction of DNA replication and damage response genes during meiosis, coupled with delayed replication, impaired repair, and apoptosis of maturing oocytes. To understand NM-1 regulation of replication and repair, immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry was used to identify NM-1 binding proteins. NM-1 binds multiple proteins regulating repair and replication, including topoisomerase TOP-2, and co-localizes with TOP-2 on chromatin. Majority of TOP-2 chromatin binding depends on NM-1. These findings suggest NM- functions at replication sites to regulate DNA and repair during meiosis.
Researchers have identified adipocyte plasma-associated protein (AAP) as a novel modulator of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. CMV is a ubiquitous pathogen that can cause serious diseases in newborns and immunocompromised patients. The virus has a large genome with coding potential and complex glycoproteins that can infect various human cells. While multiple host receptors interacting with viral glycoproteins have been reported, the mechanism of CMV infection remains unclear. This study found AAP necessary for CMV infection in epithelial and fibroblasts, with knockdown of AAP significantly reducing CMV infection in these cells. Ectopic expression of AAP in cells refractory to CMV, such as MDCK and NIH3T, promoted CMV infection. Viral early (IE) gene transcription at 6 hours post-infection and nucleus translocation tegument pp65 at 4 hours post-infection were delayed in AAP-deficient but not wildtype cells. Results suggest AAP plays a role in early CMV infection. Biochemical studies of AAP and CM proteins suggest AAP interacts with g/g containing glycoprotein at low pH and mediates tegument pp translocation. Overall, AAP functions as modulator promoting CMV in multiple cell types and important in CM mechanism.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model that combines intrinsic and extrinsic factors to understand how hematopoietic progenitor cells commit to specific lineages. The model shows that cytokine-mediated receptor feedback can induce a switch-like response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation, providing robustness to both bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced decommitment. The model supports both instructive and stochastic theories of commitment: cell fates are driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling can bias lineage commitment by regulating inherently noisy cell fate decisions with complex behaviors such as ligand ultrasensitivity and multistability. The kinetics of differentiation to a mature state depend on the progenitor state as well as the route of commitment chosen. The model agrees with lineage receptor expression kinetics from microarray experiments and provides a framework to integrate classical and alternative paths in hematies observed.
Researchers have investigated the ultrastructure of Bunyamwera virus, a prototypic member of the Orthunavirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family, using electron cryo-tomicroscopy. The virus particles are pleomorphic in shape but display a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes, each protruding 18nm from the membrane. Upon introduction to an acidic environment, the spikes become disordered. Subtom averaging revealed a three-dimensional model of the trimeric glycoprotein spike at 3nm resolution. The glycoprotein consists of a putative class-II fusion glycoprotein with a unique tripod-like arrangement. Protein-protein contacts occur at membrane-proximal regions and intra-spike at membrane-dist regions. This trimer deviates from previously observed glycoprotein arrangements, suggesting a greater repertoire of viral glycoprotein oligomerization. The study provides evidence of a pH-dependent conformation change during orthunaviral entry into host cells and a blueprint for the structure of emerging pathogens.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic factors contributing to primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), a condition characterized by shallow anterior chamber depth (AC). The study included 5,308 individuals of Asian descent and found a significant association between a variant in the ABCC5 gene (rs199) and AC depth, with a per allele effect size of -0.045mm (P=8.17×10^-9). This association was replicated in a separate case-control study of 4,276 PG cases and 18,801 controls, with an odds ratio of 1.13 (95% CI: 1.06-1.22, P=0.000). The association was strengthened when a subgroup of controls with open angles was included, with an odds ratio of 1.30 (P=7.45×10^-3, 3,458 cases vs 3,831). The study suggests that genetic variants influencing anterior chamber dimensions may contribute to increased risk of PG.
Researchers have identified conserved developmental enhancers between deuterostomes and protomes, which share a common developmental toolkit of conserved transcription factors and signaling pathways. These conserved patterning genes show similar expression and genetic interactions, suggesting a conserved regulatory apparatus. However, previous studies found no sequence conservation between the two groups. This study describes the first enhancers, called bilaterally conserved regulatory elements (Bico), which show sequence and gene synteny conservation. Bico conservation reflects conserved transcription factor binding sites. Icos are predicted to act as response elements to signaling pathways and are shown to be developmental enhancers driving transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate nervous system.
Researchers investigated the impact of vaccination on the intrahost diversity of H3N2 influenza viruses in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of vaccine efficacy. They used next-generation sequencing of patient-derived viruses to characterize the diversity of influenza A virus and define the effect of vaccine-induced immunity within populations. The study isolated the impact of vaccination while studying natural infection. Pre-hemagglutination and neuraminase inhibition titers quantified vaccine-induced immunity and its effect on intrah populations. 166 cases of H3N2 influenza were identified over 3 seasons and 19 years, with 119 whole-genome sequences obtained for analysis. A stringent, empirically validated pipeline identified intrah single nucleotide variants ≥1% frequency. Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin and neuraminase sequences showed no stratification by pre-HAI and NAI titers. The majority of intrah single nucleotide variants were rare, with few found in more than one individual. Most samples had fewer than 15 nucleotide variants across the genome, with no significant variation by day, vaccination status, or pre-antibody titer.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of genetically modified, live attenuated Leishmania donovani parasites (LC-/-) in inducing a protective immune response against visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in mice of different ages. VL, caused by L. donovani, is a severe disease with no vaccine available for any age group. Previous studies showed LC- induced strong immune response in young mice. This study compared LC- mediated immune response in 18-month-old (aged) and 2-month-old (young) mice. Analysis of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) from infected with LC- showed enhanced effector responses, augmenting CD4+ T cell function compared to wild-type (WT) BMDCs in vitro. Splenic dendritic cells from LC- infected mice also induced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-6, IF-γ, TNF) and downregulated anti-inflammatory IL-10. Immunization with LC- induced IgG2 antibodies, lymphoproliferative response, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and nitric oxide production in young and aged mice. Upon virulent L. donani challenge, LC- immunized mice displayed multifunctional Th1 CD4 and cytotoxic CD8 cells, reduced parasite burden in spleen and liver. Notably, LC- induced response in dendritic cells was similar in aged and young mice, but T and B cell activation was reduced in aged, correlating with less protection. LC- immunization induced significant but diminished response in aged mice compared young.
Researchers investigated the differences in biophysical properties between enteric and respiratory enteroviruses (EVs) by generating chimeras at the capsid level between EV-D68 (respiratory) and EV-D94 (enteric). They found that some chimeras were nonfunctional, but viable constructs with the capsid 2 protease of EV68 and caps of EV94 were viable. Functional assays showed that caps proteins determine acid sensitivity and tropism in cell lines and tissues, including respiratory and intestinal and neural. Caps genes also participate in determining optimal growth temperature, as EV94 adaptation relied on VP1 mutations, while EV68 capsid constructs could not adapt to higher temperatures. Additionally, EV68 maintained binding capacity after acid treatment despite loss of infectivity, whereas nonstructural proteins modulated the immune response in tissues.
Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gE1 (gE) is a transmembrane receptor found on the surface of infected cells and virions that binds human immunoglobulin G (Ig). It also participates in antibody bridging (ABB), a process where antigen-binding fragments (Fab) of IgG bind viral antigen while Fc binds to gE. IgFc binds gE at basic, but not acidic pH, suggesting Ig bound extracellular surface gE would dissociate and degrade in acidic endosomes/lysosomes if endocytosed. The fate of viral antigens with gE-bound Ig was unknown: they remain surface or endocyt with Ig. An in vitro system for ABB was developed to investigate trafficking of ABB using 4-D confocal imaging of complexes with transferrin epidermal growth, characterized intracellular markers. Data showed cells expressing gE and viral HSV-1 antigen endocyt antiD Ig g in gE-dependent, resulting lysosomal localization.
Researchers have investigated the transcriptome of the protoscoleces (PS) of Echinococcus granulosus, a parasite responsible for cistic hydatid disease, using Roche 454 sequencing and in silico analysis. The study generated 26,514 non-reduant sequences, of which 22,910 (86.4%) were mapped to the published E. granus genome and 17,705 (66.8%) were within coding sequence (CDS) regions. From the 2,280 predicted excretory-secretory proteins (ESPs), 138 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, 124 in protein metabolism, and 11 intracellular enzymes regulating glycolysis/glucone (GL) pathways. Additionally, 44 antigenic proteins, 25 molecular chaperones, and 4 proteases were identified. Many proteins were enriched in development-related pathways such as TGF receptor and insulin pathways. This research provides insight into the parasite's metabolic adaptation to hosts, aiding in the development of novel intervention targets for hydat treatment and control.
In the fungus Aspergillus nidans, the transcription factor NirA plays a crucial role in regulating the assimilation of nitrate, a key nitrogen source in soil. When nitrate is absent, NirA accumulates in the nucleus and becomes transcriptionally active due to the disruption of its interaction with the export protein Kap/CRM. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that in the absence of nitrate, NirA is predominantly cytosolic and methionine 169 in its nuclear export sequence (NES) is oxidized to methion sulfoxide (Metox). This oxidation is dependent on Fmo, a flav-containing monooxygenase that uses methion and cystine as substrates, but not glutathione. Fmo cannot be replaced by alternative F proteins in A. nidans. Exposure to nitrate leads to rapid reduction of Nir-Met169 to Met, independent of thiorexin and methion sulfox reductases. Replacing Met169 with isoleuc, a sterically similar but not oxidizable residue, results in partial loss of Nir activity and insensitivity to F-mediated export. In contrast, replacing Met with alanine transforms the protein into a permanently nuclear and active factor. Co-immoprecipitation of Nir-Kap interactions and subcellular studies of Nir mutants lacking parts of the protein show that Met oxidation leads to Nir conformation change.
Researchers have investigated the constraints that shape the evolution of voltage-gated sodium channels in mammals. These channels are crucial for the propagation of action potentials, as proposed by Hodgkin and Hux's mathematical models, which suggest that sodium channel properties must be tightly constrained for this to occur. There are nine mammalian genes encoding voltage-gated sodium channels, with over 90% sequence similarity, implying functional similarity. However, the multiplicity of genes raises the question of why there are so many. The study demonstrates that theoretical constraints on sodium diversity, specifically membrane excitability and resting potential uniqueness, directly constrain channel properties. Data from 172 sets of mammalian channel measurements, including wild-type and mutant, under various conditions, show that all channels obey the excitability constraint. In contrast, channels expressed in muscle obey the unique resting potential constraint, while those in neuronal tissue do not. Excitability distinguishes sodium channels into four groups consistent with phylogenetic analysis. Calculations suggest functional differences between these groups.
Researchers have identified the endonuclease domain of the influenza A/H1N1/2009 polymerase as a potential target for novel antiviral drugs due to its crucial role in viral replication and transcription. The heterotrimeric polymerase, comprising subunits PA, PB1, and PB2, has been a focus of recent structural and functional studies, revealing opportunities for structure-based optimization of viral replication inhibitors. Specifically, the cap-snatching mechanism of transcription can be inhibited by targeting the PB cap-binding or endonuc domains. This study presents high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 PA enduc domain in complexed with a series of specific inhibitors, including diketo compounds and green tea catechin, which chelate two manganese ions in the enzyme's active site. The binding modes of the compounds and mononucleotide phosphate were compared, highlighting how substituents on the metal binding scaffold can orient in distinct subockets within the active cavity and the site's plasticity, resulting in induced binding. These findings will inform the design of more potent inhibitors targeting the capatching enduc activity of the virus polymerase.
Researchers have developed an effective immunization protocol to produce polyspecific antiven against three medically important viper species in Thailand and neighboring countries: Cryptelytrops alabris (White-lipped viper), Caloselasma rhodoma (Malayan viper), and Dabo siamensis (Russell's viper). The goal was to create an antivenom that could neutralize venom from any of these species, eliminating the need to identify the culprit snake. Four horses were immunized with a mixture of the three venoms using a low-dose, low-volume immunization protocol. The antiseras showed a rapid increase in ELISA titers against the venoms, reaching a plateau at 8 weeks post-immunization. In-vitro neutralization potency of the antiser against CA, CR, and DS venoms was 10.40, 2.42, and 0.76 mg/ml, respectively, exceeding the minimal limits set by the Queen Saab Memorial Institute. Corresponding values for monospecific antiserum against CA, CR, and DS ven were 7.28, 3.12, and 1.50/ml. The polyspecific antiser also neutralized procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephroxic activities of the venoms. This immunization protocol may be useful for producing polyspecific antiven and equine antiserum against tetanus, diphtheria, and rabies.
Salmonella enterica, a bacterium that causes systemic infections, can persist in the body for long periods despite a strong immune response. Chronically infected individuals remain asymptomatic and transmit the disease to uninfected hosts through fecal shedding, serving as a reservoir for the disease. The effector protein SI, translocated into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenic Island 2 (SPI) type III secretion system, is necessary for Salmonella typhim to maintain long-term systemic infection in mice. In vitro, S inhibits normal migration of primary macrophages and dendritic cells, requiring host IQGTPase activating protein 1 (IQAP), a regulator of cell migration. S binds IQAP and localizes with this factor at cell periphery. The C-terminal of S is similar to PMTxA, a toxin containing cysteine residue critical for activity. Mutation of corresponding in S (C178) eliminates S function in vitro and vivo, but not IQAP binding. Infection with wild-type S typhur suppressed migration to spleen in S-dependent manner. Examination of spleens from infected with WT tyur revealed fewer DC and CD+ lymphocytes compared to infected ΔS tyur. Results demonstrate S inhibits host migration, counteracting ability to clear bacteria.
Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a pathogen that causes severe disease in healthy individuals and is more virulent than hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). The mechanism behind CA-MRSA's high virulence is unknown. The p-mec gene, located in the mobile element SCCmec of HA-MRSA, but not CA-MRSA, suppresses phenol-sol-soluble modulin (PSM) expression, a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus. This study found p-m RNA inhibits agr gene translation, encoding transcription factor for PSM via specific binding to agr mRNA. 25% of 325 MRSA isolates had p-m promoter mutation attenuating transcription and 9% had no p-m. Most p-mutated or p-deleted HA-MRSA had increased PSM compared to intact p-m and some produced high P comparable to CA-MRSA. Deletion p-m from HA-M with p increased Agr and PSM and virulence in mice. p-m suppresses MR virulence via agr inhibition and absence in CARSA causes high virulence.
Researchers investigated the phenomenon of antibody-mediated disease enhancement (ADE) in type I interferon-deficient mice, which occurs when maternal antibodies from a previous dengue infection enhance the severity of a subsequent heterologous or homolog deng virus (DENV) infection. Epidemiological studies have shown that babies born to deng immune mothers are at higher risk of developing severe disease upon primary infection with heterolog or homolog DENV serotype. To replicate this in a mouse model, previously, DENV-infected 5-week-old type I interferon receptor-deficient (IFN) mice (129) born to D1-immune mothers displayed enhanced disease with increased virus titers and vascular leakage leading to death. This study aimed to reproduce ADE in a less immunocompromised background. Five-week 129 mice born to D1-imm mothers succumbed to D2 infection within 4 days, whereas those born to naïve mothers survived. Clinical manifestations included hepatocyte vacuolation, vascular leakage, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Anti-TNF therapy protected mice and correlated with healthy hepatocytes, while blocking IL-6 had no impact on virus titers or outcome. This A129 model of ADE may elucidate mechanisms in deng pathogenesis and evaluate vaccine/therapeutic efficacy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to identify factors associated with Leishmaniasis infection in the Americas, a disease that has urbanized over 30 years ago. Fifty-one studies were reviewed from various databases, reference lists, and expert consultations. Meta-analysis was used to pool information on each variable, with Q and I2 statistics assessing heterogeneity. Male sex was associated with visceral leishiasis in studies using the leishman skin test, but not with serological diagnosis. Younger individuals were less frequently infected, but more prone to illness. Presence of dogs at home, higher seropositivity nearby, lower socioeconomic status, and vegetated areas were associated with L infantum infection. Chicken presence in the house and nutritional status were not associated. Studies had susceptibility to bias and limitations in analysis and description. Results showed consistent patterns for some factors, to be considered in control measures. New studies are needed in areas with improved methodological quality, prioritizing patterns and causes, and variables with poor knowledge.
Inhalation of Francisella tularens (Ft) causes acute and fatal pneumonia, characterized by excessive bacterial replication in the lung tissue. Research on the sequential host response to tularemia reveals that an innate cellular response, rather than cytokine production, drives tissue damage and mortality. Immature myeloid cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are recruited to the lungs, fail to mature, and die, causing necrotic lung damage, loss of function, and host death. This process is partially dependent on Ly6+ cells. In contrast, sub-lethal infections elicit a mature neutrophil and monocyte response, required for protection, suggesting a threshold for lethal infection. Mature phagocytosis provides transient, but significant protection against Ftu4. The study suggests the nature of myoid cell response is the primary determinant of host mortality versus survival following Francisella infection.
Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, is an invasive species that poses a global concern due to its rapid spread and potential for infectious disease transmission. As a vector of medically important arboviruses such as CHIKV, DENV, and ZIKV, understanding its colonization pattern is crucial for mitigating its spread and disease risks. Population genetics and Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) approaches were used to disentangle the demographic history of Aedesopopus populations from Southeast Asia and recently colonized areas. In Southeast Asia, low differentiation and high co-ancestry values among China and Thailand indicate native populations maintain genetic connectivity, revealing a common origin. China is the oldest population. Outside Asia, invasion in La Réunion, America, and the Mediterranean is supported by chaotic propagule distribution, maintaining high diversity in adventive populations. Independent transcontinental introductions of Aedesopus facilitated rapid establishment through admixture of unrelated genomes, resulting in intra-population variability. This variability may extend to genetic controlling vector competence. In the invasion context, ancestry and admixture create conditions for efficient arvirus transmission and outbreak.
Researchers investigated the genetic factors contributing to the fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic wounds, a type of infection that is difficult to treat. They found that clinical isolates from human wounds often lacked virulence functions and biofilm formation capabilities, which are typically associated with bacterial pathogenicity. In experimental mouse models, virulence and biofilm genes were not necessary for bacterial fitness. Instead, genes involved in anaerobic growth, metabolism, energy production, and membrane integrity were crucial. These findings suggest that bacteria in chronic wounds face anaerobic, oxidative, and membrane stress conditions, which can be represented by high-density bacterial growth in the absence of a host.
A prospective study was conducted at the Center for Teaching, Research, and Referral for Bancrofilariasis (NEF) to evaluate the occurrence of intrascrot lymphangiectasia, gross consistency of the testis, and efficacy of excision of hydrocele sac in patients with bancrofilariasis. A total of 968 patients with unilateral or bilateral hydrocele (Group 1) and 218 patients from the same area who had undergone hydrocele-sparing hydrocelectomy elsewhere (Comparison Group) were enrolled. Twenty patients from Comparison with hydrocele were reoperated at NEF and constitute Group 2. In Group 1, 1128 hydrolectomies were performed with a mean age of 30.3 years and mean follow-up of 8.6 years (range 5-12). Hydrocele rates in Group 1 and Comparison were 0.3% and 19.3 respectively (p<0.001). There was no hydrocele in Group 2 with a mean age of 25.1 and follow of 6 years (5-6). Surgically leaking or dilated lymphatic vessels were seen on the inner or outer surface of hydrocele wall or surrounding tissue in 30.9 and 46.3 of patients in Group 1 and 2 respectively (p=0.081). Testicles were abnormal in shape, volume, and consistency in 203/128 (18%) and 10/28 (35.7%) of Group 1 and 2 respectively (p=0.025). Lymph fluid from ruptured dilated lymphatic is a component of chronic hydrocele fluid threatening test integrity in adult bancfilariasis population. To prevent hydrocele, authors advise excision of hydro sac when leaking or dilated vessels should be suture or excised.
Trichella spiralis, a zoonotic nematode parasite, causes trichlosis, a disease found on all continents except Antarctica. During chronic infection, T. spir larvae infect skeletal muscles, disrupting their differentiation. An activity-based probe, HA-Ub-V, identified deubiquinating (D) enzyme activity in T. spir L larvae lysate. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation identified multiple Ds. Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to LC/MS, yielding peptides with homology to conserved D: UCH5, U3, HAP, OT6, and Atin-3. The gene encoding putative UCH5 homologue, Ts37, was cloned and recombinant protein expressed and purified. Deubitinating activity was verified by Ub-AM assay. Coipitation of recomant Ts37 showed association with putative T proteome components, including yeastpn hom ADR1. Inhibitor LD-44 exhibited specific inhibition recomant Ts37 and reduced cultured L viability. This study reports first T spir D, cystine protease orthologous to human U5. Results suggest interaction with proteome conserved throughout evolution. Inhibitors may elucidate U role in spir infection and as therapeutic targets trichlos.
Cysteine protease cruzain is a validated target for therapeutic intervention in the treatment of Chagas disease, a parasitic infection caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Researchers investigated the anti-tryosomal activity of nitrile-based cystine protease inhibitors against the CLner strain of T. cruzi. Three compounds, based on scaffolds associated with cathepsin inhibition, showed anti-tryosomal activity in the 0.1-1 μM range. The two most potent compounds had EC50 values of 0.12 μM and 0.25M against the trypanosome, significantly lower than Ki values against cruzain, a recombinant form of cruzain in an enzyme assay. This suggests the anti-tryosomal activity is not solely due to cruzain inhibition, indicating a polypharmacological profile towards cystine proteases.
Researchers have constructed a physical map of the maize genome, covering 93.5% of the genome, which aligns with 86.1% of the genetic map. The map contains 25,908 genetic markers, enabling 73% of the genome to be anchored to the rice genome. Sequence tags correlate with recombination patterns, with 1 kb in rice corresponding to 3.2 kb in maize. Maize has a 6-fold larger genome size due to regions corresponding to two in maize from polyploid origin. Inversions account for most structural variations during diploidization. Ancient duplications occurred before divergence of maize and rice progenitors.
Researchers have investigated the de novo generation of infectious prions in vitro to understand the etiology of sporadic prion disease. Prions are proteinaceous infectious agents responsible for transmissible spong encephalopathies, composed of misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) that replicates in the body without nucleic acids by inducing misfolding cellular prion (Pr). The most common human prion disease is sporadic, originating from spontaneous misfolding to PrSc particle propagation. This study aimed to mimic sporadic disease etiology by generating PrSc in vitro using protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PM) procedure. Under standard PM conditions, de novo PrSc generation was not observed, supporting diagnostic applications. However, modified PM generated PrSc in absence pre-existing PrSc in different species at low rate. De novo PrSc was infectious in wild-type hamsters, producing unique clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features. Results support prion hypothesis and provide model for sporadic disease mechanism.
Researchers have developed a novel neural model to estimate angular velocity (AV) in the bee brain, capable of quantitatively reproducing experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees. The model is based on electrophysiological data and tested with behavioral data. The model suggests that AV can be considered an extension of the optomotor response. The model was tested behaviorally in silico with the corridor-center paradigm, where bees navigate a corridor with gratings (square or sinusoidal) on walls. When combined with existing flight algorithm, the model reproduces invariance of flight path to spatial frequency and contrast of gratings, including deviations from centering behavior found in real bees. Additionally, response of model to unit movement along corridor is constant for large grating frequencies, demonstrating it can be used as visual odometer.
Untreated Infections by Trypanosoma brucei gambense Are Not 100% Fatal: A Long-Term Follow-Up of 50 African Trypanosomiasis Patients

A cohort of 50 patients with African trypanosomiasis (AT) from the Ivory Coast, diagnosed with Trypanosoma brucei gambense, the causative agent of sleeping sickness, were followed for 15 years. Eleven patients refused treatment after initial diagnosis, and 10 continued to do so despite repeated visits. Parasite clearance was observed using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all 10, and serological responses decreased in 7, becoming negative to trypanosome antigens Liat 1.3, 1.5, and 1.6. Two alternative progressions of AT were identified: aparasitemic and asymptomatic infection with long-lasting serological responses, and spontaneous resolution with negative parasitological and PCR results and decreasing antibody titres. This study does not estimate the frequency of these courses, but notes that field programs encounter subjects with positive serological results but negative parasitological tests, indicating some display these courses. Recognizing trypanotolerance in humans, accepted in animals, is a step for future HAT research.
Researchers investigated the relationship between ionizing radiation and the selection of p53-deficient hematopoietic progenitors in mice. p53 is a tumor suppressor gene, and its loss can provide resistance to genotoxic stimuli, including radiation. p53 null mice develop T-cell lymphomas with high penetrance, and irradiation accelerates lymphoma in p53 heterozygous mice. The study hypothesized that increased p53-deficient cells contribute to the link between irradiation and lymphoid malignancies. Using mouse models, they found that p53 disruption does not provide a selective advantage in an unstressed hematopoietic system or previously irradiated BM allowed to recover. However, upon irradiation, p53 confers a selective advantage, leading to long-term expansion of p53-deficient clones and increased lymphoma. Selection for p-def cells is attributed to several factors: protection from irradiation-induced ablation of progenitor cells, prevention of irradi-induced loss of clonogenic capacity for stem and progenitor, improved maintenance of progenitor fitness, and elimination of competing p wild-type progenitors.
Researchers investigated the role of Schistosoma mansoni SmKI-1 serine protease inhibitor in parasite development and its potential as a regulator of inflammatory diseases. They found that recombinant Sm-1 and its Kunit domain, but not the C-terminal region, possess inhibitory activity against trypsin and neutrophil elastase (NE). Molecular docking studies revealed that Sm-1's Kunit domain blocks NE's active site. Sm-1 also inhibited NE's capacity to kill schistosomes. To investigate Sm-1's role in the parasite, specific siRNA was used to knockdown Sm-1 in S. mansoni. Sm-1 suppression in the larval stage of S. mansoni significantly impacted parasite development in vitro and in vivo. Sm-1's ability to interfere with neutrophil function was tested in murine models of inflammatory diseases. Treatment with Sm-1 rescued acetaminophen (AP)-mediated liver damage, reducing neutil recruitment and elast activity. In a model of gout, Sm-1 reduced neutil accumulation, IL-β secretion, hyperiception, and pathological score. Sm- was also shown to inhibit early neutil recruitment in pleural cavities of mice in response to carrageenan. The study concludes that Sm-1 is a key in S. mans survival and has potential as a therapeutic against inflammatory diseases.
Researchers have developed a novel method for accurately modeling transmembrane helix (TM) protein structures from distant homologues with distinct loop and TM conformations. This method was tested on adenosine A2A and chemokine CX4 receptors, ranking first in the GPCR Dock prediction contest in the receptor category. A benchmark of 50 TM protein homolog pairs with diverse topology (5-12 TM), size (183-420 residues), and sequence (15-70%) was used to evaluate the method. The method outperformed starting templates, achieving near-atomic accuracy in membrane-embedded regions. Unlike templates, the models were suitable for computer-based engineering, redesigned and X-ray structures showed similar native interactions. This method is useful for atom-level modeling and design of structurally uncharacterized TM proteins from a range of homologues.
Listeria monocytogenes, the causative agent of listeriosis, a foodborne disease, poses significant risks to fetuses, newborns, and immunocompromised individuals. This intracellular pathogen proliferates in the host cytos and exploits the actin polymerization machinery for cell-to-cell spread and dissemination. During infection in human hepatocytes or trophlast cells, L. monocogen switches from active motile to a persistent vacuolar lifestyle. Bacteria stop producing actin nucleating protein Act and become trapped in lysosome-like vacuoles, termed Lister-Containing Vacoles (Lis). Subpopulations resist degradation in Lis and enter slow-replicative state. In host cells harboring Lis, bacteria cycle between vacolar and act-based motility stages. Act absence, as in ΔAct mutants, vacolar bacteria parasitize host in "viable but noncult" (VB) state, undetectable by colony methods. High gentamicin exposure does not trigger Lis formation but selects vacolar VB. These results reveal L monocogen ability to persist in epithelial cells, favoring asymptomatic carriage, prolonged incubation, and survival during therapy.
Researchers have developed a neuromechanical model to study auditory bistability, a phenomenon where sequences of higher and lower frequency tones in an A-BA pattern are perceived as either a single or separate streams. The model combines neuromechanical and psychoacoustic experiments to investigate persistent alternations between these percepts during long presentations. Unlike previous models, it includes neuronal units with sensory-dependent inputs mimicking pulselike responses to tones and a computation for competition in primary auditory cortex. Mutual inhibition, adaptation, and noise are implemented, along with slow NMDA recurrent excitation for temporal memory. Percepts are identified in firing patterns of units. The model predicts that manipulating frequency difference between tones affects dominance of percepts, with stronger percepts lasting longer than weaker ones, a property established in visual bistable paradigms. Psychoac experiments confirm this prediction and further constrain the model, achieving quantitative agreement between results. The model provides a platform to extend to other conditions, including context and volition.
Researchers have developed a method to assess the allergenicity of Schistosoma mansoni proteins using a humanized Ratophil Leukemia (RSAT8) cell line. This approach aims to identify molecular targets of the IgE response in S. mansoni infection, which could lead to a better understanding of anti-parasite immunity and the development of safe and efficacious vaccinations against helthic parasites. The method involves cell-free translation of S. mans proteins using wheat germ lysate, followed by assessment of potential allergity with the RSL reporter line. Cell translation is completed within 90 minutes, generating sufficient protein for rapid screening without purification. Antigen integrity is confirmed using Western blotting. After incubation with individuals' serum, the RSL reporter line is challenged with wheat translation and luciferase activity measured, indicating cellular activation by the allergen. This method is demonstrated using characterised parasitic allergens such as Par 2, SmAL-1 and IgE factor SE/alpha, expressed in wheat lysate or E coli. coli. SmAL-1, but not SmAL2, activates the basophil reporter line. The system is suitable for medium to high-throughput studies using infected sera and study of helthic protein allergity.
Researchers investigated the effects of transposable elements (TEs) on gene expression in Drosophila, specifically in the context of hybrid dysgenesis, a form of genomic incompatibility that arises when TE abundance differs between parents. They found that when TEs inherited from the father are absent in the mother's genome, they become activated in progeny, causing germline damage and sterility. In Drosila, dysgenesis occurs when paternal TEs are not matched with a pool of corresponding silencing PI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) provided by the female germl. The study used D. virilis hybrid dysgenesis as a model to characterize effects of TE divergence between parents on offspring. Results show that divergence in TE landscape is associated with persisting differences in germl TE expression in genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses, transmitted to next generation. Chronic and persisting TE expression coincides with increased levels of genic piRNAs associated with reduced gene expression. Gene expression is idiosratically influenced by differences in genicRNA profile of parents arising from polymorphic TE insertions. These results support a model where early germl events in dysgenesis establish a stable state of TE and gene expression in germl maintained through adulthood and transmitted to generation. Divergence in TE is associated with piRNA-mediated transgener effects on expression within populations.
Fragile X Tremor Atax Syndrome (FXT) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a CG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the 5′UTR of the fragile X syndrome (FX) gene, FMR1. The expanded CG repeat is thought to induce toxicity and FXT patients have high levels of FMR1 mRNA. Despite FMR's critical role in disease, the basis for increased F1 expression is unknown. Researchers found that overexpressing histone deetylases (HD3, 6, or 11) suppresses CG repeat-induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila FXT model. This is due to selective repression of the CG repeat-containing transgene. Chromatin immunoprecitation showed increased acetylation of histones at the F1 locus in preutation carriers compared to control FX lines. This correlates with elevated F1 mRNA in preutation lines. Histone acetylase (H) inhibitors reduced F1 to control levels in preutation lines and extended lifespan in CG-expressing Dophila. These findings support a model where the CG expansion promotes chromatin remodeling, increasing toxic F mRNA. Additionally, H or HD inhibitors might selectively repress the locus.
Researchers investigated the role of host genetics in controlling CD8 T cell function and immunopathology during chronic viral infection. Effective CD8 T cell responses are crucial for controlling chronic viral infections, but factors contributing to maintaining effector CD8 cell responses versus exhaustion during chronic infection are not fully understood. Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) alleles and degree of MHC heterogeneity are associated with enhanced CD8 cell function and viral control during human infection. To examine the impact of M heterogeneity versus non-MHC host genetics on chronic infection development, F1 cross of B10.D2 and B6 (DBF1) and BAL.B x BAL/C (B1) mice were infected with clone-13 (Cl-13) lymphocytic choriomening virus (LCV). Following Cl-13 infection, H-2D2DBF and B1 mice demonstrated increased viral control compared to homozygous mice. Notably, H-2D2DB mice on C57 genetic background exhibited mortality following Cl-13 infection. CD8 cell depletion prevented mortality in Cl-infected DBF mice, indicating mortality was CD T-cell dependent. DBF mice maintained CD8 cell effector cytokine production and reduced expression of T exhaustion marker PD-1. Additionally, DBF mice induced larger Th1 response than B1 mice Cl-13 mortality in DBF mice was dependent CD4-cell IFN production. Following chronic infection, increased CD8 cell functionality allowed rapid viral clearance at cost of immunopathology dependent on M diversity and host genetic background.
A study on the genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis isolated in northwestern China from 1990 to 2016 was conducted. Anthrax is a re-emerging zoon disease and endemic in China, particularly in rural areas. The study described the general characteristics of human anthrax outbreaks in northwestern China over the past decade and analyzed the genetic of Bacillus anthracis using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and multilocus-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) with 15 markers. Five sublineages/subgroups, A. Br.001/002, A. Br. Voll, A. Br94, A. Ames, and A. Br.008/009, were detected using 13SN sites. All subgroups were found in Xinjiang, one in Shaanxi, two Gans, three Qinghai, and four Inner Mongolia. Geographical distribution of B. anthrac populations exhibited different SNP characteristics from strains before 1990 in China. A. Br Ames was observed scattered from Inner to other provinces. All 106 strains assigned 36 MLVA genotypes, 21 first observed this study. Strains anthrax recent decade classified subgroups A. Br.001 and A. Ames genotypes MLVA-28, ML-30, ML-31 ML-38 ML-CH3 ML-18. By SNP and MLVA, divers ML genotypes and B anthrac populations distribution becoming balanced northwestern China. This study preliminary results population B. anthrac China, prevention control important disease.
Researchers investigated the role of goblet cell-derived RELMβ in defending against intestinal infections caused by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, a food and waterborne pathogen that attaches to the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells, leading to severe diarrheal disease. Studies using Citrobacter rodium, a related mouse pathogen, suggested that hosts rely on immune-mediated changes in intestinal epithelial cells, including goblet cells, to defend against pathogens. These changes include increased CD4 T cell-dependent intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and altered goblet cell mucin production. RELMβ, a goblet mediator, is strongly induced during Citrobium infection and detected in stool and serum, but its role in defense is unclear. Wild-type and RELβ deficient mice were orally infected with Citrobium. RELβ deficient mice showed increased mortality and mucosal ulceration due to pathogen penetration of colonic crypts. Immunostaining revealed impaired infection-induced epithelial proliferation in REL deficient mice. RELβ did not directly increase epithelial proliferation, but acted as a CD4 cell chemoattract. Deficient mice showed impaired CD4 cell recruitment and reduced interleukin-22, a multifunctional cytokine increasing epithelial proliferation. REL delivery to deficient mice restored CD4 recruitment, interleukin-22, and epithelial proliferation, reducing mucosal pathology. RELβ and goblet cells play a critical role in recruiting CD4 cells to protect against enteric pathogen via increased epithelial proliferation.
Researchers have identified a crucial interaction between the C-terminal motif of norovirus VP protein (VPg) and the HEAT domain of eukary initiation factor 4 (eIF4) that is essential for translation initiation of the positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of norovirus, a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans. Norirus RNA lacks a 5 mG cap and internal ribosome entry site (IRES), instead relying on interactions between VPg attached to the 5-end of the RNA and host eary initiation factors. In murine norirus (MNV), VP was previously shown to bind the middle fragment of e4 (residues 652-113). This study used pull-down assays, fluorescence anisotropy, and isothermal calorimetry (ITC) to demonstrate a 20 amino acid stretch at the C-terminus of MN VP mediates direct and specific binding to HE-1 within the fragment of e. Analysis revealed the MN C-termin binds e-HE-1 via a motif conserved in all norirus. Mutagenic mapping suggested the MN VP Ctermin interacts e in a helical conformation. NMR spectroscopy defined the VP binding site on e-HE-1, confirmed by mutagen and binding assays. The site is non-overlapping with binding for eA on eHE-1, indicating norirus VP can form ternary VP-e-e-eA complexes. Functional significance of the VP-e interaction was shown by fusion proteins containing the C-terminal of MN VP inhibiting in vitro translation of norirus but not cap or I-dependent.
Researchers investigated the evolution of gene clusters in bacterial genomes, where genes encoding proteins in a common pathway are often found near each other on the chromosome. Several theories have been proposed to explain this phenomenon, including natural selection favoring clusters through mechanisms such as co-regulation efficiency and the selfish operon model, which suggests clusters are more easily transferred to other species, enhancing survival prospects. The persistence model proposes genes in proximity are less likely disrupted by deletions. This study developed computational models to examine cluster evolution conditions. The selfish operon model was re-implemented and simulated under various conditions. A Moran process was introduced with natural selection for clustering and rearrangement by inversion events. A model was developed with selection and inversion, tracking rearrangement fixation. Surprisingly, clusters failed to evolve under various conditions. Factors promoting cluster evolution include low pathway genes, high population size, and selfish model high transfer rate. Computational analysis showed cluster evolution under direct and indirect selection with certain conditions. The operon remains viable under these conditions as cluster explanation.
Malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in tropical regions worldwide, with pregnant women being particularly vulnerable to severe consequences due to parasite-infected erythrocyte adhesion in the placenta. This adhesion is mediated by a variant of PfEMP1, a parasite-encoded, hyper-variable antigen on the surface of infected cells, specifically VARCS, which binds chondroit sulfate on syncyotrophoblasts in the intervillous space of placent. VARCS is only expressed in the presence of placenta, suggesting its expression is repressed in men or non-pregnant women, but the mechanism is not understood. Researchers used cultured parasite lines and gene constructs to show the VARCS gene contains an upstream reading frame that represses translation of mRNA, a novel form of regulation in malaria parasites. The mechanism is reversible, allowing high protein levels upon selection, enabling parasites to upregulate this antigen in host tissue.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide microarray analysis of blood samples from 34 children infected with dengue virus (DENV) in Nicaragua, collected on days 3-6 of illness, to investigate the pathophysiology of severe versus non-severe manifestations. The study identified distinct gene expression patterns between clinical subgroups, particularly between deng patients with and without shock, showing increased expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins associated with protein synthesis. In deng hemorrhagic fever patients, a subset of differentially expressed genes encoded neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides associated with innate immunity. A meta-analysis with previously published datasets confirmed DENV infection is associated with changes in protein and nucleic acid metabolism. In vitro infection led to an interferon signature, not observed in vivo samples, suggesting a transient interferon response by days 3-6 of illness. The study highlights differences in severity manifestations during DENV infection and identifies commonalities.
Murine Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), a lymphotropic herpesvirus related to Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus, targets the olfactory neuroepithelium for entry. In vivo studies, Mu-4 virions spontaneously targeted the olfactory neuroepithelium, a previously unexplored site for herpesvirus entry. Like other herpesviruses, Mu-4 binds heparan sulfate (HS), and virions unable to bind HS showed poor entry. The respiratory epithelium expressed basolateral HS and was bound poorly by incoming virions, whereas the neuroepithelium displayed apical HS on neuronal cilia and bound strongly. Incoming virions tracked the neuronal cilia, either infecting neurons or reaching the microvilli of adjacent glial sustacular cells and infecting them. The olfactory neuroepithium provides an important site of HS-dependent herpesirus uptake.
Salmonella enterica, a pathogenic bacteria, requires the expression of genes in the pathogenic island (SPI-1) to invade epithelial cells. SPI-1 expression is tightly regulated and activated under specific conditions. A new regulatory circuit involving CRP, a metabolic regulator, silences SPI-1 under non-permissive conditions. CRP-deficient strains show strong upregulation of SPI-1 in mid-logarithmic growth phase. Genetic analysis reveals CRP modulates HilD, master regulator of Salmonella invasion, at post-transcription level. This regulation requires a newly identified motif within Hil 3'UTR. CRP also represses Hfq-dependent sRNA Spot42. When repression relieved, Spot42 positively affects Hil expression. In vivo and in vitro assays show Spot42 targets Hil 3'UT through unstructured region. Results highlight Hil 3'UT as postcription control hub for Salmonella invasion expression.
Researchers investigated the relationship between CAG repeat instability, chromatin structure, and transcription in the context of Huntington's disease (HD) using R6 and R2 transgenic mouse lines. These mice express a similar transgene, integrated at different sites, and recapitulate tissue-specific instability. Results show increased instability in R2 tissues compared to R1 samples. High transgene expression and chromatin accessibility correlated with increased CAG instability in R2 mice. Transgene mRNA and H3K4 trimylation at the HD locus were increased, whereas H3K9 dimethylation reduced in R2 tissues relative R1. Levels of transgene and histone marks similar in striatum and cerebellum, two tissues with different CAG levels. Elongating RNA II at HD locus, not initiating form II, tissue-specific correlated with CAG levels. H3 trimylation, associated with elongation, increased at HD locus in striatum not cerebellum. Data suggest transcription modulates somatic CAG in vivo, specifically elongation regulated tissue-dependent contributing to tissue-selective instability.
Researchers investigated the genetic features of Enterovirus 71 (EV71), a highly virulent enterovirus, to understand its ability to disseminate in humans. They analyzed five full-genome sequences from immunocompromised patients with disseminated disease at different infection sites: respiratory, gastrointestinal, nervous, and blood. Three nucleotide changes occurred within five days: a non-conservative amino acid change in VP1 within the BC loop (LR), a region considered immunogenic and important in poliovirus host adaptation; conservative amino substitution in protein 2 (AV); and silent mutation in protein 3 (L). Infectious clones were constructed using BrCr (A) and clinical (C) lineages with one or both non-syn mutations. In vitro tropism and competition assays showed VP1 Leu to Arg substitution within BC conferred replicative advantage in SHY5Y neuroblastoma cells. This mutation was associated with second non-conservative (EG or EA) in VP1 loop in neuroblast cells. Comparative models of EV71 VP variants were built to determine substitutions' effects on VP structure and host interactions. No significant structural changes were observed, but substitutions may alter host receptor interactions. Results indicate VP1 BC region of EV plays critical role in tropism independent of lineage, contributing to dissemination and neurotropism in immunocomised patients.
Bacteria of the genus Streptoccus have the ability to acquire new traits through natural transformation, a process mediated by the uptake of extracellular DNA. This process is regulated by quorum sensing (QS) through peptide pherones, such as the ComRS system. ComS is processed into ComX, secreted, and imported into the cytoplasm, where it binds ComR, activating transcription and a positive feedback loop for ComS and SigX expression. ComRS is present in most Streptoccus species, but ComS and ComX sequences diverge, suggesting species-specific communication. To study cross-talk between Streptoc species in competence regulation and ComX interaction, an interdisciplinary approach was undertaken. A test assay was developed to measure Com activity in response to cognate and heterologous X peptides in vivo, revealing strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity classes among species. The X-ray structure of Com from S suis was solved to understand XIP interaction and identify structural features in Com that explain X recognition. Directed mutagenesis probed the apo conformation of the X-binding pocket site in test and biochemically in vitro. Com proteins from other species align with the pocket lined by a variable and conserved face, with conserved residues contributing to ligand binding and variable discriminating X peptides. Results provide a model for X recognition and specificity, predicting novel X peptides inducing Com activity.
Researchers have investigated the epigenetic inheritance of centromeres in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans using a genome-wide replication timing analysis. They found that each centrom is associated with a replication origin that fires first on its respective chromosome. Epigenetic formation of ectopic centromeres (neocromeres) was accompanied by shifts in replication timing, where neocere became the first to replicate and associated with origin recognition complex (OR) components. Changes in centrom-specific histone H3 isoform led to concomitant changes in ORC association with centrom regions, supporting the idea that centrom proteins determine origin activity. Analysis of centrom-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent pattern characteristic of constitutively active origins. This pattern is conserved with centrom position among strains and species, independently of DNA sequence. Inheritance of centrom position is correlated with constitutively active replication that fires early.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analysis of chronic back pain (CB) in 158,025 adults of European ancestry from 15 cohorts in the Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium and the UK Biob interim release. CB cases were defined as those reporting back pain for ≥3 months, while non-cases were included as controls. Each cohort used commercially available arrays followed by imputation. GW used logistic regression models with genetic effects, adjusting for age, sex, study-specific covariates, and population structure. The threshold for genome-wide significance was p<5×10^-8. Suggestive (p<5×10^-7) and genome significant (p<5×^-8) variants were carried forward for replication in 283,752 UKob participants not in the discovery. A genome significant association was found for the intronic variant rs10519 in SOX (OR 1.08, p7.2×10^-10). This was replicated in 50,915 cases (OR 1.06, p.3×10^-11) and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint-analysis (1.07 p.4.5^-19). Suggestive associations were found at three loci in the sample, two of which exceeded genome-wide in joint-analysis: intergenic rs317, between CC26 and GSD (1.05 p4.4^-13) and intronic rs438 in D (0.97 p.2^-10).
Taenia solium cysticosis is a significant zoonosis in developing countries, with neurocystercosis being an important cause of epilepsy in regions where the parasite occurs. However, it is underreported, and there is a lack of data on the disease burden. A study was undertaken to calculate the impact of this zoonosis in Cameroon, using Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) estimations. Parameters were collected and imported into software, with different distributions used according to type of information. Prevalence of epilepsy was 3.6%, estimating 50,326 (95%CI 37,299-65,924) people with neurocystercosis-associated epilepsy, 1.0% of population, and 15,961 (95%CI 12,320-20,044) pigs with cysticosis, 5.6% of pig population. Annual costs in Cameroon were 10,255,202 (95%CI 6,889,048-14,754,044), 4.7% losses in pig husbandry, 95.3 direct and indirect. Monetary per case 194 (95CI 147-253). Average DALs lost 9.0 per thousand per year (95CI 2.8-20.4). This study estimates costs using country-specific parameters, human and animal burden of zoon disease. Comparison with South Africa indicates salaries influence monetary burden. Knowing salary and prevalence allows rapid indication of total cost. Additional studies could estimate global burden. Estimated DALs higher than other neglected diseases.
Researchers have identified a non-coding RNA in Staphylococcus aureus, designated as Rsa, which plays a crucial role in regulating the bacterium's persistence and virulence. Rsa contains a C-rich sequence, suggesting it functions at the post-transcriptional level. The study found that Rsa represses the synthesis of the global transcriptional regulator Mgr by forming a duplex with the Shine-Dalg sequence and loop interaction within the target mRNA's coding region. These interactions are necessary for repression, leading to increased biofilm production and decreased capsule synthesis in various strains. This results in reduced susceptibility to phagocytic killing by polymonuclear leukocytes compared to strains lacking Rsa. In animal models, Rsa reduced the severity of acute infections and enhanced chronic catheter infections. R is part of a regulatory network influencing S interactions with the host, moderating invasiveness and chronic infections. This is the first example of a conserved RNA in S functioning as a virulence suppressor of acute infections. S aureus is a human commensal, suggesting R has evolved to support commensal and saprophytic interactions with the host.
Researchers have developed a novel method to visualize the process of HIV-1 uncoating, a critical step in the virus's entry into host cells, using a fluorescently tagged form of a capsid-binding protein cyclophilin A (Cyp-DRed). This protein is packaged into virions through high-affinity binding to the capsid (CA) and remains associated with cores after membrane permeabilization. In vitro and in living cells, Cyp-D and CA are lost concomitantly from cores. The rate of loss is modulated by core stability and accelerated upon reverse transcription initiation. Single particle tracking reveals that most cores lose C-D shortly after fusion, while a small fraction remains intact for several hours. Late post-infection single particle tracking shows gradual C-D loss dependent on reverse transcription. Unating occurs in cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane.
Researchers investigated the relationship between oligonucleotide usage and various properties in archaeal and bacterial genomes, including codon usage, DNA base stacking, and DNA structure. They analyzed oligonucleotide frequencies in coding and non-coding regions to assess the statistical potential of different DNA word sizes and how oligonucle frequencies differ. The study found that prokotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucle frequencies, indicating prootic DNA is short-range correlated, with information encoded in oligonucle. Oligonucle usage varied more in AT-rich and host-associated genomes than GC-rich freeiving genomes, mainly in nonoding regions. Bias in tetranucle usage correlated with GC content, coding regions more biased than nonoding. Nonoding regions were 5.5% more AT-rich than coding, on average, in 402 chromosomes. Pronounced compositional differences were found within and between AT-rich GC genomes. GC genomes were similar in tetranucle usage nonoding than AT genomes. Differences between AT-rich GC may be attributed lifestyle, tetran usage host-associated more dissimilar less freeiving.
Meiotic recombination is a critical process that ensures the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to genetic diversity through large-scale reciprocal crossovers and localized gene conversion events, also known as nonrosso. While factors such as PRDM9 and SNP variants influence recombination initiation at hotspots, little is known about factors acting downstream. This study analyzed both types of recombinant molecules in sperm at six active hotspots and identified disparity in allelic variants indicative of cis-acting influences. Two hotspots showed a novel biased transmission exclusive to noncrosso recombinants, arising from differences between crosso and nonrosso heterodup formation and mismatch repair. This biased conversion does not influence hotspot activity as SNPs do, but constitutes a previously undetected source of recombination-driven meiotic drive, potentially affecting thousands of hotspots genome-wide. Interestingly, both hotspots favor (G/C) over (A) pairs, consistent with established correlations between GC content and recombination in mammalian genomes.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive protein-protein network that integrates toxicology and systems biology to better understand the molecular mechanisms of environmental chemicals and drugs on human health. This computational model reveals uncharacterized connections between compounds and diseases, enabling the prediction of potential health risks associated with exposure. The network can also identify unexpected associations between chemicals and proteins. 

The model was applied to chemicals linked to breast cancer, lung cancer, and necrosis, and identified potential targets for diethylhexylphthalate, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloribenzo-dioxin, pirix acid, and permethrin. Associations were supported by recent studies, demonstrating the power of integrating toxicogenomics with other data.
Researchers have re-examined the receptive fields of primary auditory cortical neurons by fitting a nonlinear feedforward network model to their responses to natural sounds. This approach reveals that these neurons are sensitive to a broader range of spectrotemporal features than their standard spectrotemporal receptive fields suggest. A parsimonious network of 1-7 sub-receptive fields, interacting nonlinearly, better predicts neural responses to auditory stimuli than standard receptive fields. The network field consists of separate excitatory and inhibitory subfields with distinct properties, and their interaction gives rise to operations such as gain control and conjunctive detection. Conjunct effects, where neurons respond to specific features together, enhance selectivity for complex spectrotemp structures and may be crucial in sound recognition.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for casein kinase 2 (CK2)-mediated phosphorylation of BMAL1 (BMAL-P) in regulating the mammalian circadian clock. Using a novel CK2-targeting peptide, they demonstrated that CK2 phosphorylates BM1 at serine 90 (S90) in central and peripheral clocks. Further analysis revealed a novel function of RY as a repressor kinase. Co-immunoprecipitation and real-time monitoring of protein-protein interactions showed that RY-mediated binding of CK2 to BM1 inhibits BM1-S90 phosphorylation by CKα. The FAD domain of R1, C-terminal BM1 domains, and BM1-lysine 537 acetylation/deacetylation by CLOCK/SIRT were critical for RY-mediated BM1-CKβ binding. Conversely, BM1-S90 phosphorylation is necessary for BM1lys 537 acetylation. The study proposes a negative feedback model where RY-dependent CK-driven post-translational BM1-P1-BM1 loop is integral to the core oscillator.
Salmonella enterica, a bacterium, adapts to survive in the presence of bile by employing multiple mechanisms to counteract its antibacterial activity. Bile salts disrupt cell membranes, denature proteins, and damage DNA, but the bacterium adapts to lethal concentrations of sodium deoxycholate (DOC) bile. Adaptation involves changes in gene expression, including upregulation of the Rpo-dependent stress response and other stress responses. The general stress response is crucial for adaptation, as Rpo mutants are sensitive to bile. Adaptation is a population-level response, but individual cells can become resistant without adaptation. Non-adapted Salmonella cultures plated on lethal bile-containing medium yield resistant colonies at frequencies of 10^-6 to 10^-7 per generation. Fluctuation analysis shows these derive from pre-existing resistant cells. A fraction of isolates are stable, indicating resistance can be acquired through mutation. Genome sequencing of resistant mutants reveals lipopolysaccharide transport alterations as a common cause of mutational resistance. However, lethal bile selection also yields non-mutant isolates. These likely derive from cells in a physiological state permitting survival upon bile encounter. Single-cell analysis of gene expression supports this, as Salmonella cultures activate stress genes in DOC absence. This highlights phenotypic heterogeneity in bacterial populations and adaptive value of gene fluctuations.
The E. coli chromosome is organized into 400-500 supercoiled domains through both active and passive mechanisms, such as transcription and DNA-protein association. Prophage Mu is organized as a stable domain bounded by its termini L and R, which are 37 kbp apart on the genome. The formation and maintenance of the Mu domain is dependent on a gyrase site (SGS) at the center of Mu, Mu end MuB protein, and E. coli proteins IHF, F, and H. The domain was observed at two chromosomal locations. In contrast, prophage λ does not form an independent domain. The establishment and maintenance of the Mu domain is promoted by low-level transcription from phage promoters, one of which is domain-dependent. The domain confers transposition readiness to Mu by topological requirements of reaction and proximity of ends. The benefits the host from a subset proteins expressed by prophage may help its long-term stability.
Primaquine (PQ) is the only licensed antimalarial that prevents Plasmodium vivax (Pv) relapses and clears Plasium falciparum (Pf) gamocytes, reducing post-treatment transmission. A randomized treatment-to-infection cohort study in Papua New Guine children investigated Pv and Pf gamocyte carriage after radical cure. Children received radical cure with Chloroquine, Artemether-Lumeftrine plus PQ or placebo. Blood samples were collected 2-4 weekly over 8 months. Gamocytes were detected by reverse transcriptionPCR targeting pvs and pfs. PQ reduced Pv gamocyte incidence by 73%, comparable to PQ effect on blood-stage infections. 92% Pv and 79% Pf gamocyte infections were asymptomatic. Pv gamocyte and Pf positivity density were associated with high-stage parasite densities. Multivariate analysis showed reduced gamocytes in mixed-species compared single-species for both Pv and Pf (ORv 0.39 [0.25-0.62], Pf 0.33 [0.18-0.60], p<0.001). No difference between PQ and placebo arms was observed in Pv gamocyte density or Pv infections carrying gamocytes. First-stage infections after placebo likely caused relapse hypnoite were gamet likely than PQ first after infective bite. Pv relapses and new infections had similar gametemia. Relapses contribute to Pv reservoir highlighting anti-hypnoite treatment for control.
Researchers have investigated the role of Rho family GTPases in cellular processes such as migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis, which involve actin remodeling. The primary members of this family, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, have distinct effects on actin reorganization, but share a common mechanism of targeting the plasma membrane and activation by GTP binding. A computational framework was developed to analyze experimental data on GTP cycling between the membrane and cytosol, revealing details of GDI-mediated cycling and distinguishing between GDI-dependent and -independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and dissociation of Gase with membrane molecules. Analysis of Rac membrane cycling showed lower affinity of G for RacGTP compared to RacDP due to faster dissociation from the membrane. Non-steady-state solutions for membrane fraction Gase were presented in multidimensional charts. This methodology was applied to glucose-stimulated cycling in pancreatic β-cells, illustrating effects of Gs/Gs and affinities between Gases and membrane/GDI on bound GTP. Similar charts were used to assess targeted modifications compensating Gase-G balance in disease scenarios.
Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programmes for schistosomiasis collect data to assess the impact of interventions and progress towards World Health Organization (WHO) goals for morbidity control and elimination as a public health problem. Typically, prevalence and intensity data are collected from school-aged children (SAC) as they are easy to sample and likely to be infected with schosome parasites. However, adults are also likely infected. This study investigates how the age distribution of infection impacts mathematical recommendations for preventive chemotherapy levels to achieve WHO goals using three different intensity profiles of Schistoma mansoni infection: low, moderate, and high burdens in adults. Results show that in moderate prevalence regions, regardless of adult burden, treating SAC may achieve WHO goals. In high prevalence regions with high adult burden, adult treatment is required to meet goals. Optimal strategy for a region requires consideration of adult burden, not solely based on SAC prevalence. Past epidemiological data informed models for schosome transmission control, but more detailed data from M&E are needed to determine optimal strategy. Collecting prevalence and intensity from broader age range, including adults at baseline and throughout treatment, rather than SAC, is crucial for accurate strategy. Additional data, such as individual adherence, should be collected in M&E.
Researchers developed a computational model of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) using structural connectivity data from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 22 individuals with TLE and 39 healthy controls. The model was validated by comparing patient-control differences in seizure onset time and location. The study investigated the model's potential for predicting surgery by simulating resections and comparing post-surgery to pre-surgery seizure likelihood. Results showed that patients transitioned from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls. Regions in the left hemisphere, particularly temporal and subcortical, were frequent seizure starting points in patients. Contralateral frontal regions implicated in seizure spreading or resistance. The model predicted patient-specific resection areas led to better outcomes than routine clinical procedure.
Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) employs various strategies to evade the host's innate antiviral defenses, including interference with interferon and apoptotic signaling pathways. Four viral interferon regulatory factors (vIRFs 1-4) function in a dominant-negative manner to block cellular IR activities and target IRF-induced proteins such as p53 and TGF-β-activated Smad transcription factors. This study identifies vIR-1's direct targeting of Bim, a pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, to its inactivation via nuclear translocation. Immunofluorescence and western analysis of fractionated cell extracts revealed vIR-1-mediated localization of Bim in infected cells. Co-localization of vIR-1 and B was detected in nuclei of lytically infected endothelial cells. Co-precipitation assays using purified v-1 and B revealed a direct interaction between the proteins. B-binding residues of v-1 were mapped by deletion and mutagenesis. Generation of B-refactory v-1 variants demonstrated the importance of v-1:B interaction in prolication and anti-apopt activity. Blocking the interaction with a cell-perme peptide corresponding to the B-binding region of v- confirmed the relevance v-1:B association to v- prolication. This is the first report of an IR protein interacting with a B-2 family member and sequestration of B or any member as a means of inactivation. The study reveals a novel mechanism used by a virus to control replication-induced apoptosis and targeting v-1:B interaction may provide an antiral strategy.
Epithelial Integrin Regulates the Amplitude of Protective Lung Interfer Responses against Respiratory Pathogens

The lung maintains a state of immune readiness to rapidly respond to injury, with integrins playing a crucial role in setting this state. Epithelial-restricted αβ integrin, specifically, is upregulated during injury and modulates acute lung injury (ALI). Research reveals that upregulation of αβ during influenza infection is involved in disease pathogenesis. Mice lacking β (β KO) exhibit increased survival during infection due to limited viral spread into alveolar spaces, resulting in reduced ALI. Despite normal lung morphology, β KO mice harbor constitutively activated CD11+ alolar macrophages (AM) and elevated type IFN activity, attributed to loss of β-activated growth factor (TGF). Administration of exogenous TGF to β KO mice reduces CD11+ AM, type IF activity, and protective phenotype during infection. Protection extends to other pathogens Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia. Studies demonstrate loss of epithelial protein αβ integrin alters lung microenvironment during homeostasis and infection, reducing injury and improving survival.
Researchers conducted a retrospective analysis of 733 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis at a reference center in Argentina from 2006-2015 to evaluate the usefulness of the Leishman Skin Test (LST) as a diagnostic tool. Leishmania Viannia braziliensis is the most common species causing cutaneous and mucosal leishiasis in the Americas. Diagnosis is typically based on identifying amastigotes in lesions, but this is limited by low parasite burden. ST is a delayed hypersensitivity test to Leish antigens injected intradermally, used in endemic areas as a complement to diagnosis. The analysis included 93% localized cutaneous, 7% mucosal, and <1% disseminated cases. Confirmation was reached in 65% through smears from skin or muc lesions, with only 6 having negative ST. Among negative smear cases, 190 were also negative ST, but 69 ST positive. Sensitivity ratios between smear and ST were similar across age groups. Lesions >21 days old correlated with positive results for both smear and ST significantly more than younger. These findings support ST as a diagnostic complement for cutaneous leishias across age groups in endemic areas. Correlation with smear was high. Standardization and research into protocols will aid management of suspicious cases.
Genome-wide association studies have identified over 40 loci associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, but the mechanisms underlying most of these loci remain unknown. Recent studies suggest that many GWAS variants influence disease through altered transcriptional regulation in disease-relevant cell types. This study investigated transcriptional changes during a key CAD pathophysiological event, the lipid-induced transformation of macrophages to lipid-laden foam cells. A combination of chromatin mapping with formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FA-seq) and enhancer transcription mapping using chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) was used in primary macrophages before and after exposure to atherogenic oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLD), resulting in foam cell formation. Oxid-induced cell formation was associated with changes in a subset of chromatin and enhancers that correlated with expression of nearby genes. Ox-regulated enhancers were enriched for transcription factors, including CEB-beta, previously uninvolved in foam formation. Ox exposure upregulated CEB expression and increased genomic binding, most around genes in inflammatory pathways. Variants at CAD loci were enriched in subset chrom sites altered by ox exposure, including rs643 in ox-induced enhancer at PP2 locus. Ox increased CEB binding to site and C binding and enhancer activity were stronger with protective allele rs643. Additionally, PP2 protein product L3 was present in human atherosclerotic plaques and ox exposure upregulated L3 in macrophages, increasing pro-inflammatory mediators.
A study was conducted in Malawi to evaluate the effectiveness of a single round of azithromycin mass drug administration (MDA) in districts with trachoma follicular inflammation (TF) prevalence of 5.0-9.9% in children aged 1-9 years. The World Health Organization recommends three rounds of azithycin treatment in districts with TF prevalence ≥10%, but this may not be practical due to the large number of endemic districts and resource constraints. In 8 Malawi districts with baseline TF prevalence of 5.0-9%, a single round of azithycin was administered to the entire district, achieving 80% coverage. Population-based trach surveys were conducted in 18 evaluation units of the treated districts 6 months post-MDA, using standardized methodologies conforming to WHO recommendations. Each evaluation unit had TF prevalence <5.0%. The study found that in Malawi districts with TF 5.0-9%, one round of azithycin MDA with 80% coverage resulted in TF prevalence <5%.
Arabidopsis thaliana NLR immune signaling is mediated by Ca2+-dependent protein kinases. Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) protein complexes sense infections and trigger immune responses in plants. Activation of plant resistance (R) proteins by pathogen effectors launches convergent immune responses, including programmed cell death (PCD), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and transcriptional reprogramming. Functional genomic and biochemical screens identified six Arabidopsis Ca2-dependent kinases (CPs) mediating bifurcate immune responses by NLR proteins R2 and RPM1. Dynamics of CP2 activation by pathogen effect controls cell death onset. Sustained CP4/5/6 activation phosphorylates WR transcription factors WRKY28/48, regulating transcriptional reprogramming for N-dependent pathogen restriction. CP2/4/11 phosphorylate plasma membrane NAD oxidases for ROS production.
Researchers conducted a retrospective study on the time-series forecasting of Schistosoma haematium in the district of Nion, Mali, from 1996 to 2004. The study aimed to develop a parsimonious forecasting system for public health programs in developing countries to manage parasitic diseases. Generalized exponential smoothing methods, encapsulated in a state-space framework, were used to accommodate seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations in the time-series. Results showed mean absolute error values of 25% for 1-5 month forecasts. The state-space framework produced accurate forecasts for Schos haematium-induced hematuria incidence, capturing non-linear interactions between disease dynamics and exogenous covariates such as climate, irrigation, and health interventions. This method obviated the need for more complex forecasting methods in the district. The study suggests the framework can assist in managing and assessing Sch haemat transmission and intervention impact in the district, and potentially in the Sahel region.
Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has evolved a mechanism to restrict its replication in host cells by utilizing the tegument protein pp150, which binds to cyclin A and prevents viral gene expression during the S/G2 cell cycle phase in permissive cells. To investigate the physiological relevance of this restriction during productive CMV infection, a cyclin-binding deficient pp150 mutant virus was employed. Unrestricted viral expression in S2 led to G2 arrest, but not mitotic cells supported viral replication. Cyclin destabilization by viral product p21 was required to maintain permissive G2 arrest. An HCM double mutant with both pp and p21 disabled in cyclin interaction forced mitotic entry of infected cells, severely impacting cell and virus growth viability.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive degeneration of motor neurons, leading to paralysis and death. Approximately 10% of ALS cases are familial, with the remaining 90% being sporadic. Genetic studies in familial ALS have identified causative mutations, with some mutations also linked to sporadic cases. However, the cause of 30% familial and most sporadic cases remains unknown. Sporadic ALS represents an underutilized resource for genetic information. A targeted sequencing of 169 ALS candidate genes in 242 sporadic cases and 129 controls was conducted to identify novel variants linked to ALS. A significant enrichment of novel and rare variants in cases versus controls was found, indicating disease association. This study demonstrates the utility of next-generation sequencing with functional and rare variant analysis to elucidate sporadic disease etiology.
Researchers investigated the role of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the development of T cell memory to influenza virus. IL-6 is a cytokine that regulates T cell proliferation and survival, and its levels increase after influenza infection. The study compared virus-specific T cell activity in wild-type and IL-6 deficient mice. The results show that IL-6 is crucial for CD4+ but not CD8 T cell memory to influenza. IL-6 suppresses CD4+CD25+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, limiting their activity and facilitating virus-specific CD4 T cells. Influenza-induced IL-6 reduces virus-specific Tregs, allowing virus-specific CD4 cells to function. This suggests IL-6 ensures that during acute infection, antigen-specific Tregs do not downregulate the immune response, promoting pathogen clearance and host survival.
Researchers have identified a new function for the enzyme enolase in the parasite Entamoeba histolytica, a glycolytic enzyme that converts 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenpyruate. Enase was found to have both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in the parasite and was shown to interact with the Dmt2 protein, a DNA and RNA methyltransferase. This interaction was discovered through a yeast two-hybrid screen. Enase was found to inhibit Dmt activity, and this inhibitory effect was antagonized by 2-P, suggesting that glucose metabolism controls enase's non-glytic function. Glucose starvation caused enase to accumulate in the nucleus, leading to the formation of an enase-E histtica DN2 homolog (Ehm) complex and a reduction in tRNA methylation in the parasite. The role of enase as a Dmt inhibitor was also demonstrated in E histolytica expressing a nuclear localization signal (LS)-enase. These findings establish enase as the first Dmt interacting protein and reveal an unexpected role for a glyytic enzyme in modulating Dmt activity.
Researchers have identified microRNAs (miRNAs) in the saliva of mosquitoes for the first time, which play a crucial role in the transmission of Chikungunya virus (CHV) infection. Mosquito saliva is a complex mixture of secretions that modulate the feeding process to enhance pathogen establishment. Previous studies have identified salivary proteins that enhance pathogen infection. The study used next-generation sequencing to identify 103 exogenous miRNAs in mosquito saliva, 31 of which were novel. Several miRNAs were expressed only in CHV-infected mosquitoes. Five miRNAs were tested for their potential to regulate CHV infection, demonstrating a functional role in transmission and establishment during feeding on the host.
Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes proteins essential for cellular respiration and deletions in the genome have been linked to maternally inherited diseases and cancers. Most deletions in human cells are flanked by short repetitive sequences, suggesting recombination events. This study investigated the role of double-strand break (DS) repair proteins Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59 in mtDNA repair in Saccharces cerevisiae. Rad51 and Rad59 were localized to the mitochondria and Rad51 bound directly to mtDNA. A mitochondally-targeted restriction endonuc (mt-KI) was used to create a double-strand break (DSB) in the genome, allowing analysis of DSB repair in vivo. Loss of these proteins decreased spontaneous deletions and loss of Rad51 and Rad impaired mtDSB repair.
A systematic review examined the role of social determinants of health in the risk and prevention of Group A Streptoccal infection, acute rheumatic fever, and rheumatic heart disease. Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) poses a significant burden among disadvantaged populations, resulting from acute rheumatic fever (AR), a complication of Group A Streptoc (GAS) infection. The study aimed to determine the association between social determinants of health and GAS, AR, and RHD, and the effect of interventions targeting these. A systematic review of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases included observational and experimental studies measuring crowding, dwelling, characteristics, education, employment, income, socioeconomic status, and their relationship with GAS, AR, or RHD. 1,164 publications were identified, 90 met criteria, comprising 91 studies, 49.5% were poor quality. The proportion of studies reporting associations between socioeconomic determinants and risk of GAS was 57.1%, AR/RHD 50%. Crow was most assessed (14 studies GAS, 36 AR/RHD) followed by socioeconomic (6, 36). Studies assessing crow, dwelling, characteristics, education, employment, parents, nutrition reported positive association risk GAS, AR/RHD. Crow, socioeconomic met criteria causal association. Heterogeneity across all aspects. Literature examining social determinants lacks quality, mostly observational, not interventional. Crow cause GAS, AR/RHD presents prevention target.
A single mutation in the phosphatase activity of the sensor kinase Pho in the Pho/Pho bacterial signaling network results in a striking change in phenotype. The mutant responds to stimuli in a bistable manner, whereas the wild-type exhibits a graded response. Mutant cells exhibit distinct morphologies in on and off states, with the state being inherited over generations. External conditions that repress signaling in the wild-type drive the mutant to the on state. Mathematical modeling suggests bistability is due to positive autoregulation of Pho and PhQ. The mutant state has lower fitness in stationary cultures in rich medium, but due to inheritance, a population can be epigenetically trapped in a low-fitness state.
Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri, is a rare but potentially life-threatening infection with a high mortality rate and limited treatment options. Due to the lack of economic incentives for pharmaceutical companies to develop anti-AM drugs, research relies on drug repurposing, applying known treatments for rare diseases. N. fleri requires ergosterol, a plasma membrane component, and disrupting sterol biosynthesis is a validated strategy against fungal pathogens. The N. fleri genome encodes sterol-demethylase CYP51, sharing 35% sequence identity with fungal orthologs, suggesting repurposing antifungal drugs. This study assessed the impact of antifungal azoles, conazoles, on N. fleri sterol biosynthesis and viability, identified the endogenous C51 substrate by mass spectrometry, and analyzed interactions between recombinant C51 and conoles. Results validated C51 as a druggable target in N. fleri and conazoles as candidates for AM treatment.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4α) in the maintenance and recall of protective immunity against nematode infection. Nematodes trigger a type 2 immune response via IL-4α, but its role in maintaining this response after polarization was unknown. A mouse model with temporally controlled IL-4α deletion was used to determine its function. Sustained IL-4α expression was required for maintaining type 2 responses and protective immunity after Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection. Temporal deletion of IL-4α before secondary infection with N. brasiliensis showed efficient recall type 2 responses and parasite clearance. This study demonstrates sustained IL-4α signaling is necessary for anti-nemat type 2 immunity, a novel function distinct from its role in polarization.
A global analysis of the distribution of Bartonella bacteria in mammals reveals the impact of human activity on disease risk for humans, commensal animals, and wildlife. The study examined the largest collection of Bartonella glA genotypes, including 67 new genotypes, to understand the evolution and transmission patterns of this pathogenic genus. Results indicate that Bartonella likely originated as an environmental bacterium infecting insects before transitioning to mammals. Rodents and domestic animals serve as reservoirs or primary hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans. The study also found evidence of Bartonella exchange between phylogenetically distant domestic and wildlife animals due to increased contact.
Long noncoding RNA MALAT plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle progression by modulating the expression of oncogenic transcription factor BMYB. MALAT is upregulated in cancer tissues and associated with hyperproliferation, but its underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis in human diploid fibroblasts reveals MALAT modulates expression of cell cycle genes required for G1 and mitotic progression. Depletion of MALAT leads to activation of p53 and its target genes. Cell cycle defects in MALAT-depleted cells are sensitive to p53 levels, indicating p53 is major mediator of MALAT activity. MALAT-depleted cells display reduced expression of BMYB, oncogenic factor in G progression due to altered splicing of BMY preRNA and aberrant splicing. In cells, MALAT promotes proliferation by modulating expression and preRNA of cycle transcription factors.
Juvenile hormone (JH), a sesquiterpen produced by the corpora all, plays a crucial role in coordinating insect growth, metamorphosis, and reproduction. While J's action in repressing larval metamosis has been well studied, the molecular basis of J in promoting adult reproduction has not been fully elucidated. Methop-toler (Met), the J receptor, has been shown to mediate J action during metamosis as well as vitelogenesis, but the precise mechanism underlying the latter has been lacking. Researchers used RNA interference (RNAi) to phenocopy J-deprived in migratory locusts, demonstrating that J stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in preparation for vitelogenesis. Mc4 and Mc7, genes in the DNA replication pathway were expressed in presence of J and Met. Depletion of Mc or Mc inhibited de novo synthesis and polloid, resulting in reduction of vitelin mRNA as well as impaired oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility assays showed Met directly regulates Mc and Mc by binding upstream sequences with E-box or E-like motifs. The study suggests J-receptor acts on Mc and Mc to regulate replication and ploidy vitelogenesis and oocyte maturation.
A randomized controlled trial, the "Treatment of Early Neuropathy in Lepros" (TENL), investigated the effectiveness of 20-week versus 32-week prednisone treatment in patients with recent nerve function impairment (NFI) due to leprosy. The study included 868 patients, 429 in the 20-week arm and 439 in the 32-week arm, who received prednisone at 45-60mg/day based on body weight, tapered over 20 or 32 weeks. Nerve function was assessed by muscle testing and monofilament at baseline and week 78. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with improved or restored function at week 78. Secondary outcomes included Reaction Scale, SAL Scale, Participation Scale, and Serious Adverse Events. At week 78, the proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function did not differ between groups: 78.1% in 20-week and 77.5 in 32-week (p=0.821). No differences were found in secondary outcomes, except a higher Serious Adverse Events in the 32-week arm. A 20-week predone course was as effective as 32-week in improving and restoring NFI in lepro patients. Twenty weeks is the preferred initial duration for lepro neuropathy, with a minority requiring individualized treatment.
Researchers studied the vocalizations of male Rocky Mountain elk (Cervus elus nelsoni) and European Red Deer (Cervus elus scus) to understand how sound production relates to anatomy and physiology. A finite element model of the larynx and wave model of vocal tract, based on elk morphology and biomechanics, simulated sound production. The model produced a wide range of fundamental frequencies. Low frequencies required low vocal fold strain, high lung pressure, and glottal flow for sound levels over 70 dB at 10m. High-frequency bugles needed large muscular strain, high pressure, and 10 dB more intensity. Glottal efficiency, ratio of radiated power to aerodynamic at glott, was higher in elk, suggesting high-pitched signaling advantage. This was due to lower aerodynamic power and acoustic radiation at higher frequencies. Both types were used by males during mating, serving as honest signals. Low-frequency (Red call) related to body size, high-frequency (bugle) to muscular endurance.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-through sequencing (ChIP-seq) data, a technique used to map transcription factor binding sites and chromatin modifications, by incorporating reads that map to multiple locations on the genome (multi-reads). Current methods using only uniquely mapping reads (uni-reads) can miss up to 30% of alignable reads. The new approach allocates multi-reads as fractional counts using a weighted scheme. Using STAT1 and GATA1 IP-seq datasets, the incorporation of multi-reads increases sequencing depth, detects novel peaks not identifiable by uni-reads, and improves peak detection in mappable regions. Genome-wide characteristics of peaks detected by multi-reads are similar to uni-read, except most reside in segmental duplications. Validation of GATA multi-read peaks by quantitative ChIP confirms novel targets. The study demonstrates multi-read importance for transcription factor binding in repetitive regions with IPq experiments.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has set targets to control or eliminate four neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) by 2020, including African trypanosomiasis, lepro, visceral leishmanias, and Chagas disease, through innovative and intensified management (IDM). A study estimated the socioeconomic benefits of achieving these targets by analyzing productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments (OPPs) related to these diseases, combined with projections of people affected individuals and countries from 2011-2020 and 202-203. The study compared an ideal scenario where WHO targets are met with a counterfactual scenario assuming no change from 1990. Economic benefits were calculated as the difference between scenarios, discounted at 3% from 2010. Probabilistic analyses quantified uncertainty around the base estimate. The global productivity gain for IDM-NTs was $23.1 (15.9-34) billion in 201-202 and $35.9 (25-51.9) in 202-203, corresponding to $10.7 (7.4-15.7) and $16.6 (11-24) in OPP reduction. The study faced limitations, including no data for lepro, combining data from various sources with heterogeneous quality. Despite this, the benefits of achieving targets are considerable, exceeding investments by endemic governments and partners. The frequency of NTDs among the poorest households makes these investments valuable for improving well-being and reducing inequity.
In the auditory cortex, the relationship between neuronal selectivity and population coding accuracy has been widely accepted as neurons with higher selectivity carrying more information about sensory inputs. However, this notion is challenged by a study that found population conveys similar information about sound across two response epochs, despite selectivity differences. Initially, neurons respond to a broad range of inputs, then become highly selective in sustained response. The prevailing theory suggests first epoch encodes presence, second encodes content. Contrary to this, population conveys similar information in both epochs. The amount of encoded is dependent on total population spikes in read window. Inhomogeneous Poisson spiking accounts for this property.
Researchers investigated the role of the co-stimulatory molecule O40 (CD134) in controlling persistent viral infections. Unlike acute viral infections, where the pathogen is cleared by anti-viral T cells, chronic infections require sustained T responses to control replication and prevent spread. While inhibitory signals, such as PD-1, are known to limit T activity, little is understood about stimulatory signals that maintain antiiral cells. O40 was found to be critical in controlling LCMV 13 infection. Antiiral cells expressed high levels of O40 in the presence of cognate antigen, while cells lacking O40 receptor failed to accumulate. Germinal center T responses and LV-specific antibodies were severely impaired in O-deficient mice. Consequently, these mice failed to control LV 13 over time, highlighting the importance of this pathway in persistent infection.
Convergent Evolution of Mechanically Optimal Locomotion in Aquatic Invertebrates Vertebrates

Convergent evolution of mechanically optimal locomotion in aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates refers to the independent evolution of similar traits in different species despite the absence of the trait in their common ancestor. This phenomenon is observed in cases such as the wing and camera-type eye in vertebrates and invertebrates. However, instances of convergent evolution of locomotory patterns that quantitatively agree with mechanically optimal solutions are rare. A study on a diverse group of aquatic animals reveals that a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in vertebrate and inverte swimmers across three phyla.

The study measures the length of undulation along an animal's fin during swimming and divides it by the mean amplitude of undulations along the fin, resulting in a consistently around 20. This value is called the optimal wavelength (OS). The OS maximizes the force generated by the body, also maximizing swimming speed. A mechanical basis for this optimality is hypothesized and reasons for its repeated emergence through evolution are suggested.
Researchers investigated the role of condens, a class of evolutionarily conserved protein complexes, in neural stem cell (NS) divisions during cerebral cortex development. They found that two types of condens complexes, condens I and II, are essential for NS survival in mice. Simultaneous depletion of both condens leads to severe chromosome assembly and segregation defects, causing DNA damage and p53-induced apoptosis. Individual depletion of condens I or II results in slower loss of NS, with distinct mitotic defects: chromosome missegregation in condin II-depleted NS and mitotic delays in condin I-depleted NS. NS depleted of condin II display hyperclustering pericentric heterochatin and nucleoli, indicating condin II's role in interphase architecture. These defects persist in postmitotic neurons.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms of sex determination and differentiation in Schistosoma mansoni, a species of hermaphroditic trematode with gonochorism. The parasite's sex is determined by a female heterogetic system, but phenotypic sexual dimorphism appears only after infection of the vertebrate host. The study analyzed the transcriptome of S. mansoni in a stage and sex-comparative manner, performing RNA-seq on males and females at five developmental stages: cercaria, larvae, three schistosulum stages, and adults. A total of 7,168 genes were differentially expressed between sexes in at least one stage, with 4,065 functionally annotated. Transcript data were complemented with H3K27me3 histone modification analysis using ChIP-seq before (cercaria) and after (adults) phenotyp sexual dimorphism. The study identified candidate determinants of sexual differentiation, sex-based players of interaction with vertebrate host, and dynamic of H3K27me3 histone mark between sexes as illustration of sex-based epigen landscapes. Results show sexual differentiation in S. mans is accompanied by distinct male and female transcription landscapes of host-parasite cros, genetic determinants and epigen regulators. This combination could lead to sexual dimorphism of parasitic species. S. mans is pathogenic for humans, this study provides therapeutic targets, data on parasite interaction with vertebrate and reproductive function.
Researchers have developed an approach to address disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts by assigning a confidence value to each annotation, representing the probability of correctness. This confidence level is calculated based on individual annotator-specific parameters estimated from data. Two probabilistic models were created to perform this analysis, and their performance was compared through simulation and testing on a dataset generated by human annotators for this study. Results show that even when all annotators disagree, this approach significantly increases the probability of selecting the correct annotation. A corpus of 10,000 sentences was annotated by eight experts, with a 1,000 further annotated by five, representing a specialized curation task. However, the modeling is applicable to most annotation studies.
Researchers have developed a DNA vaccine platform using geese to produce antiviral biologics, specifically polyclonal neutralizing antibodies, to protect against hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS), a deadly disease caused by Andes virus (AND) and AND-like viruses in South America. The availability of convalescent plasma from survivors is limited, prompting the exploration of alternative treatments. Geese were vaccinated with a DNA vaccine encoding AND virus envelope glycoproteins, resulting in high levels of neutralizing antibodies after the second vaccination and maintained over a year. A booster vaccination led to exceptionally high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Analysis of the antibodies showed high reactivity to specific amino sequences of AND envelope glycoprote. The protective efficacy of goose-derived antibodies was tested in a hamster model of lethal HPS, where sera or Ig/IgFc from vaccinated geese were passively transferred subcutaneously 5 days after challenge with AND (25LD50). Both immune sera and egg-purified Ig/IgFc protected 8/8 and 7/8 hamsters, respectively. In contrast, hamsters receiving IgFc from non-vaccinated ge or no-treatment developed HPS. This demonstrates the DNA/goose platform can produce a candidate antiral product preventing lethal disease post-exposure.
Changes in DNA methylation patterns have been implicated in the development of human cancers. The Dn3 enzyme is crucial for establishing normal methylation patterns, and mutations in D3 have been linked to leukemias. Deletion of D3 in a K-ras-dependent lung cancer model promoted tumor progression, suggesting it may suppress cancer by stabilizing DNA methylation. This study used whole-genome bisulf sequencing to characterize methylomes of D3 wildtype and D3-deficient lung tumors. Results showed profound methylation changes in K-r-induced lung cancer. D3 wild-type tumors had large hypomethyl domains corresponding to lamina-associated regions. In contrast, D-deficient tumors had uniformly hypomethyl genome. Further analysis revealed D is required for efficient methylation of active chromosome domains and D-deficient showed moderate deregulation in these domains.
Researchers have identified mesoscopic patterns of neural activity in the premotor cortex of songbirds that support the generation of cortical sequences. These sequences of neural activity are found in various vertebrate species and contexts, including the hippocampus of rodents, where they control movement and temporal generation are integral to learned behavior. However, the underlying mechanisms of sequence generation are not well understood. This study describes the spatial and temporal organization of the premotor cortical microcircuit in songbirds that supports sequences of neural activity. Multi-channel electrophysiology and calcium imaging reveal that activity in premotor cortex is correlated at a scale of 100 micrometers. Within this scale, basal ganglia-projecting excitatory neurons, on average, fire at a phase of a 30 Hz rhythm. These results show premotor activity is inhomogeneous in time and space, and a mesoscopic pattern underlies the generation of sequences controlling song.
Researchers investigated the role of evolutionarily conserved genes essential for growth and development in regulating lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. They screened 2,700 genes essential for development and identified 64 that extend lifespan when inactivated post-development. These candidate regulators are conserved from yeast to humans. Classification into functional groups revealed insulin and metabolic pathways, but also enrichment for translation, RNA, and chromatin factors. Many essential inactivations extend lifespan as much as strongest regulators of aging. Early inactivation of these genes caused growth arrest at larval stages, and some arrested live longer than wild-type adults. d-16 is required for survival of arrested larvae, suggesting increased longevity a physiological response to inactivation. Results suggest insulin-signaling plays role in aging regulation at any life stage.
Researchers conducted a forward genetic screen to identify mutations that impair the formation of the epidermis during zebraf fin regeneration. They identified a temperature-sensitive allele of laminin beta 1 (lamba) that blocks fin regeneration. Lamin beta 1, but not its paralog lamin beta 1, is induced in a subset of epithelial cells after amputation and is required to establish a polarized epithelial layer. Expression of morphogenetic factors shha and lef, basolateral positioning of phosphorylated Igf1, patterning of osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone are facilitated by lamin 1. In contrast, lamin 1 is dispensable for juvenile growth, homeostatic tissue, adult maintenance, repair of fins, or renewal of genetically ablated osteoblast. Mutations or transgenic receptor inhibition disrupt lamin 1 expression, linking growth to epithelial maturation during regeneration.
Researchers compared the performance of several linear mixed models (LMM) approaches and software packages, including EMM, GenABEL, FaSTMM, Mendel, GEMMA, and MMM, in a genome-wide association study of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 families with 362 individuals. The study aimed to evaluate the differences between newly-proposed and previously-proposed methods and investigate sensitivity to user-chosen options such as the method and number of SNPs to estimate kinship matrix. The results showed strong concordance between LMM approaches in controlling genome-wide error rate, except for some approaches applied to longitudinal data with repeated measures. LMM results were compared to traditional family-based tests and alternative approaches in MQL, ROADIPS and MAST, showing high correlation between LMM and alternative approaches except transmission-based for SNPs with small or non-existent effects. The study concluded that LMM perform well compared to competing approaches, with choice of implementation based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use rather than power I error.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput screening assay to identify compounds that inhibit the infection of mammalian cells by Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease. A 200-compound library was screened using a recombinant T. cruzi strain expressing β-galactosidase. Three compounds, P1, NT, and CX, were selected for their high activity against T. cruz and low toxicity to host cells in vitro, with IC50 values of 54, 190, and 23 nM, respectively. Each compound has a distinct mechanism of action on intracellular T. cruzi proliferation: CX shows trypanocidal activity, essential for chronic stage treatment, NT has tryostatic effect, and P1 affects division. These compounds also exhibit activity against intracellular T. cruz from Y strain and related species Leishmania major and amazonensis. Characterization of anti-T. cruz activity led to selection of two compounds with IC values 2M, P6 and CX, approximately 100 times lower than current medicines.
Researchers have developed a novel point-of-care diagnostic platform for detecting Brugia parasites in mosquitoes, which is crucial for lymphatic filariasis molecular monitoring. Current methods rely on PCR or real-time PCR detection of Brugia malayi, Brug timori, and Wuchereria bancrofti in vectors, but DNA extraction using silica-based technologies is time-consuming and costly, and testing requires expensive thermal cyclers or real-time instruments. To address this, a rapid NaOH-based DNA extraction method was coupled with a portable, battery-powered PCR and strip-based detection assay. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the backpack PCR platform's feasibility for filarial parasite detection, adaptable to W bancroft and other mosquito-transmitted pathogens. A rapid NaOH extraction method was compared to silica-based DNA extraction from parasite-spiked mosquito pools, showing similar performance. The strip-based assay was compared to real-time PCR and conventional PCR with gel electrophoresis, demonstrating sensitive and specific detection. A miniaturized PCR was compared to laboratory-based cycling, showing potential for point-of-collection use. This platform eliminates reliance on expensive instrumentation without compromising detection sensitivity or specificity, offering an alternative to column-dependent extractions requiring infrastructure. This field-ready system increases molecular monitoring feasibility in B. malayi-endemic areas, and provides a framework for W bancft detection.
Researchers have studied the self-assembly of elastomeric proteins, which are proteins that have evolved independently multiple times to form polymeric structures with elastic properties. These proteins are composed of alternating domains of elastomeric and cross-linking elements, where the former provide elasticity and drive assembly, and the latter stabilize the polymer. Changes in the number and arrangement of these domains impact assembly and mechanical properties. A theoretical study used a model of diffusion-limited aggregation to simulate the self-assembly of rod-like particles with different architectures, generating various aggregates analyzed by graph-theoretic metrics. The results show that the length and number of elastom and cross-link domains significantly affect the morphology and integrity of the polymeric structure. Highly connected polymers were formed from rods with large cross-link elements interspersed with smaller elastom domains. This study provides insights into the evolution of elastom proteins and may be useful for designing new biomaterials with tunable properties.
Researchers have investigated the functions of the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) in the genome of the Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV), a highly lethal zoonotic pathogen. The 5-UTRs were found to lack internal ribosomal entry function, but differentially regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a reporter gene. The 5-UT from the viral polymerase (L) mRNA strongly suppressed translation compared to the beta-actin 5-UT. The L 5-UT contains four upstream AUGs (uAUGs), and ablating each uA enhanced translation of the open reading frame (ORF), most notably in the L5-UT. The uA was sufficient to initiate translation, surrounded by a weak Kozak sequence and suppressed ORF in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions of eIFalpha phosphorylation, the uOR maintained translation of LOR, indicating the u modulates translation in response to cellular stress. A recombinant EBO was generated with the uA mutated to UCG, resulting in a 10-100 fold lower titers than wild-type in Vero A549 cells. The mutant exhibited decreased RNA synthesis as early as 6 post-infection and enhanced sensitivity to thapsargin.
Researchers have developed a method for precise genome-wide mapping of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in human chromosomes, revealing non-random and fragmented DS hotspots. These hotspots are scattered along chromosomes and limited to 50-250 kb DNA domains. Approximately 30% of these domains possess co-expressed genes. PARP1 and HNRPA2B specifically bind DNA sequences at domain termini. The study suggests a novel gene regulation mechanism: coordinated transcriptional silencing of gene clusters by DS hotspots and PAR1/HPA2B binding sites.
Researchers conducted a study in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to investigate the presence of Trypanosomatidae in bats in two areas with different levels of degradation: Reserva Ecológica Guçu (REG) and Estação Florestal Mata Atlântica (EFMA). The study aimed to evaluate the diversity of Trypanomatids in relation to bat diversity and preservation levels in the region. The results showed no influence of preservation level on bat species richness, with 15 species found in REG and 14 in EF, including common fruit-eating species Carollia persillata and Artibe litatus. Of 181 bat specimens analyzed, 24 (13%) were infected, including one Sira individual positive by blood examination. Molecular characterization using PCR targeting 18S rRNA gene showed similar Tryosid infection rates in both areas, 15% in REG and 11 in EF (p=0.46). Trypanosionii was the most detected parasite (54%), followed by T cruzi DTI and TIV and Tryos sp, in Neotropical phlost bats RN63 and RN56; mixed infections Tionii/cruz TIII and dionii/cruzTI were observed. T cruz DTI and IV are genotypes involved in acute Chagas disease in Brazil, and dionii was found in heart tissue of infected child. Crithia mellae, a putative monoxen parasite from insects, infecting vertebrate in Americas, was described for first time.
Ticks are the primary arthropod vectors of human and animal diseases in Europe, with the Ixodes ricinus species transmitting a range of bacteria, viruses, and parasites. This tick species can be co-infected with multiple pathogens, increasing the likelihood of co-transmission to humans or animals. However, data on co-infection prevalence is limited, focusing on well-known pathogens. Ticks also harbor symbionts influencing tick biology and pathogen transmission. This study evaluated the prevalence of 38 pathogens and symbionts, co-infections, and interactions between pathogens and symbion. 267 Ix ricinus females were collected in the Ardennes and analyzed by high-throughput real-time PCR for 37 pathogens, rRT-PCR for Tick-Borne encephalitis virus, and nested PCR for symbion. Results showed 45% co-infection with up to five pathogens. Adding symbion prevalence, all ticks were infected with at least one microorganism, up to eight in one tick. Pathogen interactions suggested association between Borrelia garini and B afii, no symbion-pathogen interaction. This study reveals high co-infection rates in ticks, raising co-transmission concerns to humans, animals, and health consequences. Symbion coexistence with pathogens opens avenues for pathogen transmission research.
Researchers have developed a computational model to understand the hematopoietic eryth-myeloid lineage decision, which is governed by a genetic switch involving the genes PU.1 and GATA-1. Prior to lineage commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels, and the underlying molecular circuitry governing both primed and committed states is crucial for hematopoiesis and developmental systems. The model is based on known interactions between master genes, including mutual antagonism and autoregulation, making the system bistable, a feature for robust lineage determination. A new mechanism involving a cofactor regulated by one of the master genes binds to antagonistic partner is necessary for bistability and switch-like behavior. Suppression of cofactor through external means leads to loss of cooperativity and primed state PU.1 and GATA. The PU.1-GATA switch interacts with another antagonistic pair, FO-G, inheriting state of upstream genes and reinforcing decision through feedback, leading to irreversible commitment. The eryth-myoid lineage switch is an example of network implementing prim and committed by cooperativity through cofactor recruitment. Perturbing feedback between regulators and targets suggests reprogramming strategies. This approach provides a framework for lineage studies and lineage-determining genes.
Enterococcus faecalis, an opportunistic pathogen, exhibits intrinsic resistance to lysozym, a key effector of the innate immune system, due to a complex network of transcriptional regulators and genes (A, pgA, dA, and sigV) that inhibit lyso's enzymatic and antimicrobial activities. To identify novel modulators of this resistance, a quadruple oat/pgA/dlt/sig mutant was subjected to random transposon mutagenesis, leading to the identification of insertions in the enteroccal polysacchar antigen (EPA) region, located downstream of conserved epA-ep genes. The epA region was proposed to encode a synthetic machinery for EPA decoration, but its role was unknown. This study reveals EPA's contribution to resistance against antimicrobials and virulence in a zebraf infection model by conferring phagocytosis resistance. Results indicate that EPA modification of the polysacchar backbone is essential for E. faalis pathogenesis.
Researchers have developed a new method called RER (Regression of Combined Expression) to analyze gene regulation in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This method combines data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to understand how genes are expressed. ENCODE provides data on genetic and epigenetic factors such as copy number variation (CN), DNA methylation (DM), transcription factors (TF), and microRNA (mi) post-transcription regulation, while TCGA provides genome-wide signals. RER uses these data to infer sample-specific regulatory activities of TFs and miRNAs, which are then used to infer TF-mi-gene interactions. This two-stage framework overcomes difficulties in integrating EN data with sample-specific TCG measurements. AML data from TCG and TF binding data from K562 in EN were used as a case study. The model was verified with 10-fold cross-validation predicting gene expression. RER was also evaluated for recovering regulatory interactions and detecting mi/TF targets, showing superior power over existing methods. A feature selection identified 18 regulators whose activities clustered with cytogenetic risk, including miR-548, whose targets were enriched for leukemia-related pathways, implicating its role in AML pathogenesis. Survival analysis using inferred activities as a potential AML prognostic marker. This framework integrated TCG and EN data revealing AML regulatory program at a global level.
Researchers investigated the role of RNA interference (RNAi) in the ascomycete fungus Colletotrichum higginsum, a pathogen of various crops worldwide. Knockout mutants were generated for three RNAi-related genes: RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDR), Dicer (DCL), and Argonaute (AGO). No growth defects were observed in mutants on complex or minimal media. However, Δcl1, ΔclΔcl2, and Δago mutants showed conidiation and conidia morphology defects. Total RNA and small RNA populations were analyzed in parental and mutant strains, revealing greatest effects in Δcl, ΔclΔcl, andago strains. A previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus, Colletum higginsum nonsegmented RNA virus 1 (ChV1), was derepressed in these strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed close relationship between ChV and segmented Partitiviridae, despite nonsegmented genome. Immunoprecipitation of RNAs with AGO1 showed 5U-containing siRNA loading. Parental and Δcl strains cured of ChV showed conid and spore morphology defects caused by ChV. RNAi involving CL and AGO in C is proposed antiv mechanism.
Researchers investigated the role of histone acetyltransferase MOF in meiotic expansion of H2AX phosphorylation during spermatogenesis in mice. Three waves of H2 phosphorylation were observed in meiotic prophase I: ATM-dependent at leptotene, ATR-dependent at zygotene and pachene, and a third wave marking unsynapsed chromosomes. MOF was found to be involved in all three waves of HAX phosphorylation. Germ cell-specific deletion of MO in spermatocytes led to loss of H4acetylation in leptene and zygot spermatocytes, resulting in reduced HAX signals along chromosomal axes and chromatin-wide HAX phosphorylation. In early-mid pachene spermatocytes, HAX and MDC1 were detected along unsyn axes, but failed to expand, causing meiotic sex chromosome inactivation failure. RAD51 was recruited to double-strand break sites, but DSB repair and crossover defects were observed, indicating MO facilitates meiotic DSB repair after RAD51 recruitment. MO regulates meiosis and expands all three HAX waves from leptene to pene stages initiated by ATM and ATR.
Researchers investigated the effects of Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1) infection on human T-cell development using the "Immune System" (HIS) Rag-2/-γ- mouse model. These mice were infected with HT-1 at a time when three subpopulations of thymocytes have been detected. In all inoculated mice, HT-1 provirus was found in thymocytes, and proviral load increased with infection length. In HT- infected mice, alterations in T development were observed, correlating with proviral load. Mature single-positive (SP) CD4 and CD8 cells were more numerous at expense of immature double-positive (DP) thymocytes in th of HT- infected HIS- mice. These cells also accumulated in spleen. Lymphocytes from thym and spleen were activated, shown by CD25 expression, correlating with tax mRNA and increased NF-κB dependent genes such as bfl-1, anti-apopt gene in thym. Hepatosplenomegaly lymphadenopathy and lymphoma/thymoma were observed in HT- mice several months after infection.
In Sudan, schistosiasis remains a significant public health concern, particularly due to Schistosoma haematium infection. An integrated control program was implemented in Jabal locality, White State, Sudan from 2009-2011, targeting 78,615 primary school students out of a total population of 482,902. Urine and stool specimens were examined using sedimentation and Kato-Kato-Katz methods to assess prevalence. Baseline prevalence of S. haematium and S. mansoni was 28.5% and 0.4%, respectively. After 6-9 months post-treatment, S. haematium prevalence reduced to 13.5% (95%CI=0.331-0.462), with higher reduction in girls (20%) and rural residents compared to boys (40%) and urban. Health education increased awareness and water supply at Alida village reduced infection rate compared to a neighboring village. No significant change in S. mansoni prevalence between baseline and follow-up (95%CI=0.9336.891). At project end, S haematium prevalence reduced by 50% compared to baseline. Approximately 200,000 received praziquantel, education, or clean water.
Researchers have investigated the role of nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking of the Nip virus (NiV) matrix protein in viral budding. NiV is a highly pathogenic paramyxirus that causes encephalitis in humans and is classified as a Biosafety Level 4 (SL) pathogen. During infection, Ni-M was first detected in the nucleus at early stages before localizing to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Mutations in the putative bipartite nuclear localization (LS) and leucine-rich nuclear export (NES) in Ni-M impaired nuclear-ctoplasm trafficking and abolished Ni budding. A conserved lysine residue in LS mediated nuclear import and was also a site for monoubiquination regulating export. Overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced Ni budding while depletion via proteas inhibitors resulted in Ni retention and blocked budding. Live Ni was sensitive to proteas inhibitors: bortomib, an FDA-approved for multiple myeloma, reduced titers with IC 2.7 nM, 100-fold less than achievable in humans.
Researchers have developed an imaging assay to study the early events of poliovirus (PV) infection in live cells. The assay tracks the viral capsid and genome simultaneously with an infectivity-based RNA release assay to characterize the mechanisms of genome delivery. The study reveals that PV genome release is highly efficient and rapid, not limiting overall infectivity or infection rate. PV binds to cell surface receptors and enters through a clathrin, caveolin, flotillin, and microtubule-independent, tyrosine kinase and actin-dependent endocytic mechanism. After internalization, genome release occurs from vesicles or sealed invaginations within 100-200 nm of plasma membrane. This resolves debate on whether PV breaks plasma membrane or relies on endocyt to deliver genome into cell.
Dengue fever remains a significant public health concern in Cambodia, particularly affecting children. The National Dengue Control Program (NP) utilizes health education as a primary means of prevention and control, delivering it to communities and schools. An ethnographic study conducted in eastern Cambodia from 2003-2004 collected data on approaches used in health education and their effectiveness in controlling deng. Community health education provided by the NP's outreach activities and campaigns is not systematically evaluated, underfunded, and irregular; school-based education is limited in time and lacks follow-up on practical prevention activities. As a result, adherence is partial. The study suggests the need for sustained education in deng prevention and control, and approaches to translate knowledge into practice.
Researchers investigated the presence of microRNAs (miRNAs) released by filarial nematodes in the bloodstream of infected hosts. Using miRNA sequencing and bioinformatics, they identified over 200 mature miRNA sequences of nematode origin in Dirofilaria imis-infected dog plasma and Onchocerca volulus-infected human serum. Two miRNA candidates, mi-71 and mi-34, were detected in D. imis-infected dog plasma using stem-loop RT-qPCR assays. Brugia pangi-infected dog samples were also analyzed, as these miRNAs were previously detected in extracts from this species. The presence of mi-71 and mi-34 discriminated infected from uninfected samples, with no mi amplification in uninfected samples. However, miRNA copy numbers were not correlated with microfilaria for either parasite. This may be due to imprecision in mf counts or mi contributions from unknown adult worms. Parasite-derived miRNAs were found in plasma/serum for species not living in bloodstream.
Tyrosine kinases of the Src family are allosteric enzymes that play a crucial role in cellular signaling. The conversion of the kinase from an inactive to an active state is accompanied by substantial structural changes. A coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain was constructed incorporating experimental structures of the two stable states, and dynamics of conformation transitions were simulated. The transition landscapes were explored by constructing a network among clusters of conformations from simulations. Two major pathways for activation were identified. The first pathway involved a coordinated mechanism among the α-helix, activation loop, and β-strands in the N-lobe of the catalytic domain. The second pathway conformation change was coupled to partial unfolding of the N-lo region of the catalytic domain. The switching mechanism of α-helix and loop was characterized in detail. A Markov model was tested and its ability to account for structural in the context of conformation changes. The results provide a framework for understanding the features of conformation taking place upon activation.
Researchers have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying lethality in F1 hybrids between diverged parents, specifically focusing on crosses between diploid and tetraploid individuals of Arabidopsis thaliana. They found that dosage incompatibility plays a role in polyploid speciation and identified genetic variation in F lethality in interploidy crosses via QTL mapping. A single-effect QTL, DRANGEVE1 (DSL), and two QTL with epistatic relationships to DSL were identified. DSL affects postzygotic lethality via maternal expression in the sporophyte. Fine mapping placed DSL in an interval encoding the maternal transcription factor TT2. Maternal parents carrying loss-function in TT2 suppressed F lethality caused by paternal interplo crosses. Cellularization in the endosperm was affected by natural and tt2 loss-function mutants. The genetic basis of natural variation and single-gene mutations suggests F leth in polloids could evolve rapidly. The sporophytic TT2 gene in interplo crosses indicates developmental programming regulates viability of interplo offspring.
Researchers conducted a comparative host-pathogen coevolution analysis of Bartonella and Leptira bacteria in bats and rodents using genetic data from 51 Bartonella genotypes from 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella from 38 rodents, and 26 Leptira from 20 bats. Maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies were generated for hosts and bacteria, and coevolution congruence was tested using ParaFit, PAC, and Jane. Results showed significant coevolution between Bartonella and bats (ParaFit=1.970, P≤0.001, m value=7.332, P0.000) and between Bartonella and rodents (Para=102.440, P.001, m=86.532, P.000). In contrast, Leptira and bats showed no coevolution (Para=0.004, P.84, m=4.631, P.562). Event-based phylogeny analyses reconstructed evolutionary histories for each group, revealing Leptira bats had the most host switches (0.731) and Bartonella rodents the fewest (0.264). Bartonella exhibited coev with minimal host switching, while Leptira lacked congruence with host and had high host switches. Separate analyses of New and Old World datasets yielded congruent results. The study highlights variable coevolution patterns between pathogens and hosts, attributed to differences in disease transmission and host ecology. Understanding coev patterns and host-switching frequency will predict spillo between mammal reservoirs and humans.
A forced oscillation framework is applied to a chain model of undulatory swimming to investigate how forcing leads to deformation and movement. The study aims to understand how muscle contractions (active swimming) or fluid forces (passive swimming) cause movement. Results show that forcing triggers the first deformation modes of the body, leading to translational motion. Simple forcing patterns can trigger complex kinematics leading to movement. The frequency of muscle activation relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is crucial for emergent deformation characteristics of the body. The approach provides a qualitative understanding of optimal kinematics for fast swimming. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations confirm results from the chain model.
Genetic recombination between pathogens from humans and animals has the potential to create novel pathogen strains, as seen in the case of the H1N1N09 influenza pandemic, which originated from a reassortment of swine and avian and human influenza viruses. This study investigates whether genetic recombination between subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei from humans and animals can generate new strains of the human pathogen T. b. rhodesiense (Tb), responsible for sleeping sickness (African Trypanosomiasis, HAT) in East Africa. The trait of infectivity in T is conferred by a single gene, SRA, which is transferable to the pathogen Tbb by sexual reproduction. The study tracked inheritance of S in crosses of T and Tbb by co-transmitting genetically-engineered fluorescent trypanosome lines through tse flies. S was transferred into new genetic backgrounds by reproduction between T and T, creating new strains of the path T. There was no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility of tryosomes carrying S. Expression of S is critical to survival of T in the host, but the gene exists as a single copy in representative of T strains. S was found on homologue chromosome IV in majority of T isolates, but Ugandan T had S on homologues. Mobility of S by recombination explains observed variability of T in Africa. New strains of path T are generated by recombination with animal-infect trypanosomes. Recombinants present risk future outbreaks of H.
Researchers investigated the role of gap junction coupling in the dysfunction of β-cells in Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (NDM), a condition characterized by disrupted insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Gap junction-mediated electrical coupling between β-cells is crucial for coordinating pulsatile insulin response to elevated glucose and suppressing basal insulin secretion. A previous study showed that a critical number of inexcitable cells can suppress overall islet response due to gap coupling, using a murine model of NDM with ATP-insensitive K channels and a multi-cellular islet model. This study examined mechanisms of gap coupling in NDM dysfunction. A computational model was verified against [Ca2] and insulin measurements in islets with ATP-ins K channels under different gap coupling levels. The model predicted how K channel mutations in N suppress [2 and gap role in suppression. Stochastic and insulin dynamics were added to the model. Experimentally and computationally, reduced gap coupling allowed greater glucose-stimulated [2 and insulin with ATP-ins K channels. The model matched suppression [2 clinical N mutations. Significant [2 and insulin recoveries were predicted for many mutations with reduced gap coupling, where noise played a role in recoveries.
Researchers have developed a framework for analyzing gene transcription networks that accounts for retroactivity, a phenomenon where modules' behavior is influenced by their connections to other modules. The framework uses three matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity, which can be computed from macroscopic parameters such as dissociation constants and promoter concentrations. Internal retroactivity measures the effect of intramodular connections on a module's dynamics, while scaling and mixingactivity quantify how intermodular connections affect connected modules' dynamics. Based on these matrices and modules' dynamics in isolation, the framework predicts how loading affects an arbitrary interconnection of modules' behavior. This is demonstrated on recurrent motifs, including autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, toggle, and single motif. A metric is provided to determine a module's robustness to interconnection with other modules, applicable for evaluating natural networks' modularity and designing synthetic systems to minimize retroactivity.
Researchers have investigated recombination in the pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1), a region of homology between mammalian X and Y chromosomes, which has undergone rapid evolution. Crossover in PAR is essential for proper disjunction of X and Y chromosomes in meiosis, and deletion results in male sterility. The human PAR1 has an exceptionally high crossover rate, 17-fold higher than the genome-wide average. To understand this, researchers constructed a fine-scale genetic map of crossovers in African-American pedigrees, leveraging recombination rates from linkage disequilibrium in populations and DNA evolution signatures. They also identified PRDM9 binding sites using ChIP-seq in human cells. Contrary to mouse findings, PRDM does not localise recombination in human PAR1. Instead, recombination is a rapid and intense driver of evolution in PAR1, differing from autosomes. PAR hotspot activities vary among human populations and have changed between human and chimpanzee, with no shared hotspots.
Researchers have identified a new isoform of the histone demethylase JMJD2/KDM4, referred to as Δ-JJD2, which plays a crucial role in skeletal muscle differentiation. In proliferating myoblasts, muscle genes are silenced through epigenetic modifications, including histone H3 methylation at their promoters. The promoter of the gene encoding myogenic factor myogen (My) is key for muscle initiation of differentiation. The mechanism of H3 demethylation at My promoter is unclear. Δ-J2 increases during differentiation of C2 myoblast into myubes. Genome-wide expression and exon-specific siRNA knockdown indicate Δ-J is necessary for myube formation and muscle-specific expression. Δ promotes MyD conversion of NIH3T cells into muscle. ChIP-chip analysis shows Δ binds genes involved in transcriptional control, linked to activation. Δ is recruited to My promoter at onset differentiation. This binding promotes demethylation H3me and H3. Induction of Δ is crucial for muscle by removing repressive chromatin marks at My promoter, promoting transcription activation My and muscle-specific expression.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme (GWEP) is in its final stages, with only 25 cases reported in 2016, but global eradication requires certification by the World Health Organization (WHO) of absence of transmission in all countries. This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of the GWEP when the number of cases is lower and cost per case is higher than any time. Using data from GWEP, the cost of implementation, pre-certification, and certification stages are estimated. The cost-effectiveness is modeled for 1986-203. The GWEP is compared to two scenarios: doing nothing (no intervention since 1986) and control (only surveillance and response 201-203). The cost per case averted, disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted, and cost at-risk year averted are reported. Cost-effectiveness is assessed against a threshold of one GDP per capita (less than $500 in low-income countries). The GW cost an estimated $11.95 (95% interval, 4.70-12.49) per case averted 198-203. The pre-cert and certification phases cost $0.004 and $0.001 per capita year. The DAL averted by GW relative doing nothing is $222 (118-372) 198-203. GW is more cost-effective control by 203. GW more cost-effective control if willing to pay one life without risk GWD $0.10. Even if costs twice financial estimated 202, GW still cost-effective doing. Whether GW most-effective beyond 201 depends on horizon.
Researchers investigated the function of the BB32 protein from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto and its orthologues in the Lyme disease-causing Borrelia burgorferi sensu lato complex. They found that the carbox-terminal domain of BB32 (BB32-C) inhibits the initiating serine protease of the classical complement pathway, C1, by binding to it with high affinity. The study focused on the BB32 orthologs from Boria afii PG and Bor garin, and found that Bor afii BAD-C exhibited similar activity to BB32 in assays, including high-affinity binding to C1 protease and complex and inhibition of the classical pathway. Borin B19-C also bound C1 and Cr with high-affinity, but showed reduced in vitro inhibitory activity compared to BB32 and BAD. However, Borin B19 weakly recognized C1 and did not confer protection from serum killing. Site-directed mutagenesis created a chimeric protein BB32 with Borin B19 residues, which mimicked Bor B19's properties. The structure of BB32 was solved to 1.7Å resolution, revealing an anti-parallel four-helix fold with a protruding alpha-helix. The structure showed surface-exposed residues targeted in the chimer, supporting C1 binding and inhibition. Additional assays showed BB32 recognized C1 fragments containing the serine prote domain.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen, undergoes morphological and transcriptional adaptation from commensalism to pathogenicity. Previous gene knockout studies have identified factors involved in this transformation, but how they are regulated remains unclear. Investigating post-translational phosphorylation regulation has provided insights, focusing on cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28. The Fkh transcription factor is a target of Cdc and cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk, distinct from its conserved cell cycle function. In stationary yeast cells, 2D gel electrophoresis shows diverse F2 phosphoisoforms. A window before hyph induction, phosphorylation transforms to yeast profile. This does not occur in stationary cells reinoculated into fresh medium. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified C28 and C1 phosphorylated residues. Substituting with nonosphory alanine altered phosphorylation and abated hyal profile. Transcript profiling revealed hyal phosphorylation required pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm genes. These changes resulted in pathogenic defects. F2 interacts chromatin modifier P3 phosphorylation, regulating specificity. A cell-independent phosphoregulatory event subverts cycle component to commal pathity.
Trypanosoma brucei, a human pathogenic parasite, possesses both de novo and salvage pathways for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, rendering it non-reliant on salvage pyrimines for growth. Thymidine kinase (TK) catalyzes the formation of dTMP and dUMP, one of several enzymes redundant to the de novo pathway. Unexpectedly, TK is essential for growth and infectivity in a mouse model, with a catalytically active enzyme required for function. Unlike humans and other kinetoplasts, T. bruce lacks dCMP deaminase (DD), an alternative route to dUMP formation. Ectopic expression of human DD rescues the RNA growth phenotype, allowing viable TK null cells. Metabolite profiling reveals a buildup of deoxyrim nucleotides in TK depleted cells. Knockout of cytidine deaminase (DA), converting deoxycidine to deuridine, results in thym/deuridine auxotrophy. This suggests T. br encodes an unidentified 5'-nuclease converting deoxyrim nucleides to nucleosides, leading to buildup in TK cells at expense of dTP pools. Bioinformatics identifies potential genes encoding 5-uclease activity, including an HD protein phosphorylating deoxyonucle 5-monophosph. TK is essential for thym nucleotide synthesis, regardless novo or salvage.
In prokary systems, translation initiation requires interaction between the ribosome and an mRNA sequence upstream of the initiation codon, known as the Shine-Dalgarn sequence. However, a significant number of genes lack Shine-Darn sequences, and the mechanism of start cod recognition in these mRNAs is unknown. A genome-wide searches in various proaryotes identified elements and RNA structural motifs that mediate translation in mRN lacking Shine-Darn sequences. Results show mRN without Shine-Darn are less structured in their initiation region and exhibit minimal folding at the start cod. Reporter gene constructs in bacteria support local unfoldedness determining start cod recognition in Shine-Darn-dependent translation. AUG codons reside in single-stranded regions, whereas internal codons are in structured mRNA regions. Bioinformatics and experimental data suggest absence of secondary structure is necessary and sufficient for Shinearn-dependent translation initiation.
A study was conducted in Bihar, India, a region endemic for Leishmania donovani, to investigate the occurrence of Post-Kala Dermal Leishiasis (PKDL) in patients treated with liposomal amphotin B (Ambisome) for visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Between July 2017 and August 2012, 874 patients received 20mg/kg intravenous Ambis as first-line treatment with a high cure rate (99.3%) and low default rate (0.3%). Patients received health education on PK symptoms and were advised to return to the programme if symptoms developed. Of 831 patients completing VL treatment, 24 (0.3%) returned with symptoms confirmed PKDL, diagnosed by clinical history, appearance, and slit-skin examination. 89% had macular lesions with a median (interquartile range) of 1.2 (0.8-2.2) years post-treatment. Demographic and clinical characteristics of VL patients treated with Ambis who developed PKDL were compared to those who did not, and no significant factors were identified. However, time to PKDL was shorter with Ambis in a subset with previous stibogluconate VL treatment. In a large cohort of VL patients in Bihar treated with 20/kg Ambis, PKDL appears infrequent with no predictive factors. Time to PKDL was shorter with Ambis compared to conventional treatments.
Researchers investigated the re-infestation dynamics of Triatoma infestans, the primary vector of Chagas disease, in three villages in northwest Argentina after community-wide insecticide spraying in 1992. Continuous and discrete-time models were fitted to patch-level infestation data to elucidate aspects of re-establishment. The study found a 6-month lag between detection of new infestation and dispersal events, confirming previous results. Analysis revealed a higher establishment of new bug populations from May to November compared to November to May, coinciding with an increase in dispersal distance. The probability of new establishment increased with time since last infestation in the models. These findings challenge current understanding of T. infans ecology and highlight gaps in knowledge. Experiments are necessary to close these gaps.
Researchers investigated the effects of polyomavirus SV40 (SV40) microRNA on the pathogenesis of viral infections in Syrian hamsters, a commonly used animal model for studying SV40. Young adult hamsters were inoculated with 1×10^7 plaque-forming units of four different SV40 variants via the intracardial route and sacrificed at 3-270 days post-infection. Viral loads in tissues were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. All strains established persistent infections with slow clearance, displaying broad tissue tropism in liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain. Liver and kidney had higher viral loads than other tissues, with kidneys being the primary site for long-term infection. Expression of SV40 microRNA was detected in wild-type infected tissues, while micro-negative mutants showed higher DNA loads in liver and kidney. Viruses with complex regions had modestly higher loads in kidney than simple regions. Early transcripts were higher than late in liver and kidney. Infectious virus was infrequently detected. Clearance of micro-deficient viruses was limited. Wild-type and micro-negative SV showed similar transformation rates in vitro and tumor induction in vivo. This study demonstrated broad tissue tropism for SV in hamsters and first evidence of SV microRNA expression and function in vivo. MicroRNA dampened DNA levels in infected SV strains with simple or complex regions.
This study presents the most comprehensive genome-wide examination of positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals to date, utilizing six high-coverage assemblies of eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset enhances statistical power, allowing for new lineage and clade-specific tests to be applied. Approximately 16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two species show significant evidence of positive selection (FDR < 0.05) according to a likelihood test. An additional 144 genes exhibit positive selection on lineages or clades. Identified PSGs are enriched in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but also in specific functions such as complement-mediated immunity and taste. Several pathways are enriched PSG, suggesting co-evolution of interacting genes. A Bayesian analysis indicates PSG have switched multiple times between selection and non-selection, suggesting positive is often episodic. Affymetrix exon array data shows PSG are expressed lower, in a tissue-specific manner than non-PSGs. Genes in spleen, testes, liver, breast are enriched PSG, but not in brain.
Staphylococcus aureus, an opportunistic pathogen that colonizes mammalian skin and mucosal surfaces, often forms persistent infections through surface-associated biofilms. Researchers have identified a novel extracellular fibril structure that enhances S. aureus biofilm stability. Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed that these fibers exhibit amyloid properties, composed of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs). Mutants unable to produce PSs are susceptible to biofilm disassembly by matrix-degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. Prior research linked PSs to biofilm disassembly, this study shows soluble PS disperse biofilms while polymerized do not. This suggests PS aggregation into amyloid fibers modulates their biological role in biofilms.
Researchers have developed a novel antibody biomarker, Ab3, to monitor the persistence of Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite causing agent of Chagas disease, in infected individuals. Chagas affects over 6 million people in 20 countries. Monitoring parasite persistence is crucial for evaluating treatments and controlling the disease. Current methods, such as serological assays and PCR, have limitations due to low parasitic load in blood. A multiplex serology assay was designed with 15 T cruzi antigens to evaluate 165 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. One antibody, Ab3, showed strong correlation with T cruzi persistence determined by PCR results. High Ab3 levels were associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, while decline in Ab signals were observed in benznidazole-treated patients with cleared parasitemia. Ab3 is a surrogate biomarker for parasite persistence in chronic benidazole-treated Chagas patients. It is hypothesized that Ab3 is induced by incessant immune stimulation from tissue-based parasites undetectable by PCR. A simple immunoassay of Ab3 could monitor infectious status of seropositive patients.
Chikungunya virus (CHV) is an arthrogenic alphavirus that causes fever and severe joint and muscle pain, with chronic musculoskeletal pain persisting in a fraction of patients for months to years after initial infection. Researchers sought to identify cells contributing to pathogenesis during chronic phase by developing a recombinant CHV expressing Cre recombinase (CHV-3-C). CH-C replicated in myoblast and fibroblasts, inducing arthritis in mice during acute phase and chronic disease, including persistent RNA and myitis synovitis. Infection of tdato reporter mice resulted in tdato cells persisting at least 112 days. Immunofluorescence and cytometry revealed td cells were predominantly myofib and dermal muscle fibbl. Treatment with antibody against Mra, a host receptor for CHV, reduced td cells and chronic RNA levels, implicating as reservoir of chronic RNA. Isolation and cytometry sorting td fibbl from skin and ankle analysis revealed td cells harbored persistent CHV RNA. The CH-C and tdato mouse system identifies cells surviving CHV in vivo and enriched CHV RNA, a tool for studying path in acute and chronic disease stages.
Recent studies have applied dimensionality reduction methods to understand the multi-dimensional structure of neural activity in the brain. However, it is unclear how these results generalize to larger numbers of neurons and trials or relate to the underlying network structure. This study addresses these questions by applying factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and spiking models that generate irregular activity through excitation and inhibition. The study compares the scaling of two dimension reduction outputs, shared dimension and percent variance, with neuron and trial count. Results show that networks with clustered and non-clustered connectivity differ, and in vivo recordings align with clustered networks. Recordings of tens of neurons are sufficient to identify dominant variability modes that generalize to larger portions of the network.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa-regulated molecule 2-aminoacetophen (2-AA) modulates host immune responses in a manner that increases host's ability to cope with the pathogen. Mice treated with 2-AA prior to infection had a 90% survival rate compared to 10% survival in non-treated mice. 2-AA activates innate immune pathways involving mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPs), nuclear factor (NF)-κ, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but attenuates response upon pre-treatment by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. Pretreatment with 2 is characterized by transcriptional block of c-J N-terminal (JNK) and NF-κ activation, with preserved extracellular regulated kinase (ER)1/2 activation. These changes lead to CA/enhancer protein-β (c/EBβ) activation and c/EBβ-p65 complex formation, preventing NFκ activation.2 dampens inflammatory processes while increasing survival and pathogen persistence.
Mammalian genomes contain numerous active and fossilized retroelements, including LINE-1 (L1) elements, which can integrate into host genomes and provide opportunities for retroelement domestication, leading to innovations in genome defense and adaptation. The L1-DT1 gene is a domesticated gene whose protein-coding sequence is entirely derived from a LINE-1 element, and has been shown to play a role in pluripotency maintenance. To investigate its role, the origin and evolution of L1-D1 was traced. L1 originated in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, but was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. L1-D1 evolved under positive selection in primate and mouse evolution, and prosian L1-D1 acquired a recent L1 ORF from the prosian genome. This suggests L-D1 has been selected for novelty, potentially for genome defense. L-D1 loss is associated with extinction in several lineages, but not sigmodine rodents. The study highlights the role of retroelement domestication in mammalian biology, and domesticated genes can adopt different functions in lineages.
A highly conserved bacterial protein, RNase Y, plays a crucial role in the processing of the 3' end of 16S rRNA and 70 ribosome quality control in Escherichia coli. Although it is not essential in E. coli, loss of RNase Y severely sensitizes it to multiple stresses. In Vibrio cholera, RN Y is an endoribonuclease and essential for virulence, stress regulation, RNA processing, and ribosome quality control, and part of a core set of RNases in most pathogens. Analysis of RNA and ribosome profiles of V. cholera partially depleted of RN Y and other RN associated with 16 rRNA processing show Y is also crucial for 16 r 3 enduration in V. cholera and impedes subunit assembly into 70 ribosomes. Y's importance to V cholera pathogenesis is demonstrated by loss of colonization, biofilm formation, reduced cholera toxin production, and altered expression of virulence small RNAs of V. cholera depleted Y. The Y genes of several distantly related pathogens complement E. coli ΔY under stress, showing conservation of Y's activity in regulation. This study provides comprehensive exploration of Y's role in human pathogen, conserved across species in cellular processes.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the topological properties of transcription factor networks (TF) and the robustness of their gene expression phenotypes to genetic and environmental perturbations. They focused on assortativity, a measure of the tendency of nodes with similar numbers of edges to connect, and its four distinct components that form the assortativity signature. Theoretical studies suggested that increasing one component of TF's assortativity leads to increased phenotypic robustness, but biological context is limited due to lack of characterization of real-world TFNs' assortativity. This study used DNase-seq data to measure genome-wide TFNs assortativity in 41 human cell and tissue types and found a common assortativity signature that confers phenotypic robustness to TFNs. They determined the contribution of each assortativity component to this robustness.
Researchers investigated how populations of inhibitory (IN) and excitatory (EX) neurons in the neocortex encode stimulus-related information. They recorded the activity of ensembles of up to 74 neurons in anesthetized rat somatosensory barrel cortex using 128-channel multi-electrode arrays. Two whisker stimuli (location and frequency) were used to classify IN and EX neurons based on their extracellular spike waveforms. IN neurons discriminated between 6 stimulus classes better than EX neurons in granular and infragran layers. Ensembles of IN cells provided as much information as ensembles of the 20 most informative EX neurons, with less redundancy. This was consistent with information measurements and linear discriminant analysis. The study suggests a consortium of IN neurons dominates neocort information processing, efficiently processing sensory activity.
Researchers have engineered a fundamental arithmetic unit for binary addition in living cells using de novo riboregulation, a process that allows for the computation of two bits of information encoded in molecular concentrations. The circuit, based on post-transcriptional control and allosteric transcription factors, robustly performs the intended computation and encodes the result as fluorescence amplitudes. This achievement demonstrates the potential of regulatory RNAs as key players in synthetic biology and paves the way for more complex RNA-based biocomputers using this circuit as a building block.
Researchers have investigated the inhibition of cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II (c-II) by ribonucleotide 5'-monophosphate analogues to understand its role in resistance to cytotoxic nucleide analogues during cancer therapy. c-II regulates intracellular nucleotide pools by dephosphorylating 6-hydroxypine nucleide 5'-monosphates. High c-II expression is linked to poor patient outcomes in cytotoxic therapy. A class of compounds, ribonucle phosphates, were screened as potential c-II inhibitors, featuring chemically stable phosphorus-carbon linkages instead of regular phospho bonds. Six compounds were identified as better ligands than natural substrate inosine 5-monophosphate (IMP). Study of purine and pyrimidine analogues and phosphon chain modifications defined rules for ligand affinity. Binding was analyzed in silico and attributed to van der Waals, highlighting c-II residues Phe 157, His 209, and Tyr 210. Docking predictions were confirmed by experimental nucleotase activity measurements with best phosphon analogues. These induced total inhibition of c-II activity at 2mM. This study emphasizes importance of non-hydroable phosphon bond in new c-II inhibitors and hydrophobic stacking by protein residues.
Researchers have found evidence of prion infectivity in milk and colostrum from sheep incubating scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). This is the first reported case of prion presence in dairy products from SE-affected ruminants entering the animal and human food chain. Prions were detected in mammary secretions from scrap-affected ewes in a previous study. This study found consistent levels of infectivity in colostr and milk from sheep with natural scrapie several months before clinical onset. Abnormal Pr was detected by immunohistochemistry and PET in lactal ducts and mamary glands. PrSc accumulation was found in ewes with mammary ectopic lymphoid follicles due to Ma lentivirus infection. However, bioassay showed prion infect was present in milk and colostr from ewes with lymph-proiferative mastitis and those with lesion-free mam glands. Infectivity was recovered in cellular cream and caseinhey fractions of milk and colstrum. Using a T 338 mouse model, the highest infectious titre was equivalent to 6g of posterior brain from terminally scrap ewe. These findings indicate colstr and milk from ruminants with T could contribute to T transmission, either through milk-derived material in animal feed or directly. This raises concern for human T exposure with ovine and T-susceptible dairy products.
An outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) occurred in Liberia from March 2014 to January 2016. Epidemiological data on EVD cases were collected and managed nationally, but data collection and management were challenging due to malfunctioning surveillance and reporting systems. Laboratory data, however, systematically recorded demographic and clinical information on patients. This study presents data on 16,370 laboratory samples tested between April 4, 2014 and March 29, 2015. A total 10,536 individuals were traced, of whom 3,897 were confirmed positive for Ebola RNA. Confirmed cases differed significantly from suspected cases tested negative for RNA by sex, age, and place of residence. Young children and elderly, and rural areas were risk factors for death. The case fatality rate of confirmed cases decreased from 80% to 63 during the period.
Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.11), a copper-containing monooxygenase, catalyzes the conversion of phenol to orthoquinone. The Streptomyces tyin forms a complex with the Cie protein, facilitating copper ion transport into the active center. A previous study identified Tyr98 in Cie, accommodated in tyrosin active pocket, converted to quin through μ2:2-pero-dopper (II) and CuII-dasiquin intermediates. Despite extensive studies, catalytic mechanism unclear at atomic level. Cryo-crystal structures (1.16-1.70Å) reveal new step: hydroxylation triggered by Cu movement, inducing syn-anti rearrangement copper ligands after μ2:2-pero-dopper formation. Rearrangement places hydroxyl substrate equatorial, enabling electrophil attack aromatic Cu2 oxidant.
Researchers have investigated the early stages of ribosome biogenesis, specifically the production of the large ribosomal subunit, in yeast. The first precursor to the large ribosomal subunit, the pre-60S particle, contains 30 assembly factors (AFs), including RNA helicases, which drive conformational rearrangements. However, the mechanisms by which these helicases are targeted to their substrates within pre-ribosomal particles and their precise roles remain unknown. The Dbp helicase, essential for normal accumulation of pre-60 preribosomal in S. cerevisiae, associates with a complex of four AFs: N1, N2, N8, and R3. Tand affinity purifications show N forms the backbone of the complex. N and N directly bind Dbp. N is essential for insertion of Dbp within 90 preribosomal particles. In vivo cross-linking analysis maps N binding sites on 25 rRNA adjacent to root helices of first and last secondary domains. This suggests N and Dbp function in formation of root helices of largeunit rRNAs, creating core of ribosomal structure. N also crosslinks snoRN in decoding and peptid transfer center and vicinity of binding sites on 25 r. Data suggest Dbp and play key roles in compaction of core 25 r and control sno-rRNA interactions.
Researchers investigated the role of catecholamines in regulating learning rate in a dynamic environment. They found that the P3 component of the EEG, an electrophysiological index of phasic cateolamine release in the cortex, predicted learning rate and mediated the effect of prediction error on learning. P3 amplitude also mediated the effects of unexpectedness of outcome and uncertainty of existing belief on learning. Pharmacological manipulation of cateolamine activity affected learning following task changes in a way dependent on baseline rate.
In Senegal, a syndromic surveillance system called EPIC was implemented to monitor infectious diseases using data from two Point-of-Care (POC) laboratories in rural villages. From 2010 to 2016, two POC laboratories were established in the Salm region of Senegal. EPIC was used to analyze data from the Timone hospital laboratory in Marseille, France. This study describes the implementation of EPIC using data from two POC laboratories in Senegal. After implementation, 15 pathogens were monitored in two POC using the same methodology as France. In 5 years, 2,577 patient samples from 775 patients were tested in Diel and Ndi POC, with 739 positive for at least one pathogen. Analysis with EPIC generated 443 alarms. In Niak P laboratory, 316 samples from 298 patients were processed, with 56 positive for at least pathogen. EPIC analysis generated 14 alarms.
Researchers have investigated the role of cellular architecture in collective signaling and contractility in multicellular systems, specifically in the context of vascular endothelial cells. Using a combination of computational modeling and micro-patterning techniques, they examined how the arrangement of endothelial cells affects calcium signaling and contractility in response to histamine stimulation. The study found that endothelial cells self-assembled into microengineered networks, but not individual monolayers, exhibited calcium oscillations under histamine stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition and computational modeling revealed that calcium oscillations depend on the number of neighboring cells coupled via gap junction intercellular communication, providing a mechanistic basis for architecture-dependent signaling. Furthermore, calcium oscillations attenuated histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and contraction, resulting in architecture-dependent cell responses. The study suggests that endothelial cells can sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to vascular architecture via collective signaling.
Researchers investigated the role of antigenic sites on the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) attachment protein outside the conserved cysteine domain (CCD) in immunity. Previous studies identified antibody responses to RSV in infants using whole-genome phage display libraries, revealing epitopes on the N and C-termini of the ectodomain and CCD. This study examined the contribution of antigenic regions outside the CCD to RSV immunity by evaluating the immunogenicity, neutralization, and protective efficacy of RSV antigen sites following primary infection using recombinant E. coli expressed ectomain (REG), CCD-deleted ectomain (REGΔD), N and C-terminal subdomains, and antigen peptides. Results showed that REGD, N-terminal subdomains, and peptides generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound glycosylated recombinant mammalian ectomain (RM) and intact RSV particles, but minimal in vitro neutralization titers compared to intact ectomain. Vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally with RSV-A Line 19, and viral replication in nasal cavity and lungs was reduced in vaccinated animals compared to unimmun controls. Control viral loads post-R challenge correlated with serum binding to particles. Additionally, low Th2/Th cytokine ratios were found in lungs of REGD vaccinated mice after challenge. These findings demonstrate multiple protective sites on RSV protein outside CCD contributing to a vaccine against R disease.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the specification of the FMRFamide neuropeptide neurons in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) is a complex process involving both intrinsic transcriptional and extrinsic cues. Target-derived signals, denoted as retrograde signals, play a critical role in this process. One such signal is the BMP (Bone Morphogenetic Protein) received by Tv4 neurons from their target cells, which triggers the activation of the FMRF gene. A genetic screen identified several genes involved in Tv4 specification, including components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome: b2 (72)Ab and Pr8. This study focuses on the role of RNA processing in target-derived signaling. b2 and Pr8 are crucial for FMa expression in Tv neurons of the VNC. Analysis of b2 reveals two mechanisms: proper axonal targeting to receive BMP ligand and proper splicing of genes in the BMP pathway: thickve (tk) and Medea. These results demonstrate RNA processing in diversifying neuronal identity within the central nervous system.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism for regulating the abundance of F-box proteins, a key components of the SCF (Skp-cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex, which plays a crucial role in various cellular processes including cell cycle regulation and response to stress. In yeast, the F-box protein Met30 is targeted for ubiquitination and degradation through a pathway independent of Skp1, a central component of the SC complex. This pathway requires the cullin component Cdc/Cul1, but not other SC components. The study shows that this non-canonical degradation pathway is essential for maintaining chromosome stability and protecting against heavy metal stress.
Kinesin-3 motors, specifically KIF1, play a crucial role in transporting synaptic vesicles and membrane-bound organelles in neuronal cells. In the absence of cargo, Kines motors are inactivated to prevent motility and ATP hydrolysis. Current models propose that KIF1 is monomeric in the inactive state, becoming active upon concentration-driven dimerization on the membrane. Contrary to this, native and expressed K1 are dimeric in the inactive state. K1 motors are not activated by cargo-induced dimerization, but rather autoinhibited by two distinct mechanisms. This suggests a model for activation of dimer K1 by cargo binding. Successive truncations yield monomeric and dimer motors capable of one-dimensional diffusion along microtubule lattice. However, only dimer motors undergo ATP-dependent processive motility. This indicates K1 may utilize both diffuse and processive motility for long-distance transport in neuronal cells.
A study was conducted to investigate the regulation of seed metabolism in a collection of 76 homozygous tomato introgression lines (ILs) grown in the field over two consecutive seasons. Metabolic profiling and network analysis revealed 30 quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with metabolite variation. Amino acid contents showed high variability across the population, while sugars exhibited seasonal fluctuations. Factorial ANOVA identified genotypic background as the primary factor influencing metabolic polymorphism, rather than environment or tissue. Analysis of variance indicated greater phenotypic plasticity in ILs compared to M82 tomato cultivar. Heritability estimates suggested different modes of inheritance for metabolite traits in seed versus fruit. Correlation-based network analysis comparing seed and pericarp metabolite data showed seed displayed tighter metabolic interdependence than fruit. Amino acids in seed network played a central role, interacting with sugars and organic acids. Six highly regulated amino acids, Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro, were identified. Strong interdependence confirmed by QTL mapping.
Vibrio cholera, a bacterial pathogen that colonizes both the chitinous exoskeleton of zooplankton and the human gastrointestinal tract, utilizes a protein called N-acetylucosamine binding protein (Gbp) to mediate attachment to marine chitin and mammalian mucin. Research reveals that Gbp has an elongated, four-domain structure with domains 1 and 4 showing structural homology to chitin binding domains. Glycan analysis shows Gbp binds GlcNA oligosaccharides, while structure-guided Gbp truncation mutants demonstrate domains 1 and 4 interact with chitin in vitro, and domain 1 is crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization in vivo. Bacterial studies show domains 2 and 3 bind V cholera surface. Mouse virulence assays indicate only first three domains Gbp are required for colonization.
Chronic activation of T cells is a hallmark of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB), a disease characterized by an imbalance between effector (Te) and regulatory (Treg) cells. Research has shown that circulating Treg cells in adults with TB retain their suppressive function, but Te cells are resistant to Treg suppression. This resistance is attributed to the expansion of an activated Te subset expressing Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-DR. Depletion of this subset restores sensitivity to suppression. Comparative transcriptome analysis of Te cells with and without HLA-DR identified mechanisms linked to IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22, PD-L, and chemokines CCL3, C4 expression. Blocking experiments confirmed HLA-DR Te cells are resistant to Treg suppression via CCR5 and PD1 pathways. HLA-DR cells activate NF-κB downstream of C5 and PD1, and express higher Th1/17 cytokines, which counterbalance Treg function.
Researchers investigated the propagation of prions in mice expressing prion protein (PrP) devoid of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, a molecule that typically links Pr to the cell membrane. Mice lacking the GPI anchor (tg- mice) are susceptible to prion infection, but accumulate anchorless prion (PrSc) outside the cell. The study aimed to determine if tg mice could propagate prions despite the deviant structure and location of anchorless PrSc. Results showed that RML and ME, but not 22 prions propagated in tg mice developed novel tropisms, as determined by Cell Assay. Unexpectedly, levels of proteinase-resistant PrSc (PrPres) in R- or ME-infected tg brain were 25-50 times higher than wild-type. When returned to wild brain, ME pr recovered original properties, but R pr gave rise to novel strain S, which remained unchanged after three passages in wild mice. Both RPrSc and SSc are stably propagated in wild mice, suggesting two conformations separated by high energy barrier abated in tg mice.
In Drosophila, the BMP signaling pathway plays a crucial role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development, mediated by the transcription factor Mad and the repressor Brinker. A study combining RNA-seq and Br ChIP-seq, the BMP-responsive transcription network underlying dorsal-vent axis patterning was deciphered. Multiple BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling, were identified. EGF signaling was found to negatively regulate embryonic BMP transcription. The BMP network exhibits self-regulation, balancing its activity with antagonistic EGF signaling to facilitate patterning. Key transcription factors Zelda and Zerküll establish the expression domain, while insulator proteins bind to Mad and Brinker genomic regions. In embryos lacking BE-32, transcription of a BMP target gene and amniosa cells were reduced, specified by BMP signaling. A model for Mad-dependent activation was proposed, relevant to vertebrate BMP interpretation.
In Tunisia, cases of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania major have been increasing and spreading from south to new areas in the center. To improve knowledge on L. major evolution and dynamics, a multi-locus microsatellite typing of isolates from Tunisian governorates where the disease is endemic (Gaf, Kairan and Sidi Bouid governorates) collected during 1991-1992 and 2008-201 was performed. Analysis of genotyping results of isolates in Sidi Bouid 199-199 and 200-201 using F-statistics and Bayesian-based approach shows that over two decades, Leish parasites evolved generating genetically differentiated populations. Genetic patterns of 200-201 isolates from three governorates indicate L major did not spread from south to center Tunisia according to geographical gradient, suggesting human activities source of disease expansion. Bayesian model and F-stat genotypes between governor and districts indicate human activities, reservoir and environmental dynamics explain disease progression. This study provides insights into evolution and spread L in Tunisia, improving understanding parasite between geographically and temporally distinct populations.
Researchers conducted a study to evaluate the effectiveness of anthelmint chemotherapy and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions in reducing helminth infections among HIV-infected adults in Kenya. A total of 701 stool samples were analyzed, with approximately 22% showing helmin infections, mostly of low to moderate intensity. Treatment with albendazole significantly reduced the odds of infection with any helmin species (OR: 0.11, 95%CI: 0.05,0.20, p<0.001), adjusting for age and sex. While WASH showed minimal benefit, access to safe flooring offered additional protection (OR:0.34, 95%:0.20,0.56, p<0.001) against any helmin species. For schistosiasis, treatment with prazantel was protective (OR:0.30,95:0.14,0.60, p=0.001). Among those not treated with albazole or prantel, the most protective package was safe flooring (OR:0.34,95:0.20,0.59, p<0.001) and latrine access (OR:0.59,95:0.35,0.99 p=0.05). No synergy or antagonism was found between anthint chemotherapy and W resources. Deworming reduced helmin infections in HIV-infected adults, with W offering minimal additional benefit except for flooring.
Lectin-like bacteriocins are proteins produced by plant-associated bacteria that selectively kill closely related species, including phytopathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas. The crystal structure of LlpW, a prototype lectin-like bacteriocin from Pseudomon putida, reveals a two-domain architecture consisting of a monocot mannose-binding lectin (MBL) domain and a C-terminal β-hair extension. The C-terminal MB domain (C-domain) adopts a fold similar to MB domains in plant lectins and contains a mannose-binding site. Mutational analysis indicates an intact sugar-binding pocket in this domain is crucial for bactericidal activity. The N-terminal MB (N) domain adopts the same fold but is structurally divergent and lacks mannose-binding site. Differential activity of engineered N-domain chimeras from Lp homologs with distinct killing spectra disclosed the N-domain determines specificity. This bacteriocin is assembled from two structurally similar domains evolved towards dedicated functions in target recognition and bacterotoxicity.
Bacillus subtilis undergoes sporulation, a complex developmental process involving two coordinately regulated programs. During late sporulation, the forespore, a developing spore, resides within the mother cell. The regulation of the forespore transcription factor σG has remained enigmatic. σG requires eight proteins encoded by the spoII operon and the foresore protein SpoQ. Several SpoII proteins share similarity with components of specialized secretion systems, one resembling an ATPase. We found that ATP motifs are required for σ activity. SpoII proteins and SpoQ reside in a multimer complex spanning two membranes surrounding the foresore. In their absence, the foresore develops invaginations and collapses. Maintenance of foresore integrity does not require σ. These results support a model where SpoII-SpoQ form a novel apparatus allowing the cell to nurture the fores, maintaining fores physiology and σ during spore maturation.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with bipolar disorder (BD), a highly heritable and disabling disease. The study included 1,190 cases and 401 controls, with additional samples from a total of 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls. No genome-wide significant associations were detected for individual loci, but a significant association was found between the power to detect effects from a previous genome-wide association study and evidence (P=1.5×10−7). To rule out a false positive result, replication was analyzed in a meta-analysis of height, showing associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. Within BD, SNPs near exons exhibited greater replication probability, indicating enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions. This suggests common genetic variation near exons (±10kb) could be identified in larger studies, providing a framework for assessing replication combining results from multiple studies.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide systematic analysis to identify predictive proliferation signatures of cancerous versus non-cancerous cells. They developed a Cancer Prolation Index (cPI) to quantify the association between gene expression levels and growth rates across 60 cancer cell lines. Results showed that genes essential in cancer knockdown screens had positive PI values, while tumor suppressors had negative PI. Cell cycle, DNA replication, splicing, and protein production processes were positively associated with cancer, while migration was negatively associated. This aligns with the "grow or die" dichotomy. Analysis of non-cancer proliferation (nPI) across lymphoblast cell lines revealed differences between cancerous and nonancer proliferation, highlighting translation and splice machinery as cancer-associated proteins. Cross-species comparison showed cancer proliferation resembled microorganisms, nonancer did not. Combining cancer and nonancer signatures improved patient outcome prediction and gene essentiality in cancer.
A retrospective case series of 11 patients with cardiac and vascular cistic echinoccosis (CE) was followed over a 15-year period (1995-2009). Clinical manifestations included thoracic pain and dyspnea, with 2 patients being asymptomatic. Cysts were primarily located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava. Nine patients had disseminated CE. Echocardiography was the diagnostic method of choice, with serology, electrocardiogram, chest-ray, computed tomography/magnetic imaging, and histology aiding diagnosis and follow-up. Nine underwent cardiac surgery and received long-term antiparas for a median 25 months (4-93). One died intra-operatively due to cyst rupture and vascular dissemination. Two died 10 and 14 years post-diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism (PE) and failure, respectively. One was lost to follow. Patients with cardiac involvement had no complications post-surgery and were cured. One recurrence required second operation. Vascular involvement developed PEs and multiple complications.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism by which Staphylococcus aureus uses to modulate the host immune response, through a protein called Tir, a Toll/interleukin receptor mimic. This protein inhibits the activation of the NF-kB pathway, a key component of the innate immune response, by downregulating TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9 receptors. In a mouse model, skin lesions caused by a mutant S. aureus lacking Tir were more severe than those caused by the wild-type strain, despite similar bacterial loads. Tir was also associated with reduced neutrophil and macrophage activity, indicating its role in attenuating virulence through inflammatory responses. Tir is encoded within the staphlococcal chromosomal cassette SCC, which also contains the fusC gene for fusidic acid resistance, but not the mec gene. Fusidic acid sub-inhibitory concentrations increased Tir expression. Epidemiological studies found no link between Tir and clinical presentation, but a selective advantage with the SCCmec element containing SCC/tir.
Researchers have identified distinct embryonic patterning mechanisms in fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) and mosquitoes (Anopheles gambiae) by analyzing gene expression data during embryonic development. The study focused on whole-genome changes in gene expression underlying differences in their respective embryonic morphologies. Orthologous gene pairs were clustered based on coincident discordances in temporal profiles. One cluster contained genes specifically expressed in mosquito serosa, redeployed later in cuticle synthesis. Maternal genes exhibited sharp reduction at maternal-zyotic transition in Dophila, sustained in Anophe. Gene clustering by temporal discord can identify batteries underlying morphological diversity.
Researchers conducted a cross-sectional study in rural villages on Lih Island, Papua New Guinea, during a yaws elimination campaign to investigate the presence of Haemophilus duyi and Treponema pallidum subsp pertue DNA in asymptomatic individuals and their environment. Participants were recruited from households with and without cases of ulcers. Skin swabs from asymptomatic individuals, flies, and environmental surfaces were collected and tested by PCR for H. duyi and T. pertue DNA. Of 78 asymptomatic participants with adequate specimens, 16% had H. duyi PCR positivity and 1% T. pertue positivity. In subgroup analysis, H. duyi PCR did not differ in exposed or not exposed to case in household (24% vs 18%; p=0.76). Of 17 cultures, 2 yielded definitive H. duyi skin colonization. Of 10 flies, 90% had H duyi and 50 T. pertue DNA. Of 6 bed sheets, 33 had H duyi and 17 T. pert DNA This is the first demonstration of H duyi on asymptomatic skin and H du and T. pertue in flies and fites. Ubiquity of du in environment contributes to spread.
The International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee's Curriculum Task Force has developed a set of bioinformatics core competencies to provide a framework for training and curricula across various user groups and programs. The competencies were based on surveys of employers and training programs and refined through a multi-year community engagement process. This report presents the current status of the competencies and illustrates their application in diverse training contexts. The competencies are intended to address the wide range of populations in need of bioinformatics training with divergent backgrounds and application areas. They cover essential knowledge and skills in areas such as data management, analysis, visualization, and interpretation, and communication. The competencies are organized into three categories: foundational, technical, and application, and professional. Foundational competencies include understanding of bioinformatics concepts, data types, and tools. Technical competencies cover data management, analysis, and visualization. Professional competencies include communication, collaboration, and project management. The competencies are being applied in various training programs and contexts, including undergraduate, graduate, and continuing education. The use cases demonstrate how the competencies can be integrated into existing curricula and programs. The report concludes with consideration of remaining challenges and future plans for the competencies refinement and application.
Researchers conducted a deep-sequencing study of the polyadenylated transcriptome of the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercalis to investigate the mechanisms of its developmentally arrested third-stage larva (L3) formation. The study aimed to determine if homologous pathways present in Caenorhabditis elegans, a free-living nemode with a similar developmental arrested larval form, the dauer, are involved in L3 arrest and activation. The study generated 2.3 billion paired-end reads from seven developmental stages and constructed expression profiles for S. steralis homologs of C. elegans dauer genes. Intriguingly, genes encoding cyclic GMP (cG) pathway components were coordinately upregulated in L3. In contrast to C. elegans, S. stalis has a paucity of genes encoding insulin/IG-1-like (IS) ligands, several of which have abundance profiles suggesting involvement in L3 development. Seven S. stalis genes encoding homologs of C. elegans dauer transforming factor β (Tβ) ligand were identified, three of which are expressed in L3. Dachronic acid biosynthetic genes did not appear to be coordinately regulated in L3 development. The study suggests that dauer pathway genes are present in S. stalis and may play a role in L3 development, with significant differences between the two species.
Researchers investigated the effects of Cytothal distending toxin (CDT) and colibactin, bacterial toxins secreted by pathogenic bacteria, on nuclear remodeling in the context of cell survival. Helicobacter infected mice, co-culture with CDT and colibin-secreting bacteria, hepatic, intestinal, and gastric cells, and xenograft mouse models were used to assess nuclear remodeling in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that CDT and colibin induced nuclear remodeling associated with formation of cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus of cells. These structures, observed in vivo and vitro, correspond to nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). The NR core contained ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenylated RNA, and components of complex CR involved mRNA turnover. These structures were active sites of translation, correlated with high ploidy, and MAP and calcium signaling. Data showed insulation and concentration of ribonucleoproteins within nucleus were dynamic and transient, protecting cells until genotoxic stress relieved. Bacterial genotoxin-induced NR was a gateway for mRNA to be transported for local translation.
Researchers conducted a quantitative evaluation of maxillary bone deformation in patients with leprosy using three-dimensional computed tomography (3-CT). They reconstructed three-dimensional images of the maxilla in 10 patients with lepro and 5 controls, and measured the anterior-posterior length of the maxilla (MA). The difference in MA between patients and controls was evaluated after compensating for individual skull size. The findings were compared to previous paleopathological studies. Three patients with lepromatous leprosy showed marked atrophy of the maxilla (-8.6, -11.1, and -17.9mm), consistent with visual appearance of maxillary deformity and paleopathological findings. The study confirmed maxillary regression in paleopathological studies.
Researchers investigated how the auditory system represents sounds in a way that is invariant to background noise, which is a significant challenge in identifying relevant sounds amidst noise. To address this, the system may represent sounds in a noise-invariant fashion by adapting to stimulus statistics altered by noise. The study examined adaptation to mean and contrast of auditory stimulation along the auditory pathway by presenting synthetic and natural sounds, recording responses in inferior colliculus and primary auditory cortex of anaesthetized ferrets, and comparing with a model of auditory nerve. Adaptation to both forms increased along the pathway. To determine if adaptation to statistics contributes to noise-invariant representations, complex sounds in noise were embedded and a decoding approach used to assess population noise tolerance. The code for complex in periphery was more affected by noise than cortical. Noise tolerance was correlated with adaptation to statistics, with strongest adapting populations being most tolerant. The increase in adaptation from nerve to cortex is a stage in constructing noise-invariant representations in higher brain.
Researchers investigated the reorganization of the yeast protein-protein interaction network (interactome) in response to heat shock stress using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. The study analyzed changes in interaction weights of the interactome from mRNA expression levels upon heat shock and found that heat induced a significant decrease in overlaps and connections of interactome modules. The diameter of the interactome increased 4.9-fold in response to heat. Key proteins of the heat response became centers of heat-induced communities and provided residual connections after shock. The changes resembled a "stratus-culus" transition of interact structure, with unstressed interact having a global organization like stratus clouds and shocked interact having multifocal like cumulus. Results showed heat induced partial disintegration of global interact organization. This may occur in other stresses and complex systems, including proteins, social networks, and ecosystems, which decrease intermodular links, form compact modules, and disintegrate globally in initial crisis phase.
A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of amiodarone in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, a chronic condition caused by Trypanosoma cruzi prevalent in Latin America. Nine studies (3 before-after studies, 5 case series, and 1 randomized trial) were included, with 2 providing full datasets for individual patient-level analysis. Amiodarone significantly reduced ventricular tachia episodes by 99.9% (CI 99.8-100%), ventricular beats by 93.1 (82-97.4%), and ventricular couplets by 79% (RR 0.21, CI 0.11-0.39) in 24-hour Holter. Studies not included in individual data analysis showed similar reductions in ventricular beats, tachia, and couplets. Meta-analysis pooled incidence of adverse effects associated with amarone included corne microdepos 61.1 (19-91.5), gastrointestinal 16.1 (6-34.23), bradycardia 12.7 (3-35.6), dermatological 10.6 (4-21.93), and discontinuation 7.68 (4-13.75). Quality evidence ranged from moderate to low. Amiodone is effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias but lacks evidence for hard endpoints (sudden death, hospitalization).
A study was conducted to investigate the seasonal patterns of deng fever in rural Ecuador from 2009-2016 using medical records from two hospitals. Poisson generalized modeling was used to determine short and long-term patterns of deng fever, as well as the effect of day of the week and public holidays. A subset analysis examined the impact of school schedules on school-aged children, and a separate model evaluated the effect of climate on diagnosis. Results showed that annual sinusoidal fluctuations in disease, long-term trends, day of the week, and hospital were significant predictors of deng fever. Seasonal trends peaked in mid-March, with more cases diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and fewer on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays were not significant predictors except for an increase on the day after Christmas. School schedules did not impact deng diagnoses in school children. Climate variables included total precipitation, interaction between precipitation and minimum temperature, interaction between precipitation and days, and three-way interaction between temperature, precipitation, and days.
Researchers have explored the potential of the innate immune system as an alternative to adaptive immunity in combating emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, which can take years or decades to develop. They found that expressing a picornavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) in the absence of other viral proteins can activate the innate immune system without triggering autoimmunity or chronic inflammation. RRP-transgenic mice showed long-term upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and resistance to lethal viral challenge. The mechanism operates through MDA and MAVS and is independent of the adaptive system. Human models recapitulated the findings with RRP inducing an IS network and blocking HIV-1 infection. The RRP mechanism does not depend on secondary structure but operates at the protein level and requires catalysis. Despite massive IS elevations, RRP mice are healthy with normal longevity. The study provides a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiral protection.
Effective population size (Ne) plays a crucial role in determining the strength of genetic drift and frequency of co-infection by multiple genotypes in viral evolution. However, estimates of Ne for plant viruses have yielded diverging results. The independent action hypothesis (IAH) proposes that each virion has a probability of infection, and virions act independently during the infection process. A corollary of IAH is that Ne must be dose-dependent. To test IAH for a plant virus, a study was conducted using Tobacco etch virus (TEV) variants carrying GFP or mCherry fluorescent markers in Nicotiana tabum and Capsicum plants. The number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose and followed a Poisson distribution. At high doses, primary foci containing both genotypes were found at low frequency (<2%). The probability of a genotype infecting the inoculated leaf systemically infecting the plant was near 1, although rare genotypes could be trapped in the inoculated leaf by surrounding other genotypes. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection was predicted by the mean primary foci using the independent model. Independent action holds for TE, and Ne is dose-dependent for this RNA virus. The number of virions causing systemic infection can be small, approaching 1 at low doses.
Researchers have developed a new statistical framework for analyzing gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) in multiple tissues simultaneously, addressing a limitation of previous studies that focused on single tissues or cell types. This Bayesian approach, called Sparse Regression for eQTL, enables joint analysis of gene expression across tissues with genetic variants. In a study of 2,000 genes across four tissues, the method outperformed traditional approaches in revealing the complexity of the QTL landscape at the systems-level. A previously undetected cis-QTL for the Hopx gene was experimentally validated, demonstrating the method's power. Approximately 27% of transcripts showed common regulation across tissues, resulting in a 5-fold increase in QTL detection compared to single-tissue analyses at 5% false discovery rate. This study provides new insights into complex genetic control of gene expression and the generality of the approach makes it adaptable to other models and humans, enabling analysis of multiple and whole-body phenotypes.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how extrinsic apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death, is controlled. Extrinsic apoptosis is triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or TN-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which activates initiator caspases, enzymes that then activate downstream effector caspases to dismantle the cell. This process is controlled by a variable-delay, snap-action switch, allowing cells to choose between life and death. The model, based on mass-action representation of reaction pathways, was trained with data from live-cell imaging, flow cytometry, and immunoblot of cells with protein depletion and overexpression. The model accurately reproduces normal and perturbed cells exposed to TRAIL, enabling detailed study of switching mechanisms. Analysis and experiments show that initiator casp-8 activity and reaction rates downstream of TR receptor determine delay duration to effector caspase activation. Sudden effector caspase activation is achieved by mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and Smac relocalization. Bcl-2 family interactions, Smac partition from XIAP, and pore assembly mechanics are critical for snap control.
During pregnancy, the placenta acts as a protective barrier against maternal immune responses, bacterial, and viral pathogens. Listeria monocytogen, a bacterial pathogen, has evolved mechanisms to breach this barrier, providing an opportunity to study the placenta's protective function. The L. monocytogen protein Internalin (InP) is a secreted virulence factor critical for placental infection. This study shows InP binds to afadin, a protein associated with cell junctions, but not the similar L. monocogenin Lmo7. The InP structure features an extended leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain with a Ca2+-binding site. Despite af's role in cell junction formation, MDCK cells expressing InP exhibit decreased traction on substrates, similar to AF-6 knockout MDCK cells. L monocogenΔinP mutants are deficient in actin protrusions from polarized epithelial monolayers, necessary for transcytosis. A similar phenotype is observed in bacteria with an in-frame InP deletion (InPΔRR) disrupting interaction with af. However, af deletion in host cells does not rescue transcyt defect. Secreted InP targets cytosolic af to promote L monocogen transcyt across epithelial monolayers, contributing to crossing the basement membrane during placental infection.
Researchers characterized the proteome of Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, the causative agent of syphilis, using complementary mass spectrometry techniques. A total of 603 peptides were detected, corresponding to 557 unique proteins at a high confidence level, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. This is the most comprehensive description of the T. pallum proteome to date. The study used multidimensional separation and identification via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF/TO) and electrospray ionization (ESI-TQ-Orbit) tandem mass spectrometry on T. pallum subspecies pallum DAL-1 strain isolated from rabbits. Detected proteins were annotated according to predicted function and localization, with half categorized into various functional groups. One hundred and fourteen proteins were previously annotated as hypothetical or uncharacterized, with this being the first identification at protein level. Proteins with unclear annotations were subjected to bioinformatics analysis for further characterization. A hundred and sixteen potential membrane proteins were identified, of which 16 had outer membrane localization evidence. Eight proteins related to the paralog tpr gene family were found. Protein abundance was semi-quantified using label-free counting methods. Low correlation was found between microarray data and protein abundance. The study provides valuable insights into in vivo T. pallum protein expression and pathogenicity.
Protein kinase A (PKA) is a key receptor for the secondary messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in eukaryotes. AMP binds to two tandem AMP-binding domains (CBD-A and -B) within the regulatory subunit of PKA (R), unleashing the activity of the catalytic subunit (C). The study investigated the dynamics of the two-domain construct RIα (91-379) in its apo, cAMP, and c-bound forms using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Comparative NMR analyses revealed a double conformation selection model where each CBD samples both active and inactive states independently of the adjacent CBD within a degenerate free energy landscape. This degener is critical for the gate function of CBD-B, which modulates the control exerted by CBD-A. Binding of cAMP eliminates degener, stabilizing the active conformation within CBD and inter-C contacts, which require cAMP. The inter-C interface is dispensable for intra-C conformation selection but indispensable for PK activation as it occludes C-sub sites within CBD-A. Structurally homolog c-bound CBDs exhibit marked differences in residual profiles, suggesting conservation of structure does not imply dynamics.
Researchers investigated the role of interferon-stimulated gene 15 (IS15) in the function of macrophages following vaccinia virus infection. They compared the proteomes of IS15- and IS+ bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMD) after vaccinia virus (V) infection. The results showed that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were altered in IS- MD treated with interferon. Mitochondrial respiration, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production were higher in IS+ MD than IS- MD following interferon treatment, indicating IS-dependent mechanisms. IS depletion led to a change in macrophage polarization. IS- macrophages showed a pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern typical of M1 phenotype, but blocked nitric oxide (NO) production and arginase activation. Following interferon treatment, NO release was higher in IS+ macroph than IS- macro concomitant with decrease in viral titer. IS- macroph were permissive for VV replication following interferon treatment. The study demonstrates that IS governs mitochondrial function, specifically oxidative phosphorylation and mitagy, broadening its role as antiv agent.
HIV-1 protein Vpu plays a crucial role in viral replication by degrading the cellular receptor CD4 and enhancing viral particle release. V binds CD4 and recruits the βTr subunit of the SCβCP ubiquitin ligase complex through its constitutively phosphorylated DS52XX56 motif, escaping degradation while inhibiting βTr targets such as β-caten and Iκα. This study investigated V's inhibitory function on Em1 and Cdc25, β substrates in cell cycle progression. Phosphorylation of V at serine 61, adjacent to βTr-binding motif, triggers β-independent degradation. Mutation V S61 in HIV-1 extends protein half-life and increases particle release from HeLa cells. The S determinant is conserved in HIV-1 isolates. Phosphorylation of V determines fate as adaptor or substrate of ubiquinases. Conservation of V degradation, despite negative effect on release, suggests role in overall HIV fitness.
Researchers investigated the relationship between tissue patterning and whole-body development in Drosophila larvae to understand how robustness against environmental and physiological perturbations is achieved. Two hypotheses were proposed: tissue pattering is coordinated with whole-body development over time, and patterning aligns at developmental milestones. A staging scheme for wing imaginal discs was developed using canonical patterning genes linked to whole-body events: moulting, larval, and pupation. The scheme was used to explore pattern progression changes when development time was altered by temperature or hormone synthesis. Results showed pattern alignment at moul and pupation, indicating these events represent milestones. Between milestones, pattern showed variability in response to temperature and physiological changes. Discs from wandering larvae showed greater variability in patterning, suggesting it is not a milestone. Findings indicate patter remains robust against perturbations by aligning at milestones. This work provides insight into how individual tissue development is coordinated with the body as a whole.
In polarized cells, such as fungal hyphae, endosomes play a crucial role in both endocytosis and long-distance transport of various cargoes, including mRNA and protein complexes. However, the interplay between these processes is not well understood. This study demonstrates that the ESCRT regulator Did coordinates endosomal transport in hyphae of Ustago may. Loss of Did results in defective vacuolar targeting, reduced long-distance transport, and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. The late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease P1 exhibit increased shuttling on these aberrant endosomes, indicating defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Molecular motors fail to attach, explaining disturbed processive movement. Additionally, the endosomal RNP linker Up1 is absent from endosomes, leading to defects in long-distance mRNA transport.
Researchers conducted a comparative study on the adenine riboswitches of Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulnus, two types of ligand-binding elements that regulate bacterial mRNAs at the transcriptional or translational level. While both bind adenine, the riboswitches differ in their regulatory mechanisms, with B. subtilis controlling transcription and V. vulnus translation. The study revealed differences in ligand binding properties and operating regimes between the two riboswitches. The B. subtil ribwitch relies on co-transcriptional binding of adenine for function, whereas the V. vulus ribwitch can bind adenine post-transcriptionally and still regulate translation. Further investigation showed that transcription rate is crucial for B. subtil ribwitch efficiency, consistent with co-transcription regulation. The findings suggest that the nature of regulation, transcription or translation, plays a significant role in ribwitch mechanisms.
Researchers have identified a conserved pattern of primer-dependent transcription initiation (PDI) in Escheria coli and Vibrio cholera using high-throughput sequencing of RNA 5' ends (5 RNA-seq). PDI is a process where a 2-4 nucleotide oligonucleotide primer is used to initiate transcription, previously shown to be prevalent at promoters of genes during stationary phase growth in E. coli. coli. This study establishes a physiological role for P in E. coli as a regulatory mechanism modulating biofilm formation and demonstrates its occurrence in the pathogenic bacterium V. cholera. A comparative analysis of P in V. cholera and E. coli reveals a striking similarity in the pattern of P. P is detected in stationary phase, not exponential, and preferentially at promoters with sequence T-1+1 or G-1+ (position 1 corresponding to de novo initiation). The study demonstrates a physiological role for P and suggests it may be widespread among Gammaprotebacteria. P in both E. coli and V. cholera occurs through a growth-dependent process leading to preferential generation of dinucleotides 5'-UA-3 and 5'-GG-3.
Researchers investigated the effect of parental genome imbalance on the expression of imprinted genes in Arabidopsis, a plant species. Imprinted genes are expressed by a single parental allele and play a crucial role in regulating growth and development. The parental conflict theory proposes that genome imbalance is mirrored by antagonistic regulation of imprinted genes, with maternal growth inhibitors and paternal enhancers. However, these hypotheses were not directly tested. This study examined the impact of genome imbalance on expression of Arabidopsis imprinted genes FERTIZATION INDEPENDENT SE2 (FIS) and FLOW WINGENING (FW) controlled by DNA methylation and MEA (ME) and PES (P1) by histone methylation. Results showed that genome imbalance deregulated expression of IS and P in an antagonistic manner, with increased dosage of inactive alleles causing loss of imprinting of IS and ME. IS controls histone methylation, repressing ME and P expression, but changes in P and ME could not be fully explained by fluctuations in IS expression. Parental dosage deregulates imprinting mechanisms independent of known regulators. The complexity of regulations between expressed and silenced imprinted genes in response to dosage does not support simple models from parental hypothesis.
Researchers have investigated the hierarchical organization of brain rhythms in the brain using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings, which exhibit oscillations of specific frequencies over a non-oscillatory background. These oscillations appear in the power spectrum as a collection of frequency bands evenly spaced on a logarithmic scale, preventing mutual entrainment and cross-talk. The study focuses on what brain rhythms reveal about functional connectivity, rather than how they emerge or are necessary for neural function. By constructing "virtual" brains" with dynamics similar to EEG/ME recordings, researchers found that these networks share structural and topological features with real brains. Mathematical techniques were used to reverse-engineer network architectures generating characteristic of brain dynamics, including spindles and sharp waves. Reconstructed networks display similar topological features and dynamics. Diseased brains (epileptic and schizophrenic) with altered oscillatory activity were also reverse-engineered, showing consistent alterations in connectivity and dynamics. Complexity, quantified by Tononi and Sporns Edelman, is a good indicator of brain fitness, as diseased brains display lower complexity than normal.
Researchers conducted a population structure analysis of 1,374 Hispanic individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) using 60,000 SNPs selected for linkage disequilibrium. The study included individuals from Central America (n=93), Cuba (n=50), the Dominican Republic (n=203), Mexico (n=708), Puerto Rico (n=192), and South America (n=111). Principal components (PCs) of ancestry from Hap phase and Human Diversity Panel (HGDP) were used to quantify Caucasian, African, and Native American origins. The third and fourth PCs revealed an axis aligning with South-to-N geographic location of HGDP Native samples, separating MESA Mexican from Central/South American samples. K-means clustering from four PCs defined four subgroups in the ESA cohort, aligning with self-identification: Dominican/Cub, Mexican, Central/South, and Rican. A pooled and stratified analysis of triglycerides SNPs in LPL and TR1 regions, previously reported in Caucasians but unconfirmed in Hispanics, showed significant association in both genes. The study highlights the importance of considering population structure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic studies in the US Hispanic population.
Elongator, a histone acetylase complex, interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) to modulate transcriptional silencing and sensitivity to DNA damage. The Elong complex, composed of six subunits, is involved in histone deposition onto replicating DNA during PCNA-dependent nucleosome assembly. This process is crucial for maintaining transcriptional silencing and genome stability. However, the regulation of these pathways is not well understood. This study reports an interaction between Elong and PCNA. Cells lacking El3, the catalytic subunit of Elong, exhibit partial silencing loss of reporter genes at telomere and HMR, and increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea (HU) and methanesulfonate (MS). Deletion of El3 or mutations in other El subunits compromise Elong formation and result in sil loss and HU sensitivity. El3 is required for S-phase progression in H presence. Epasis analysis shows el3 mutant sensitive to MS exacerbates MS cells lacking histone chaperone As1, C-1 and H3 acetylase R109. el3 has specific interactions with POL30 encoding PCNA, which binds Elong in vivo and vitro. Results uncover novel Elong role in transcription silencing and genome stability, linked to replication and repair PCNA.
Researchers have developed a machine-assisted literature triage method to improve the process of manually curating biomedical knowledge from publications. The traditional query-based method of retrieving relevant publications from PubMed often yields unsatisfactory results and is difficult to generate optimal queries. To address this, a deep learning-based method was proposed, trained on a gold-standard dataset of curated publications from UniProt/SwissProt and NHRIEB GWAS Catalog. The trained models classify and rank new publications for curation. The method was applied to the real-world curation of UniProt/SissProt and GWAS, outperforming current query-based methods in efficiency and enriching content. Precision was 1.81 and 2.99 times higher than query-based methods for UniProt/Siss and GWAS, respectively, without compromising recall. The method retrieved additional publications not found by query Uni/SProtiss. Results show the machine-assisted triage process is more efficient, allowing human curators to focus on quality improvement.
A gain-of-function mutations in the KCNJ2-encoded Kir2.1 channels underlie variant 3 (SQT3) of the short QT syndrome, which is associated with atrial fibrillation (AF). This study investigated the mechanistic link between QT3 mutations and atrial arrhythmogenesis and potential channel targets for treatment of QT3 using physiologically-detailed human atrial computer models. A model of the atrial action potential (AP) was modified to recapitulate functional changes in IK due to heterozygous and homozygous forms of D172 and E299 Kir2.1 mutations. Wild-type (WT) and mutant formulations were incorporated into multi-scale and heterogeneous models. Effects on AP duration (AP), conduction (CV), refractory period (ERP), tissue excitation threshold and rate-dependence, as well as wavelength re-entry (WL) were quantified. The D172 and E299 Kir.1 mutations produced distinct effects on IK and AP shortening. Both mutations decreased WL through reduction in ERP and CV. Stability of reentrant excitation in 2D and 3 tissue was mediated by changes tissueability and AP in conditions. Combined block of IK and IK was effective in terminating re-entry with heterozygous D172, whereas IK block alone may be safer for E299. Combined of IK and IK produced synergistic antiarrhythmic in both forms QT3. This study provides mechanistic insights atrial prohythm with QT2.1 mutations and highlights pharmacological for management of QT-linked AF.
Researchers investigated the potential of adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (ASC) in treating Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi (T. cruzi), in a mouse model of chagasic cardiopathy. ASC were injected intraperitoneally at 3 days post-infection (dpi) and tracked by bioluminescence, showing they remained in the abdominal cavity for up to 9 days, with most migrating to abdominal subcutaneous fat, an early parasite reservoir. ASC injection significantly reduced parasitemia, followed by decreased cardiac tissue parasitism and fibrosis at 30 dpi. Cytokine analysis in heart cells exposed to T. cruzi antigens showed an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated animals, while splenocytes produced a pro-inflammatory response, crucial for parasite control in placebo and ASC groups. However, splenocytes from ASC released higher IL-10 at 60 dpi. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed right ventricular (RV) dilation prevention in ASC-treated mice. Early ASC injection after T. cruz infection prevented RV remodeling through immune response modulation, promoting parasite control and heart protection from damage.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of structurally optimized analogs of Retro-2, a retrograde trafficking inhibitor, in limiting Leishmania infections in mammalian cells. Leish parasites reside in parasitophorous vacuoles (LPVs), and previous studies showed that Retro-2 reduced LP size and parasite numbers in L. mexicana infections. This study aimed to determine if analogs of Retro-2 with superior potency in inhibiting retrograde-dependent phenomena, such as polyavirus infection and Shiga toxin trafficking, were more effective against Leish infections. In addition to LP effects, analogs DHZ36 and DHZ36.1 limited Leish infection in macrophages with EC50 13.63±2.58μM and 10.57±2.66M, respectively, lower than Retro-2's 40.15M EC50. These analogs also reversed Leish induced IL-6 suppression by infected cells after LPS activation. Unlike Retro-2, analogs killed Leish parasites in axenic cultures, a desirable for treating Leish infections. Studies validated and extended the structure-activity relationship of Retro-2.
Researchers have developed a computational method to evaluate the sensitivity of nucleosomes to transcription factors along a given stretch of the genome. The method identifies sensitive factors as those with binding sites preferentially within nucleosome boundaries and lacking 10 base pair periodicity. Using this approach, the Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1 (AML-1) transcription factor, a regulator of immune gene expression, was predicted to be sensitive to nucleosomal regulation within the Ly49 gene family. This prediction was confirmed in an RMA cell line with natural expression of Ly49, using MNase-Seq to generate a nucleosome map of chromosome 6, where the Ly49 family is located. Analysis of this map revealed a specific depletion of nucleosomes at AML-1 binding sites in expressed Ly49 compared to silent Ly genes. The study suggests nucleosome regulation contributes to Ly gene expression. The method of predicting nucleosome sensitivity is proposed to aid in dissecting the role of nucleosomes in general.
Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDs) play a crucial role in orchestrating cell cycle progression, including genome duplication. CD activation depends on phosphorylation of their T-loop by CD-activating kinase (CAK). In animals, the known CA for CD2 and CD1 is cyclin-HCD7, which is constitutively active. The critical step is dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by C25 phosphatases rather than T-loop phosphorylation. Homolog CD4 and CD6 bound cyclins are integrators of mitogenic signaling cascades by inactivating the oncosuppressor p and cycle at the restriction point. Unlike CD1 and CD2 cyclin complexes, constitutive T phosphorylation of CD6 is weak, whereas T-loop phosphorylation at172 of CD4 is highly regulated. CD4 and CD6 phosphorylations are catalyzed by CD7 unclear. To answer, we used chemical-genetics with analogue-sensitive CD7 (as) mutant H116 cells, inhibited by adenine analogs. CD7 inhibition prevented phosphorylations CD6, but CD4 was partly dependent on p21. In response CD7 inhibition, p-binding CD increased conitantly with disappearance of phosphorylation p, localized S130 catalyzed by CD and CD2. S130 mutation p prevented CD phosphorylation and inhibited CD6 and CD2 phosphorylations p and p-bound CD. CD7 inhibition revealed crucial indirect CD7 involvement in CD4 phosphorylation and existence CD-activating other than CD7 and novel CD-dependent feedback by p phosphorylation CD and CD2 sustain activation p and restriction passage.
Researchers have identified a protein called DUET/M1 that plays a crucial role in the process of meiosis in Arabidopsis, a plant species of flowering plant. Meiosis is a process that produces haploid cells essential for sexual reproduction. The study found that DUET1 binds to a protein called H3me2 and this interaction is necessary for its function during meiosis. Additionally, DU1 is required for proper microtubule organization during meiosis, stage II, independently of its role in meiosis I. The protein shows stage-specific expression, being confined to diplotene. Two genes, TDM1 and JAS, are critical for cell cycle and spindle organization in meiosis and are targets of DU1, with T1 being a direct target. DU regulates microtub organization and cell transitions during meiosis and activates the meiotic gene T1. Expression analysis showed reduced expression of 12% of known meiotic genes in du mutant. The study reveals DU as transcriptional regulator during meiosis in plants and suggests that meiotic gene expression is stage-wise in plants, unlike yeast.
Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of CG repeats in the Fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Previous studies have shown that CG repeats are sufficient to cause neurodegeneration and that CG-binding proteins α and hnRNP A/B can modulate CG-mediated neurotoxicity. To investigate the role of α in CG-mediated neurodegeneration, a proteomic approach was used to identify over 100 proteins that interact with α. Notably, R62, the Drosophila ortholog of p68 helicase, was found to modulate CG-mediated neurodegeneration. This study found that CG repeats decrease R62 transcription, leading to the accumulation of H70 and additional mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses. The accumulation of these mRNAs, likely due to impaired export, may contribute to FAS pathogenesis.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that forms environmentally and clinically relevant biofilms, has been studied as a paradigm for biofilm development. The extracellular matrix of P. aerugin biofilm is a complex mixture of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. Researchers have directly visualized the product of the polyschar synthesis locus (Psl polyschar) at different stages of biofilm development. During attachment, P is anchored on the cell surface in a helical pattern, promoting cell-cell interactions and matrix assembly, holding bacteria in biofilm on surface. Chemical dissociation of P from bacterial surface disrupted P matrix and bio structure. During bio maturation, P accumulates on periphery of 3-D microcolonies, forming P matrix-free cavity in microcol center. At dispersion stage, cells appear in matrix. Dead and extracellular DNA (eDNA) concentrated in P-free area. Deletion of genes controlling cell death autolysis affected matrix and microcol formation dispersion. Data provide mechanism P. aerugin builds matrix and cavity for cell seeding. Visualization reveals P key matrix component.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a malignancy with poor prognosis, necessitating improved therapeutic strategies. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) are promising tools for identifying drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC. To be effective, these preclinical models must recapitulate PDAC molecular heterogeneity and validate patient-specific sensitivities. A comprehensive assessment of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and PDX from PD and metastasis was conducted, including a unique cohort of 5 'triplets' of primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. A pipeline was developed to score concordance between PD models and paired tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy variations. Tumour-model comparisons showed single-gene concord across major PD driver genes, but poor agreement across mutational load. Genome-wide chromosome analysis of structural (SV) events highlighted concordance across chromosomes with clustered SV. Ploidy presented a challenge in assessing copy changes; however, ploidy-correct copy states showed agreement between donor pairs. This study highlights PDX and PDO as transplantable systems for probing PD molecular properties, but may serve selective analyses across genomic complexity levels.
A genome-wide association study was conducted in 19,091 breast cancer cases and 20,606 controls of East-Asian descent, including Chinese and Japanese women, to identify genetic susceptibility loci for breast cancer. The study analyzed 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, then evaluated 5,365 SNPs in 3,972 and 3,852, followed by 94 SNPs in 5,203 and 5,138. The top 22 SNPs were investigated in 17,423 additional subjects (7,489 and 9,934). The study found a significant association between SNP rs9482, near TGF-β activated kinase 2 (TAB) gene on chromosome 6q25.1, with breast cancer risk, with a P-value 3.8×10^-12 in combined analysis. Adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) were 0.89 (0.85-0.94) and 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for A/G and A genotypes, respectively, compared to GG. SNP938 (P=1.9×10^-6) in ESR gene intron 5 and rs7107 (P=4.6×10^-7) at 11q24.3 also showed consistent association. This study provides evidence for novel breast susceptibility locus rs948 near TAB (6.25) and possible loci in ESR and 11.24.
Researchers conducted a study on a cohort of 230 Cryptococcus neoformans (C) isolates from HIV-positive patients in South Africa to investigate the relationship between genetic diversity and clinical outcomes of cryptococcal meningitis. The study used multi-locus sequence typing and in vitro virulence assays to correlate genetic data with clinical markers of disease in patients. Results showed high genetic diversity and variability in South African isolates compared to global types, with 50 sequence types grouped into main types VNI, VNII, and VNB, and 72% into 7 high-frequency types. Spatial analysis found no geographical clustering of patients' cryptococcal genotypes, suggesting reactivation of latent infection rather than recent acquisition. Comparison of MLST data with clinical parameters revealed a relationship between genetic lineage and outcome, with VNB lineage associated with worse survival (HR 3.35, CI 1.51-7.20, p=0.003), maintained after adjusting for prognostic indicators and treatment. In vitro assays on 89 isolates showed lineage-associated virulence, with VNII increased lacc activity (p=0.001) and ex vivo CSF survival (p0.000). Findings indicate Cryptoccus neoans is phenotypically heterogeneous and lineage plays role in cryptococcal virulence during human infection. Detailed understanding genetic diversity in Africa supports investigation of diversity across environments and risks posed to infection.
Researchers have identified the transcription factor Tec1 as a key component of a newly evolved signaling pathway that regulates the pheromone response in the white phenotype of Candida albicans. This discovery provides a comprehensive understanding of the pherone response pathway in the white phenotype of C. albicans and sheds light on how signaling pathways may evolve. The pherone response in C. albicans involves three distinct portions, each derived from different ancestral processes. The upstream components, including receptors, trimeric G protein, and MAP kinase cascade, are from the mating pathway. Tec1, a transcription factor targeted by the MAP pathway, is from filamentation, and white-specific downstream genes from biofilm. This evolution of the pherone pathway serves as a model for how signaling pathways evolve.
Researchers investigated the variation in genomic GC content among bacteria, which ranges from less than 20% to over 70%, attributing it to differences in mutation patterns. They analyzed synonymous polymorphism datasets from 149 species to test this hypothesis. A significant excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations was found in all but the most AT-rich bacteria, across diverse species. This excess is inconsistent with mutation bias, as it would imply GC-rich bacteria decreasing in GC content, which is unsustainable. Translational selection and gene conversion are also ruled out, as optimal codons are AT-rich and excess GC→SNPs observed in recombination-free datasets. Therefore, selection for increased GC-content is present in many species. Since GC-content is correlated with genomic-content, selection on base composition is also present in bacteria.
Researchers have developed a new approach to map the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in Kenya using observed data from 106,370 individuals in 945 cross-sectional surveys between 1974 and 2009. Ecological and climatic covariates were extracted from high-resolution satellite data and matched to survey locations. Bayesian-time geostatistical models were developed for each species and used to interpolate the probability of infection exceeding 20% across the country for 1989 and 2009. Maps for each species were integrated to estimate combined STH prevalence using the law of probability and a correction for associations. Population data were combined with models to estimate the population at risk and requiring treatment in 2009. In 2009, high endemicity was below 20% in most areas, with ≥20% around Lake Victoria and coast. Comparison of 198 and 200 show STH prevalence decreased over time. The model estimated 2.8 million school-age children in districts warrant treatment. Bayesian-time models can estimate STH prevalence and suggest a quarter of Kenya's school children live in high areas warranting mass treatment.
Researchers investigated the role of innate lymphocytes in immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. They established an in vitro system to study the interaction between innate and adaptive immune responses. Interferon-γ production was observed when splenocytes from uninfected mice were cultured with M-infected macrophages, resulting in suppressed bacterial replication. This control was dependent on CD1-restricted invariant NKT (iKT) cells, which required CD1 expression by infected macrophages and IL-12 and IL-18. iKT cells, even in small quantities, restricted M replication. To assess in vivo contribution, iKT cells were adoptively transferred into mice. Primary splenic iKT from uninf mice significantly reduced bacterial burden in lungs of mice infected with virulent M by aerosol route. iKT had direct bactericidal effect without synthetic ligand α-galactosceramide. iKT protected mice against aerosol M infection, demonstrating CD-restricted N cells mediate protection against M in vivo.
Researchers investigated the regulation of Bacillus subtilis spore coat transglutaminase (Tgl), an enzyme responsible for cross-linking proteins in the bacterial endospore coat. Unlike other transglutases, Tgl is produced in an active form and catalyzes amine incorporation and cross-linking in vitro with no additional requirements. To understand how T's activity is controlled during spore assembly, they found that substrates assembled onto the spore prior to T production govern T's localization to the surface. T's residues for substrate recognition are crucial for its localization, with glutamyl (Q) and lys (K) docking sites identified. The first reaction step, interaction with substrates and acyl-enzyme formation, determines T's localization. In solution, T forms a hexamer that cross-links into high molecular weight forms, and becomes part of cross-products during reaction. This suggests T's dependency on substrates controls time, location, and extent of activity, directing covalentification of pre-assembled complexes at sp surface.
A cross-sectional parasitological and questionnaire survey was conducted in 51 villages in Champasak province, Lao PDR, in the first half of 2007. The study aimed to map the distribution of Opisthorchis viverrin, a foodborne trematode species causing biliary diseases and cholangiocarcinoma, identify underlying risk factors, and predict prevalence at non-survey locations. Data on demography, socioeconomic status, water, sanitation, and behavior were combined with remotely sensed environmental data into a geographical information system. Bayesian statistical models were employed to identify factors and investigate spatial pattern of Opisthoris vivin infection. Bayesian krig was utilized to predict risk at non-survey locations. The prevalence of Opistis viv among 3,371 participants with complete records was 61.1%. Statistical models identified age, Lao ethnic group, educational attainment, occupation (farmer, fisherman, animal breeder), and unsafe water source as risk factors. History prazant treatment, access sanitation, and distance to freshwater were protective. Spatial patterns Opis were governed by environmental factors, predictive identifying two risk profiles: low in mountains and high in Mekong corridor. A risk map of Opis infection in Champak province was presented, important for targeting control efforts. Infection Opis associated with exposure intermediate host, human behavior, culture, transmission sustained lack sanitation.
In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, the presence of Anopheles and Cule mosquito larvae is common, contributing to the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and malaria. A study investigated the importance of drains as larval habitats, using data from the Urban Malaria Control Program (UMCP) and a special survey conducted in 2006. The study found that more than 70% of larval habitats in Dar Sala were human-made, with aquatic habitats associated with agriculture having the highest proportion of Anophe larvae and Cule presence. However, the majority of aquatic habitats were drains (42%), with 43% (1,364/3,149) of all culicine and 33% (320/976) of anopheline habitats being drains. Compared to drains with flowing water, the odds of Anophe and Cx larvae were 8.8 and 6.3 (p<0.001) times larger in stagnant water. There was a positive association between vegetation and mosquito presence (p<0.001). The proportion of habitats with larvae was spatially correlated. Restoring and maintaining drains in Dar Sala has the potential to eliminate more than 40% of mosquito larval habitats treated with laricides by UMCP. The study highlights the importance of human-made larval habitats for lymphatic filasis and malaria vectors, underscoring the need for synergy between control efforts.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection leads to changes in lipid metabolism within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of infected cells, favoring viral replication. Previously, it was found that DENV inhibits HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR) phosphorylation, creating a cholesterol-rich environment for replication. This study investigated the relationship between HMG activity and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in DENV-infected cells. Enzymatic assays, ELISA, and Western blotting revealed increased HMG activity in DENV-infected cells, associated with AMPK inactivation. Metformin, an AMPK activator, decreased HMG activity, suggesting AMPK mediates HMG activity. AMPK phosphorylation was reduced in DENV-infected cells at 12 and 24 hours post-infection. HMG and cholesterol co-localized with viral proteins NS3, NS4A, and E, indicating HMG and AMP activity in replicative complex formation. Metform and lovastatin, an HMG inhibitor, altered co-localization and replicative formation, supporting active HMG in replicative complexes. Metform showed dose-dependent antiviral effect in DENV-infected cells, while compound C, an AMP inhibitor, increased viral genome copies and infected cells. PP2, HMG phosphatase, was unaffected by DENV infection. Elevated HMG in DENV cells is due to AMPK inhibition, not PP2 activity. PP inhibition showed antiral effect in HMG-independent manner. DENV infection increases HMG through AMPK inactivation, raising ER cholesterol for replicative complexes.
Researchers used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 70S ribosome to investigate the kinetics and energy landscape of tRNA translocation. The simulation spanned 2.1 million atoms and 1.3 microseconds, allowing for a detailed examination of specific conformational events during the process. Starting from a pre-translocation configuration, the study identified sets of residues undergoing rotary rearrangements implicated in ribosome function. Diffusion coefficients along collective coordinates of translocation were estimated to convert between experimental rates and energy measures of the landscape. This analysis, combined with previously reported rates of translocation, provided an upper-bound of free-energy associated with trans. The study focused on a particular kinetic scheme of translocation, but the framework is general and can be applied to energetic and kinetic descriptions with any number of intermediates and states.
Researchers investigated the genetic landscape of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) by analyzing formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues from 84 sporadic MTC patients and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel. They identified 101 mutations in 18 genes in MTC samples, with the most common being in the RET proto-oncogene (47 cases), followed by mutations in HRAS (14), STK11 (11), KIT (6), MLH1 (4), KIT (3), and MET (3). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and break-ap fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), with 2 of 98 cases positive for ALK. Targeted sequencing of DNA from two patients' tumor samples revealed glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GF1)-ALK and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein 4 (E4)-ALK fusions. PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed GF1-ALK, indicating an intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. A metastatic M case with E4ALK showed response to AL inhibitor crizotinib. The study found several mutations in MTC and first identified AL fusions in M, suggesting E4ALK may be a driver and target for AL inhibitors, and GFALK a candidate for molecular therapy.
In Malda district, West Bengal, India, a study was conducted to evaluate the role of asymptomatic Leishmaniasis in the transmission of Visceral Leishiasis (VL) and Post Kala-azar Dermal Leishias (PKDL) in an endemic areas. A total of 289 individuals were screened for antileman antibody using K39 rapid diagnostic kits, out of which 185 were positive, 96 had a history of VL/PKDL and 89 did not. 79 were classified as asymptomatic Leishias and 10 as active VL with a ratio of 7.9:1. Among asymptomatic cases, 2 were lost to follow-up as they moved to other places. Disease transformation in 8/77 (10.39%) and seroconversion 62/77 (80.52%) were noted in asymptomatic individuals. 7 (9.09%) remained ser-positive after 3 years. Progression to disease among asymptomatic individuals occurred up to 3 years after baseline. In areas with no VL/PK cases for 2 years, it does not mean free from Leishias as sympt VL/PK may appear after 3 if asymptomatic. Asympt individuals need attention for VL elimination programme initiated by adjoining countries.
Researchers used Multiplex Ligation-Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to analyze genome rearrangements in Saccharomyces cerevisiae caused by the presence of the retrotransposon Ty. They found that the distribution of translocations induced by Ty was nonrandom and majority were mediated by six targets on four chromosomes, despite 254 potential targets in the genome. Most Ty-mediated translocations resulted from RAD-dependent recombination, but some were mediated by RAD-independent recombination between Ty elements. RAD-independent trans did not require Rad51 or Rad59 homolog pairing or Rad1-10 endonuc complex. Defects in ASF1-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 resulted in increased genome rearrangements and aneuploidy, which often occurred with rearrangements. MLPA is a technique for rapid analysis of rearrangements, facilitating study of pathways that prevent and promote rearrang and aneupidy.
Researchers have developed a new method for protein docking, called semi-definite programming underestimation (SD), which uses a quadratic function to underestimate a set of local energy minima in the space of rigid body motions (SE(3) while accounting for flexibility of the interface chains. The method minimizes funnel-shaped energy functions in the space of rigid motions, driven by favorable interactions in the neighborhood of the native state. A strategy is introduced to separate variables for side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance of two proteins, and five angular descriptors of relative orientations. This improves efficiency by turning the five-dimensional space into a well-behaved energy surface for underestimation. The algorithm explores the energy surface spanned by encounter complexes corresponding to local energy minima, similar to macromolecular association through collisions. Results show that the energy landscape is a funnel in a broad neighborhood of the native and SD generates predictions with less than 5Å ligand interface root-mean-square deviation, achieving a 20-fold efficiency gain over Monte Carlo methods.
