    Title: 
    Abstract: The intensification of intervention activities against the fatal vector-borne disease gambiense human African trypanosomiasis ( gHAT , sleeping sickness ) in the last two decades has led to a large decline in the number of annually reported cases . However , while we move closer to achieving the ambitious target of elimination of transmission ( EoT ) to humans , pockets of infection remain , and it becomes increasingly important to quantitatively assess if different regions are on track for elimination , and where intervention efforts should be focused . We present a previously developed stochastic mathematical model for gHAT in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) and show that this same formulation is able to capture the dynamics of gHAT observed at the health area level ( approximately 10 , 000 people ) . This analysis was the first time any stochastic gHAT model has been fitted directly to case data and allows us to better quantify the uncertainty in our results . The analysis focuses on utilising a particle filter Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) methodology to fit the model to the data from 16 health areas of Mosango health zone in Kwilu province as a case study . The spatial heterogeneity in cases is reflected in modelling results , where we predict that under the current intervention strategies , the health area of Kinzamba II , which has approximately one third of the health zone’s cases , will have the latest expected year for EoT . We find that fitting the analogous deterministic version of the gHAT model using MCMC has substantially faster computation times than fitting the stochastic model using pMCMC , but produces virtually indistinguishable posterior parameterisation . This suggests that expanding health area fitting , to cover more of the DRC , should be done with deterministic fits for efficiency , but with stochastic projections used to capture both the parameter and stochastic variation in case reporting and elimination year estimations .

    ","Researchers have made significant progress in reducing the number of reported cases of Gambian human trypanosomiasis (HAT), a fatal vector-borne disease, over the past two decades through intensified interventions. However, pockets of infection remain, and it is crucial to assess which regions are on track for elimination and where efforts should be focused. A stochastic model for AT in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) was developed and fitted to data from 16 health areas in Mosango zone, Kivu province, using particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCM) methodology. The model captures the dynamics of AT at the health district level (approximately 10,000 people) for the first time, allowing for quantification of uncertainty in results. Spatial heterogeneity in cases is reflected in the results, predicting that Kinamba II, with one-third of the zone's cases, will be the last to reach elimination target. Deterministic version of the AT model using MCM is faster than stochastic, but produces similar posteriorisation. This suggests using deterministic fits for health area expansion and stochastic for projections to capture variation in reporting and elimination estimations."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Tumor microenvironments ( TMEs ) contain vast amounts of information on patient’s cancer through their cellular composition and the spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cell populations . Exploring variations in TMEs between patient groups , as well as determining the extent to which this information can predict outcomes such as patient survival or treatment success with emerging immunotherapies , is of great interest . Moreover , in the face of a large number of cell interactions to consider , we often wish to identify specific interactions that are useful in making such predictions . We present an approach to achieve these goals based on summarizing spatial relationships in the TME using spatial K functions , and then applying functional data analysis and random forest models to both predict outcomes of interest and identify important spatial relationships . This approach is shown to be effective in simulation experiments at both identifying important spatial interactions while also controlling the false discovery rate . We further used the proposed approach to interrogate two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients . The methods proposed are publicly available in a companion R package funkycells .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Abnormally strong neural synchronization may impair brain function , as observed in several brain disorders . We computationally study how neuronal dynamics , synaptic weights , and network structure co-emerge , in particular , during ( de ) synchronization processes and how they are affected by external perturbation . To investigate the impact of different types of plasticity mechanisms , we combine a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic weight and/or structural plasticity mechanisms: ( i ) only spike-timing-dependent plasticity ( STDP ) , ( ii ) only homeostatic structural plasticity ( hSP ) , i . e . , without weight-dependent pruning and without STDP , ( iii ) a combination of STDP and hSP , i . e . , without weight-dependent pruning , and ( iv ) a combination of STDP and structural plasticity ( SP ) that includes hSP and weight-dependent pruning . To accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing , STDP , and SP , we introduce a simple stochastic SP model , enabling detailed numerical analyses . With tools from network theory , we reveal that structural reorganization may remarkably enhance the network’s level of synchrony . When weaker contacts are preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning , synchrony is achieved with significantly sparser connections than in randomly structured networks in the STDP-only model . In particular , the strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher natural firing rates to those with lower rates and the weakening of contacts in the opposite direction , followed by selective removal of weak contacts , allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections . This activity-led network reorganization results in the emergence of degree-frequency , degree-degree correlations , and a mixture of degree assortativity . We compare the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model ( i ) with the desynchronization of models ( iii ) and ( iv ) . The latter require stimuli of significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization . These findings may inform future pre-clinical and clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive stimulus modalities aiming at inducing long-lasting relief of symptoms , e . g . , in Parkinson’s disease .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Some animals can regenerate large missing regions of their nervous system , requiring mechanisms to restore the pattern , numbers , and wiring of diverse neuron classes . Because injuries are unpredictable , regeneration must be accomplished from an unlimited number of starting points . Coordinated regeneration of neuron-glia architecture is thus a major challenge and remains poorly understood . In planarians , neurons and glia are regenerated from distinct progenitors . We found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing a Delta-encoding gene , delta-2 , at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems . Planarian glia are specified later from dispersed Notch-1-expressing mesoderm-like phagocytic progenitors . Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians , but did not affect the specification of other phagocytic cell types . Loss of several delta-2-expressing neuron classes prevented differentiation of the glia associated with them , whereas transplantation of delta-2-expressing photoreceptor neurons was sufficient for glia formation at an ectopic location . Our results suggest a model in which patterned delta-2-expressing neurons instruct phagocytic progenitors to locally differentiate into glia , presenting a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types .

    ","Researchers have studied the process of regeneration in planarians, a type of flatworm, to understand how they can regrow missing parts of their nervous system. Planarians can regenerate large regions of their nervous system, including neurons and glia, which are types of non-neuronal cells. However, this process is challenging due to the unpredictability of injuries and the need to regenerate from multiple starting points. In planarians, neurons and glia come from distinct progenitor cells. The study found that planarians first express a gene called delta-2 in neurons in central and peripheral nervous systems, while glia come from mesodermal phagocytic progenitors that express Notch-1. Inhibiting delta-2 or Notch-1 reduced glia in planarians, but not other phocytic cell types. Loss of delta-2-expressing neurons prevented glia differentiation associated with them, while transplanting delta-2-express photoreceptors formed glia at ectopic locations. The study suggests a model where delta-2-express neurons instruct phocytic progenitors to differentiate into glia, a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of cell numbers and types."

    Abstract: New HIV vaccine approaches are focused on eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies . We characterized early gamma-delta ( γδ ) T cell responses starting from pre-acquisition and during acute HIV infection ( AHI ) in participants previously characterized for neutralization breadth development . We found significant differences in γδ T cell surface marker expression in participants that developed neutralization breadth compared to those that did not . Activation of γδ T cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and associated with viral load . Expression of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells and CD57 on Vδ2 T cells were found to be significantly higher in broad neutralizers during AHI , and associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later . In addition , the levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells was associated with early production of founder virus Env-specific IgM . Thus , γδ T cells may promote development of neutralization breadth , which has implications for HIV vaccine strategies .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The spread of cancer from organ to organ ( metastasis ) is responsible for the vast majority of cancer deaths; however , most current anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing disease spread . It was recently discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner , and blockade of the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors ( IL-6R and IL-8R ) with a novel bispecific antibody , BS1 , significantly reduced metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer . Bispecific antibodies ( BsAbs ) , which combine two different antigen-binding sites into one molecule , are a promising modality for drug development due to their enhanced avidity and dual targeting effects . However , while BsAbs have tremendous therapeutic potential , elucidating the mechanisms underlying their binding and inhibition will be critical for maximizing the efficacy of new BsAb treatments . Here , we describe a quantitative , computational model of the BS1 BsAb , exhibiting how modeling multivalent binding provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design . We present detailed simulations of the monovalent and bivalent binding interactions between different antibody constructs and the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors to establish how antibody properties and system conditions impact the formation of binary ( antibody-receptor ) and ternary ( receptor-antibody-receptor ) complexes . Model results demonstrate how the balance of these complex types drives receptor inhibition , providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Although centrosomes help organize spindles in most cell types , oocytes of most species lack these structures . During acentrosomal spindle assembly in C . elegans oocytes , microtubule minus ends are sorted outwards away from the chromosomes where they form poles , but then these outward forces must be balanced to form a stable bipolar structure . Simultaneously , microtubule dynamics must be precisely controlled to maintain spindle length and organization . How forces and dynamics are tuned to create a stable bipolar structure is poorly understood . Here , we have gained insight into this question through studies of ZYG-8 , a conserved doublecortin-family kinase; the mammalian homolog of this microtubule-associated protein is upregulated in many cancers and has been implicated in cell division , but the mechanisms by which it functions are poorly understood . We found that ZYG-8 depletion from oocytes resulted in overelongated spindles with pole and midspindle defects . Importantly , experiments with monopolar spindles revealed that ZYG-8 depletion led to excess outward forces within the spindle and suggested a potential role for this protein in regulating the force-generating motor BMK-1/kinesin-5 . Further , we found that ZYG-8 is also required for proper microtubule dynamics within the oocyte spindle and that kinase activity is required for its function during both meiosis and mitosis . Altogether , our findings reveal new roles for ZYG-8 in oocytes and provide insights into how acentrosomal spindles are stabilized to promote faithful meiosis .

    Abstract: Circulating metabolite levels have been associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , but the extent to which T2D affects metabolite levels and their genetic regulation remains to be elucidated . In this study , we investigate the interplay between genetics , metabolomics , and T2D risk in the UK Biobank dataset using the Nightingale panel composed of 249 metabolites , 92% of which correspond to lipids ( HDL , IDL , LDL , VLDL ) and lipoproteins . By integrating these data with large-scale T2D GWAS from the DIAMANTE meta-analysis through Mendelian randomization analyses , we find 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D , all spanning lipid-related classes except for Glucose and Tyrosine . Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2D liability , spanning almost all tested classes , including branched-chain amino acids . Secondly , using an interaction quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis , we describe four metabolites consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank , for which genetic loci in two different genomic regions show attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls . The significant variants from the interaction QTL analysis are significant QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the general population but are not associated with T2D risk , pointing towards consequences of T2D on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels . Finally , through differential level analyses , we find 165 metabolites associated with microvascular , macrovascular , or both types of T2D complications , with only a few discriminating between complication classes . Of the 165 metabolites , 40 are not causally linked to T2D in either direction , suggesting biological mechanisms specific to the occurrence of complications . Overall , this work provides a map of the consequences of T2D on Nightingale targeted metabolite levels and on their genetic regulation , enabling a better understanding of the T2D trajectory leading to complications .

    Abstract: Staphylococcus aureus ( S . aureus ) colonizes humans asymptomatically but can also cause opportunistic infections , ranging from mild skin infections to severe life-threatening conditions . Resistance and tolerance are two ways a host can survive an infection . Resistance is limiting the pathogen burden , while tolerance is limiting the health impact of a given pathogen burden . In previous work , we established that collaborative cross ( CC ) mouse line CC061 is highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S . aureus infection ( MRSA , USA300 ) , while CC024 is tolerant . To identify host genes involved in tolerance after S . aureus infection , we crossed CC061 mice and CC024 mice to generate F1 and F2 populations . Survival after MRSA infection in the F1 and F2 generations was 65% and 55% and followed a complex dominant inheritance pattern for the CC024 increased survival phenotype . Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than in their parents , suggesting successful segregation of genetic factors . We identified a Quantitative Trait Locus ( QTL ) peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection . In this QTL , the WSB/EiJ ( WSB ) allele was present in CC024 mice and contributed to their MRSA tolerant phenotype . Two genes , C5ar1 and C5ar2 , have high-impact variants in this region . C5ar1 and C5ar2 are receptors for the complement factor C5a , an anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response by binding to these receptors . We hypothesize that C5a may have altered binding to variant receptors in CC024 mice , reducing damage caused by the cytokine storm and resulting in the ability to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and longer survival .

    Abstract: The tempo and mode of adaptation depends on the availability of beneficial alleles . Genetic interactions arising from gene networks can restrict this availability . However , the extent to which networks affect adaptation remains largely unknown . Current models of evolution consider additive genotype-phenotype relationships while often ignoring the contribution of gene interactions to phenotypic variance . In this study , we model a quantitative trait as the product of a simple gene regulatory network , the negative autoregulation motif . Using forward-time genetic simulations , we measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models . A key expectation from adaptive walk theory is that the distribution of fitness effects of new beneficial mutations is exponential . We found that both models instead harbored distributions with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected . The network model also had a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations , with a considerable density at deleterious selection coefficients . This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity , where correlations among traits constrain adaptation . Our results suggest that the interactions emerging from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects .

    Abstract: A fundamental function of cortical circuits is the integration of information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior . While animals behave as if they optimally integrate information according to Bayesian probability theory , the implementation of the required computations in the biological substrate remains unclear . We propose a novel , Bayesian view on the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses which suggests that they are naturally equipped to optimally perform information integration . In our approach apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials , while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials . These are parametrized by local quantities , the effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances . We formally demonstrate that under these assumptions the somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior . We derive a gradient-based plasticity rule , allowing neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities . Our theory explains various experimental findings on the system and single-cell level related to multi-sensory integration , which we illustrate with simulations . Furthermore , we make experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity .

In this view, apical dendrites represent prior expectations of somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parameterized by local quantities, effective potentials and conductances. The somatic compartment naturally computes the posterior under these assumptions. A gradient-based plasticity rule allows neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by their reliabilities. This theory explains experimental findings on single-cell and multi-sensory integration. Simulations illustrate the theory. Predictions on Bayesian dendritic and synaptic plasticity are made."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Protein structure prediction has now been deployed widely across several different large protein sets . Large-scale domain annotation of these predictions can aid in the development of biological insights . Using our Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains ( ECOD ) from experimental structures as a basis for classification , we describe the detection and cataloging of domains from 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database . On average , we can provide positive classification ( either of domains or other identifiable non-domain regions ) for 90% of residues in all proteomes . We classified 746 , 349 domains from 536 , 808 proteins comprised of over 226 , 424 , 000 amino acid residues . We examine the varying populations of homologous groups in both eukaryotes and bacteria . In addition to containing a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned domains , eukaryotes show a higher proportion of repeated proteins , both globular and small repeats . We enumerate those highly populated domains that are shared in both eukaryotes and bacteria , such as the Rossmann domains , TIM barrels , and P-loop domains . Additionally , we compare the sampling of homologous groups from this whole proteome set against our stable ECOD reference and discuss groups that have been enriched by structure predictions . Finally , we discuss the implication of these results for protein target selection for future classification strategies for very large protein sets .

    ","Researchers have applied the Evolutionary Classification of Domains (EC) framework to classify and catalog domains from 536,808 proteins in the AlphaFold database, covering 226,424,000 amino acid residues. They achieved accurate classification for 90% of residues, identifying 746,349 domains. The study examined domain populations in eukaryotes and bacteria, finding higher fractions of disordered regions and unassigned domains in eukotes. Eukotes also have more proteins with globular and small repeats. Shared domains between eukotes and bacteria include Rossm, TIM barrels, and P-loop. The study compared homolog groups from the proteome to the EC reference database, identifying enriched groups. The findings suggest implications for protein classification strategies in large sets."

    Title: 
    Abstract: BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure , for which there are no antivirals . The current model is that BKPyV expresses TAg ( large T antigen ) early during infection , promoting cells to enter S phase where the viral DNA can access the host replication machinery . Here , we performed a single-cell analysis of viral TAg expression throughout the cell cycle to reveal that robust TAg expression required replication of the host DNA first . By using inhibitors that only affect host and not viral replication , we show that both TAg expression and viral production rely on an initial S phase . BKPyV is known to promote cellular re-replication , where the cell re-enters S phase from G2 phase ( without passing through mitosis or G1 phase ) to prolong S phase for viral replication . Thus , BKPyV infection results in cells with greater than 4N DNA content . We found that these subsequent rounds of replication of the host DNA relied on canonical host cell cycle machinery and regulators despite BKPyV infection . Together , these findings suggest a model for polyomavirus replication , where robust viral TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase and that BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication . Having a better understanding of the molecular events that are required for BKPyV production will help identify effective therapeutic targets against BKPyV .

    ","Researchers have investigated the life cycle of BK polyomavirus (BKPyV), a major cause of kidney transplant failure with no current antiviral treatment, to understand how it replicates in host cells. They used single-cell analysis to track the expression of BKV's large T antigen (TAg) throughout the cell cycle and found that robust TAg expression is required for host DNA replication, not the other way around. By using inhibitors that only affect host replication, not viral, they showed TAg and viral production rely on initial S phase. BKV is known to promote cell re-entry into S phase from G2 without passing through G1 or mitosis, prolonging S for viral replication, resulting in cells with more than 4N DNA content. Subsequent rounds of host DNA replication rely on canonical cell cycle regulators despite BKV infection. These findings suggest a model for polyomavirus replication where robust TAg depends on initial S and BKV primarily replicates during host-replication. Understanding the molecular events required for BKV production may lead to effective targets against BKV."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Transcriptome-wide association studies ( TWAS ) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene expression mapping studies with genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ) . While most existing TWAS approaches focus on marginal analyses through examining one gene at a time , recent developments in TWAS fine-mapping methods enable the joint modeling of multiple genes to refine the identification of potentially causal ones . However , these fine-mapping methods have primarily focused on modeling quantitative traits and examining local genomic regions , leading to potentially suboptimal performance . Here , we present FABIO , a TWAS fine-mapping method specifically designed for binary traits that is capable of modeling all genes jointly on an entire chromosome . FABIO employs a probit model to directly link the genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) of genes to binary outcomes while taking into account the GReX correlation among all genes residing on a chromosome . As a result , FABIO effectively controls false discoveries while offering substantial power gains over existing TWAS fine-mapping approaches . We performed extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of FABIO and applied it for in-depth analyses of six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank . In the real datasets , FABIO significantly reduced the size of the causal gene sets by 27 . 9%-36 . 9% over existing approaches across traits . Leveraging its improved power , FABIO successfully prioritized multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases , including GATA3 for asthma , ABCG2 for gout , and SH2B3 for hypertension . Overall , FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Misfolded proteins are usually refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms . When misfolded proteins evade quality control , they can be sequestered to specific sites within cells to prevent the potential dysfunction and toxicity that arises from protein aggregation . Btn2 and Hsp42 are compartment-specific sequestrases that play key roles in the assembly of these deposition sites . Their exact intracellular functions and substrates are not well defined , particularly since heat stress sensitivity is not observed in deletion mutants . We show here that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress conditions induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide . Btn2 and Hsp42 act to sequester oxidized proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure and their absence leads to an accumulation of protein aggregates . The toxicity of protein aggregate accumulation causes oxidant sensitivity in btn2 hsp42 sequestrase mutants since overexpression of the Hsp104 disaggregase rescues oxidant tolerance . We have identified the Sup35 translation termination factor as an in vivo sequestrase substrate and show that Btn2 and Hsp42 act to suppress oxidant-induced formation of the yeast [PSI+] prion , which is the amyloid form of Sup35 . [PSI+] prion formation in sequestrase mutants does not require IPOD ( insoluble protein deposit ) localization which is the site where amyloids are thought to undergo fragmentation and seeding to propagate their heritable prion form . Instead , both amorphous and amyloid Sup35 aggregates are increased in btn2 hsp42 mutants consistent with the idea that prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress conditions in the absence of sequestrase activity . Taken together , our data identify protein sequestration as a key antioxidant defence mechanism that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation .

    Abstract: Glioblastoma ( GBM ) invasion studies have focused on coding genes , while few studies evaluate long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) , transcripts without protein-coding potential , for role in GBM invasion . We leveraged CRISPR-interference ( CRISPRi ) to evaluate invasive function of GBM-associated lncRNAs in an unbiased functional screen , characterizing and exploring the mechanism of identified candidates . We implemented a CRISPRi lncRNA loss-of-function screen evaluating association of lncRNA knockdown ( KD ) with invasion capacity in Matrigel . Top screen candidates were validated using CRISPRi and oligonucleotide ( ASO ) -mediated knockdown in three tumor lines . Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) and Genotype-Tissue Expression ( GTEx ) survival analysis . Mediators of lncRNA effect were identified via differential expression analysis following lncRNA KD and assessed for tumor invasion using knockdown and rescue experiments . Forty-eight lncRNAs were significantly associated with 33–83% decrease in invasion ( p<0 . 01 ) upon knockdown . The top candidate , LINC03045 , identified from effect size and p-value , demonstrated 82 . 7% decrease in tumor cell invasion upon knockdown , while LINC03045 expression was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade ( p<0 . 0001 ) . RNAseq analysis of LINC03045 knockdown revealed that WASF3 , previously implicated in tumor invasion studies , was highly correlated with lncRNA expression , while WASF3 KD was associated with significant decrease in invasion . Finally , WASF3 overexpression demonstrated rescue of invasive function lost with LINC03045 KD . CRISPRi screening identified LINC03045 , a previously unannotated lncRNA , as critical to GBM invasion . Gene expression is significantly associated with tumor grade and survival . RNA-seq and mechanistic studies suggest that this novel lncRNA may regulate invasion via WASF3 .

    Abstract: It has been classically conjectured that the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli .

We address this issue by using a new clustering procedure for sets of electroencephalographic ( EEG ) data recorded from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain . This clustering procedure indicates that the brain uses the recurrent occurrences of a regular auditory stimulus in order to build a model .

    Abstract: While single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) is a popular method to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution , it harbors shortcomings: The failure to account for cell-to-cell variations of transcriptome-size ( i . e . , the total number of transcripts per cell ) and also cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression . This is particularly a problem when analyzing highly heterogeneous solid tissues/organs , which requires cell dissociation for the analysis . As a result , there exists a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq result and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq result using its composite scRNA-seq data . To fix this problem , we propose a computationally calculated coefficient , “cell type-specific weighting-factor ( cWF ) ” . Here , we introduce a concept and a method of its computation and report cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs . Their fidelity is validated by more accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data of diverse solid organs using the scRNA-seq data and the cWFs of their composite cells . Furthermore , we also show that cWFs effectively predict aging-progression , implicating their diagnostic applications and also their association with aging mechanism .

    Abstract: Animal behavior spans many timescales , from short , seconds-scale actions to daily rhythms over many hours to life-long changes during aging . To access longer timescales of behavior , we continuously recorded individual Drosophila melanogaster at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in featureless arenas on sucrose-agarose media . We use the deep learning framework SLEAP to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances . We identify stereotyped behaviors such as grooming , proboscis extension , and locomotion and use the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies’ behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment . We find distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors , adding specific information about trends in different grooming modalities , proboscis extension duration , and locomotion speed to what is known about the D . melanogaster circadian cycle . Using our holistic measurements of behavior , we find that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies’ daily pattern of behavior , and that the behavioral composition of this hour tracks well with other indicators of health such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spend moving vs . resting . The method , data , and analysis presented here give us a new and clearer picture of D . melanogaster behavior across timescales , revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying biological mechanisms .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor type ( PTPNs ) have been studied extensively in the context of the adaptive immune system; however , their roles beyond immunoregulation are less well explored . Here we identify novel functions for the conserved C . elegans phosphatase PTPN-22 , establishing its role in nematode molting , cell adhesion , and cytoskeletal regulation . Through a non-biased genetic screen , we found that loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 ( human NEK8/NEK9 ) and NEKL-3 ( human NEK6/NEK7 ) , which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation . To better understand the functions of PTPN-22 , we carried out proximity labeling studies to identify candidate interactors of PTPN-22 during development . Through this approach we identified the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1 ( human DNMBP ) as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22 . Consistent with this interaction , loss of DNBP-1 also suppressed nekl-associated molting defects . Genetic analysis , co-localization studies , and proximity labeling revealed roles for PTPN-22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes , including C . elegans hemidesmosomes , suggesting that PTPN-22 plays a broad role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues . Localization and proximity labeling also implicated PTPN-22 in functions connected to nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation , particularly within the germline , as nearly one-third of proteins identified by PTPN-22 proximity labeling are known P granule components . Collectively , these studies highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel gene functions .

We use a comprehensive database from the WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 ( K13 ) gene , which are known to be associated with artemisinin resistance , and a Bayesian geostatistical model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artemisinin resistance . Our maps of estimated prevalence show an expansion of the K13 mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022 . Moreover , the period between 2010 and 2015 demonstrated the most spatial change across the region . Our model and maps provide important insights into the spatial and temporal trends of artemisinin resistance in a way that is not possible using data alone , thereby enabling improved spatial decision support systems on an unprecedented fine-scale spatial resolution . By predicting for the first time spatio-temporal patterns and extents of artemisinin resistance at the subcontinent level , this study provides critical information for supporting malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia .

    ","Malaria elimination efforts face a significant challenge due to the emergence of artemisinin resistance, a major antimalarial drug. If artem resistance spreads to Africa and India, malaria-related deaths are expected to increase substantially. Understanding the spread of artem resistance in Southeast Asia is crucial for health organizations to prioritize control measures. However, data on artem resistance are limited. A comprehensive database from the World Antimal Resistance Network was used to analyze the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kel 13 ( K ) gene, associated with artem resistance. A Bayesian geostatistical model was applied to produce spatio-temporal predictions oftem resistance. The results show an expansion of the K mutation across the Greater Mekong region from 2000 to 202, with the most change occurring between 2010 and 2015. The study provides critical information for malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia by predicting spatio-temporal patterns and extents oftem at the subcontinent level."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Function-to-find domain ( FIIND ) -containing proteins , including NLRP1 and CARD8 , are vital components of the inflammasome signaling pathway , critical for the innate immune response . These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain , resulting in full-length ( FL ) , cleaved N-terminal ( NT ) , and cleaved C-terminal ( CT ) peptides , which form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state . However , the detailed mechanism remains elusive . Here , we found that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT interactions and FL-CT interactions , but with distinct mechanisms . Specifically , the Linker3 region located between LRR and FIIND in murine NLRP1b ( mNLRP1b ) plays an essential role in forming the NT-CT autoinhibitory complexes , while the ZU5 of rat NLRP1 ( rNLRP1 ) and CARD8 mediates their NT-CT interaction . In addition , we explored the involvement of the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 ( DPP9 ) in these complexes , revealing differential interactions and the significance of domain structure . Besides the FL-DPP9-CT complex , DPP9 interacts with NTs of mNLRP1b , rNLRP1 , and CARD8 through their ZU5 subdomains , forming NT-DPP9-CT complex; however , DPP9 cannot bind to NTs of hNLRP1 . Further functional assay indicated that although DPP9 is involved in the NT-CT complex of rodent NLRP1 and CARD8 , it does not influence the inhibitory activity of NT on CT . Our study enhanced the understanding of the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation and underscored the complexity of their interactions within the immune response .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Defects in protein homeostasis can induce proteotoxic stress , affecting cellular fitness and , consequently , overall tissue health . In various growing tissues , cell competition based mechanisms facilitate detection and elimination of these compromised , often referred to as ‘loser’ , cells by the healthier neighbors . The precise connection between proteotoxic stress and competitive cell survival remains largely elusive . Here , we reveal the function of an endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi localized protein Rer1 in the regulation of protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium . Our results show that loss of Rer1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α . Clonal analysis showed that rer1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through cell competition . Interestingly , we find that Rer1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression that causes overgrowth , albeit under high proteotoxic stress . Our results suggest that increased levels of Rer1 provide cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells by alleviating the proteotoxic stress and thereby supporting Myc-driven overgrowth . In summary , these observations demonstrate that Rer1 acts as a novel regulator of proteostasis in Drosophila and reveal its role in competitive cell survival .

    ","Researchers investigated the role of the ER and Golgi localized protein R1 (R1) in regulating protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. They found that loss of R1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eukary initiation factor 2 (eIF2), a key regulator of protein synthesis. Cell analysis revealed that R1 mutant cells are identified as ""losers"" and eliminated through competition with healthier neighbors. Interestingly, R1 levels are upregulated in cells overexpressing Myc, which causes overgrowth despite high prote stress. This suggests that increased R1 provides protection to My-overexpressing cells by alleviating prote stress and supporting overgrowth. The study demonstrates R's novel role in regulating proteinostasis in Dophila and its function in competitive survival."

    Abstract: Loss of function mutations in the checkpoint kinase gene CHEK2 are associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers . Most of the 3 , 188 unique amino acid changes that can result from non-synonymous single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) of CHEK2 , however , have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHEK2-enocded protein ( CHK2 ) . One successful approach to testing the function of variants has been to test for their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2 , RAD53 . This approach has been used to provide functional information on over 100 CHEK2 SNVs and the results align with functional assays in human cells and known pathogenicity . Here we tested all but two of the 4 , 887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame for their ability to complement RAD53 mutants using a high throughput technique of deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) . Among the non-synonymous changes , 770 were damaging to protein function while 2 , 417 were tolerated . The results correlate well with previous structure and function data and provide a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases . Combined , this approach can be used to help predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance that are found in susceptibility screening and could be applied to other cancer risk genes .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae forms multiple epigenetically and phenotypically distinct intra-populations by invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant ( cod ) locus . As manifested by phase switch between opaque and transparent colonies , different genome methylation patterns or epigenomes confer pathogenesis-associated traits , but it is unknown how the pathogen controls the hsdS inversion orientations . Here , we report our finding of the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin ( TA ) system that regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions , and thereby bacterial epigenome and associated traits ( e . g . , colony opacity ) by targeting pneumococcal protein synthesis . SpxA1 and TenA were found to constitute a highly conserved type II TA system in S . pneumoniae , primarily based on the observation that overexpressing toxin TenA led to growth arrest in E . coli and enhanced autolysis in S . pneumoniae , and the antitoxin SpxA1 repressed the transcription of the spxA1-tenA operon . When the transcription of tenA was de-repressed by a spontaneous AT di-nucleotide insertion/deletion in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon , TenA bound to the ribosome maturation factor RimM , and thereby reduced the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX ( known for the activation of natural transformation-associated genes ) . Attenuation of ComX expression in turn enhanced the transcription of the invertase gene psrA , which favored the formation of the transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus . Phenotypically , moderate expression of TenA dramatically reshaped pneumococcal epigenome and colony opacity . Because spontaneous variations frequently occur during bacterial growth in the number of the AT di-nucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon , this locus acts as a programmed genetic switch that generates pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity .

    Abstract: High-dimensional data have become ubiquitous in the biological sciences , and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition . However , traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset . Contrastive principal component analysis ( cPCA ) has been proposed to address this problem , but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions , with no way of knowing which is correct . Moreover , cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently , making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically . Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA ( gcPCA ) , a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems . We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement . We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios . Finally , we demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data , revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data . As a fast , robust , and easy-to-use comparison method , gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena .

gcPCA was developed to address cPCA's hyperparameter requirement. cPCA requires a hyperparameter to determine the number of components to retain, resulting in multiple solutions with no knowing which is correct. gc uses a novel algorithm to determine optimal number of components, eliminating hyperparameter. gc also treats foreground and background equally, unlike c, making it suitable for comparing conditions symmetric.

The relevance of the crosstalk was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites . Compared to the starting network , the trained network for BL-2 cells was better transferable to BL-41 cells . Moreover , the BL-2 network was also suited to model BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells lines with aberrant BCR signaling ( HBL-1 , OCI-LY3 ) , indicating that BCR aberration does not cause a major downstream rewiring .

    Abstract: The ubiquitous Notch receptor signalling network is essential for tissue growth and maintenance . Operationally , receptor activity is regulated by two principal , counterposed mechanisms: intercellular Notch transactivation triggered by interactions between receptors and ligands expressed in neighbouring cells; intracellular cis inhibition mediated by ligands binding to receptors expressed in the same cell . Moreover , different Notch receptor/ligand combinations are known to elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses , and together , these phenomena determine the strength , the duration and the specificity of Notch receptor signalling . To date , it has been assumed that these processes involve discrete ligand homomers and not heteromeric complexes composed of more than one ligand species . In this study , we explore the molecular basis of the opposing actions of the Notch ligands , DLL4 and JAG1 , which control angiogenic sprouting . Through a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling , we provide evidence that two mechanisms could underpin this process: 1 ) DLL4 rather than JAG1 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation; 2 ) JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex . We propose a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells , which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis .

Many types of data have associated uncertainty or measurement error , but this is rarely used to inform the clustering .

    Abstract: Deep neural networks have been remarkably successful as models of the primate visual system . One crucial problem is that they fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision . Whereas humans base their judgements of category membership to a large extent on shape , deep networks rely much more strongly on other features such as color and texture . While this problem has been widely documented , the underlying reasons remain unclear . We design simple , artificial image datasets in which shape , color , and texture features can be used to predict the image class . By training networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations , we show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features , whereas others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards the other features . We show that the bias can be explained by the interactions between the weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent . This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser , more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hepatic stellate cells ( HSC ) are the source of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis , a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases . Understanding the dynamics of HSCs will provide insights needed to develop new therapeutic approaches . Few models of hepatic fibrosis have been proposed , and none of them include the heterogeneity of HSC phenotypes recently highlighted by single-cell RNA sequencing analyses . Here , we developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion . We used the Kappa graph rewriting language , for which we used tokens and counters to overcome temporal explosion . HSCs are modeled as agents that present seven physiological cellular states and that interact with ( TGFβ1 ) molecules which regulate HSC activation and the secretion of type I collagen , the main component of the ECM . Simulation studies revealed the critical role of the HSC inactivation process during fibrosis progression and reversion . While inactivation allows elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps , reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs ( iHSCs ) are required to sustain fibrosis . Furthermore , we demonstrated the model’s sensitivity to ( TGFβ1 ) parameters , suggesting its adaptability to a variety of pathophysiological conditions for which levels of ( TGFβ1 ) production associated with the inflammatory response differ . Using new experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis , we validated the predicted ECM dynamics . Our model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease . By analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associated with liver fibrosis , we confirmed this accumulation , identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression . Overall , our study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic liver disease that can be used to explore the regulatory role of iHSCs in liver homeostasis . Moreover , our model can also be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fibrosis in other tissues .

HSCs are modeled as agents with seven physiological states interacting with TGF-β molecules, which regulate H activation and secretion of type I collagen, a main component of the extracellular matrix (ECM). Simulations revealed the critical role of HSC inactivation during fibrosis progression and reversion. Inactivation eliminates activated Hs during reversion, while reactivation of inactivated Hs (iHs) sustains fibrosis. The model is sensitive to TGF-β parameters, adaptable to various pathophysiological conditions with differing Tβ levels. Experimental data from a mouse model of CCl-induced fibrosis validated predicted ECM dynamics. The model also predicts accumulation of is during chronic disease. RNA sequencing from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated fibrosis confirmed this, identifying is as novel fibrosis markers. This study provides the first model of H dynamics in chronic disease, exploring is role in liver homeostasis. The model can be generalized to fibroblasts and fibrosis in other tissues."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Meta-analysis is used to aggregate the effects of interest across multiple studies , while its methodology is largely underexplored in mediation analysis , particularly in estimating the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators . Large-scale genomic consortia , such as the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed ) program , comprise multiple cohorts with diverse technologies to elucidate the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits and diseases . Leveraging the recent established asymptotic standard error of the R-squared ( R2 ) -based mediation effect estimation for high-dimensional omics mediators , we have developed a novel meta-analysis framework requiring only summary statistics and allowing inter-study heterogeneity . Whereas the proposed meta-analysis can uniquely evaluate and account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies due to , for example , varying genomic profiling platforms , our extensive simulations showed that the developed method was more computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory operating characteristics comparable to analysis of the pooled individual-level data when there was no inter-study heterogeneity . We applied the developed method to 5 TOPMed studies with over 5800 participants to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol . The proposed method is available in R package MetaR2M on GitHub .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Cancer development is driven by an accumulation of a small number of driver genetic mutations that confer the selective growth advantage to the cell , while most passenger mutations do not contribute to tumor progression . The identification of these driver genes responsible for tumorigenesis is a crucial step in designing effective cancer treatments . Although many computational methods have been developed with this purpose , the majority of existing methods solely provided a single driver gene list for the entire cohort of patients , ignoring the high heterogeneity of driver events across patients . It remains challenging to identify the personalized driver genes . Here , we propose a novel method ( PDRWH ) , which aims to prioritize the mutated genes of a single patient based on their impact on the abnormal expression of downstream genes across a group of patients who share the co-mutation genes and similar gene expression profiles . The wide experimental results on 16 cancer datasets from TCGA showed that PDRWH excels in identifying known general driver genes and tumor-specific drivers . In the comparative testing across five cancer types , PDRWH outperformed existing individual-level methods as well as cohort-level methods . Our results also demonstrated that PDRWH could identify both common and rare drivers . The personalized driver profiles could improve tumor stratification , providing new insights into understanding tumor heterogeneity and taking a further step toward personalized treatment . We also validated one of our predicted novel personalized driver genes on tumor cell proliferation by vitro cell-based assays , the promoting effect of the high expression of Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 ( LRP1 ) on tumor cell proliferation .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Tuberculosis ( TB ) , the disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) , remains a major health problem with 10 . 6 million cases of the disease and 1 . 6 million deaths in 2021 . It is well understood that pulmonary TB is due to Mtb growth in the lung but quantitative estimates of rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of patients or animals such as monkeys or rabbits remain largely unknown . We performed experiments with rabbits infected with a novel , virulent clinical Mtb isolate of the Beijing lineage , HN878 , carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10 . In our in vitro experiments we found that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 strain than in a more commonly used laboratory-adapted Mtb strain H37Rv ( the segregation coefficient being s = 0 . 10 in HN878 vs . s = 0 . 18 in H37Rv ) . Interestingly , the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in lungs of Mtb-infected rabbits did not follow an expected monotonic decline; the percent of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late time points . Mathematical modeling suggested that such a non-monotonic change in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells can be explained if the lung Mtb population consists of several ( at least 2 ) sub-populations with different replication/death kinetics: one major population expanding early and being controlled/eliminated , while another , a smaller population expanding at later times causing a counterintuitive increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells . Importantly , a model with one kinetically homogeneous Mtb population could not explain the data including when the model was run stochastically . Given that in rabbits HN878 strain forms well circumscribed granulomas , our results suggest independent bacterial dynamics in subsets of such granulomas . Our model predictions can be tested in future experiments in which HN878-pBP10 dynamics in individual granulomas is followed over time . Taken together , our new data and mathematical modeling-based analyses illustrate differences in Mtb dynamics in mice and rabbits confirming a perhaps somewhat obvious observation that “rabbits are not mice” .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Protein ubiquitination is usually coupled with proteasomal degradation and is crucial in regulating protein quality . The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF ( Skp1-Cullin-F-box ) complex directly recognizes the target substrate via interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate . F-box protein is the determinant of substrate specificity . The limited number of identified ubiquitin ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the ubiquitination field . Penicillium oxalicum contains many transcription factors , such as BrlA , CreA , XlnR , and Ace1 , conserved in filamentous fungi that regulate the fungal development and transcription of ( hemi ) cellulase genes . Transcription factor Ace1 ( also known as SltA ) positively correlated with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively correlated with the expression of ( hemi ) cellulase genes . A ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair , SCFFbx23-Ace1 , is identified in P . oxalicum . Most of PoFbx23 is present in free form within the nucleus . A small portion of PoFbx23 associates with Skp1 to form PoFbx23-Skp1 heterodimer or assembles with the three invariable core components ( Skp1 , Cul1 , and Rbx1 ) of SCF to form the SCFFbx23 complex . Under glucose signal , PoFbx23 absence ( Δfbx23 ) results in decreased transcription levels of the brlA gene which encodes the master regulator for asexual development and six spore pigmentation genes ( abrB→abrA→aygB→arpA→arpB→albA ) which encode the proteins in the dihydroxynaphthalene-melanin pathway , along with impaired conidiation . Under cellulose signal , transcription levels of ( hemi ) cellulase genes in the Δfbx23 mutant are significantly upregulated . When PoFbx23 is present , PoAce1 exists as a full-length version and several low-molecular-weight degraded versions . PoAce1 has polyubiquitin modification . Deleting the Pofbx23 gene does not affect Poace1 gene transcription but results in the remarkable accumulation of all versions of the PoAce1 protein . Accumulated PoAce1 protein is a dysfunctional form that no longer binds promoters of the target gene , including the cellulase genes cbh1 and eg1 , the hemicellulase gene xyn11A , and the pigmentation-related gene abrB . PoFbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator , recognizing and activating PoAce1 , allowing the latter to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects ( activating or repressing ) under different signals .

Here , we determined the specific molecular identity and cell exit sites of BM protein secretory routes . First , we found that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel routes for BM protein secretion . When both routes were abolished , BM production was fully blocked; however , genetic interactions revealed that these two routes competed . Rab10 promoted lateral and planar-polarized secretion , whereas Rab8 promoted basal secretion , leading to the formation of BM fibrils and homogenous BM , respectively . We also found that the dystrophin-associated protein complex ( DAPC ) and Rab10 were both present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins . DAPC was essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route . Moreover , we identified a dual function for the exocyst complex in this context . First , the Exo70 subunit directly interacted with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization . Second , the exocyst complex was also required for the Rab8 route . Altogether , these results highlight important mechanistic aspects of BM protein secretion and illustrate how BM diversity can emerge from the spatial control of distinct traffic routes .

    Abstract: The ability to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs ) will increase bnAb therapeutic benefits . Machine learning is a powerful approach for such prediction . One challenge is that some HIV-1 subtypes in currently available training datasets are underrepresented , which likely affects models’ generalizability across subtypes . A second challenge is that combinations of bnAbs are required to avoid the inevitable resistance to a single bnAb , and computationally determining optimal combinations of bnAbs is an unsolved problem . Recently , machine learning models trained using resistance outcomes for multiple antibodies at once , a strategy called multi-task learning ( MTL ) , have been shown to improve predictions . We develop a new model and show that , beyond the boost in performance , MTL also helps address the previous two challenges . Specifically , we demonstrate empirically that MTL can mitigate bias from underrepresented subtypes , and that MTL allows the model to learn patterns of co-resistance to combinations of antibodies , thus providing tools to predict antibodies’ epitopes and to potentially select optimal bnAb combinations . Our analyses , publicly available at https://github . com/iaime/LBUM , can be adapted to other infectious diseases that are treated with antibody therapy .

    Abstract: Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a hematological disease exhibiting aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow . The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients , highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for informed therapeutic decision-making . Most previous models were constructed at the gene level , ignoring the fact that the dysfunction of the pathway is closely associated with disease development and progression . The present study considered two strategies that construct predictive models by taking pathway information into consideration: pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information . The former simply converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for model fitting . We considered three methods for pathway score calculation ( ssGSEA , GSVA , and z-scores ) and 14 data sources providing pathway information . We implemented these methods in microarray data for MM ( GSE136324 ) and obtained a candidate model with the best prediction performance in interval validation . The candidate model is further compared with the gene-based model and previously published models in two external data . We also investigated the effects of missing values on prediction . The results showed that group lasso incorporating Vax pathway information ( Vax ( grp ) ) was more competitive in prediction than the gene model in both internal and external validation . Immune information , including VAX pathways , seemed to be more predictive for MM . Vax ( grp ) also outperformed the previously published models . Moreover , the new model was more resistant to missing values , and the presence of missing values ( <5% ) would not evidently deteriorate its prediction accuracy using our missing data imputation method . In a nutshell , pathway-based models ( using group lasso ) were competitive alternatives to gene-based models for MM . These models were documented in an R package ( https://github . com/ShuoStat/MMMs ) , where a missing data imputation method was also integrated to facilitate future validation .

    Abstract: Mitochondrial hyperfission in response to cellular insult is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death . Thus , there is a critical need to understand the molecular mechanisms coordinating and regulating the complex process of mitochondrial fission . We develop a nonlinear dynamical systems model of dynamin related protein one ( Drp1 ) -dependent mitochondrial fission and use it to identify parameters which can regulate the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time . The TFR defined from a nondimensionalization of the model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k - where M is the total concentration of mitochondrial fission factor ( Mff ) and k+ and k− are the association and dissociation rate constants between oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane . The variable μ can be thought of as the maximum build rate over the disassembling rate of oligomers . Though the nondimensionalization of the system results in four dimensionless parameters , we found the TFR and the cumulative total fission ( TF ) depend strongly on only one , μ . Interestingly , the cumulative TF does not monotonically increase as μ increases . Instead it increases with μ to a certain point and then begins to decrease as μ continues to increase . This non-monotone dependence on μ suggests interventions targeting k+ , k− , or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism . Thus understanding the impact of regulatory parameters , such as μ , may assist future therapeutic target selection .

This non-monotonic dependence on μ suggests targeting k, k, or M may have non-intuitive impact on fission. Understanding regulatory parameters, such as μ, may assist therapeutic selection."

    Title: 
    Abstract: CRISPR-based gene drives offer promising prospects for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests . A significant challenge for successful suppression-type drive is the rapid evolution of resistance alleles . One approach to mitigate the development of resistance involves targeting functionally constrained regions using multiple gRNAs . In this study , we constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 ( Tdc2 ) in Drosophila suzukii , a notorious fruit pest . Our investigation revealed only a low level of homing in the germline , but feeding octopamine restored the egg-laying defects in Tdc2 mutant females , allowing easier line maintenance than for other suppression drive targets . We tested the effectiveness of a similar system in Drosophila melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency . Our findings show that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles , and the position effect profoundly influences Cas9 activity . Furthermore , this study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing the female infertility caused by the gene drive , offering a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects .

    ","Researchers have developed a CRISPR-based gene drive system to control disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests by targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyros decarboxylase 2 (T2) in Drosophila suuk, a notorious fruit pest. The system uses a 3-gRNA homing gene to suppress the T2 gene, resulting in low homing in the germline but restored egg-laying defects in T2 mutant females. This allows for easier maintenance of the drive system. The effectiveness of a similar system was tested in Drosila melanogaster and additional drive systems were constructed with promoter-C9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. The study found that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations limit the spread of gene alleles and Cas9 activity is influenced by position. Conditionally rescuing female infertility caused by the drive was also demonstrated, offering a tool for industrial-scale production of gene transgenic insects."

    Title: 
    Abstract: The brain is not only constrained by energy needed to fuel computation , but it is also constrained by energy needed to form memories . Experiments have shown that learning simple conditioning tasks which might require only a few synaptic updates , already carries a significant metabolic cost . Yet , learning a task like MNIST to 95% accuracy appears to require at least 108 synaptic updates . Therefore the brain has likely evolved to be able to learn using as little energy as possible . We explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks . Based on a parsimonious energy model , we propose two plasticity restricting algorithms that save energy: 1 ) only modify synapses with large updates , and 2 ) restrict plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network . In biology networks are often much larger than the task requires , yet vanilla backprop prescribes to update all synapses . In particular in this case , large savings can be achieved while only incurring a slightly worse learning time . Thus competitively restricting plasticity helps to save metabolic energy associated to synaptic plasticity . The results might lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a better match between artificial and biological learning . Moreover , the algorithms might benefit hardware because also electronic memory storage is energetically costly .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Organelles and endosymbionts have naturally evolved dramatically reduced genome sizes compared to their free-living ancestors . Synthetic biologists have purposefully engineered streamlined microbial genomes to create more efficient cellular chassis and define the minimal components of cellular life . During natural or engineered genome streamlining , deletion of many non-essential genes in combination often reduces bacterial fitness for idiosyncratic or unknown reasons . We investigated how and to what extent laboratory evolution could overcome these defects in six variants of the transposon-free Acinetobacter baylyi strain ADP1-ISx that each had a deletion of a different 22- to 42-kilobase region and two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases . We evolved replicate populations of ADP1-ISx and each deletion strain for ~300 generations in a chemically defined minimal medium or a complex medium and sequenced the genomes of endpoint clonal isolates . Fitness increased in all cases that were examined except for two ancestors that each failed to improve in one of the two environments . Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors . The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd ( ribonuclease D ) , csrA ( RNA-binding carbon storage regulator ) , and hfq ( RNA-binding protein and chaperone ) were frequently mutated across all strains , though the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment . Mutations in this regulatory network likely compensate for how an earlier deletion of a transposon in the ADP1-ISx ancestor of all the deletion strains restored csrA function . More generally , our results demonstrate that fitness lost during genome streamlining can usually be regained rapidly through laboratory evolution and that recovery tends to occur through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Precise regulation of gene expression is essential to understand a wide range of biological processes . Control over gene expression can be achieved using site-directed recombinases and endonucleases . However , their efficiency is variable and dependent on the genomic context . Here , we develop a self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebrafish . Using an in vivo reporter strategy , we first show that inserting the T3H48 self-cleaving ribozyme in an intron enables rapid pre-mRNA cleavage , with up to 20-fold reduction in expression , and that this ribozyme displays superior activity compared with other ribozymes . We then inserted the T3H48 ribozyme in the second intron of the albino gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and observed a pigmentation phenotype similar to that in the mutant . Using a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme , we also show that this phenotype is reversible , illustrating the specificity of the approach . In addition , we generated a Flippase- and Cre-activatable version of the T3H48 ribozyme , called RiboFlip , to control the mRNA levels of the albino gene . RiboFlip activation induced mRNA knockdown and also recapitulated the albino mutant phenotype . Furthermore , we show that a Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS reporter in the RiboFlip cassette can label knocked-down cells independently of the expression of the target gene . Altogether , we introduce the RiboFlip cassette as a flexible tool to control endogenous gene expression in a vertebrate model and as an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments is a central challenge for efficient behaviour . We asked whether humans address this challenge by relying on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features . One such property is the rate of change of features , given that behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise . Hence , we asked whether humans are biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast . To test this idea , 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward . Across two experiments and one preregistered replication , participants accrued more reward when a bandit’s relevant feature changed slowly , and its irrelevant feature quickly , as compared to the opposite . We did not find a difference in the ability to generalise to unseen feature values between conditions . Testing how feature speed could affect learning with a set of four function approximation Kalman filter models revealed that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature , and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes . The larger the improvement in participants’ performance for slow compared to fast bandits , the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates . These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features , suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Patients with ER-negative breast cancer have the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes , often experiencing rapid recurrence or progression to metastatic disease shortly after diagnosis .

Using a mouse systems genetics approach , we previously identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility . Here , we extend those studies to identify Resf1 , a poorly characterized gene , as a novel metastasis susceptibility gene in ER- breast cancer . Resf1 is a large , unstructured protein with an evolutionarily conserved intron-exon structure , but with poor amino acid conservation . CRISPR or gene trap mouse models crossed to the Polyoma Middle-T antigen genetically engineered mouse model ( MMTV-PyMT ) demonstrated that reduction of Resf1 resulted in a significant increase in tumor growth , a shortened overall survival time , and increased incidence and number of lung metastases , consistent with patient data . Furthermore , an analysis of matched tail and primary tissues revealed loss of the wildtype copy in tumor tissue , consistent with Resf1 being a tumor suppressor . Mechanistic analysis revealed a potential role of Resf1 in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences , particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis . These results suggest that loss of Resf1 enhances tumor progression in ER- breast cancer through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control .

    Title: 
    Abstract: During meiosis , programmed DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme , Spo11 , activating the DNA damage response ( DDR ) kinase Mec1ATR via the checkpoint clamp loader , Rad24RAD17 . At single loci , loss of Mec1 and Rad24 activity alters DSB formation and recombination outcome , but their genome-wide roles have not been examined in detail . Here , we utilise two strategies—deletion of the mismatch repair protein , Msh2 , and control of meiotic prophase length via regulation of the Ndt80 transcription factor—to help characterise the roles Mec1 and Rad24 play in meiotic recombination by enabling genome-wide mapping of meiotic progeny . In line with previous studies , we observe severely impacted spore viability and a reduction in the frequency of recombination upon deletion of RAD24—driven by a shortened prophase . By contrast , loss of Mec1 function increases recombination frequency , consistent with its role in DSB trans-interference , and has less effect on spore viability . Despite these differences , complex multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs—rare in wild-type cells—occur more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1 , suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation in both . Mec1 and Rad24 also have important roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers ( COs ) . Upon loss of either Mec1 or Rad24 , CO distributions become more random—suggesting reductions in the global manifestation of interference . Such effects are similar to , but less extreme than , the phenotype of ‘ZMM’ mutants such as zip3Δ , and may be driven by reductions in the proportion of interfering COs . Collectively , in addition to shared roles in CO regulation , our results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor , and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency , the loss of which helps to suppress any broader defects in CO regulation caused by abrogation of the DDR .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /transcriptional co-activator with PDZ binding motif ( TAZ ) induces cell proliferation through nuclear localization at low cell density . Conversely , at extremely high cell density , the Hippo pathway , which regulates YAP/TAZ , is activated . This activation leads to the translocation of YAP/TAZ into the cytoplasm , resulting in cell cycle arrest . Various cancer cells have several times more YAP/TAZ than normal cells . However , it is not entirely clear whether this several-fold increase in YAP/TAZ alone is sufficient to overcome proliferation inhibition ( contact inhibition ) under high-density conditions , thereby allowing continuous proliferation . In this study , we construct a three-dimensional ( 3D ) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway . Herein , a significant innovation in our approach is the introduction of a novel modeling component that inputs cell density , which reflects cell dynamics , into the Hippo pathway and enables the simulation of cell proliferation as the output response . We assume such 3D model with cell-cell interactions by solving reaction and molecular dynamics ( MD ) equations by applying adhesion and repulsive forces that act between cells and frictional forces acting on each cell . We assume Lennard-Jones ( 12-6 ) potential with a softcore character so that each cell secures its exclusive domain . We set cell cycles composed of mitotic and cell growth phases in which cells divide and grow under the influence of cell kinetics . We perform mathematical simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density . The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels of cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells , enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions . Finally , this mathematical model , which incorporates cell-cell interactions and the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway , may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels , developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells , and determining appropriate drug dosages . The source codes are freely available .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Many eukaryotic proteins and RNAs contain low-complexity domains ( LCDs ) with a strong propensity for binding and driving phase separation into biomolecular condensates . Mutations in LCDs frequently disrupt condensate dynamics , resulting in pathological transitions to solid-like states . Understanding how the molecular sequence grammar of LCDs governs condensate dynamics is essential for uncovering their biological functions and the evolutionary forces that shape these sequences . To this end , we present an energy landscape framework that operates on a continuous ‘stickiness’ energy scale rather than relying on an explicit alphabet-based sequence . Sequences are characterized by Wasserstein distance relative to thoroughly shuffled or random counterparts . Armed with an energy landscape framework , map diagrams of material and dynamical properties governed by key energy landscape features modulated by the degree of complexity in LCD arrangements , including the periodicity and local disorder in LCDs . Highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior , while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties . Our results reveal that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates , thereby avoiding transitions to glassy or solid-like states . Moreover , we demonstrate that the energy landscape framework explains the recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity . Our work provides a unifying perspective on the sequence-encoded material properties whereby key features of energy landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable .

    ","Researchers have identified that many eukaryotic proteins and RNAs contain low-complex domains (LCDs) with a tendency to form biomolecular condensates. Mutations in LCDs can disrupt condens dynamics, leading to pathological transitions to solid-like states. To understand how LCD sequence governs condens dynamics, an energy framework was developed based on a'stickiness' scale, rather than explicit sequence. Sequences were characterized by Wasserstein distance to random counterparts. The framework maps material and dynamical properties governed by energy features modulated by LCD complexity, including periodicity and disorder. Periodic LCDs promote elasticity, while random sequences exhibit viscosity. Results show minimum periodicity is crucial for fluid condens, avoiding glass or solid states. The framework explains prion domain findings and predicts cond viscoelasticity alterations."

    Title: 
    Abstract: The development of ectodermal organs begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that progressively invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme as the organ takes its shape . Signaling by secreted molecules is critical for epithelial morphogenesis , but how that information leads to cell rearrangement and tissue shape changes remains an open question . Using the mouse dentition as a model , we first establish that non-muscle myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and show that it functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and persistent convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer . Shh signaling controls these processes by inducing myosin II activation via AKT . Pharmacological induction of AKT and myosin II can also rescue defects caused by the inhibition of Shh . Together , our results support a model in which the Shh signal is transmitted through myosin II to power effective cellular rearrangement for proper dental epithelial invagination .

    Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale atlas-level single cell RNA sequences and single-cell chromatin accessibility data provide extraordinary avenues to broad and deep insight into complex biological mechanism . Leveraging the datasets and transfering labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq will empower the exploration of single-cell omics data . However , the current label transfer methods have limited performance , largely due to the lower capable of preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets . Here , we present a robust deep transfer model based graph convolutional network , scTGCN , which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation , while achieving integration hundreds of thousands cells in minutes with low memory consumption . We show that scTGCN is powerful to the integration of mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Proteins with nuclear localization sequences ( NLSs ) are directed into the cell nucleus through interactions between the NLS and importin proteins . NLSs are generally short motifs rich in basic amino acids; however , identifying NLSs can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence . In this study , we characterized the sequence specificity of an essential and conserved NLS in Mcm3 , a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase . Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 ( AF3 ) modeling , we demonstrate that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3 through optimal interactions with importin . Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3 , resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth . Our results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs , which , despite lacking a single consensus sequence , retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Ataxin-2 ( ATXN2 ) is a gene implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type II ( SCA2 ) , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and Parkinsonism . The encoded protein is a therapeutic target for ALS and related conditions . ATXN2 ( or Atx2 in insects ) can function in translational activation , translational repression , mRNA stability and in the assembly of mRNP-granules , a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) . Previous work has shown that the LSm ( Like-Sm ) domain of Atx2 , which can help stimulate mRNA translation , antagonizes mRNP-granule assembly . Here we advance these findings through a series of experiments on Drosophila and human Ataxin-2 proteins . Results of Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified by Editing ( TRIBE ) , co-localization and immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that a polyA-binding protein ( PABP ) interacting , PAM2 motif of Ataxin-2 may be a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of Ataxin-2 mRNP granules . Experiments with transgenic Drosophila indicate that while the Atx2-LSm domain may protect against neurodegeneration , structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both support Atx2-induced cytotoxicity . Taken together , the data lead to a proposal for how Ataxin-2 interactions are remodelled during translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute differently to the specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation as well as to neurodegeneration .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Gene regulatory networks that act upstream of skeletal muscle fate determinants are distinct in different anatomical locations . Despite recent efforts , a clear understanding of the cascade of events underlying the emergence and maintenance of the stem cell pool in specific muscle groups remains unresolved and debated . Here , we invalidated Pitx2 with multiple Cre-driver mice prenatally , postnatally , and during lineage progression . We showed that this gene becomes progressively dispensable for specification and maintenance of the muscle stem ( MuSC ) cell pool in extraocular muscles ( EOMs ) despite being , together with Myf5 , a major upstream regulator during early development . Moreover , constitutive inactivation of Pax7 postnatally led to a greater loss of MuSCs in the EOMs compared to the limb . Thus , we propose a relay between Pitx2 , Myf5 and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance . We demonstrate also that MuSCs in the EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier that those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult , yet EOMs have a significantly higher content of Pax7+ MuSCs per area pre- and post-natally . Finally , while limb MuSCs proliferate in the mdx mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy , significantly less MuSCs were present in the EOMs of the mdx mouse model compared to controls , and they were not proliferative . Overall , our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of MuSC heterogeneity along the body axis and brings further insights into the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy .

    Abstract: Image-based cell profiling is a powerful tool that compares perturbed cell populations by measuring thousands of single-cell features and summarizing them into profiles . Typically a sample is represented by averaging across cells , but this fails to capture the heterogeneity within cell populations . We introduce CytoSummaryNet: a Deep Sets-based approach that improves mechanism of action prediction by 30–68% in mean average precision compared to average profiling on a public dataset . CytoSummaryNet uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple-instance learning framework , providing an easier-to-apply method for aggregating single-cell feature data than previously published strategies . Interpretability analysis suggests that the model achieves this improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large uncrowded cells . The approach requires only perturbation labels for training , which are readily available in all cell profiling datasets . CytoSummaryNet offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets .

    Abstract: The ability to solve complex tasks relies on the adaptive changes occurring in the spatio-temporal organization of brain activity under different conditions . Altered flexibility in these dynamics can lead to impaired cognitive performance , manifesting for instance as difficulties in attention regulation , distraction inhibition , and behavioral adaptation . Such impairments result in decreased efficiency and increased effort in accomplishing goal-directed tasks . Therefore , developing quantitative measures that can directly assess the effort involved in these transitions using neural data is of paramount importance . In this study , we propose a framework to associate cognitive effort during the performance of tasks with electroencephalography ( EEG ) activation patterns . The methodology relies on the identification of discrete dynamical states ( EEG microstates ) and optimal transport theory . To validate the effectiveness of this framework , we apply it to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task , a cognitive test in which participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another , often conflicting , aspect . The Stroop task is a cognitive test where participants must respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another , often conflicting , aspect . Our findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive effort , thus confirming the framework’s effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions . By utilizing a fully data-driven method , this research opens up fresh perspectives for physiologically describing cognitive effort within the brain .

Here , P . vivax Duffy Binding Protein II ( PvDBPII ) probes were generated to detect the development and durability of specific aMBCs , and to demonstrate the capacity of these cells to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections . PvDBPII-specific aMBCs were elicited during malaria illness , and they persisted through the recovery phase of infections . To address biology and function of P . vivax-specific aMBCs in producing protective antibodies , a single MBC was cultured , and the secreted IgG was tested for binding and inhibition activity . The aMBC-derived clones produced antibodies with variable levels of anti-PvDBPII IgG in cultures , and some produced high antibody levels comparable to classical MBC clones . Thus , we focused our attention on the function of aMBCs in producing neutralizing antibodies . Among the aMBC clones , A1F12 and B4E11 produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PvDBPII variants .

We also present a real data analysis of 16 blood cell phenotypes in the UK Biobank , showing that mr . mash-rss achieves higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits , especially when the data set has smaller sample size .

In this study , we propose a novel modelling framework integrating the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models , by introducing a continuous recruitment process for the susceptibles . A neural network approximates the recruitment rate to develop a Universal Differential Equations ( UDE ) model .

Our projections indicate an attack rate and a peak of new infections of 80 . 06% and 3 . 17% of the population , respectively , compared with the homogeneous model’s projections of 99 . 97% and 32 . 78% , thus providing an 18 . 6% improvement in the prediction accuracy based on the actual data . Our simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity in the susceptibles decreases herd immunity for ~37 . 36% of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from ~30 days to ~70 days , also aligning with the real case . We consider that this study lays the groundwork for the development of a new class of models and new insights for modelling heterogeneity .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Synapses in the brain are highly noisy , which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability . Given how costly synapses are in terms of energy consumption these high levels of noise are surprising . Here we propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron . To show this , we developed a mathematical framework , in which the synapse as a whole interacts with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in a similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain , dynamic environment . This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics that is being updated by a synaptic learning rule , which resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms . In addition , this approach entails that a synapse utilizes its inherently noisy synaptic release to also encode its uncertainty about the state of the somatic potential . Although each synapse strives for predicting the somatic dynamics of its postsynaptic neuron , we show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment . Hereby , synapses coordinate themselves to represent and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations .

    ","Researchers have developed a new method called Scup for reconstructing cell lineages using both bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. This approach addresses challenges associated with single-cell sequencing, such as allelic dropout and amplification errors, by incorporating them into the analysis. Scup calculates distances between cells and uses the neighbor-joining algorithm to reconstruct the lineage tree. The method is designed to be embarrassingly parallel, allowing it to perform faster than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy. Its robustness is demonstrated using synthetic and biological datasets of 18 cells."

    Title: 
    Abstract: An efficient allocation of limited resources in low-income settings offers the opportunity to improve population-health outcomes given the available health system capacity . Efforts to achieve this are often framed through the lens of “health benefits packages” ( HBPs ) , which seek to establish which services the public healthcare system should include in its provision . Analytic approaches widely used to weigh evidence in support of different interventions and inform the broader HBP deliberative process however have limitations . In this work , we propose the individual-based Thanzi La Onse ( TLO ) model as a uniquely-tailored tool to assist in the evaluation of Malawi-specific HBPs while addressing these limitations . By mechanistically modelling—and calibrating to extensive , country-specific data—the incidence of disease , health-seeking behaviour , and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health available , we were able to simulate the health gains achievable under a number of plausible HBP strategies for the country . We found that the HBP emerging from a linear constrained optimisation analysis ( LCOA ) achieved the largest health gain—∼8% reduction in disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ) between 2023 and 2042 compared to the benchmark scenario—by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments . This HBP however incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation . Other feasible approaches to prioritisation were assessed , including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics , rather than service type . Unlike the LCOA-based HBP , this approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year- to-year basis , and a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period , which suggests an approach based upon patient characteristics might prove beneficial in the future .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Precise regulation of chromosome dynamics in the germline is essential for reproductive success across species . Yet , the mechanisms underlying meiotic chromosomal events such as homolog pairing and chromosome segregation are not fully understood in many species . Here , we employ Oligopaint DNA FISH to investigate mechanisms of meiotic homolog pairing and chromosome segregation in the holocentric pantry moth , Plodia interpunctella , and compare our findings to new and previous studies in the silkworm moth , Bombyx mori , which diverged from P . interpunctella over 100 million years ago . We find that pairing in both Bombyx and Plodia spermatogenesis is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends . Additionally , both species form rod shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I . However , unlike the telomere-oriented chromosome segregation mechanism observed in Bombyx , Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple different ways at metaphase I . Surprisingly , in both species we find that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci toward the center of chromosomes regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent . Additionally , sister kinetochores do not seem to be paired in these species . Instead , four distinct kinetochores are easily observed at metaphase I . Despite this , we find clear end-on microtubule attachments and not lateral microtubule attachments co-orienting these separated kinetochores . These findings challenge the classical view of segregation where paired , poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I . Our studies here highlight the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model systems , as employing novel organisms can lead to the discovery of novel biology .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Coordinated activation and inhibition of F-actin supports the movements of morphogenesis . Understanding the proteins that regulate F-actin is important , since these proteins are mis-regulated in diseases like cancer . Our studies of C . elegans embryonic epidermal morphogenesis identified the GTPase CED-10/Rac1 as an essential activator of F-actin . However , we need to identify the GEF , or Guanine-nucleotide Exchange Factor , that activates CED-10/Rac1 during embryonic cell migrations . The two-component GEF , CED-5/CED-12 , is known to activate CED-10/Rac1 to promote cell movements that result in the engulfment of dying cells during embryogenesis , and a later cell migration of the larval Distal Tip Cell . It is believed that CED-5/CED-12 powers cellular movements of corpse engulfment and DTC migration by promoting F-actin formation . Therefore , we tested if CED-5/CED-12 was involved in embryonic migrations , and got a contradictory result . CED-5/CED-12 definitely support embryonic migrations , since their loss led to embryos that died due to failed epidermal cell migrations . However , CED-5/CED-12 inhibited F-actin in the migrating epidermis , the opposite of what was expected for a CED-10 GEF . To address how CED-12/CED-5 could have two opposing effects on F-actin , during corpse engulfment and cell migration , we investigated if CED-12 harbors GAP ( GTPase Activating Protein ) functions . A candidate GAP region in CED-12 faces away from the CED-5 GEF catalytic region . Mutating a candidate catalytic Arginine in the CED-12 GAP region ( R537A ) altered the epidermal cell migration function , and not the corpse engulfment function . We interfered with GEF function by interfering with CED-5’s ability to bind Rac1/CED-10 . Mutating Serine-Arginine in CED-5/DOCK predicted to bind and stabilize Rac1 for catalysis , resulted in loss of both ventral enclosure and corpse engulfment . Genetic and expression studies strongly support that the GAP function likely acts on different GTPases . Thus , we propose CED-5/CED-12 support the cycling of multiple GTPases , by using distinct domains , to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation .

    Abstract: A core challenge for the brain is to process information across various timescales . This could be achieved by a hierarchical organization of temporal processing through intrinsic mechanisms ( e . g . , recurrent coupling or adaptation ) , but recent evidence from spike recordings of the rodent visual system seems to conflict with this hypothesis . Here , we used an optimized information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to show that information- and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation , while information-theoretic predictability decreases . Moreover , intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy , whereas the hierarchy of predictability was stimulus-dependent . We could reproduce these observations in a basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input . Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas , while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) is a non-invasive , FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications , but the neural circuits that are engaged during TMS are still poorly understood . Recordings of neural activity from the corticospinal tract provide a direct readout of the response of motor cortex to TMS , and therefore a new opportunity to model neural circuit dynamics . The study goal was to use epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn through which the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS , including direct and indirect waves , could be investigated . An in-depth sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways , and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways . Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to single corticospinal waves . Single wave preference could be predicted using the average connection probability of all possible paths between the activated neuron type and L5 pyramidal tract neurons ( PTNs ) . For these activations , the total conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTNs determined the latency of the corticospinal wave . Finally , there were multiple neuron type activations that could preferentially modulate a particular corticospinal wave . The results support the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons . Moreover , activation of both afferents to the motor cortex as well as specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves , and the results were interpreted to propose the cortical origins of afferents that may give rise to certain I-waves . The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to both identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation .

    ","Cell-free placental DNA (cfDNA) is present in the maternal circulation during gestation, offering a potential research and clinical tool to investigate the placental epigenome across gestation, previously requiring invasive placental sampling. cfDNA has been implemented in clinical non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) settings. However, the biology of cfDNA remains poorly understood, limiting research and clinical utility. This review examines current knowledge of cfDNA, including origins and molecular characteristics, highlighting gaps in knowledge and future directions.

cfDNA is released from the placenta into the maternal circulation through various mechanisms, including apoptosis, necrosis, and microvesiculation. cfDNA concentration increases with gestation, peaking at 20-24 weeks. cfDNA originates from the placenta, fetus, and maternal tissues, with paternal and maternal DNA present in maternal circulation. cfDNA is degraded, fragmented, and methylated, and carries epigenetic modifications.

cfDNA has been used in NIPT for aneuploidy screening, microdeletion syndromes, and sex chromosomal ane abnormalities. However, accuracy and sensitivity vary depending on gestational age and cfDNA concentration. cfDNA has also been used for fetal sex determination, RhD typing, and HLA typing. cfDNA has potential for monitoring fetal growth restriction, preeclampsia, and other pregnancy complications.

Gaps in knowledge include understanding cfDNA origin, transport, metabolism, and degradation. The role of cfDNA in pregnancy complications, such as preeclamps and intrauterine growth restriction, is unclear. Further research is needed to elucidate cfDNA biology, improve NIPT accuracy, and clinical utility."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Recently we characterized polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker dog . The familial occurrence of the disease were suggestive of an inherited cause . Here we report the results of our molecular genetic investigation . A genome-wide association study of 33 cases and 106 controls indicated the involvement of a region on chromosome CFA19 ( p = 4 . 7*10−10 ) . Haplotype analysis indicated that the cases shared a 2 . 9 Mb region in the homozygous or the heterozygous state . Next Generation Sequencing of genomic DNA implicated a deletion of a 39 kb DNA fragment , located 10 kb upstream of the neighbouring interleukin genes IL21 and IL2 . The frequency of the deletion allele was 0 . 81 in the available cases and 0 . 25 in a random sample of the Kooiker dog breed . Leukocytes of affected , untreated dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpress IL21 and IL2 upon stimulation with mitogens . We suggest that elements located 10–49 kb upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play an important role in the regulation of the canine genes and that deletion of these elements is a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs . Postulating causality , the penetrance of the disease phenotype was estimated at 10–20% for homozygous dogs and 0 . 5–2% for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion . Our results suggest that distant variants upstream of IL21 could also be important for human autoimmune diseases that have been found to be associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region .

Engineering campaigns commonly seek to improve protein stability , and there is a strong interest in streamlining these processes to enable rapid optimization of highly stabilized proteins with fewer iterations . In this work , we explore utilizing a mega-scale dataset to develop a protein language model optimized for stability prediction .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iKIRs ) are a family of inhibitory receptors that are expressed by natural killer ( NK ) cells and late-stage differentiated T cells . There is accumulating evidence that iKIRs regulate T cell-mediated immunity . Recently , we reported that T cell-mediated control was enhanced by iKIRs in chronic viral infections . We hypothesized that in the context of autoimmunity , where an enhanced T cell response might be considered detrimental , iKIRs would have an opposite effect . We studied Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) as a paradigmatic example of autoimmunity . In T1D , variation in the Human Leucocyte Antigen ( HLA ) genes explains up to 50% of the genetic risk , indicating that T cells have a major role in T1D etiopathogenesis . To investigate if iKIRs affect this T cell response , we asked whether HLA associations were modified by iKIR genes . We conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1D dataset ( N = 11 , 961 ) and found that iKIR genes , in the presence of genes encoding their ligands , have a consistent and significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations . Our results were validated in an independent data set . We conclude that iKIRs significantly decrease HLA class II protective associations and suggest that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D .

T1 variation in Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) genes explains up 50% of genetic risk, indicating T-cells major role in T1 etiopathogenesis.

Immunogenetic analysis of case-control T1 dataset (N=11,961) found K genes, in presence of encoding ligands, consistent and significant effect on HLA class II genetic associations. Results were validated in independent set. KIR significantly decreased HLA II associations, suggesting K regulate CD4 T responses in T1."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy ( FECD ) is an age-related cause of vision loss , and the most common repeat expansion-mediated disease in humans characterised to date . Up to 80% of European FECD cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element ( termed CTG18 . 1 ) located within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor encoding gene , TCF4 . The non-coding nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4 have made it extremely challenging to experimentally decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease . Here we comprehensively describe CTG18 . 1 expansion-driven molecular components of disease within primary patient-derived corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ) , generated from a large cohort of individuals with CTG18 . 1-expanded ( Exp+ ) and CTG 18 . 1-independent ( Exp- ) FECD . We employ long-read , short-read , and spatial transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific transcriptomic biomarkers . Interrogation of long-read sequencing and alternative splicing analysis of short-read transcriptomic data together reveals the global extent of altered splicing occurring within Exp+ FECD , and unique transcripts associated with CTG18 . 1-expansions . Similarly , differential gene expression analysis highlights the total transcriptomic consequences of Exp+ FECD within CECs . Furthermore , differential exon usage , pathway enrichment and spatial transcriptomics reveal TCF4 isoform ratio skewing solely in Exp+ FECD with potential downstream functional consequences . Lastly , exome data from 134 Exp- FECD cases identified rare ( minor allele frequency <0 . 005 ) and potentially deleterious ( CADD>15 ) TCF4 variants in 7/134 FECD Exp- cases , suggesting that TCF4 variants independent of CTG18 . 1 may increase FECD risk . In summary , our study supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms , RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation , both underpin the pathophysiology of FECD . We anticipate these data will inform and guide the development of translational interventions for this common triplet-repeat mediated disease .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Direct seeding is employed to circumvent the labor-intensive process of rice ( Oryza sativa ) transplantation , but this approach requires varieties with vigorous low-temperature germination ( LTG ) when sown in cold climates . To investigate the genetic basis of LTG , we identified the quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) qLTG11 from rice variety Arroz da Terra , which shows rapid seed germination at lower temperatures , using QTL-seq . We delineated the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h ( GF14h ) gene , which is expressed during seed germination . The Arroz da Terra GF14h allele encodes functional GF14h , whereas Japanese rice variety Hitomebore harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region . Knocking out functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line ( NIL ) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele decreased LTG , whereas overexpressing functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG , indicating that GF14h is the causal gene behind qLTG11 . Analysis of numerous Japanese rice accessions revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost from popular varieties during modern breeding . We generated a NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra including GF14h . The NIL showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore , with otherwise comparable agronomic traits . The functional GF14h allele from Arroz da Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) possesses an 8–9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy ( TR , or r ) on the negative ( - ) strand DNA derived from the reverse transcription of viral pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) . It remains unclear whether the TR forms a 5’ or 3’ flap structure on HBV rcDNA and which TR copy is removed during covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) formation . To address these questions , a mutant HBV cell line HepDES-C1822G was established with a C1822G mutation in the pgRNA coding sequence , altering the sequence of 3’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA while the 5’ TR remained wild type ( wt ) . The production of HBV rcDNA and cccDNA in HepDES-C1822G cells was comparable to wt levels . Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) analysis revealed that the positive ( + ) strand DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cccDNA predominantly carried the wt nt1822 residue , indicating that the 5’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication , forming a duplex with the ( + ) strand DNA , while the 3’ TR forms a flap-like structure , which is subsequently removed during cccDNA formation . In a survey of known cellular flap endonucleases using a loss-of-function study , we found that the 3’ flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation in wild-type HBV replicating cells , alongside the 5’ flap endonuclease FEN1 . Additionally , we have mapped the potential Mus81 and FEN1 cleavage sites within the TR of nuclear DP-rcDNA by RACE-NGS analyses . The overlapping function between Mus81 and FEN1 in cccDNA formation indicates that the putative 5’ and 3’ flap formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rcDNA precursor . These findings shed light on HBV rcDNA structure and cccDNA formation mechanisms , contributing to our understanding of HBV replication cycle .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The efficiency of microbial fuel cells ( MFCs ) in industrial wastewater treatment is profoundly influenced by the microbial community , which can be disrupted by variable industrial operations . Although microbial guilds linked to MFC performance under specific conditions have been identified , comprehensive knowledge of the convergent community structure and pathways of adaptation is lacking . Here , we developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model ( mmGEM ) based on metabolic cross-feeding to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory . The metabolic model encompassed three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria ( SRB ) , methanogens ( MET ) , and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria ( SOB ) . Our findings revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as organic loading rates ( OLRs ) increased , along with a decline in MFC performance . The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs ( L-OLRs ) and adaptation to high OLRs ( H-OLRs ) . The simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide ( S ) cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB . More cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET , facilitating their competitive dominance . Assessing cross-feeding dynamics under varying OLRs enabled the execution of practical scenario-based simulations to explore the potential impact of elevated acidity levels on SOB growth and MFC performance . This work highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial community structure in response to high OLRs . The insights gained will inform the development of effective strategies for implementing MFC technology in real-world industrial environments .

In those applications , ML models are used to predict the properties of biological systems , and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates as new biological hypotheses for downstream experimental validations . However , when applied to unseen situations , these models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives . One solution to address this issue is to quantify the model’s prediction uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate ( FDR ) pre-specified by researchers . We propose CPEC , an ML framework for FDR-controlled biological discovery . We demonstrate its effectiveness using enzyme function annotation as a case study , simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes . CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool known as conformal prediction , providing accurate and FDR-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme . Conformal prediction provides rigorous statistical guarantees to the predictive model and ensures that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability . Evaluation experiments show that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control , better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods , and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data . We expect CPEC to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Neuronal inclusions of hyperphosphorylated TDP-43 are hallmarks of disease for most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) . Mutations in TARDBP , the gene coding for TDP-43 , can cause some cases of familial inherited ALS ( fALS ) , indicating dysfunction of TDP-43 drives disease . Aggregated , phosphorylated TDP-43 may contribute to disease phenotypes; alternatively , TDP-43 aggregation may be a protective cellular response sequestering toxic protein away from the rest of the cell . The heat shock responsive chaperone Hsp90 has been shown to interact with TDP-43 and stabilize its normal conformation; however , it is not known whether this interaction contributes to neurotoxicity in vivo . Using a C . elegans model of fALS mutant TDP-43 proteinopathy , we find that loss of function of HSP-90 protects against TDP-43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult animals . This protection is accompanied by a decrease in both total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein . We also find that hsp-90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key stress responsive heat shock pathway gene expression , including hsp-70 and hsp-16 . 1 , and we demonstrate that normal levels of hsp-16 . 1 are required for hsp-90 mutation effects on TDP-43 . We also observe that the neuroprotective effect due to HSP-90 dysfunction does not involve direct regulation of proteasome activity in C . elegans . Our data demonstrate for the first time that Hsp90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP-43 proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Chronic pain is a wide-spread condition that is debilitating and expensive to manage , costing the United States alone around $600 billion in 2010 . In a common symptom of chronic pain called allodynia , non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with highly variable presentations across individuals . While the specific mechanisms remain unclear , allodynia is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory ( E-I ) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord . In this work , we analyze biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn . These circuits are hypothesized to be part of the neural pathways that mediate two different types of allodynia: static and dynamic . We use neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit . By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions , we specify model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions . Then , we implement a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit’s E-I signaling . We find that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs either due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling so that excitatory neurons are “released” from inhibitory control , or due to upregulation of excitatory neuron responses so that excitatory neurons “escape” their inhibitory control . Which of these mechanisms is most likely to occur , the subcircuit components involved in the mechanism , and the proportion of subcircuits exhibiting the mechanism can vary depending on the subcircuit structure . These results suggest specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be most likely responsible for allodynia , thus offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Protein homeostasis relies on the accurate translation and folding of newly synthesized proteins . Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 ( eEF2 ) promotes GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome during translation . eEF2 folding was recently shown to be dependent on Hsp90 as well as the cochaperones Hgh1 , Cns1 , and Cpr7 . We examined the requirement for Hsp90 and cochaperones more closely and found that Hsp90 and cochaperones have two distinct roles in regulating eEF2 function . Yeast expressing one group of Hsp90 mutations or one group of cochaperone mutations had reduced steady-state levels of eEF2 . The growth of Hsp90 mutants that affected eEF2 accumulation was also negatively affected by deletion of the gene encoding Hgh1 . Further , mutations in yeast eEF2 that mimic disease-associated mutations in human eEF2 were negatively impacted by loss of Hgh1 and growth of one mutant was partially rescued by overexpression of Hgh1 . In contrast , yeast expressing different groups of Hsp90 mutations or a different cochaperone mutation had altered sensitivity to diphtheria toxin , which is dictated by a unique posttranslational modification on eEF2 . Our results provide further evidence that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not just by assisting protein folding , but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins .

    ","Protein homeostasis relies on the accurate translation and folding of newly synthesized proteins. Elongation factor 2 (EF2) promotes GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome during translation. Recent studies have shown that EF2 is dependent on heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and its cochaperones H1, C1, and C7. This study examined the requirement for Hsp and cochones more closely and found that Hsp and cochones have distinct roles in regulating EF function. Yeast expressing one group of Hsp mutations or group cochone mutations had reduced steady-state levels of EF2. Growth of Hsp mutants affecting EF accumulation was also negatively impacted by deletion of the gene H1. Mutations in yeast EF mimicking disease-associated mutations in human EF were impacted by loss of H1 and one was partially rescued by overexpression of H1. In contrast, yeast expressing different Hsp mutations or cochone had altered sensitivity to diphther toxin, dictated by post-translational modification of EF. Results provide evidence that H contributes to homeostasis not only by assisting folding but also enabling translation of newly synthesized proteins. Additionally, results show that yeast H mutants have distinct in vivo effects correlating with defects in cochones."

    Title: 
    Abstract: When making risky choices in social contexts , humans typically combine social information with individual preferences about the options at stake . It remains unknown how such decisions are made when these preferences are inaccessible or disrupted , as might be the case for individuals confronting novel options or experiencing cognitive impairment . Thus , we examined participants with lesions in insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex , key regions implicated in risky decision-making , as they played a gambling task where choices were made both alone and after observing others’ choices . Participants in both lesion groups showed disrupted use of standard utility-based computations about risky options . For socially situated decisions , these participants showed increased conformity with the choices of others , independent from social utility-based computations . These findings suggest that in social contexts , following others’ choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Biomorphs , Richard Dawkins’s iconic model of morphological evolution , are traditionally used to demonstrate the power of natural selection to generate biological order from random mutations . Here we show that biomorphs can also be used to illustrate how developmental bias shapes adaptive evolutionary outcomes . In particular , we find that biomorphs exhibit phenotype bias , a type of developmental bias where certain phenotypes can be many orders of magnitude more likely than others to appear through random mutations . Moreover , this bias exhibits a strong preference for simpler phenotypes with low descriptional complexity . Such bias towards simplicity is formalised by an information-theoretic principle that can be intuitively understood from a picture of evolution randomly searching in the space of algorithms . By using population genetics simulations , we demonstrate how moderately adaptive phenotypic variation that appears more frequently upon random mutations can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent . This result , as well as many other patterns found in the structure of variation for the biomorphs , such as high mutational robustness and a positive correlation between phenotype evolvability and robustness , closely resemble findings in molecular genotype-phenotype maps . Many of these patterns can be explained with an analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained sections of the genome . We postulate that the phenotype bias towards simplicity and other patterns biomorphs share with molecular genotype-phenotype maps may hold more widely for developmental systems .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Activities like ball bouncing and trampoline jumping showcase the human ability to intuitively tune to system dynamics and excite motions that the system prefers intrinsically . This human sensitivity to resonance has been experimentally supported for interactions with simple linear systems but remains a challenge to validate in more complex scenarios where nonlinear dynamics cannot be predicted analytically . However , it has been found that many nonlinear systems exhibit periodic orbits similar to the eigenmodes of linear systems . These nonlinear normal modes ( NNM ) are computable with a recently developed numerical mode tool . Using this tool , the present resarch compared the motions that humans excite in nonlinear systems with the predicted NNM of the energy-conservative systems . In a user study consisting of three experiment parts , participants commanded differently configured virtual double pendula with joint compliance through a haptic joystick . The task was to alternately hit two targets , which were either aligned with the NNM ( Experiments 1 and 2 ) or purposefully arranged offset ( Experiment 3 ) . In all tested experiment variations , participants intuitively applied a control strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems . Even for increased task accuracy ( Experiment 2 ) and targets located away from the NNM ( Experiment 3 ) , participants could successfully accomplish the task , likely by adjusting their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics to better align the resonant motions to the task . Consequently , our experiments extend the existing research on human resonance sensitivity with data-based evidence to nonlinear systems . Our findings emphasize the human capabilities to apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions , including possibly shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Regulation of transcription is a fundamental process that allows bacteria to respond to external stimuli with appropriate timing and magnitude of response . In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis , transcriptional regulation is at the core of developmental processes needed for cell survival . Gene expression in cells transitioning from exponential phase to stationary phase is under the control of a group of transcription factors called transition state regulators ( TSRs ) . TSRs influence numerous developmental processes including the decision between biofilm formation and motility , genetic competence , and sporulation , but the extent to which TSRs influence bacterial physiology remains to be fully elucidated . Here , we demonstrate two TSRs , ScoC and AbrB , along with the MarR-family transcription factor PchR negatively regulate production of the iron chelator pulcherrimin in B . subtilis . Genetic analysis of the relationship between the three transcription factors indicate that all are necessary to limit pulcherrimin production during exponential phase and influence the rate and total amount of pulcherrimin produced . Similarly , expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis gene yvmC was found to be under control of ScoC , AbrB , and PchR and correlated with the amount of pulcherrimin produced by each background . Lastly , our in vitro data indicate a weak direct role for ScoC in controlling pulcherrimin production along with AbrB and PchR . The layered regulation by two distinct regulatory systems underscores the important role for pulcherrimin in B . subtilis physiology .

Genetic analysis shows that all three factors are necessary to limit pulchimin production during exponential phase, affecting rate and total amount produced. Expression of pulerr biosynthesis gene yC is controlled by Sco, Abr, and PR, correlating with pulerr amount produced. In vitro data indicate direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production with Abr and PR. Regulation by two distinct systems highlights pulerr importance in B. subtilis physiology."

    Title: 
    Abstract: After spinal cord injuries ( SCIs ) , patients may develop either detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( DSD ) or urinary incontinence , depending on the level of the spinal injury . DSD and incontinence reflect the loss of coordinated neural control among the detrusor muscle , which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination , and urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles , which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit bladder emptying . Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced DSD and incontinence . We defined , within a mathematical model , the minimum neuronal elements necessary to replicate neurogenic dysfunction of the bladder after a SCI and incorporated into this model the minimum additional neurophysiological features sufficient to replicate the improvements in bladder function associated with lumbar TMS of the spine in patients with SCI . We created a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations that replicated normal bladder function . We added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI , and we increased the density and complexity of interactions of both inhibitory and excitatory lumbar spinal interneurons responsive to TMS to provide a more diverse set of spinal responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of spinal interneurons that remains after SCI . The model reproduced the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI . When we investigated the effect of monophasic and biphasic TMS at two frequencies applied at or below T10 , the model replicated the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity that has been observed clinically: low-frequency TMS ( 1 Hz ) within the model normalized control of voiding after SCI , whereas high-frequency TMS ( 30 Hz ) enhanced urine storage . Neuroplasticity and increased complexity of interactions among lumbar interneurons , beyond what is necessary to simulate normal bladder function , must be present in order to replicate the effects of SCI on control of micturition , and both neuronal and network modifications of lumbar interneurons are essential to understand the mechanisms whereby TMS reduced bladder dysfunction after SCI .

Current methods quantify fungal growth rates from time-course morphology-specific data , such as hyphal length data . However , automated large-scale collection of such data lies beyond the scope of most clinical microbiology laboratories . In this paper , we propose a mathematical model of fungal growth to estimate morphology-specific growth rates from easy-to-collect , but indirect , optical density ( OD600 ) data of Aspergillus fumigatus growth ( filamentous fungus ) . Our method accounts for OD600 being an indirect measure by explicitly including the relationship between the indirect OD600 measurements and the calibrating true fungal growth in the model . Therefore , the method does not require de novo generation of calibration data . Our model outperformed reference models at fitting to and predicting OD600 growth curves and overcame observed discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD600 versus directly measured data in reference models that did not include calibration .

    Abstract: Chromatin structure and DNA accessibility are partly modulated by the incorporation of histone variants . H2A . Z , encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in S . cerevisiae , is an evolutionarily conserved H2A histone variant that is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR1-complex ( SWR1-C ) . While H2A . Z has often been implicated in transcription regulation , htz1Δ mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type . However , given that growth defects of htz1Δ mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SWR1-C subunits , previous work examining the role of H2A . Z in gene expression regulation may be confounded by deleterious activity caused by SWR1-C when missing its H2A . Z substrate ( apo-SWR1-C ) . Furthermore , as H2A . Z mutants only display significant growth defects in genotoxic stress conditions , a more substantive role for H2A . Z in gene expression may only be uncovered after exposure to cellular stress . To explore this possibility , we generated mRNA transcript profiles for wild-type , htz1Δ , swr1Δ , and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea ( HU ) , which induces DNA replication stress . Our data showed that H2A . Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure , and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes . We also observed that apo-SWR1-C contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant , particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation . Furthermore , mapping H2A . Z incorporation before and after treatment with HU revealed that decreases in H2A . Z enrichment at transcription start sites was correlated with , but generally not required for , the upregulation of genes during HU exposure . Together this study characterized the regulatory effects of H2A . Z incorporation during the transcriptional response to HU .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNASeq ) data plays a major role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology . An important current question is how to classify transcriptomic profiles obtained from scRNASeq experiments into the various cell types and identify the lineage relationship for individual cells . Because of the fast accumulation of datasets and the high dimensionality of the data , it has become challenging to explore and annotate single-cell transcriptomic profiles by hand . To overcome this challenge , automated classification methods are needed . Classical approaches rely on supervised training datasets . However , due to the difficulty of obtaining data annotated at single-cell resolution , we propose instead to take advantage of partial annotations . The partial label learning framework assumes that we can obtain a set of candidate labels containing the correct one for each data point , a simpler setting than requiring a fully supervised training dataset . We study and extend when needed state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods , such as SVM , kNN , prototype-based , logistic regression and ensemble methods , to the partial label learning framework . Moreover , we study the effect of incorporating the structure of the label set into the methods . We focus particularly on the hierarchical structure of the labels , as commonly observed in developmental processes . We show , on simulated and real datasets , that these extensions enable to learn from partially labeled data , and perform predictions with high accuracy , particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method . We demonstrate that the performances of our methods trained with partially annotated data reach the same performance as fully supervised data . Finally , we study the level of uncertainty present in the partially annotated data , and derive some prescriptive results on the effect of this uncertainty on the accuracy of the partial label learning methods . Overall our findings show how hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies can help solve the problem of automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles , interestingly these methods rely on a much less stringent type of annotated datasets compared to fully supervised learning methods .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The RNA content is crucial for the formation of nuclear compartments , such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli . Phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) is found in nuclear speckles , nucleoli , and nuclear lipid islets and is involved in RNA polymerase I/II transcription . Intriguingly , the nuclear localization of PIP2 was also shown to be RNA-dependent . We therefore investigated whether PIP2 and RNA cooperate in the establishment of nuclear architecture . In this study , we unveiled the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated ( RDPA ) nuclear proteome in human cells by mass spectrometry . We found that intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs are prevalent features of RDPA proteins . Moreover , these IDRs of RDPA proteins exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation , acetylation , and ubiquitination sites . Our results show for the first time that the RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) associates with PIP2 in the RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions , and that altered PIP2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BRD4 protein . Thus , we propose that PIP2 spatiotemporally orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins and affects their ability to form foci presumably via phase separation . This suggests the pivotal role of PIP2 in the establishment of a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression .

Here , we investigate the evolutionary basis for horns as well as other key dung beetle traits via comparative genomic and developmental assays . We begin by presenting chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species in the tribe Onthophagini ( > 2500 extant species ) including Onthophagus taurus , O . sagittarius , and Digitonthophagus gazella . Comparing these assemblies to those of seven other species across the order Coleoptera identifies evolutionary changes in coding sequence associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis . We then contrast chromatin accessibility in developing head horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O . taurus males and females and identify distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- compared to sex-responsive development , including a large proportion of recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn morph determination . Binding motifs of known and new candidate transcription factors are enriched in these nutrition-responsive open chromatin regions . Our work highlights the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits , demonstrates gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals , and provides new reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental , ecological , and evolutionary studies of this insect group .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The pathogenesis of Lassa fever has not yet been fully deciphered , particularly as concerns the mechanisms determining whether acute infection is controlled or leads to catastrophic illness and death . Using a cynomolgus monkey model of Lassa virus ( LASV ) infection reproducing the different outcomes of the disease , we performed histological and transcriptomic studies to investigate the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune mechanisms associated with survival or death . Lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever , with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome . However , subsequent viral tropism varies considerably with disease severity , with viral dissemination limited almost entirely to lymphoid organs and immune cells during nonfatal Lassa fever . By contrast , the systemic dissemination of LASV to all organs and diverse cell types , leading to infiltrations with macrophages and neutrophils and an excessive inflammatory response , is associated with a fatal outcome . These results provide new insight into early viral dynamics and the host response to LASV infection according to disease outcome .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Pathological disruption of Nucleocytoplasmic Transport ( NCT ) , such as the mis-localization of nuclear pore complex proteins ( Nups ) , nuclear transport receptors , Ran-GTPase , and RanGAP1 , are seen in both animal models and in familial and sporadic forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) , frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTD\FTLD ) , and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias ( AD/ADRD ) . However , the question of whether these alterations represent a primary cause , or a downstream consequence of disease is unclear , and what upstream factors may account for these defects are unknown . Here , we report four key findings that shed light on the upstream causal role of Importin-β-specific nuclear transport defects in disease onset . First , taking advantage of two novel mouse models of NEMF neurodegeneration ( NemfR86S and NemfR487G ) that recapitulate many cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases , we find an Importin-β-specific nuclear import block . Second , we observe cytoplasmic mis-localization and aggregation of multiple proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS/FTD and AD/ADRD , including TDP43 , Importin-β , RanGap1 , and Ran . These findings are further supported by a pathological interaction between Importin-β and the mutant NEMFR86S protein in cytoplasmic accumulations . Third , we identify similar transcriptional dysregulation in key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease . Lastly , we show that even transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β in both mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cells induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in our mouse models and in neurodegeneration . Our convergent results between mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cellular biology provide mechanistic evidence that many of the mis-localized proteins and dysregulated transcriptional events seen in multiple neurodegenerative diseases may in fact arise primarily from a primary upstream defect in Importin- β nuclear import . These findings have critical implications for investigating how sporadic forms of neurodegeneration may arise from presently unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Importin-β function .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The pervasiveness of gene expression variation and its contribution to phenotypic variation and evolution is well known . This gene expression variation is context dependent , with differences in regulatory architecture often associated with intrinsic and environmental factors , and is modulated by regulatory elements that can act in cis ( linked ) or in trans ( unlinked ) relative to the genes they affect . So far , little is known about how this genetic variation affects the evolution of regulatory architecture among closely related tissues during population divergence . To address this question , we analyzed gene expression in the midgut , hindgut , and Malpighian tubule as well as microbiome composition in the two gut tissues in four Drosophila melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids from two divergent populations: one from the derived , European range and one from the ancestral , African range . In both the transcriptome and microbiome data , we detected extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects , including effects of genetic background on overall tissue specificity . Tissue-specific effects were typically stronger than genetic background-specific effects , although the two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules . An examination of allele specific expression revealed that , while both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in genes expressed differentially between populations than genes with conserved expression , trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects . Despite there being highly variable regulatory architecture , this observation was robust across tissues and genetic backgrounds , suggesting that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence and yielding new insights into cis and trans regulatory evolution .

    Abstract: While the first infection of an emerging disease is often unknown , information on early cases can be used to date it . In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic , previous studies have estimated dates of emergence ( e . g . , first human SARS-CoV-2 infection , emergence of the Alpha SARS-CoV-2 variant ) using mainly genomic data . Another dating attempt used a stochastic population dynamics approach and the date of the first reported case . Here , we extend this approach to use a larger set of early reported cases to estimate the delay from first infection to the Nth case . We first validate our framework by running our model on simulated data . We then apply our model using data on Alpha variant infections in the UK , dating the first Alpha infection at ( median ) August 21 , 2020 ( 95% interpercentile range across retained simulations ( IPR ) : July 23–September 5 , 2020 ) . Next , we apply our model to data on COVID-19 cases with symptom onset before mid-January 2020 . We date the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan at ( median ) November 28 , 2019 ( 95% IPR: November 2–December 9 , 2019 ) . Our results fall within ranges previously estimated by studies relying on genomic data . Our population dynamics-based modelling framework is generic and flexible , and thus can be applied to estimate the starting time of outbreaks in contexts other than COVID-19 .

    Abstract: Sex determination in the nematode C . elegans is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis . Expression of xol-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes and autosomes , which differs between XX hermaphrodites and XO males . In males , xol-1 is highly expressed and in hermaphrodites , xol-1 is expressed at very low levels . XOL-1 activity is known to be critical for the proper development of C . elegans males , but its low expression was considered to be of minimal importance in the development of hermaphrodite embryos . Our study reveals that XOL-1 plays an important role as a regulator of developmental timing during hermaphrodite embryogenesis . Using a combination of imaging and bioinformatics techniques , we found that hermaphrodite embryos have an accelerated rate of cell division , as well as a more developmentally advanced transcriptional program when xol-1 is lost . Further analyses reveal that XOL-1 is responsible for regulating the timing of initiation of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes , and the appropriate expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites . We found that xol-1 mutant embryos overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3K9me landscape . Some of these effects of the loss of xol-1 gene were reversed by the loss of met-2 . These findings demonstrate that XOL-1 plays an important role as a developmental regulator in embryos of both sexes , and that MET-2 acts as a downstream effector of XOL-1 activity in hermaphrodites .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly relevant as genetics-based mosquito control strategies advance from laboratory to field testing . Especially applicable are mosquito gene drive projects , the potential scale of which leads monitoring to be a significant cost driver . For these projects , monitoring will be required to detect unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes beyond field sites , and the emergence of alternative alleles , such as drive-resistant alleles or non-functional effector genes , within intervention sites . This entails the need to distribute mosquito traps efficiently such that an allele of interest is detected as quickly as possible—ideally when remediation is still viable . Additionally , insecticide-based tools such as bednets are compromised by insecticide-resistance alleles for which there is also a need to detect as quickly as possible . To this end , we present MGSurvE ( Mosquito Gene SurveillancE ) : a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized . A key strength of MGSurvE is that it allows important biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit to be accounted for , namely: i ) resources required by mosquitoes ( e . g . , food sources and aquatic breeding sites ) can be explicitly distributed through a landscape , ii ) movement of mosquitoes may depend on their sex , the current state of their gonotrophic cycle ( if female ) and resource attractiveness , and iii ) traps may differ in their attractiveness profile . Example MGSurvE analyses are presented to demonstrate optimal trap placement for: i ) an Aedes aegypti population in a suburban landscape in Queensland , Australia , and ii ) an Anopheles gambiae population on the island of São Tomé , São Tomé and Príncipe . Further documentation and use examples are provided in project’s documentation . MGSurvE is intended as a resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance .

    ","Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is becoming increasingly important as genetics-based control strategies move from laboratory to field testing. Gene drive projects, in particular, require monitoring for unintended spread beyond field sites and emergence of alternative alleles, such as resistant or non-functional genes, within sites. This necessitates efficient distribution of traps to detect alleles of interest as quickly as possible, ideally before remediation. Insecticide-based tools, like bed nets, are compromised by resistance alleles, also requiring quick detection. To address this, a computational framework, Mosquito Gene Surveillance (MGS), optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance, minimizing time to detect alleles. MGS accounts for biological features of mosquitoes and landscapes: resources (e.g., food, breeding sites) distributed, mosquito movement (sex, gonotrophic state, resource), and trap attractiveness. Example analyses demonstrate optimal placement for Aedes aegyti in Queensland, Australia and Anopheles gambia on São Tomé Tomé Principe. MGS is a resource for field and computational researchers in mosquito surveillance."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Symbiomonas scintillans Guillou et Chrétiennot-Dinet , 1999 is a tiny ( 1 . 4 μm ) heterotrophic microbial eukaryote . The genus was named based on the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum , however , like most such endosymbionts neither the identity nor functional association with its host were known . We generated both amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing data from S . scintillans strains RCC257 and RCC24 , but were unable to detect any sequences from known lineages of endosymbiotic bacteria . The absence of endobacteria was further verified with FISH analyses . Instead , numerous contigs in assemblies from both RCC24 and RCC257 were closely related to prasinoviruses infecting the green algae Ostreococcus lucimarinus , Bathycoccus prasinos , and Micromonas pusilla ( OlV , BpV , and MpV , respectively ) . Using the BpV genome as a reference , we assembled a near-complete 190 kbp draft genome encoding all hallmark prasinovirus genes , as well as two additional incomplete assemblies of closely related but distinct viruses from RCC257 , and three similar draft viral genomes from RCC24 , which we collectively call SsVs . A multi-gene tree showed the three SsV genome types branched within highly supported clades with each of BpV2 , OlVs , and MpVs , respectively . Interestingly , transmission electron microscopy also revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar the morphology and size of the endosymbiont originally reported in S . scintillans . Overall , we conclude that S . scintillans currently does not harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium , but is associated with giant viruses .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer’s disease with ApoE4 strongly increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to the control ApoE3 . To investigate how ApoE isoforms alter risk , we measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing a human ApoE gene ( isoform 2 , 3 , or 4 ) . The regulation of each protein’s homeostasis is observed by measuring turnover rate and abundance for that protein . We identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the homeostatic regulation of ~2700 ontologies . In the brain , we found that ApoE4 and ApoE2 both lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to the wild-type control ApoE3 . In ApoE4 mice , lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggests that dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy is reducing protein quality . In ApoE2 , proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and the membrane , including oxidative phosphorylation complexes , had a similar increase in degradation which suggests coordinated replacement of the entire organelle . In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting that the ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues . Our findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover rates to decipher proteome regulatory mechanisms and their potential role in biology .

A2 increased degradation of mitochondrial and membrane proteins, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, indicating coordinated replacement of the organelle.

    Abstract: Tissue-specific gene knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful approach for characterizing gene functions during development . However , this approach has not been successfully applied to most Drosophila tissues , including the Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) . To expand tissue-specific CRISPR to this powerful model system , here we present a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis ( CRISPR-TRiM ) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons , muscles , and glial cells . We validated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue , demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system , and showed simultaneous knockout of multiple redundant genes . We used CRISPR-TRiM to discover an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance . Furthermore , we demonstrate that the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling . Lastly , we found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ . Thus , we have successfully developed an NMJ CRISPR mutagenesis approach which we used to reveal genes important for NMJ structural plasticity .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Post-larval hematopoiesis in Drosophila largely depends upon the stockpile of progenitors present in the blood-forming organ/lymph gland of the larvae . During larval stages , the lymph gland progenitors gradually accumulate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) , which is essential to prime them for differentiation . Studies have shown that ROS triggers the activation of JNK ( c-Jun Kinase ) , which upregulates fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) to facilitate progenitor differentiation . Intriguingly , despite having ROS , the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in the late larval stages . Using expression analyses , genetic manipulation and pharmacological approaches , we found that the Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Relish ( Rel ) shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that inducts them into the differentiation program by curtailing the activation of JNK . Although ROS serves as the metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation , the input from ROS is monitored by the developmental signal TAK1 , which is regulated by Relish . This developmental circuit ensures that the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted entirely . Our study sheds light on how , during development , integrating NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways seem crucial to regulating cell fate transition during development .

    Abstract: Like many other non-sporulating bacterial species , Escherichia coli is able to survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion , by entering a state of growth called long-term stationary phase ( LTSP ) . In July 2015 , we initiated a set of evolutionary experiments aimed at characterizing the dynamics of E . coli adaptation under LTSP . In these experiments populations of E . coli were allowed to initially grow on fresh rich media , but were not provided with any new external growth resources since their establishment . Utilizing whole genome sequencing data obtained for hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points spanning the first six years of these experiments , we reveal several novel aspects of the dynamics of adaptation . First , we show that E . coli continuously adapts genetically , up to six years under resource exhaustion , through the highly convergent accumulation of mutations . We further show that upon entry into LTSP , long-lasting lineages are established . This lineage structure is in itself convergent , with similar lineages arising across independently evolving populations . The high parallelism with which adaptations occur under LTSP , combined with the LTSP populations’ lineage structure , enable us to screen for pairs of loci displaying a significant association in the occurrence of mutations , suggestive of a historical contingency . We find that such associations are highly frequent and that a third of convergently mutated loci are involved in at least one such association . Combined our results demonstrate that LTSP adaptation is characterized by remarkably high parallelism and frequent historical contingency .

Interestingly , the MSA transcript is a male-specific version of another transcript produced in both sexes within the posterior central nervous system from an alternative promoter , called the iab-8 lncRNA . However , while the MSA transcript produces a small peptide , it seems that the iab-8 transcript does not . Here , we show that the absence of iab-8 translation is due to a repressive mechanism requiring the two unique 5’ exons of the iab-8 lncRNA . Through cell culture and transgenic analysis , we show that this mechanism relies on the presence of upstream open reading frames present in these two exons that prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames .

    Abstract: The HBV core ( HBc ) protein contains an N-terminal domain ( NTD ) for capsid assembly and an arginine-rich C-terminal domain ( CTD ) for pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) encapsidation . Phosphorylation of the HBc CTD , especially at Ser162 and Ser170 , is essential for nucleation with the polymerase ( Pol ) to initiate pgRNA encapsidation . As capsids mature , the HBc CTD undergoes dephosphorylation , suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsidation , which remains to be determined . Using a C-S170 antibody specific for non-phosphorylated HBc-Ser170 , we observed a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state during pgRNA packaging . The Pol-dependent dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 was confirmed by the substitution of one single amino acid at Val782 in the RNase H domain , which abolished the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 . Immunoprecipitation , mass spectrometry analyses , and the protein structural analyses showed that the recruitment of the host phosphatase PP1 is dependent on the Pol-Val782 domain . This recruitment does not require HBc but does require Pol via epsilon RNA signal , suggesting that the Pol-pgRNA complex plays a key role in PP1 recruitment . Pol-pgRNA-PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 is essential for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and appears to be associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) . Therefore , HBV Pol may play a dual role by initially bringing pgRNA to phosphorylated HBc and recruiting PP1 for later completion of RNA packaging into the capsids . These findings not only decipher the mechanism by which Pol-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc regulates pgRNA encapsulation , but also reveal the possibility of PP1 as a potential target for antiviral development .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Bacterial symbionts , with their shorter generation times and capacity for horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) , play a critical role in allowing marine organisms to cope with environmental change . The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created distinct environmental conditions in the Tropical Eastern Pacific ( TEP ) and Caribbean , offering a “natural experiment” for studying how closely related animals evolve and adapt under environmental change . However , the role of bacterial symbionts in this process is often overlooked . We sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena ( family Lucinidae ) collected on either side of the Isthmus , to investigate how differing environmental conditions have influenced the selection of symbionts and their metabolic capabilities . The lucinid sister species hosted different Candidatus Thiodiazotropha symbionts and only those from the Caribbean had the genetic potential for nitrogen fixation , while those from the TEP did not . Interestingly , this nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbiont phylogeny , suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions . Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon by including other lucinid symbiont genomes from around the world further revealed that the last common ancestor ( LCA ) of Ca . Thiodiazotropha lacked nif genes , and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nif operon through HGT from the Sedimenticola symbiont lineage .

    ","Researchers investigated the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to environmental change, using the closure of the Isthmus of Panama as a natural experiment. They sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbivalves from the genera Codak and Cten, collected on either side of the isthmus. The results showed that the lucid sister species hosted Candidatus Thiazropha symbts, with those from the Caribbean having genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the Tropical Pacific did not. Nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbion phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of nifDK operon revealed the common ancestor lacked n genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats acquired through horizontal gene transfer from Sedimentola lineage. The study suggests HGT facilitated diversification of globally distributed Ca Thiazpha species."

    Abstract: TAS2Rs are a family of G protein-coupled receptors that function as bitter taste receptors in vertebrates . Mammalian TAS2Rs have historically garnered the most attention , leading to our understanding of their roles in taste perception relevant to human physiology and behaviors . However , the evolution and functional implications of TAS2Rs in other vertebrate lineages remain less explored . Here , we identify 9 , 291 TAS2Rs from 661 vertebrate genomes . Large-scale phylogenomic analyses reveal that frogs and salamanders contain unusually high TAS2R gene content , in stark contrast to other vertebrate lineages . In most species , TAS2R genes are found in clusters; compared to other vertebrates , amphibians have additional clusters and more genes per cluster . We find that vertebrate TAS2Rs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species , although total TAS2R count is stable in most lineages . Interestingly , TAS2R count is proportional to the receptors expressed solely in extra-oral tissues . In vitro receptor activity assays uncover that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics .

    Abstract: A tri-protein complex containing NICD , RBPj and MAML1 binds DNA as monomer or as cooperative dimers to regulate transcription . Mice expressing Notch dimerization-deficient alleles ( NDD ) of Notch1 and Notch2 are sensitized to environmental insults but otherwise develop and age normally . Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids uncovered no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene miss-regulation , confirmed impaired stem cell maintenance in-vitro , and discovered an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts , a likely underlying cause for heightened sensitivity in NDD mice . TurboID followed by quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line expressing either NOTCH2DD or NOTCH2 revealed an unbalanced interactome , with reduced interaction of NOTCH2DD with the transcription machinery but relatively preserved interaction with the HDAC2 interactome suggesting modulation via cooperativity . To ask if HDAC2 activity contributes to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes , we used the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid ( VPA ) and discovered it could prevent the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitors ( DBZ or DAPT ) treatment in mice and spheroids , suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Background selection , by which selection on deleterious alleles reduces diversity at linked neutral sites , influences patterns of total neutral diversity , πT , and genetic differentiation , FST , in structured populations . The theory of background selection may be split into two regimes: the background selection regime , where selection pressures are strong and mutation rates are sufficiently low such that deleterious alleles are at a deterministic mutation-selection balance , and the interference selection regime , where selection pressures are weak and mutation rates are sufficiently high that deleterious alleles accumulate and interfere with another , leading to selective interference . Previous work has quantified the effects of background selection on πT and FST only for deleterious alleles in the background selection regime . Furthermore , there is evidence to suggest that migration reduces the effects of background selection on FST , but this has not been fully explained . Here , we derive novel theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and extend previous theory from the interference selection regime to make predictions in an island model . Using simulations , we show that this theory best predicts FST and πT . Moreover , we demonstrate that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under sufficiently high migration rates , because migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations . However , we show that background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT , particularly for metapopulations with a larger effective population size . Our work further extends the theory of background selection into structured populations , and suggests that background selection will minimally confound locus-to-locus FST scans .

The theory of background selection can be categorized into two regimes: the background regime with strong selection and low mutation rates, where deleterious alleles are at mutation-selection balance, and the interference regime with weak selection and high mutation rates, where deleter alleles accumulate and interfere. Previous studies have quantified background effects on π and F for deleterious alleles in the background regime. However, evidence suggests migration reduces background effects on F, which has not been fully explained. This study derives novel theory predicting effects of migration on background in subpopulations and extends interference regime to island model. Simulations show this theory predicts F and π. Additionally, background may increase F under high migration due to correlated fitness effects within subpopulations.

    Title: 
    Abstract: Increasing genetic and phenotypic data size is critical for understanding the genetic determinants of diseases . Evidently , establishing practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a fundamental methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies . As the sample sizes become more heterogeneous , complex statistical approaches , such as generalized linear mixed effects models , must be used to correct for the confounders that may bias results . On another front , due to the privacy concerns around Protected Health Information ( PHI ) , genetic information is restrictively protected by sharing according to regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) . This limits data sharing among institutions and hampers efforts around executing high-powered collaborative studies . Federated approaches are promising to alleviate the issues around privacy and performance , since sensitive data never leaves the local sites . Motivated by these , we developed FedGMMAT , a federated genetic association testing tool that utilizes a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests that can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites . Genetic data is never shared among collaborating sites , and the intermediate statistics are protected by encryption . Using simulated and real datasets , we demonstrate FedGMMAT can achieve the virtually same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements .

    Abstract: DPAGT1-CDG is a Congenital Disorder of Glycosylation ( CDG ) that lacks effective therapies .

We used a Drosophila rough eye model of DPAGT1-CDG with an improperly developed , small eye phenotype . We performed a drug repurposing screen on this model using 1 , 520 small molecules that are 98% FDA/EMA-approved to find drugs that improved its eye . We identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the DPAGT1-CDG model . Notably from this screen , we found that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DPAGT1-CDG model . Loss of both dopamine synthesis and recycling partially rescued the model , suggesting that dopaminergic flux and subsequent binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DPAGT1 deficiency . This links dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation and represents a new potential therapeutic target for treating DPAGT1-CDG . We also genetically validate other top drug categories including acetylcholine-related drugs , COX inhibitors , and an inhibitor of NKCC1 . These drugs and subsequent analyses reveal novel biology in DPAGT1 mechanisms , and they may represent new therapeutic options for DPAGT1-CDG .

    Abstract: The pathway for axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans is activated by SVH-1 , a growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family . SVH-1 is a dual-function factor that acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a protease to regulate early development . It is important to understand how SVH-1 is converted from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration . In this study , we demonstrate that cytidine deaminase ( CDD ) SVH-17/CDD-2 plays a role in the functional conversion of SVH-1 . We find that the codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the cdd-2 defect in axon regeneration . Furthermore , the stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1 . These results suggest that CDD-2 promotes axon regeneration by transforming the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor through modification of svh-1 mRNA .

    Abstract: Zebrafish collective behaviour is widely used to assess their physical and mental state , serving as a valuable tool to assess the impact of ageing , disease genetics , and the effect of drugs . The essence of these macroscopic phenomena can be represented by active matter models , where the individuals are abstracted as interactive self-propelling agents . The behaviour of these agents depends on a set of parameters in a manner reminiscent of those between the constituents of physical systems . In a few cases , the system may be controlled at the level of the individual constituents such as the interactions between colloidal particles , or the enzymatic behaviour of de novo proteins . Usually , however , while the collective behaviour may be influenced by environmental factors , it typically cannot be changed at will . Here , we challenge this scenario in a biological context by genetically modifying zebrafish . We thus demonstrate the potential of genetic modification in the context of controlling the collective behaviour of biological active matter systems at the level of the constituents , rather than externally . In particular , we probe the effect of the lack of col11a2 gene in zebrafish , which causes the early onset of osteoarthritis . The resulting col11a2 -/- zebrafish exhibited compromised vertebral column properties , bent their body less while swimming , and took longer to change their orientations . Surprisingly , a group of 25 mutant fish exhibited more orderly collective motion than the wildtype . We show that the collective behaviour of wildtype and col11a2 -/- zebrafish are captured with a simple active matter model , in which the mutant fish are modelled by self–propelling agents with a higher orientational noise on average . In this way , we demonstrate the possibility of tuning a biological system , changing the state space it occupies when interpreted with a simple active matter model .

However , the mechanisms connecting mechanical and chemical stimuli remained undefined , and the functions of the different VEGF forms in the culture environment were still unclear . In this paper , we developed a hybrid model for simulating short-term in vitro capillary incubations .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The Transforming Growth Factor beta ( TGF-β ) family consists of numerous secreted peptide growth factors that play significant roles in cell function , tissue patterning , and organismal homeostasis , including wound repair and immunity . Typically studied as homodimers , these ligands have the potential to diversify their functions through ligand interactions that may enhance , repress , or generate novel functions . In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans , there are only five TGF-β ligands , providing an opportunity to dissect ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates . As in vertebrates , these ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) and TGF-β/Activin subfamilies that predominantly signal through discrete signaling pathways . The BMP subfamily ligand DBL-1 has been well studied for its role in the innate immune response in C . elegans . Here we show that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogens . We also demonstrate that multiple TGF-β ligand pairs act nonredundantly as part of this response . We show that the two BMP-like ligands–DBL-1 and TIG-2–function independently of each other in the immune response , while TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-β/Activin-like ligand TIG-3 function together . Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers . Additionally , we identify TIG-2 and TIG-3 as members of a rare subset of TGF-β ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking mature dimers . Finally , we show that canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens , while components of the DAF-7 TGF-β/Activin signaling pathway do not play a major role in survival . These results demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-β/Activin subfamily ligands to interact and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The DNA damage response ( DDR ) constitutes a vital cellular process that safeguards genome integrity . This biological process involves substantial alterations in chromatin structure , commonly orchestrated by epigenetic enzymes . Here , we show that the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 ( Nat4 ) , known to acetylate the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2A , is implicated in the response to DNA damage in S . cerevisiae . Initially , we demonstrate that yeast cells lacking Nat4 have an increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than wild-type cells . Accordingly , upon DNA damage , NAT4 gene expression is elevated , and the enzyme is specifically recruited at double-strand breaks . Delving deeper into its effects on the DNA damage signaling cascade , nat4-deleted cells exhibit lower levels of the damage-induced modification H2AS129ph ( γH2A ) , accompanied by diminished binding of the checkpoint control protein Rad9 surrounding the double-strand break . Consistently , Mec1 kinase recruitment at double-strand breaks , critical for H2AS129ph deposition and Rad9 retention , is significantly impaired in nat4Δ cells . Consequently , Mec1-dependent phosphorylation of downstream effector kinase Rad53 , indicative of DNA damage checkpoint activation , is reduced . Importantly , we found that the effects of Nat4 in regulating the checkpoint signaling cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically towards histone H4 . Overall , this study points towards a novel functional link between histone N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and the DDR , associating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Phylogenies depicting the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer , i . e . , cancer phylogenies , offer valuable insights about cancer development and guide treatment strategies . Many methods exist that reconstruct cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected with bulk DNA sequencing . However , these methods become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations , or , in some cases , fail to recover a phylogeny altogether . Here , we introduce Orchard , a cancer phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate using up to 1000 mutations . Orchard samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies , a novel result derived in this paper . Each factor in this approximate posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylogeny . Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially , generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations . Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALLs ) . Remarkably , Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phylogenies using up to 1 , 000 mutations . Additionally , we demonstrate that the large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations .

    Title: 
    Abstract: The quality of meat is important to the consumer . Color is a primary indicator of meat quality and is characterized mainly into lightness , redness , and yellowness . Here , we used the genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and gene-based association analysis with whole-genome resequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to map genes related to meat lightness and redness to a 6 . 24 kb QTL region ( GGA15: 6298 . 34–6304 . 58 kb ) . This analysis revealed that only the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma ( PPP1CC ) was associated with meat color ( P = 8 . 65E-08 ) . The causal relationships between PPP1CC expression and meat lightness/redness were further validated through Mendelian randomization analyses ( P < 2 . 9E-12 ) . Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1CC knockout ( PPP1CC-SSKO ) mice were generated and these mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in the limb muscles . In addition , the predominant myofiber shifted from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers . Through transcriptome and targeted metabolome evidence , we found that inhibition of PPP1CC decreased the expression of typical slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes and enhanced the glycolysis pathway . Functional validation through a plasmid reporter assay revealed that a SNP ( rs315520807 , C > T ) located in the intron of PPP1CC could regulate the gene transcription activity . The differences in meat color phenotypes , myoglobin content , frequency of rs315520807 variant , expression of PPP1CC and fast-twitch fiber marker genes were detected between fast-growing white-feathered chickens and local chickens . In this study , PPP1CC was identified as the causative gene for meat color , and the novel target gene and variant that can aid in the innovation of meat improvement technology were detected .

    Abstract: Spatially nonlinear stimulus integration by retinal ganglion cells lies at the heart of various computations performed by the retina . It arises from the nonlinear transmission of signals that ganglion cells receive from bipolar cells , which thereby constitute functional subunits within a ganglion cell’s receptive field . Inferring these subunits from recorded ganglion cell activity promises a new avenue for studying the functional architecture of the retina . This calls for efficient methods , which leave sufficient experimental time to leverage the acquired knowledge for further investigating identified subunits . Here , we combine concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography and introduce super-resolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ) as a technique to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits . Simulations demonstrate that this approach can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations , and application in recordings of primate parasol ganglion cells validates the experimental feasibility . STR can potentially reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within only a few tens of minutes of recording time , making it ideal for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings .

    Title: 
    Abstract: An important application of CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) technology is for identifying chemical-genetic interactions ( CGIs ) . Discovery of genes that interact with exposure to antibiotics can yield insights to drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance . The objective is to identify CRISPRi mutants whose relative abundance is suppressed ( or enriched ) in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted , reflecting synergistic behavior . Different sgRNAs for a given target can induce a wide range of protein depletion and differential effects on growth rate . The effect of sgRNA strength can be partially predicted based on sequence features . However , the actual growth phenotype depends on the sensitivity of cells to depletion of the target protein . For essential genes , sgRNA efficiency can be empirically measured by quantifying effects on growth rate . We observe that the most efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs . sgRNA efficiency interacts in a non-linear way with drug sensitivity , producing an effect where the concentration-dependence is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength ( and less so for sgRNAs that induce too much or too little target depletion ) . To capture this interaction , we propose a novel statistical method called CRISPRi-DR ( for Dose-Response model ) that incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation . We use CRISPRi-DR to re-analyze data from a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify genes that interact with antibiotics . This approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets , which we show via an CRISPRi dataset for E . coli growth on different carbon sources . The performance is competitive with the best of several related analytical methods . However , for noisier datasets , some of these methods generate far more significant interactions , likely including many false positives , whereas CRISPRi-DR maintains higher precision , which we observed in both empirical and simulated data .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Finding communities in gene co-expression networks is a common first step toward extracting biological insight from these complex datasets . Most community detection algorithms expect genes to be organized into assortative modules , that is , groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups . While it is reasonable to expect that these modules exist , using methods that assume they exist a priori is risky , as it guarantees that alternative organizations of gene interactions will be ignored . Here , we ask: can we find meaningful communities without imposing a modular organization on gene co-expression networks , and how modular are these communities ? For this , we use a recently developed community detection method , the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model ( SBM ) , that does not assume that assortative modules exist . Instead , the SBM attempts to efficiently use all information contained in the co-expression network to separate the genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes . Using RNAseq gene expression data measured in two tissues derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster , we show that ( a ) the SBM is able to find ten times as many groups as competing methods , that ( b ) several of those gene groups are not modular , and that ( c ) the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities . These results show that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks .

Traditional methods expect genes to be grouped together based on similarity, but this assumption may overlook alternative organizations. The Weighted Stochastic Block Model (SB) is a community detection method that doesn't assume modules exist a priori, instead, it separates genes into hierarchically organized blocks using all co-expression information. Using RNA-seq data from Drosophila melanogaster tissues, SB found 10 times more groups than competing methods, some of which aren't modular. Non-modular groups are as functionally enriched as modular ones. This suggests the transcriptome is more complex than thought, challenging the assumption modularity drives gene-expression structuring."

We find that pab1Δ cells manifest drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome , as well as defects in translation initiation and termination . Defects in translation initiation and the stabilization of specific classes of mRNAs in pab1Δ cells appear to be partly indirect consequences of reduced levels of specific initiation factors , decapping activators , and components of the deadenylation complex in addition to the general loss of Pab1’s direct role in these processes . Cells devoid of Pab1 also manifested a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in translation termination . Collectively , our results indicate that , unlike the loss of simpler regulatory proteins , elimination of cellular Pab1 is profoundly pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcriptional regulation .

    Abstract: Slow brain rhythms , for example during slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization , can be accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration . Such slow brain rhythms typically have a lower frequency than tonic action-potential firing . They are assumed to arise from network-level mechanisms , involving synaptic interactions and delays , or from intrinsically bursting neurons . Neuronal burst generation is commonly attributed to ion channels with slow kinetics . Here , we explore an alternative mechanism generically available to all neurons with class I excitability . It is based on the interplay of fast-spiking voltage dynamics with a one-dimensional slow dynamics of the extracellular potassium concentration , mediated by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase . We use bifurcation analysis of the complete system as well as the slow-fast method to reveal that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteresis loop organized around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node loop bifurcation–a common feature of class I excitable neurons . Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-ATPase , bursts are generated from pump-induced shearing the bifurcation structure , spiking is tonic , or cells are silenced via depolarization block . We suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation , such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na+/K+-ATPase activity . The identified minimal mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump’s generic contribution to burst dynamics can , therefore , contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and , potentially , inform therapeutic strategies .

    Title: 
    Abstract: Recent research on multi-view clustering algorithms for complex disease subtyping often overlooks aspects like clustering stability and critical assessment of prognostic relevance . Furthermore , current frameworks do not allow for a comparison between data-driven and pathway-driven clustering , highlighting a significant gap in the methodology . We present the COPS R-package , tailored for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results . COPS features advanced methods , including similarity networks , kernel-based approaches , dimensionality reduction , and pathway knowledge integration . Some of these methods are not accessible through R , and some correspond to new approaches proposed with COPS . Our framework was rigorously applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types , including breast , prostate , and lung , utilizing mRNA , CNV , miRNA , and DNA methylation data . Unlike previous studies , our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness . Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score , survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates , and the stability of the results . While survival analysis and gold-standard agreement are standard metrics , they vary considerably across methods and datasets . Therefore , it is essential to assess multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria , from cluster stability to prognostic relevance , and to provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets . Emphasizing multi-objective evaluation , we applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study . Affinity Network Fusion , Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization , and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies .

Survival and standard metrics varied across methods and datasets, necessitating multi-criteria evaluation. The Pareto efficiency concept was applied to gauge equilibrium metrics in each case. Affinity Network, Integrative Non-Matrix Factor, and Multiple Kernel-Mans with Pathway Kernels were most stable and effective in discerning groups with different outcomes in several studies."

    Title: 
    Abstract: Development of multicellular organisms requires well-orchestrated interplay between cell-intrinsic transcription factors and cell-cell signaling . One set of highly conserved transcription factors that plays diverse roles in development is the SoxC group . C . elegans contains a sole SoxC protein , SEM-2 . SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development , and for specifying the sex myoblast ( SM ) fate in the postembryonic mesoderm , the M lineage . We have identified a novel partial loss-of-function sem-2 allele that has a proline to serine change in the C-terminal tail of the highly conserved DNA-binding domain . Detailed analyses of mutant animals harboring this point mutation uncovered new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage . First , SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381 , the sole C . elegans FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor , to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the M lineage . Second , in addition to specifying the SM fate , SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage . Finally , SEM-2 appears to directly regulate the expression of hlh-8 , which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor and plays critical roles in proper patterning of the M lineage . Our data , along with previous studies , suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins . Furthermore , our work identified new interactions in the gene regulatory network ( GRN ) underlying C . elegans postembryonic development and adds to the general understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins .

    ","In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the SoxC group transcription factor SEM-2 plays a crucial role in embryonic and postembryonic development. SEM-2 is essential for specifying the sex myoblast (SM) fate in the postembry mesoderm lineage and is involved in embryonic development. A novel loss-of-function SEM-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal of the conserved DNA-binding domain was identified. Analysis of mutant animals harboring this mutation revealed new functions of SEM-2 in the SM lineage. SEM-2 functions antagonizes LET-38, the C. elegans Fox/Forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the SM lineage. Additionally, SEM-2 is required for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage. SEM- also regulates the expression of hl-8, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor critical for patterning the SM. These findings, along with previous studies, suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. This work identifies new interactions in the gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying C. elegans postembry development, contributing to understanding the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins."
