Researchers have developed a stochastic mathematical model to study the dynamics of gambiense human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The model was fitted to data from 16 health areas in the Mosango zone of Kwilu province, capturing the disease's dynamics at a local level of approximately 10,000 people. Using particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology, the analysis accounted for spatial heterogeneity in cases, predicting that under current strategies, the area of Kinzamba will have the latest expected year for elimination. Fitting a deterministic version of the model was computationally faster but produced virtually indistinguishable results, suggesting its use for larger areas. The stochastic model provides a framework for detailed projections of future infections under various scenarios. The study demonstrates that mechanistic stochastic models can be fitted to health area data, allowing for calibration and projections of gambiense human trypanosiasis infections. Modelling at a health area scale captures the heterogeneity and focal nature of the disease, providing specific results. The approach can be used to assess if regions are on track for elimination and where efforts should be focused to achieve the target of eliminating transmission to humans.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to analyze tumor microenvironments (TMEs) by summarizing spatial relationships using spatial functions and applying functional data and random forest models to predict patient outcomes and identify important interactions. The method is effective in simulation experiments, identifying interactions while controlling false discovery rate, and is resistant to overfitting. The approach was applied to real data from multiplex ion beam images of triple negative breast and lung cancer patients, comparing groups with "compartmentised" and "mixed" tumors based on tumor-immune cell interactions. Spatial functions for cell interactions are combined with patient metadata, such as age and sex, and used in a random forest model to predict patient outcomes. The method aims to identify differences in cell phenotypes, proteins, or mixtures between patient groups and predict group membership using TME and metadata. The approach is publicly available in the R package funkells and has been shown to be effective in identifying marked spatial patterns with known interactions, demonstrating its potential for guiding therapeutic interventions and predicting patient outcomes such as survival and treatment success with immunotherapies.
Researchers computationally studied how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-emerge, particularly during desynchronization processes and their response to external perturbations. A network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic and structural plasticity mechanisms was used, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity, homeostatic structural plasticity, and a combination of both. The study found that structural reorganization can enhance the network's level of synchrony, with weaker contacts preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning leading to synchrony with sparser connections. The strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher firing rates to lower rates and weakening in the opposite direction, followed by removal of weak contacts, allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections. This results in the emergence of degree-frequency, degree correlations and a mixture of degree assortativity. The study compared stimulation-induced desynchronization in different models, finding that those with homeostatic structural plasticity require higher intensity stimuli for long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform preclinical and clinical studies aiming to induce long-lasting relief from symptoms, such as in Parkinson's disease. The model maintains distinction between timescales of neuronal activity and plasticity, using a stochastic method that produces similar dynamics to established methods but is computationally faster.
Researchers have discovered a mechanism for the coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia in planarians, a type of animal that can regenerate large regions of their nervous system. The study found that neurons expressing the Delta-encoding gene delta-2 are regenerated first, followed by the specification of glia from Notch-1-expressing mesoderm-like phagocytic progenitors. Inhibition of delta2 or Notch1 reduced glia regeneration without affecting other phagocytic cell types. The loss of delta2-expressing neurons prevented glia differentiation, while transplantation of delta2-expressing photoreceptor neurons induced glia formation. The results suggest a model where patterned delta2-express neurons instruct phocytic progenitors to differentiate into glia, enabling coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia. The interaction between delta2 on neurons and Notch1 on phocytic progenitors specifies progenitors to choose the glial fate and differentiate, presenting a solution to the challenge of coordinated regeneration between neurons and glia. The Notch signaling pathway is essential for cell-fate and tissue patterning and plays a role in planarian glia regeneration, distinct from its role in neuronal progenitors. The modular nature of this mechanism could facilitate evolution of new configurations of glia by neurons acquiring or losing delta2 expression and accessing phocytic progenitors. This discovery provides insight into the regeneration of the nervous system and the role of Notch signaling in neuron-glia development.
Researchers investigated gamma-delta (γδ) T cell responses in individuals with HIV from pre-acquisition to acute infection, focusing on those who developed neutralization breadth. Significant differences in γδ T cell surface marker expression were found between participants who developed neutralization and those who did not. Activation of γδ cells occurred within weeks of HIV acquisition and correlated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on Vδ1 cells and CD57 on Vδ2 cells were higher in broad neutralizers during acute HIV infection and associated with later development of neutralization. CD16 on V1 cells also correlated with early production of founder virus-specific IgM. In contrast, V1 expansion occurred only during chronic infection and was not associated with viral load. Lower V2 T cell frequency at day 18 post-infection was observed in participants with neutralization breadth, likely due to higher viral load. Higher CD16 and CD57 expression on V1 and V2 cells were found in participants with neutralization breadth. Understanding how γ T cells promote neutralizing antibodies could inform vaccine strategies targeting these cells to improve humoral responses, especially against HIV-1 Env. The study evaluated γ T cell frequency and phenotype from pre-acquisition to acute infection in participants with and without neutralization, assessing their contribution to viral control and humoral responses. The findings suggest γ T cells may promote development of neutralization breadth, with implications for HIV vaccine development.
The spread of cancer from one organ to another, known as metastasis, is responsible for the majority of cancer deaths, yet most anti-cancer drugs focus on arresting tumor growth rather than addressing the spread. Research has shown that tumor-secreted interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 enhance metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner. A novel bispecific antibody, BS1, targeting IL-6 and IL8 receptors, significantly reduced metastatic burden in preclinical mouse models. Bispecific antibodies combine two antigen-binding sites into one molecule, offering enhanced avidity and dual effects. A quantitative model of BS1 exhibits multivalent binding, providing insights into affinity and avidity, guiding therapeutic design. Simulations of monovalent and bivalent interactions between antibody constructs and IL-6 and IL8 receptors demonstrate how properties impact binary and ternary complex formation, driving receptor inhibition. Targeting IL6 and IL8 is a promising approach to inhibiting tumor metastasis, with monoclonal antibodies being a fixture in anti-cancer regimens due to specificity and stability. Simulations reveal antibody concentration and receptor expression levels impact bispecific binding, with a 1:1 ratio of IL6 and IL8 resulting in bispecific binding similar to monospecific antibodies. The model provides generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design.
Researchers investigated the role of ZYG-8, a conserved doublecortin-family kinase, in acentrosomal spindle assembly in C. elegans oocytes. ZYG-8 depletion resulted in overelongated spindles with pole and midspindle defects, and experiments with monopolar spindles revealed excess outward forces within the spindle, suggesting a potential role in regulating force-generating motor BMK-1/kines-5. ZYG8 is required for proper microtubule dynamics within the oocyte and its kinase activity is necessary for function during meiosis and mitosis. The protein plays two roles: regulating microtubule dynamics to facilitate proper turnover and influencing motor activity to tune forces that build and stabilize the spindle. ZYG8 contains a microtubule-binding doublecortin domain and a kinase domain, and its depletion led to reduced growth and increased nucleation rates, demonstrating modulation of microtule dynamics in mitosis. The study reveals new roles for ZYG8 in oocytes, providing insights into acentomal spindle stabilization to promote faithful meiosis, and sheds light on balancing forces within acentomal spindles and bipolar structure stabilization. ZYG8 contributes to spindle organization beyond overactivation of BM1, regulating microtule assembly in mitotically-dividing embryos, with depletion leading to reduced growth and increased nucleation rates. Overall, the findings provide new insights into doublecort-family protein functions in cell division and acentomal spindle stabilization.
Researchers investigated the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) risk using the UK Biobank dataset and Nightingale panel of 249 metabolites. They found 79 metabolites with a causal association to TD, mostly lipid-related, and twice as many metabolites causally affected by TD liability, including branched-chain amino acids. Quantitative trait locus analysis identified four metabolites with genetic loci showing attenuated regulation in TD cases compared to controls, with variants significant in the general population but not associated with TD risk. Differential analysis found 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both TD complications, with 40 not causally linked to TD. The study provides a map of consequences of TD on metabolite levels and genetic regulation, enabling understanding of TD trajectory to complications. TD seems to impact genetic regulation of metabolite levels, with more metabolites affected by TD liability than having causal effect on disease risk. Interaction analysis identified 222 variants with significant between metabolite and TD status, corresponding to 14 metabolites, including glycine and lipids, suggesting genetic regulation differences between TD patients and controls is a consequence rather than cause of disease.
Staphylococcus aureus can colonize humans asymptomatically but also cause opportunistic infections ranging from mild to life-threatening conditions. Researchers investigated host genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection by crossing susceptible CC061 and tolerant CC024 mice to generate F1 and F2 populations. Survival after MRSA infection in F1 and F2 generations was 65% and 55%, following a complex inheritance pattern for CC024 increased survival. Colonization in F2 animals was more extreme than parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. A Quantitative Locus on chromosome 7 was identified for survival and weight change after infection, with WSB/EJ allele in CC024 contributing to MRSA tolerance. Two genes, C5 and C5, have high-impact variants in this region, acting as receptors for complement C5a anaphylatoxin. C5 may have altered binding to receptors in CC024, reducing cytokine storm damage and increasing tolerance to pathogen burden. F1 mice showed median survival of seven days, higher than CC061, and maintained weight similar to CC024. F2 mice showed 55% survival, with pre-infection weight and dose not correlating with survival. The study suggests genetic component to MRSA tolerance linked to dominant alleles in CC024.
Researchers investigated how genetic networks influence adaptation by modeling a quantitative trait as the product of a simple regulatory network, the autoregulation motif, and comparing it to an additive model. Using forward-time simulations, they measured adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum and found that both models had fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected, with the network model exhibiting a complex, bimodal distribution of fitness effects and considerable deleterious selection. The network model approached the optimum more slowly than the additive model, with a lower rate of trait evolution. Both models showed similarities in adaptive walks, including the number of adaptive steps and distribution of fitness effects among fixations and beneficial mutations, but the network was more limited by a lack of large-effect mutations. The study found that interactions from genetic networks can generate complex, multimodal distributions of fitness effects, affecting a population's ability to adapt to changing environments. The results highlight the importance of considering non-additive genotype-phenotype maps in understanding adaptation, as traditional models often overlook intricate gene interactions driving trait expression. The distribution of fitness effects changes when non-additive maps are considered, impacting a population's chance to adapt.
Researchers propose a novel Bayesian view of cortical circuit function, suggesting that conductance-based neurons and synapses are naturally equipped to perform optimal information integration. Apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials, parametrized by local quantities such as effective potentials and conductances. The somatic compartment computes the posterior under these assumptions. A gradient-based plasticity rule allows neurons to learn desired distributions and weight synaptic inputs by relative reliabilities. This theory explains experimental findings related to multisensory integration and makes predictions on dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity. Conductance-based neuron dynamics compute posterior distributions from Gaussian functions represented in dendritic compartments. Somatic membrane dynamics arise from stochastic ascent on the posterior and synaptic plasticity from matching the posterior to a target distribution. Simulations demonstrate successful learning of prototypical multisensory tasks, where adapting basal inputs is conceptualized as learning dendritic prediction of somatic firing, with synaptic plasticity matching bottom-up to top-down expectations. The probabilistic view of single neuron computation yields the same somatic potential dynamics, assuming Gaussian likelihoods and priors due to summation of independent synaptic inputs resulting in a normal distribution according to the central limit theorem.
Researchers have utilized the Evolutionary Classification of Domains (EC) from experimental structures to classify and catalog domains from 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database, providing positive classification for 90% of residues in all proteomes. A total of 746,349 domains from 536,808 proteins comprising 226,424,000 amino acid residues were classified. Eukaryotes showed a higher fraction of disordered and unassigned domains compared to bacteria, as well as a higher proportion of repeated proteins, including globular and small repeats. Highly populated domains shared between eukotes and bacteria include Rossmann domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains. The study compared homolog groups from the whole proteome set against the EC reference and identified groups enriched by structure predictions. The results suggest convergence between sequence and structural classifications for well-understood protein families, while structural classification finds previously unannotated domains in less populated homolog groups. Classification rates were 98% for bacteria and lower for eukotes, likely due to prediction and contextual errors. The widespread access to previously difficult-to-classify proteins diminishes the gap between structural and sequence classification, expanding knowledge of unknown domains.
BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure with no available antivirals. The current model suggests BKV expresses T antigen (TAg) early, promoting cells to enter S phase for viral replication. However, single-cell analysis reveals robust TAg expression requires host DNA replication first. Inhibitors affecting host, not viral replication, show TAg and viral production rely on initial S phase. BKV promotes cellular replication, re-entering S phase from G2 without mitosis or G1 to prolong S for replication, resulting in cells with greater than 4N DNA content. Subsequent host DNA replication relies on canonical cell cycle regulators despite BKV infection. Findings suggest a model where viral TAg depends on initial S phase and BKV replicates during host-replication. BKV production is dependent on initial S phase, with robust TAg in ≥4 cells. Chemical inhibitors prevent cellular replication to determine viral dependence. BKV life cycle requires initial S for robust TAg and production. Late gene expression reveals VP2 follows TAg as cells progress to replication, suggesting infectious virions form in replicating cells. This places viral replication after cell arrival at 4N. Understanding molecular events for BKV production will help identify therapeutic targets against BKV.
Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool for identifying gene-trait associations by integrating gene expression studies with genome-wide association studies. A novel TWAS fine-mapping method called FIO has been developed, specifically designed for binary traits, capable of modeling all genes jointly on an entire chromosome. FIO employs a probit model to link genetically regulated expression to binary outcomes, taking into account correlation among genes on a chromosome, effectively controlling false discoveries and offering power gains over existing approaches. Simulations evaluated FIO's performance and applied to six binary disease traits in UK Biobank, reducing causal sets by 27.9-36.9% and prioritizing potentially causal genes, including GATA for asthma, ABCG2 for gout, and SHB3 for hypertension. FIO models binary traits through a probit and all genes on a chromosome, accounting for correlation within and between blocks, reducing residual variance and enhancing precision. An efficient MCM algorithm enables scalability to large datasets, making FIO an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease. FIO outperformed existing fine-mapping methods FOCUS and FOG in simulations using real genotype and simulated expression data from UK Biob.
Researchers investigated the roles of Btn2 and Hsp42 protein sequeases in maintaining proteostasis during oxidative stress, finding they are required for tolerance to oxidative conditions induced by hydrogen peroxide exposure. Btn2 and Hsp sequester oxidized proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure, and their absence leads to accumulation of protein aggregates, causing oxidant sensitivity. Overexpression of Hsp104 disaggregase rescues oxidant tolerance in btn2 hsp sequease mutants. Sup35 translation factor is identified as an in vivo sequease substrate, and Btn2 and Hsp suppress oxid-induced formation of yeast [PS+] prion, an amyloid form of Sup35. In btn2 hsp mutants, amorphous and amyloid Sup35 aggregates increase, indicating prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress without sequease activity. Data identifies protein sequestration as a key antioxidant mechanism mitigating protein oxidation-induced aggregation. Hydrogen peroxide exposure increases protein misfolding and aggregation, and Btn2 Hsp play a role in triaging aggregated proteins during oxidative conditions. Proper sequestration of aggregates prevents dysfunction associated with misfolding diseases, and btn2 hsp mutants are sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, implicating a functional role for sequestration in oxid tolerance. Overall, Btn2 Hsp sequesters protect against widespread amorph and amyloid aggregation during oxidative conditions, acting as part of the cells antioxidant system to sequest oxidatively damaged proteins.
Researchers conducted a CRISPR-interference screen to evaluate the role of long non-coding RNAs in glioblastoma invasion, identifying 48 lncRNAs associated with a 33% decrease in invasion upon knockdown. The top candidate, LINC045, demonstrated an 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion and was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade. RNA analysis revealed WASF3, previously implicated in tumor studies, was highly correlated with LINC045 expression, and WASF knockdown resulted in decreased invasion. WASF overexpression rescued invasive function lost with LINC045 knockdown, suggesting LINC045 regulates invasion via WASF. The CRISPR screen identified LINC045, a previously unannotated lncRNA, as critical to glioblastoma invasion, with expression significantly associated with tumor grade and survival. The study utilized a CRIS-based invasion screen to identify lncAs affecting glioma cell invasion, assessing clinical association with tumor grade and patient outcomes, and potential mechanisms. LINC045 regulates in vitro invasion of multiple glioblastoma cell lines, with significant associations between LINC and tumor grade, as well as patient survival. Analysis of patient data, tumor lnc knockdown, and WAS3 knockdown reveal WAS3 mediates the LINC tumor effect, indicating LINC045 as a potential therapeutic target for glioblastoma.
Researchers investigated how the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli, focusing on identifying the classes of models used for this task. A new clustering procedure was applied to electroencephalographic data from participants exposed to auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain, indicating the brain uses recurrent occurrences of regular auditory stimuli to build a model. The goal was to retrieve from EEG data the fingerprints of the putative model assigned to the sequence of auditory stimuli. The clustering procedure groups EEG signals by law, allowing selection of a parsimonious model of the data. Previous works assumed a particular class of models used by the brain to organize statistical regularities of sequences, but identification of the actual class used remains open. Employing this approach, regularities matching the algorithm generating the sequence were extracted from EEG data. The sequence generation is defined by a context and transition probabilities, and a model selection procedure showed the brain uses occurrence of strong beats in a stochastic sequence to select a model. The study provides evidence the brain builds a model based on the occurrence of regular auditory stimuli in a sequence.
Single-cell RNA sequencing is a popular method for analyzing gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, but has limitations, including failure to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcriptome size and dissociation-induced cryptic expression. To address this, a computationally calculated coefficient, cell-type weighting factor (cWF) is proposed. The study introduces a method for computing cWF and reports cWF for 76 cell types across 10 solid organs, validated by accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk RNA data using scRNA and cWF. The cWFs predict aging progression, implicating diagnostic applications and association with aging mechanisms. The study provides a method to solve limitations of scRNA analysis of complex tissues and suggests diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWF. The computed cWFs are validated by five methods, including reconstitution and deconvolution of whole-organ RNA data, comparison to experimentally measured transcript contents, independence from cell ratios, and prediction using unmatched RNA and scRNA data. The cWF accounts for variations in transcript size and cryptic expression, demonstrating a role in accurately reconstituting whole-organ RNA data and recapitulating experimentally determined mRNA differences.
Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects of a single exposure on an outcome, while Multivariable MR (MVM) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, MR and MVM can be biased by pleiotropic genetic variants, violating core assumptions. Researchers propose a radial formulation of MVM and an adapted Galith radial plot to visualize the estimated effect of each exposure within MRM analysis. Radial MRM includes an option for removal of outlying SNPs that may violate MRM assumptions. The RMR package implements these methods, demonstrating effectiveness through simulations and applied analyses, highlighting outliers with respect to all exposures can be visualized and removed. Simulations show outlier removal decreases bias under various forms of pleiotropy. Radial MRM applied to estimate lipid fractions on coronary heart disease, illustrating features of MVM can be explored within the RMR package. Radial MRM visualizes causal estimates and provides diagnostic information on MVM assumptions. The approach facilitates assessment of pleiotropic associations between genetic variants and phenotypes using GWAS data, allowing visualization of effects and identification of outlying SNPs, and pruning to obtain unbiased results.
Researchers continuously recorded the behavior of individual Drosophila melanogaster flies at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days in a featureless arenas on sucrose-agar media, generating a full-body postural dataset of nearly 2 billion instances using the deep learning framework SLE. The study identified stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion, and explored how the flies' behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment, revealing distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors. The findings added information about trends in different modalities, probis extension duration, and locomotion speed to what is known about the D. melanaster circadian cycle. A decline in probis extension and locomotion was observed as the fraction of time spent in an idle state increases across days. The hour after dawn was identified as a unique point in the flies' daily pattern of behavior, tracking general health indicators such as locomotion speed and fraction of time spent moving versus resting. High-resolution data revealed differences in behavioral patterns during morning and evening peaks of activity, primarily in grooming behavior. Overall, the study provides a clearer picture of D. melanaster behavior across timescales, revealing novel features that hint at unexplored underlying mechanisms, including a decline in the difference between day and night hours across days as flies weaken and die, similar to the weakening of circadian rhythms with age.
Researchers have identified a novel function for the conserved protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor PTP-22 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, establishing its role in molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. Loss of PTP-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 and NEKL-3, which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation. Proximity labeling studies identified the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1 as an in vivo partner of PTP-22, consistent with loss of DNBP also suppressing nekl-associated molting defects. PTP-22 plays a role in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesmosomes, suggesting it maintains tissue structural integrity. Additionally, PTP22 is implicated in nucleocytoplasmic transport and mRNA regulation, particularly in the germline, with nearly one-third of identified proteins by PTP-22 proximity labeling known as Pule components. These findings highlight the utility of combined genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel gene functions. PTP22 functionally interacts with NEKL proteins in the context of molting, exerting opposing effects on one or more substrates or acting on distinct components within a discrete pathway. Overall, PTP22 is an effector of C. elegans molting, with loss of catalytic activity alleviating molting defects in nekl mutant backgrounds.
Researchers have developed a geostatistical model to track the spread of artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia, utilizing a comprehensive database from the World Antimalarial Resistance Network on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 gene associated with artemisinin resistance. The model produced spatio-temporal predictions of artemisinin resistance, revealing an expansion of the K13 mutation across the Greater Mekong Subregion from 2000 to 2022, with the most significant change occurring between 2010 and 2015. The maps provide insights into spatial and temporal trends of artemisinin resistance, enabling improved decision support for malaria control measures. This study predicts spatio-temporal patterns and extents of artemisinin resistance at a subcontinent level, supporting malaria elimination goals in Asia. The data-driven predictive maps estimate drug resistance in locations where data is unavailable, guiding health agencies in prioritizing surveillance, treatment, and preventing resistance spread. The results are consistent with earlier work and provide critical information for health organizations to prioritize malaria control measures, as artemisinin resistance significantly expanding to Africa or India would increase malaria-related deaths substantially. The maps support monitoring, targeting strategies, and elimination efforts in Southeast Asia.
Function-to-find domain-containing proteins, including NLR1 and CARD8, play a crucial role in the inflammasome signaling pathway and innate immune response. These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FI domain, resulting in full-length, cleaved N-terminal, and cleaved-terminal peptides that form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state. NLR1 paralogs and CARD8 form conserved autohibitory complexes involving NT-CT and FL-CT interactions but with distinct mechanisms. The linker region between LRR and FI in murine NLR1 and Z5 of rat NLR1 and CARD8 mediate NT-CT interactions. Cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidase 9 interacts with NTs of murine and rat NLR1 and CARD through Z5 subdomains forming NT-DPP-CT complex but not with human NLR1. DPP9 is involved in NT-CT complex of rodent NLR1 and CARD but does not influence inhibitory activity on CT. The study enhances understanding of regulatory functions of FI-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and underscores complexity of interactions within the immune response. NLR1 and CARD exist in steady state characterized by formation of NT-CT and FL-CT autohibitory complexes suggesting conserved regulatory mechanism among FI-containing proteins. The formation of distinct autohibitory complexes represents a highly regulated mechanism controlling inflamome activation. NLR1 paralogs and CARD can be activated by pathogenic proteases through functional degradation liberating CT for inflamome assembly.
Defects in protein homeostasis can induce proteotoxic stress, affecting cellular fitness and overall tissue health. The connection between proteotoxic stress and competitive cell survival remains elusive. Research reveals the function of endoplasmic retic reticulum and Golgi localized protein Rer1 in regulating protein homeostasis in the Drosophila wing epithelium. Loss of Rer leads to proteotoxic stress and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukotic initiation factor 2. Clonal analysis shows rer1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through competition. Rer levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression, causing overgrowth under high proteotoxic stress. Increased Rer levels provide cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells, alleviating proteotoxic stress and supporting My-driven overgrowth. Rer acts as a regulator of proteostasis in Drosila, playing a role in competitive survival. Rer is localized to ER and cis-Golgi compartments and loss activates PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eIFα, indicating proteotoxic stress onset. Mutations in the rer gene were first described in yeast, required for transport between ER and Golgi. Loss of Rer creates proteotoxic stress in the wing epithelium, eliminated via cell competition when surrounded by wild-type cells. Utilizing a GFP-rer genomic construct, Rer colocalizes with ER and Golgi markers in epithelial cells, affirming conserved localization. Absence of Rer induces ER stress, activating UPR pathways, suggesting a conserved function across species. Rer deficiency creates loser cells eliminated via competition.
Researchers investigated the functional impact of non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the CHEK2 gene, which is associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers, using a high-throughput technique called deep mutational scanning (DMS). They tested 4,885 out of 4,887 possible CHE2 SNVs, including 3,913 codon changes, for their ability to complement RAD53 mutants in yeast. The results showed 770 non-synonymous changes were damaging to protein function, while 2,417 were tolerated. The findings correlate with previous structure and function data, providing a functional assay for variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases. Yeast rad53 complementation has been used as a method for protein function assessment on CHE2 pathogenic and likely-pathogenic variants, including the CHE2 founder mutation c.110delC, which showed no complementation. The rad53 complement score was used to predict intermediate function in 443 variants tested in another functional assay. The study classified 3,187 amino acid changes from non-synonymous SNVs as damaging or tolerated based on the rad53 complementation screen. This approach can help predict pathogenicity of CHE2 variants of uncertain significance found in screening and can be applied to other cancer genes.
Researchers have discovered a toxin-antitoxin system, Spx1-Ten, in Streptococcus pneumoniae that regulates epigenetic and phenotypic diversity by controlling DNA methyltransferase hsd gene inversions in the colony-determinant locus. The system consists of toxin TenA and antitoxin Spx1, which form a type II toxin-antoxin pair. Overexpression of TenA leads to growth arrest in E. coli and enhanced autolysis in S. pneumoniae, while Spx1 represses transcription of the spxA-ten operon. The balance of the Spx1-Ten system is controlled at the transcriptional level by variable AT dinucleotide repeats upstream of the spxA-ten promoter. When TenA is de-repressed, it binds to ribosome maturation factor RimM, reducing sigma factor ComX and enhancing invertase PsrA transcription, favoring transparent phase hsd allelic configurations. Expression of Ten reshapes pneumoccal epigen and colony, generating subpopulations with epetic and phenic diversity. The Spx1-Ten system acts as a programmed switch generating pneumoccal subpopulations with epetic and phenic diversity due to spontaneous variations in AT nucleotides in the promoter region of spxA-ten operon. Transcription analysis shows spxA and ten are co-transcribed as an operon, consistent with type II TA genes, and Ten exhibits toxic effects on S pneumonia when overexpressed. The Ten-driven epigen overhaul alters various aspects of bacterial biology, including loss of 6A methylation of DNA motifs recognized by Hsd1-specific methylase and increased methylation of Hsd2 and Hsd3 sequences.
Investigators in the biological sciences are collecting high-dimensional datasets that are challenging to analyze, with modalities ranging from imaging to electrophysiology to single-cell sequencing. Dimension reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis and its variants are used to simplify these datasets and facilitate analysis. Discovering low-dimensional patterns that differ between conditions in high-dimensional datasets is crucial in many research contexts. Generalized contrastive principal component analysis is a method that achieves this by examining the covariance structure of the datasets to find dimensions that exhibit the largest changes in variance between conditions. It builds on the development of contrastive principal component analysis but solves its key problem, the requirement for a hyperparameter. This method addresses questions such as which subsets of neurons exhibit increased correlations in one condition versus another or which genes are more likely to be up or downregulated in individual cells in one condition versus another. It introduces a normalization factor to mitigate bias toward high-variance dimensions. Generalized contrastive principal analysis provides a valuable resource for analyzing diverse high-dimensional datasets, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing, offering a fast and robust comparison method to gain insights into complex biological phenomena.
Researchers developed a semi-quantitative model of B cell receptor signaling in Burkitt lymphoma cells using phosphorylation data from BL-2 and BL-41 cells, unveiling feedback and crosstalk structures, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. The model's relevance was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different cells and confirmed by phosphoproteomics on ERK and known ERK sites. The BL-2 network was transferable to BL41 cells and suited to model BCR signaling in Diffuse large cell lymphoma lines with aberrant BCR, indicating no major rewiring. Additional phosphopomic analyses supported key insights of the model, which reflects conserved elements of intracellular B-cell signaling. Novel connections improved the model fit, including crosstalk from mTOR to JNK, feedback from GSK to ZAP, and negative crosstalk from p38 on RAF/ME/ERK. The BL2-derived network forms a base to describe signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma with aberrant BCR. Signaling motifs are conserved across B lymphoma types, suggesting the study's insights may apply to other B lymphomas. The model describes BCR signaling in a general and can be used as a starting point to quantify cell-specific networks.
The Notch signalling network is essential for tissue growth and maintenance, regulated by two mechanisms: intercellular Notch transactivation and intracellular inhibition. Different Notch receptor-ligand combinations elicit distinct responses, determining the strength, duration, and specificity of Notch signalling. This study explores the molecular basis of opposing actions of Notch ligands DLL4 and JAG, controlling angiogenic sprouting. Evidence suggests two mechanisms underpin this process: DLL4 induces Notch receptor transactivation, while JAG blocks DLL-dependent cis-inhibition through JAG/DLL complex formation. A new model of Notch signalling is proposed, recapitulating tip and stalk cell formation necessary for sprouting angiogenesis. Heteromeric JAG/DLL complexes relieve Notch receptor inhibition, enabling efficient Notch signalling when ligands are expressed in the same cell. Two factors underlie the mechanism by which JAG antagonizes DLL, enabling tip and stalk cell selection to drive angiogenic sprouting. DLL homimers and DLL-JAG heterimers mediate Notch receptor cis-inhibition. A new theoretical model of DLL/JAG-Not-VEGFR signalling is proposed, incorporating J1 antagonizing DLL function through hetereric DLL-JAG complexes, underlying opposing effects in sprouting angiogenesis, advancing understanding of Notch signalling through mathematical and in silico modelling of molecular and cellular processes.
Researchers have developed Dirichlet Process with Uncertainty, a Bayesian non-parametric clustering algorithm extension that incorporates data uncertainty associated with each point, outperforming existing methods on simulated data. Applied to immune-mediated diseases using GWAS statistics, it separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates subgroups like adult-onset arthritis. The method also clusters gene expression datasets summarized with signatures, introducing a novel procedure for generating signature summaries on different datasets, accounting for variability across genes. Three public expression datasets of patients with immune-mediated diseases were summarized using relevant signatures and clustered, revealing associations between disease and clusters. Clustering recapitulated known divisions and relationships in immune diseases, suggesting further uses for uncertainty-informed clustering, such as polygenic risk scores. Ignoring uncertainty led to clusterings not associated with disease status in two of nine examples. Gene signatures linked to immune diseases were identified and used to cluster patients in three datasets, demonstrating the value of incorporating uncertainty in clustering. Bayesian methods offer advantages in conveying uncertainty and inferring cluster numbers, with Dirlet Process Uncertainty adapting to settings with uncertain data points, altering clustering solutions and demonstrating performance on simulated and real applications, including GWAS statistics where uncertainty varies with sample size.
Deep neural networks have been successful models of the primate visual system but fail to account for the strong dependence of primate vision on shape, relying more on features such as color and texture. Researchers designed artificial datasets where shape, color, and texture can predict image class and trained networks to classify images with single features and combinations, showing some architectures are unable to learn shape while others are biased towards other features. The bias is explained by interactions between weight updates in mini-batch gradient descent, suggesting different algorithms with sparser changes are required. Experiments demonstrate color and texture bias arises from dynamics of gradient learning, specifically gradients aligning with image classes, and breaking this requires changing gradients. Convolutional networks show bias for color or texture over shape but are able to classify by shape, failing to learn shape-based classification if another feature is sufficient. Reducing alignment between color and texture-selective gradients enables networks to learn shape classification. Humans rely strongly on shape while networks preferentially classify by other features such as color or size, indicating a need for changes to learning algorithms to make networks sensitive to shape and improve capability to describe human vision.
Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) are the source of extracellular matrix (ECM) whose overproduction leads to fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases. Researchers developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion using the Kappa rewriting language, modeling HSC as agents with seven physiological states interacting with TGF1 molecules. Simulation revealed the critical role of HSC activation during fibrosis progression and reversion, with inactivation allowing elimination of activated HSC during reversion and reactivation of inactivated HSC required to sustain fibrosis. The model is sensitive to TGF1 parameters, suggesting adaptability to various pathophysiological conditions. Experimental data from a mouse model of CCl-induced liver fibrosis validated predicted ECM dynamics, and RNA sequencing from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated liver fibrosis confirmed accumulation of inactivated HSC, identifying them as novel markers of fibrosis progression. The study provides the first model of HSC dynamics in chronic disease, exploring regulatory roles in liver homeostasis, and can be generalized to fibroblasts in other tissues. The model integrates all H states during fibrosis development and reversion, describing interactions between cell populations and molecules like TGF1, which induces HSC activation and promotes type collagen secretion.
Researchers have developed a novel meta-analysis framework to estimate the total effect of high-dimensional mediators, such as gene expression, on complex traits and diseases. This framework allows for fixed and random effects estimation and accounts for inter-study heterogeneity, making it suitable for large-scale genomic consortia like the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine program. The method was applied to five studies with over 580 participants to estimate the mediation of gene expression on age-related systolic blood pressure and sex-related high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Simulation results showed the method was computationally efficient and yielded satisfactory characteristics comparable to individual-level data analysis when no interstudy heterogeneity existed. The framework is available in the R package MetaRm on GitHub. Meta-analysis has been applied to identify potential mediators influencing health outcomes but its methodology is underexplored in high-dimensional analysis, particularly estimating the total effect of high-dimensional omics mediators. Gene expression data from five cohorts was used as putative mediators and adjusted for covariates including BMI, sex, age, smoking, and gene profiling platform. Fixed-effects meta-analysis results showed the total effect of gene expression in the relationship between age and systolic blood pressure across five cohorts from the Trans-Omics for Medicine program.
Cancer development is driven by the accumulation of a small number of genetic mutations that confer a selective advantage to cells, while most mutations do not contribute to tumor progression. Identifying driver genes responsible for tumorigenesis is crucial for designing effective treatments. A novel method, PWH, prioritizes mutated genes based on their impact on abnormal expression across patients with similar co-mutations and gene profiles. Experimental results on 16 cancer datasets showed PWH excels in identifying known driver and tumor-specific genes, outperforming existing methods. PWH identifies common and rare drivers, improving tumor stratification and providing insights into heterogeneity. Validation of a predicted driver, Low-density lipoprotein-related protein 1, showed an effect on tumor cell proliferation. PWH is a genome/transcriptome approach leveraging influence of mutated genes on biological networks, hypothesizing samples with same cancer types display molecular similarities. PWH requires cohort samples, somatic mutation, gene profiles, and interaction, predicting personalized driver genes for each sample. Comparison with other methods showed PWH's reliability in inferring drivers, promising for discovering causal variants obscured by heterogeneity, and assisting in personalized treatment development.
The Virtual Epile Patient (EP) is a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities, generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG. This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach, utilizing a cooperative metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation to yield high-quality solutions. The approach successfully solved a set of different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating scalability and superior performance against other solvers, with further enhanced results using Bayesian framework for hyperparameter tuning. A scalable uncertainty quantification phase was added after calibration to assess variability in estimated parameters across problems. The study aims to improve estimation of pathological areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making by accurately capturing diverse seizure dynamics and generating simulations resembling intracranial EEG, offering a platform to optimize surgical strategy. The VEP model relies on estimating parameters in high-dimensional space to identify the network involved in seizure generation and propagation, integrating mathematical modeling of abnormal activity with patient-specific anatomical data to predict brain networks.
Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains a major health problem with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths. Researchers investigated Mtb growth in rabbits infected with a novel virulent clinical isolate, H878, carrying unstable plasmid p10. In vitro experiments showed p10 is more stable in H878 than laboratory-adapted Mtb strain H37. The kinetics of plid-bearing bacteria in Mtb-infected rabbits did not decline monotonically, increasing between 28-56 days post-infection and stabilizing between 84-112 days despite a large increase in bacterial numbers. Mathematical modeling suggested the lung Mtb population consists of subpopulations with different replication/death kinetics. A model with one kinetically homogeneous population could not explain the data. H878 forms well-circumscribed granomas in rabbits, suggesting independent dynamics in subsets. The study followed replication of pathogenic Mtb H878 with p10 in rabbit lungs, determining the plid is lost with a segregation coefficient of 0.1. H878-p10 undergoes more replications than H37v in mice, highlighting differences between Mtb strains and host. Two approaches could not explain H878-p10 growth in rabbit lungs. Future work will focus on correlating estimated replication and death rates with immune components in granulomas. Transforming p10 into clinical isolates could compare replication in various models.
Researchers have developed a computational algorithm called GlyTreeer that builds glycan structures layer-by-layer using kernel density estimates of common glycan conformations derived from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations. The algorithm was benchmarked on a test set of glycan structures and showed high accuracy in both de novo modeling and experimental-guided building. GlyTreeer was used to design glycan trees into a nanoparticle vaccine to shield regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition, which was experimentally verified. This work aims to inform glycoprotein prediction, glycan masking, and aid computational methods in structure determination and refinement. Computational glycobiology tools have been developed for glycosylation, carbohydrate chemistry, statistical analysis, and docking. GlyTreeer allows modelers to accurately model glycans through de novo and density-guided modeling with a median RMSD of 2.7A. The algorithm and energy were optimized and benchmarked with glycans of varying length and complexity. GlyTreeer can predict glycan structures de novo, build into known density, and be used in coating protein surfaces. The results demonstrate the potential for automated glycop modeling, sampling glycan chemistries, branching, and kinematics to build potential glycan residues into unknown glycans.
Protein ubiquitination is crucial in regulating protein quality and is usually coupled with proteasomal degradation. The E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF complex recognizes target substrates via the F-box protein, which determines substrate specificity. In Penicillium oxum, transcription factors such as BrlA, CreA, Xln, and Ace1 regulate fungal development and transcription of cellulase genes. Transcription factor Ace1 positively correlates with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively with cellulase gene expression. The ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair SCFbx-Ace1 has been identified in P. oxum, where PoF23 associates with Sk1 to form the SCFbx complex. Under glucose signal, PoF23 absence results in decreased brl gene transcription and impaired conidiation, while under cellulose signal, cellulase gene transcription is upregulated. Deleting Pof23 does not affect Po1 transcription but results in accumulation of dysfunctional Po1 protein that no longer binds to target gene promoters. PoF23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator, recognizing and activating Po1, allowing regulation of target genes with different effects under different signals. Po1 is a ubiquinated protein and substrate of the SCFbx complex. The findings support the role of PoF23 in maintaining Po1 activity and propose a model of Po23-Ace regulating transcription.
Researchers investigated the formation and diversification of the basement membrane (BM) in Drosophila melanaster follicular epithelium, which relies on a BM composed of oriented fibrils and a homogenous matrix. They found that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel routes for BM protein secretion, with Rab10 promoting lateral and planar-polarized secretion and Rab8 promoting basal secretion, leading to the formation of fibrils and homogenous BM respectively. The dystrophin-associated complex (DAP) and Rab10 are present in a plan-polarized compartment containing BM proteins, with DAP essential for fibril formation and reorienting secretion towards the Rab10 route. The exocyst complex has a dual function, interacting with dystin to limit planar polarization and required for the Rab8 route. Results highlight mechanistic aspects of BM secretion, illustrating how diversity emerges from spatial control of distinct traffic routes. Parallel secretory routes, orchestrated by Rab proteins with different cell sites defined by polarity, explain BM diversification during development. Rab10-driven lateral and planar polarized secretion and Rab8 basal secretion contribute to BM diversification, with DAP influencing plan polarization of Rab-dependent secretion. The exyst complex is required for homogenous BM formation. The study provides mechanistic insights into BM secretion in epithelial cells, demonstrating BM diversification arises from different secretory routes with cell sites integrated in polarity axes.
Researchers have developed a machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies, addressing two key challenges: underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes in training datasets and determining optimal combinations of antibodies to avoid resistance. The model, a language-based universal model, utilizes multi-task learning, trained on Env sequences with associated neutralization data and fine-tuned with sequences with non-bnAb and bnAb outcome data. Results show that multi-task learning mitigates bias against underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes and allows learning patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, providing tools to predict epitopes and select optimal combinations. The model's performance increases with size and diversity of training data, addressing key challenges in HIV-1 vaccine research. Compared to classical algorithms, random forests and gradient boosting machines, the language universal model demonstrates improved predictions. This approach can be adapted to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy, with publicly available analyses at https://github.com/ia/LBUM. The study reveals the potential of multi-task learning in predicting HIV-1 resistance, enabling the selection of optimal broadly neutralizing antibody combinations to increase therapeutic benefits.
Multiple myeloma is a hematological disease characterized by aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow, with varying treatment effects between patients, highlighting the need for prognostic models for informed decision-making. Previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring pathway dysfunction associated with disease progression. This study considered two strategies constructing predictive models incorporating pathway information: pathway score and group lasso methods. The pathway score method converted gene expression to sample-wise scores, using three calculation methods and 14 data sources, implemented in microarray data, yielding a model with best prediction performance. The candidate model outperformed gene-based and previously published models in external data and was resistant to missing values. Group lasso incorporating pathway information was competitive in prediction and outperformed published models, with immune pathways being more predictive for multiple myeloma. Pathway-based models using lasso were alternatives to gene-based models, documented in an R package with a missing imputation method for future validation. Benchmark results demonstrated the advantage of pathway models in clinical prediction, serving as a guide for future studies incorporating prior knowledge into predictive models. Pathway-based models are stable and interpretable, with predictive models based on immune pathways consistent with multiple myeloma being a cancer of plasma cells producing antibodies, a component of the adaptive immune system.
Mitochondrial fission in response to cellular insult is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death. A nonlinear dynamical model of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1)-dependent mitochondrial fission has been developed to identify parameters regulating the total fission rate (TFR) as a function of time. The model undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k+M - k, where M is the concentration of mitochondrial fission factor and k+ and k- are association and dissociation rate constants between oligomers on the outer membrane. The parameter μ represents the maximum build over disassembling rate of oligomers. Despite four dimensionless parameters from nondimensionalization, total fission rate and cumulative fission depend strongly on μ. Cumulative fission does not monotonically increase with μ, instead increases to a point then decreases as μ increases. This non-monotone dependence suggests interventions targeting k+, k, or M may have nonintuitive impact on fission. Understanding regulatory parameters like μ may assist therapeutic selection. The model focuses on Dr1-dependent fission following cellular injury with increased cytosolic Dr1 concentration. Delayed release of Dr1 from newly created mitochondrial ends could be incorporated with a delay term or additional pool of postfission complexes affecting available cytos Dr1 and total Dr1 concentration on TFR and cumulative fission.
Researchers have developed a CRISPR-based gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 (Tdc) in Drosophila suzii, a notorious fruit pest, to control disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. The 3-gRNA homing gene system showed low levels of homing in the germline, but octopamine restored egg-laying defects in Tdc mutant females, allowing easier line maintenance. A similar system was tested in Drosila melanogaster and additional split systems were constructed with promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. Findings indicate genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles and position influences Cas9 activity. The study highlights the potential of rescuing female infertility caused by the gene drive, offering a tool for industrial-scale production of gene transgenic insects. The CRPR/Cas9 genetic tool was used to construct gene drive systems targeting the haplosufficient female gene Tdc in Drosophila suii and D melanogaster. The gene drive functions by biasing inheritance of specific genes for widespread transmission across generations. Feeding octopamine to female flies restored egg-laying defects, mitigating the need for continuous introduction of wild-type females. Three gRNAs targeted the Tdc gene, reducing selective pressure for resistance. The study demonstrates a novel CRPR-based homing drive system with conditional rescue of Tdc mutant phenotype by octamine and moderate gene efficiency targeting the Tdc locus.
The brain's ability to learn is constrained not only by the energy required for computation, but also by the energy needed to form memories. Research has shown that even simple learning tasks incur significant metabolic costs, with complex tasks like MNIST requiring at least 10^8 synaptic updates. To minimize energy usage, two plasticity-restricting algorithms are proposed: modifying only synapses with large updates and restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. In large networks, restricting plasticity can save energy while incurring slightly worse learning times. An abstract energy measure assumes energy is used solely by synaptic updates, revealing a square root relation between energy and size, M ∝ N^0.43. Allowing plasticity in a subset of synapses using a binary mask drawn from a Bernoulli distribution can save energy, and skipping uninformative samples during learning can lead to further savings. Future studies can explore adapting algorithms to task difficulty or network architecture and finding efficient synaptic modification during transfer. Energy costs for neural signaling, such as transmission and spike generation, should also be considered. Large networks, like macaque V1 with 150 million neurons and 3x10^9 synapses, can have high energy costs according to the model.
Researchers investigated how laboratory evolution can overcome fitness defects in genome-streamlined microbial strains of Acinetobacter bayi ADP-IS with deletions of 22-293 kilobase regions. After evolving replicate populations for ~300 generations in minimal and complex media, fitness increased in most cases, except two strains that failed to improve in one environment. Mutations in protein-coding genes and small RNAs were associated with specific environments and deletions. Global transcriptional regulators, including RNase D, CsrA, and Hfq, were frequently mutated across strains, compensating for earlier deletions. Results demonstrate that lost fitness during genome streamlining can be regained through evolution, occurring through deletion-specific and global adjustments. Eight reduced-genome strains of Acinetacter bayi ADP-IS were evolved in laboratory environments, with substantial fitness defects initially, but evolution restored fitness partially in most instances. Engineered deletions significantly decreased fitness in one or both media, but most resulting strains gained fitness after evolution, except two that failed to recover in one environment. The study validates laboratory evolution as a strategy for improving reduced-genome strains and illuminates a path for engineering a minimal-genome Acinetobacter bayi strain.
Researchers have developed a self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebrafish, achieving up to 20-fold reduction in expression. The T3H48 self-cleaving ribozyme inserted in an intron enables rapid pre-mRNA cleavage and displays superior activity compared to other ribozymes. Insertion of the T3H48 ribozyme in the second intron of the albino gene using CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in a pigmentation similar to the mutant, and base editing to inactivate the ribozyme showed the phenotype is reversible. A Flippase and Cre-activatable version of the T348 ribozyme, called RiboFlip, was generated to control mRNA levels of the albino gene, inducing knockdown and recapitulating the mutant phenotype. The Ribo cassette can label cells independently of the expression of the target, introducing it as a flexible tool to control endogenous expression in vertebrate and alternative to existing knockdown strategies. The zebish model allows efficient screening of genetic tools due to external fertilization and rapid development, establishing a self-cleaving ribozyme system to knockdown gene expression in vivo. The T3 ribozyme induces cleavage of endogenous target in zebish and conversion to an inactive version using base editing rescues the pigmentation phenotype, broadening the genetic toolbox for functional genomics in vertebrates.
Researchers have developed aiSEG, a user-friendly software that utilizes convolutional neural networks to segment nuclei and cells in bright field images, eliminating the need for fluorescent labeling and reducing phototoxicity. The software was extensively evaluated on various cell types and imaging modalities, with a curated dataset of 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images. Results show that aiSEG accurately segments nuclei, retaining biologically relevant information, and is adaptable to new cases with minimal retraining. The software is accessible through command line and graphical interfaces and does not require coding experience. It can be used in challenging conditions such as low magnification and live imaging of primary cells, including hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Features associated with the nucleus are crucial for accurate segmentations, and removing fluorescence channels enables additional markers and improved workflows. aiSEG's segmentations provide rich information on cells, interactions, and subcellular structures. The software is available in CLI and GUI versions, utilizing a generic approach not limited to microscopy, making it accessible to users without prior coding experience and adaptable to various environments.
Humans face a challenge in identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments, which can be addressed by relying on prior knowledge of common properties of reward-predicting features, such as the rate of change of features. Behaviourally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise, suggesting humans may be biased to learn more when task-relevant features are slow rather than fast. In a decision-making task, 295 participants learned rewards of two-dimensional bandits with either slowly or quickly changing features. Results showed participants accrued more reward when the bandit's relevant feature changed slowly and its irrelevant feature quickly, compared to the opposite. No difference was found in generalizing to unseen feature values between conditions. Kalman filter models revealed participants had higher learning rates for slow features and adjusted to relevance and speed of feature changes. The larger improvement in performance for slow bandits, the more they adjusted learning rates. Results indicate human learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning. Participants learned values faster when reward-predict feature changed slowly and irrelevant feature quickly, and adjusted learning to speed of features. The study extends research on slown prior, suggesting it aids task states in reinforcement learning.
Researchers have identified a novel tumor suppressor gene, Res1, associated with metastatic susceptibility in ER-negative breast cancer using a mouse genetics approach. Res1 is a poorly characterized gene with an evolutionarily conserved intron-exon structure but poor amino acid conservation. CRISPR or gene trap mouse models demonstrated reduction of Res1 resulted in increased tumor growth, shortened survival, and increased lung metastases, consistent with patient data. Analysis revealed loss of the wildtype in tumor tissue consistent with Res1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis suggests Res1 plays a role in transcriptional control through G-quadruplex sequences associated with ribosomal biogenesis. Loss of Res1 enhances tumor progression in ER breast cancer through alterations in transcriptional and translational control. The study used two strains of mice with different tumor phenotypes to characterize Res1 as a tumor suppressor for ER breast cancer. Lower expression of Res1 correlated with worse outcomes in human cancer data and experimental models. The Res1 knockout mouse bred to the PyMT model showed increased tumor burden, rapid growth, and pulmonary metastases. The findings provide evidence that Res1 is a potential tumor suppressor and metastasis modifier in ER-negative breast cancer.
Researchers investigated the roles of DNA damage response proteins Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination, utilizing strategies such as deletion of mismatch protein Msh2 and regulation of meiotic prophase length via Ndt80 transcription factor to enable genome-wide mapping of meiotic progeny. Loss of Rad24 resulted in severely impacted spore viability and reduced recombination frequency due to shortened prophase, while loss of Mec1 increased recombination frequency with less effect on spore viability. Both Rad24 and Mec1 play roles in regulating crossovers, with their loss leading to random distributions and reduced interference. The results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-crossover factor and Mec as a regulator of recombination frequency, with Mec's loss suppressing defects in crossover regulation caused by abrogation of the DNA damage response. Genome-wide mapping revealed similar and distinct roles for Mec1 and Rad in meiotic double-strand break repair, with complex multi-chromat events initiated by closely spaced double-strand breaks occurring more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec, indicating loss of spatial regulation at the level of double-strand break formation. Overall, the study provides insights into the roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination and crossover regulation.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive in silico genome-scale model of Pneumocystis growth and metabolism to identify metabolic requirements and imbalances hindering its growth in vitro. Pneumocystis jirovecii is a deadly pathogen causing life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients, but its experimental dissection has been constrained by the inability to culture the organism in vitro. The model utilises recently published genome data, literature, bioinformatics tools, and Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement approaches to make predictions regarding metabolic fluxes and identify critical components of the Pneumyst growth medium. Findings offer insights into Pneumyst biology and provide a strategy to overcome culturing this pathogen in vitro. A genome-scale model for mouse-specific fungal pathogen Pneumyst murina was also developed for practical and ethical reasons. The model made predictions regarding Pneumyst growth and metabolism, analysing medium components and suggesting supplements to enhance growth. It replicates drop-off and knockout experiments, highlighting potential as a tool in antifungal targets development. The lack of in vitro culture has hindered Pneumyst research, relying on microscopic detection for diagnosis. In silico modelling and experimental phenotyping opens opportunities to release this bottleneck, addressing the absence of empirical data on composition, physiological and biological characteristics.
Researchers investigated whether increased levels of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcription coactivator with PDZ motif (TAZ) (YAP/TAZ) can induce sustained cancer cell proliferation. A three-dimensional mathematical model incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TA pathway was constructed to simulate cell proliferation, accounting for cell-cell interactions, adhesion, repulsion, and friction forces. The model utilized molecular dynamics equations and Lenn-Jones 12-6 potential with a softcore to secure exclusive cell domains. Simulations were performed at varying Y/TA levels to determine the extent required increase for sustained proliferation at high density. Results showed a twofold increase in YTA levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell arrest, enabling continuous proliferation under high-density conditions. The study suggests increased YTA alone can bypass contact inhibition, contributing to unchecked proliferation in cancer cells. The model integrating cell and intra-cell dynamics provides a comprehensive understanding of the influence of cell density and YTA concentration on proliferation, contributing to the understanding of normal and cancer cell characteristics. The findings position the model as a tool for evaluating malignancy, exploring therapeutic interventions targeting YTA and optimizing dosages.
Researchers have developed a framework to understand how low-complexity domains in proteins and RNAs govern the dynamics of biomolecular condensates. The framework, called Free Energy of Landscape Stickers, operates on a continuous "stickiness" scale to investigate the effects of sequence patterns on condensate dynamics and material properties. By varying sequence complexity from periodic to random, they found that periodic patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. Minimum periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates, preventing transitions to glass or solid-like states. The framework explains experimental findings on prion domains and predicts alterations in condensate viscoelasticity through periodicity and stickiness variations. The study elucidates the role of sequence complexity in governing dynamics and material properties of biomolecular condates, providing a unifying perspective on sequence-encoded properties. Key features of energy landscapes are conserved while sequences are variable, allowing for systematic programming of protein condensate viscoity by altering periodicity and stickiness of low-complex domains. The framework advances understanding of biomolecular condates' dynamics and functional roles, addressing a critical gap in understanding phase-separating biomolecules and their evolutionary development.
The development of ectodermal organs, such as teeth, begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme as the organ takes shape. Signaling by secreted molecules, including Sonic hedgehog (Sh), is critical for epithelial morphogenesis. Non-muscle myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and functions by promoting cell adhesion and convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer. Sh signaling induces myosin II activation via AKT, and pharmacological induction of AKT and myos II can rescue defects caused by inhibition of Sh. The Sh signal is transmitted through myos II to power cellular rearrangement for proper epithelial invagination. Myos II maintains cell adhesion at adherens junctions and enables persistent convergent cell movement in the suprabasal layer. The Sh-PI3/AKT-MyII axis promotes cell adhesion and movement to propel incisor invagination. Myos II acts to generate cellular forces and maintain intercellular adhesion, and its perturbations impede convergent extension and invagination. The results demonstrate the importance of MyII in maintaining cell adhesion in the stratified dental epithelium, consistent with prior findings that MyII forces are essential for growth of adherence junctions and deletion results in defective adhesion in mouse embryos.
Researchers have developed a deep learning model called single-cell graph convolutional network (scGCN) to integrate single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell chromatin accessibility (scAT-seq) data, enabling exploration of single-cell omics. Current label transfer methods have limited performance due to inability to preserve fine-grained cell populations and heterogeneity between datasets. scGC achieves high performance in preserving biological variation, integrating hundreds of thousands of cells in minutes with low memory consumption. The model regards label transfer from scRNA-seq to scATseq as domain adaption in learning, addressing challenges of domain discrepancy and robustness. scGC integrates gene expression and chromatin data into a unified multi-omics cell atlas, combining different types of measurements, even unpaired data. The model formulates cell relationships and gene expression with graph convolutional networks based on kinetic relationships between regulatory mechanisms of scRNA and scATseq, leveraging domain-specific effects. scGC accurately transfers cell annotations across datasets, tissues, species, and molecular layers, such as scRNA and scATseq, demonstrating high label accuracy and effective knowledge transfer across modalities. The approach enables analysis of large-scale atlas-level single-cell multi-omics data, providing insights into complex biological mechanisms.
Proteins with nuclear localization sequences (NLS) are directed into the nucleus through interactions between the NLS and importin proteins. Researchers characterized the sequence of an essential and conserved NLS in Mcm, a subunit of replicative helicase, using mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 modeling, demonstrating that precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm through interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs nuclear import of Mcm, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth. Mutations of Mc3 at P2 or P3 result in defective import, reduced chromatin association, and impaired growth, supporting the essential role of P2 and P3 interactions. The study provides a structure-guided framework for predicting monopartite NLS, which retain key characteristics between NLS of Mc3 and SV40 large antigen. Further characterization of Mcm's NLS will help elucidate cell-dependent nuclear import and subsequent loading, refining predictions of other putative NLS in nuclear proteins. Defective import of Mc3 into the nucleus may compromise MCM loading, leading to severe growth defects. AlphaFold analysis demonstrates NLS of Mc3 and SV share similar contacts with Kap60, providing insight into nuclear import mechanisms.
Ataxin-2, a gene implicated in spinocerebellar ataxia type II, amyrophic lateral sclerosis, and Parkinsonism, encodes a protein that functions in translational activation, repression, mRNA stability, and assembly of mRNP-granules, mediated by intrinsically disordered regions. The LSm-like domain of Atx2 stimulates translation and antagonizes mNP-granule assembly. Experiments on Drosophila and human Atin-2 proteins identified polyA-binding protein interacting PAM motif of Atin2 as a determinant of mRNA and protein content of Atin2 mNP granules. Transgenic Drosophila experiments showed At2-LS domain protects against neurodegeneration, while P2 and unstructured IDR interactions support At2-induced cytotoxicity. Atin2 has three conserved regions: LSm domain, LSm-associated domain, and P2 motif flanked by extended IDRs. The P2 motif and interactions with polyA binding protein are essential for granule assembly and recruit At2 target mRNAs and proteins into At2 granules. At2 is a translational activator, repressor, facilitator, and stabilizer of associated mRNAs. Mutants lacking cID for At2 granule formation were resistant to neurodegeneration, and LSm domain antagonizes At2 granule formation. Deletion of P2 motif in At2 affected edited RNAs in poly selected brain RNA, suggesting P2 plays a role in At2 function and neurodegeneration. Results propose Atin2 interactions remodel translational control and structured and non-structured interactions contribute to specificity and efficiency of RNP granule condensation and neurodegeneration.
Researchers investigated the role of gene regulatory networks in the development and maintenance of muscle stem cells in different anatomical locations, focusing on Pitx2 and Pax7 genes. They used genetically modified mice to study the emergence and maintenance of muscle stem cells in extraocular muscles and limb muscles, finding that Pitx2 becomes dispensable for specification and maintenance of muscle stem cells in extraocular muscles despite being crucial during early development. Constitutive inactivation of Pax7 postnatally led to greater loss of muscle stem cells in extraocular muscles compared to limb, suggesting a relay between Pitx, My5, and Pax7 for stem cell maintenance. Extraocular muscle stem cells adopt a quiescent state earlier and do not proliferate in adults, yet have higher Pax7 content pre- and postnatally. In a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, fewer stem cells were present in extraocular muscles and were non-proliferative. The study provides a comprehensive characterization of muscle stem cell heterogeneity along the body axis, offering insights into the sparing of extraocular muscles during dystrophy. Deletion of Pax7 in adult stem cells results in reduced numbers and impaired regeneration, while Pitx expression in postnatal stem cells is higher in extraocular than limb muscles.
Researchers have developed a novel algorithm called VOC-informed neural network (VOC-IN) to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among human populations by combining an infectious disease model with physical neural networks. The VOC-IN integrates epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate transmission of COVID-19 strains, emphasizing patterns in multivariate data for optimization and accurate fitting. The algorithm accurately fits reported data from British Columbia, Canada, simulates unobserved dynamics, infers time-dependent parameters, and enables short-term predictions, performing well with long-term multi-wave data. Variants of concern exhibit differences in transmissibility, disease severity, immune evasion, and treatment responsiveness, necessitating substantial public health measures. The VOC-IN approach leverages observational data and physical principles governing infectious models to capture time-varying parameters, inspired by studies showing Physics-Informed Networks can accurately fit compartmental models and estimate time-vary parameters. The proposed method encodes VOC infection data, epidemiological mechanisms, and ordinary differential equations into neural networks, aiming to integrate with machine learning for better predictions. The VOC-IN represents a significant contribution to infectious disease modeling, evaluating risk and simulating transmission within populations and determining time-dependent characteristics of SARSV-2 variants.
CytoSummary is a Deep Sets-based approach that improves mechanism of action prediction by 30-68% in average precision compared to average profiling. It uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple-instance framework, providing an easier method for aggregating single-cell data. The model achieves improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or debris and prioritizing uncrowded cells, requiring only perturbation labels for training. CySummary offers a post-processing step for single profiles that boosts performance on image-based datasets. The study proposes CySummary, a model that finds the optimal way to aggregate single-cell profiles using self-supervised contrastive learning, learning an aggregation strategy from single morphological feature data. Future research could explore its applicability to genetic perturbations, expanding its utility in functional genomics. CySummary provides a better method for aggregating single image data, achieving quality by filtering noisy cells. It leverages naturally available information in profiling, applying contrast learning to extracted features, making it applicable to most image datasets. The Deep Sets formulation learns a model aggregating single data into a profile outperforming population-averaged profiles in predicting a compound's mechanism of action.
Researchers have developed a framework to quantify cognitive effort during task performance using electroencephalography (EEG) activation patterns, focusing on discrete dynamical states and optimal transport theory. The framework was applied to a dataset collected during a spatial Stroop task, where participants respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting aspect. Findings reveal increased cost linked to cognitive effort, confirming the framework's effectiveness in capturing and quantifying transitions. The study highlights the value of characterizing brain dynamics and transition costs in understanding cognitive processes, offering insights into the relationship between neural patterns, effort, and performance. A stochastic framework was employed to measure brain transition in an EEG dataset, confirming a correlation between cost and cognitive demand during the Stro task. This is the first application of such a framework to EEG data, providing a pipeline to quantify demand in experiments. The approach bridges the gap by generalizing the method to EEG signals, which measure neural activity more directly than fMRI, analyzing a dataset on participants performing a spatial Stro task. The study shows transition from resting to tasks varies significantly, proposing suitability for describing neurophysiological data, and investigates changes during tasks to explain energy needs for differing demands.
Researchers investigated the generation and function of atypical memory B cells (aBCs) in individuals exposed to malaria, specifically focusing on Plasmodium vivax (P. viv)-specific aBCs and their role in producing neutralizing antibodies. Using P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein II (PvDBI) probes, they detected the development and durability of specific aBCs during and their capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections. Results showed that PvDBI-specific aBCs were elicited during illness, persisted through recovery, and produced antibodies with variable levels of anti-PDBI IgG. Two clones, A1 and B4, produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PvDBI variants. Notably, B cell receptors of PvDB-specific aBC expressed unique IGH genes with similar usage of IGH1 comparable to classicalBC. The somatic hypermutation rate and CDR length of VH and VK were not significantly different between the two subsets. Findings revealed P viv infections elicited development and persistence of P viv-specific aBCs, which may play a role in producing protective antibodies against malaria. Identifying MBC subsets that produce protective antibodies can facilitate development of effective and long-lasting malaria vaccines. The study demonstrated generation of antigen-specific aBC in P viv malaria and their competency to secrete antibodies against variant antigens, highlighting a protective role of aBC in humoral response to malaria by differentiating into ASC for broadly neutralizing antibodies against P viv invasion into erythrocytes.
Researchers have introduced MR-MASH-RSS, an extension of the MR-MASH model, which predicts complex trait phenotypes using summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies and linkage disequilibrium estimates from a reference panel, overcoming the need for individual-level data and scalability limitations. MR-MASH-RSS is competitive with and often outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for single and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in various scenarios, including effect sharing patterns, number of phenotypes, causal variants, and heritability. Simulations demonstrate its effectiveness, and real data analysis of 16 blood phenotypes in the UK Biobank shows higher prediction accuracy than competing methods, especially for smaller sample sizes. MR-MASH-RSS addresses limitations of MR-MASH, including the need for individual data and lack of scalability to biobank-size data, and is robust to small to medium amounts of missing phenotypes. Results confirm its competitiveness with state-of-art univariate and multivariate polygenic score methods, outperforming competing methods in 14 of 16 blood phenotypes with improvements ranging from modest to substantial. MR-MASH-RSS learns patterns of effect sharing across phenotypes, models multiple phenotypes jointly, and is computationally efficient, making it a valuable tool for precision medicine and human genetics applications.
A novel modelling framework is proposed to integrate spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models by introducing a continuous recruitment process for susceptibles, approximated by a neural network to develop a Universal Differential Equations model. The model is trained using deep learning and calibrated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods with data from a COVID-19 Omicron outbreak in Shanghai. Projections indicate an attack rate and peak of new infections of 80.06% and 3.17% of the population, a 18.6% improvement in prediction accuracy compared to homogeneous models. Simulations show heterogeneity decreases herd immunity by 37.36% and prolongs outbreak from 30 to 70 days, aligning with real cases. The study aims to develop a generalized framework embedding spatio-temporal heterogeneity into homogeneous models for efficient epidemic prediction, enhancing accuracy by leveraging compartment models. Results depict the epidemic curve of the Omron variant in China, peak size, final size, herd immunity, and duration, with enhanced prediction accuracy compared to homogeneous models. The approach utilizes cutting-edge technology and machine learning to shape the spread of susceptibles during outbreaks, providing groundwork for a new class of models and insights for heterogeneity.
Synapses in the brain exhibit high levels of noise, which leads to significant trial-by-trial variability, despite being costly in terms of energy consumption. Researchers propose that synapses utilize noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. A mathematical framework was developed, modeling the synapse as an agent interacting with the postsynaptic neuron in an uncertain environment, suggesting synapses use an internal model of somatic dynamics updated by a learning rule resembling long-term potentiation and depression mechanisms. This approach implies synapses utilize noisy release to encode uncertainty about the somatic potential. Each synapse strives to predict postsynaptic dynamics, but multiple synapses in a network resolve problems such as pattern classification and control in dynamic environments, coordinating to represent uncertainties in behaviorally ambiguous situations. The model predicts synapses should be stochastic to encode uncertainties about somatic potential and makes precise predictions about synaptic plasticity changes and weight dependence. The learning rule enables synapses to adapt efficacy to predict postsynaptic spikes, registered by back-propagating action potentials. Synaptic variability reflects uncertainty in neural firing, with postsynaptic neurons learning to fire according to Gaussian distributions, resulting in trial-to-trial variability in membrane dynamics. The task of a synapse learning suitable responses is considered a problem in a partially unknown environment, where variability represents uncertainty about cellular state.
Researchers have developed Scup, a distance-based cell lineage reconstruction method that utilizes bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues to investigate development, differentiation, and cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing technologies enable detailed analysis with higher resolution, but come with challenges such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, which Scup accounts for. The method computes distances between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm, allowing for faster analysis than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy. Scup's robustness is demonstrated using synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells with a known lineage topology. The dataset consists of single-cell DNA sequencing data from closely related cells with few distinguishing mutations, making it challenging to reconstruct the true tree topology. Scup is a probabilistic framework that reconstructs cell trees from healthy diploid single cells using whole-genome amplified DNA data, fitting biological findings and obtaining better accuracy with read-phasing. The scarcity of mutations in healthy tissues necessitates sophisticated models and methods to capitalize on existing data, highlighting the need for single-cell DNA sequencing, which reveals more point mutations than other data types despite its challenges. Scup addresses these challenges, distinguishing somatic mutations from sequencing errors and nucleotide substitutions caused by amplification.
Researchers propose the individual-based Thanzi Onse model to evaluate health benefits packages in low-income settings, addressing limitations of existing analytic approaches. The model simulates health gains under plausible strategies, accounting for disease incidence, health-seeking behavior, and healthcare capacity constraints. A linear optimisation analysis-based health package achieved an 8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years by 2023, concentrating on high-impact treatments, but incurred excess years in initial years. An alternative approach prioritizing services based on patient characteristics showed consistent year-to-year gains and a 5% reduction over the period. The model provides a tool to test packages designed for Malawi, evaluating health gains through service prioritization under realistic resource constraints, addressing limitations of other methods. The approach captures effects of resource constraints, avoiding overestimation of healthcare delivery, offering a balanced representation of the Malawian healthcare system. The simulation enforces realistic constraints on healthcare delivery based on data-driven estimates of human resources and time requirements, simulating the impact of alternative health packages under credible formulations, ensuring services are constrained by workforce time, take realistic delivery time, and maintain status quo clinical practice and availability.
Researchers employed Oligaint DNA FISH to investigate meiotic homolog pairing and chromosome segregation in the holocentric moth Plodia interpunctella and compared findings to the silkworm Bombyx mori, which diverged over 100 million years ago. Both species initiate pairing at gene-rich chromosome ends during spermatogenesis and form rod-shaped bivalents at metaphase I. However, unlike Bombyx, Plodia orients bivalents in multiple ways at metaphase I. Kinetochores assemble at non-telomeric loci towards the center of chromosomes, regardless of centromere location, and sister kinetochores are not paired. Four distinct kinetochores are observed at metaphase I with end-on microtubule attachments. This challenges the classical view of paired pole-facing kineto requirement for homolog separation in meiosis. The study reveals a novel mode of meiotic segregation in holocentric species, where kinetore formation is restricted to the center of the chromosome, and telomeres face the pole. This "center-kinetic" mechanism is observed in both Plodia and Bomx, suggesting a conserved mechanism in Lepidopteran insects. The findings highlight the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model organisms to discover novel biology.
Researchers investigated the role of the transcription factor SOX3 in the development and function of the median eminence, a crucial for information exchange between the brain and pituitary gland. Mutations or duplications in SOX3 lead to hypopituitarism, likely of hypothalamic origin. The absence of SOX3 predominantly affects the median eminence, with phenotypes emerging in juvenile animals despite embryonic onset of SO3 expression. In the pituitary, reduced hormone levels correlate with a lack of endocrine cell maturation. NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation are also affected. Low-dose aspirin treatment, known to affect NG2-glia, and changes in gut microbiota, rescue proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in SOX3 mutants. The study highlights the central role of NG2-glia for median eminence function during postnatal development and sensitivity to extrinsic signals. Conditional gene deletion shows loss of SO3 in the central nervous system causes hypopuitar, developing postnatally at weaning, with defective endocrine cell maturation in the pituitary. SO3 is expressed in hypothalamic stem cells, affecting their proliferation in vivo and in hypothalamic neurosphere assays. Low-dose aspirin treatment restores NG-glia proliferation and rescues pituitary hormonal deficiencies but not myelination. Changes in gut microbiome also ameliorate hypopituitarism. The findings indicate a novel role for NG2-glia in post-weaning formation of functional median eminence and control of pituitary maturation, modified by non-genetic factors.
Researchers investigated the role of CED-5/CED12, a two-component guanine nucleotide exchange factor, in regulating F-actin during embryonic epidermal morphogenesis in C. elegans. CED10/Rac1, a GTPase, was identified as an essential activator of F-act, and CED5/CED12 was known to activate CED10/R1 to promote cell movements. However, CED5/CED's role in embryonic migrations was unclear. Loss of CED5/CED led to embryonic death due to failed epidermal migrations, but surprisingly, CED/CED inhibited F-act in migrating epidermis, opposite of expected for a CED10 GEF. A candidate GAP region in CED12 was identified and mutating it altered epidermal migration but not corpse engulfment. Interfering with GEF function resulted in loss of ventral enclosure and corpse engulfment. Studies suggest CED5/CED supports cycling of multiple GTP by distinct domains, promoting and inhibiting F-act nucleation. CED10/R1 recruits and activates the WAVE complex, essential for embryonic tissue formation and migration. Loss of CED10 and CED/CED caused opposite effects on epider F-act levels, leading to embryonic death due to cell migration arrests. CED5/CED has a previously undescribed role in embryonic morphogenesis.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes information across various timescales, focusing on the mouse visual system's hierarchical organization. Using information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis, they found that information and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy under visual stimulation, while predictability decreases. Intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas predictability was stimulus-dependent. A basic network model with correlated sensory input reproduced these observations, suggesting the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms for longer integration in higher areas while reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. The study found a gradual increase in timescales following the anatomical hierarchy, indicating hierarchical temporal processing in the mouse cortex. Recurrence enables longer integration of visual information, and stronger recurrence can lead to a reduction of temporal correlations from stimuli. Decreasing predictability reflects efficient coding, where subsequent stages remove temporal redundancy in spike trains. Network-intrinsic mechanisms, such as increased recurrent coupling, shape the temporal hierarchy. The findings indicate that stimulus encoding and feature representations play a role but are not the sole cause of long correlation and informationcales, highlighting the importance of intrinsic mechanisms in temporal processing.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with potential for new applications, but the neural circuits engaged during TMS are poorly understood. Researchers used epidural recordings from the cervical spine to develop a computational model of a motor cortical column to investigate the mechanisms underlying response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves. Sensitivity analysis identified neuron types that preferentially contributed to corticospinal waves, with single wave preference predicted by the average connection probability of all paths between activated neurons and L5 pyramidal tract neurons (PT). The conduction delay of the shortest path to L5 PTs determined the latency of corticospinal waves. Multiple neuron activations could modulate particular corticospinal waves, supporting the hypothesis that different pathways contribute to corticospinal waves with excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Activation of afferents to the motor cortex and specific neuron types initiated I-waves, suggesting cortical origins of afferents may give rise to certain waves. The methodology provides a workflow for computationally tractable analyses on complex models, relating results to network structure to identify mechanisms underlying response to acute stimulation. Corticospinal waves represent activity of layer 5 pyramidal neurons that send axons into the spinal cord, with the shortest latency wave representing direct activation of PTs. Intrinsic mechanisms allow L5 PTs to behave as neural oscillators, resulting in I-waves from repeated spiking due to initial excitation by TMS. Computational models integrate anatomical and electrophysiological details to investigate TMS-induced corticospinal waves, identifying important circuit mechanisms with 81.6% accuracy.
Cell-free placental DNA (cfDNA) is present in maternal circulation throughout pregnancy, comprising up to 40% of total plasma DNA, and has been detected as early as the fourth week of gestation. Since its discovery in 1997, cfDNA has been used in noninvasive prenatal testing to screen for genetic aberrations, notably chromosomal aneuploidies. The biology of cfDNA remains poorly understood, limiting its research and clinical utility. cfDNA is representative of the full placental genome, providing a means for noninvasive characterization, and can be leveraged to study placental health and disease. Fetal and placental sequences are generally identical, but confined placental mosaicism can occur, highlighting the importance of distinction between cell-free "fetal" and cell-free "plac" DNA. Noninvasive prenatal testing has been implemented to screen for common aneuploidies, including Trisomies 13, 18, and 21, by assessing overrepresentation of affected chromosomes in maternal plasma-free DNA. Studying cfDNA can improve understanding of placental processes and its role in pregnancy, opening avenues for applications beyond genetic screening, including longitudinal studies of placental development and disease, currently hindered by limited availability of early and mid-gestation samples.
Hormone-dependent cancers, including breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancers, share several risk factors suggesting a common aetiology. Genome-wide association studies have identified spatial clustering of risk variants across these cancers, contrasting with genetically unrelated traits. Forty-four multi-hormone-dependent cancer risk regions were identified across the genome, with two regions containing risk variants for all four cancers, 13 for three cancers, and 28 for two cancers. Integrating GWAS data, epigen profiling, and promoter capture Hi-C maps annotated 53 candidate genes at 22 multi-hormone-dependent risk regions, which were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Census. Long non-coding RNAs were identified as potential targets and risk alleles in several regions altered transcription motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known drug targets were overrepresented among candidate genes, implying they may serve as targets for therapeutic development or repurposing existing treatments. The study expands the repertoire of risk regions and candidate genes for hormone-dependent cancers, providing insights into the genetic architecture and biology underpinning susceptibility, and offers a framework for identifying common genes driving complex traits and understanding susceptibility.
A genetic study of polymyositis in Koo dogs identified a region on chromosome CFA19 associated with the disease, with cases sharing a 2.9 Mb region in homozygous or heterozyous state. Next-generation sequencing revealed a 39 kb deletion 10 kb upstream of interleukin genes IL21 and IL2, found in 81% of cases and 25% of the breed. Leukocytes from affected dogs overexpressed IL21 and IL2 upon stimulation. The deletion is a risk factor for polymyitis, with estimated penetrance at 10-20% for homozygous and 0.5-2% for heterozygous dogs. The study implicates elements 10-49 upstream of IL21/IL2 in regulating canine gene expression and suggests distant variants may contribute to human autoimmune diseases associated with the IL21/2 region. A PCR assay for the deletion can help breeders prevent high-risk dogs and reduce polymyitis incidence. Preliminary experiments showed increased expression of IL21 and IL2 in affected dogs homozyous for the deletion. Targeted resequencing found no protein-coding variants, suggesting regulatory elements are involved in pathogenesis. Inspection revealed all affected dogs were homozyous for the 39 kb deletion, containing cytokine genes IL21 and IL2, regulators of cell-mediated immunity.
Researchers have developed a protein language model, ESMm, to predict protein stability, utilizing a large dataset of 528,000 natural and de novo derived sequences from 461 protein domains. The model accommodates deletions, insertions, and multiple mutations, and performs reasonably on small domains, generalizing to sequences distal from the training set. Training on an ensemble of protein domains improves performance compared to single-domain mutagenesis studies. ESm's performance is comparable to state-of-art models but lags behind on larger scaffolds. Results highlight the need for large-scale measurements on diverse datasets mirroring sequence lengths in nature. Fine-tuning ESm on absolute energy of small domains shows potential to reduce experimental burden. Benchmarking on larger proteins reveals limitations, with 72% of domains having a Spearman R change of only 0.1. ESm is fine-tuned on sequences no longer than 72 residues, whereas natural proteins span 200-400 residues. Comparison with state-of-art methodologies is shown in Tables 1 and 2, indicating the need for larger stability datasets to improve generalizability. The study demonstrates folding prediction is possible using a language model and highlights benefits of training on all sequences over single mutagen studies.
Inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIRs) are a family of inhibitory receptors expressed by natural killer (NK) cells and late differentiated T cells, regulating T cell-mediated immunity. In the context of autoimmunity, such as Type 1 diabetes (T1D), where enhanced T cell response may be detrimental, iKs may have an opposite effect. Variation in Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) genes explains up to 50% of the genetic risk in T1, indicating T cells have a major role in T1 etiopathogenesis. An immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1 dataset found iK genes, in the presence of their ligands, have a consistent and significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations. Results were validated in an independent dataset, concluding iKs decrease HLA II protective associations, suggesting iKs regulate CD4 T responses in T1. iKs are predominantly expressed on NK cells and late differentiated T cells, binding HLA I molecules in broad allele groups. The impact of functional iK on HLA has not been studied, but given their impact on adaptive responses in viral infections, iK may play a role in autoimmunity. Associations between HLA II and T1 show CD4 cells play a role in T1, and iK modulation of HLA II genetic associations suggests iK modulate CD4 T responses.
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FE) is a common age-related cause of vision loss, with up to 80% of European cases attributed to the expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat, CTG18.1, within the TCF4 gene. Researchers investigated CT18.1 expansion-driven molecular components in primary corneal endothelial cells from individuals with CTG18.1-expanded (Exp+) and CT18.1-independent (Exp-) FE. Long-read, short, and spatial transcriptomic techniques revealed altered splicing and unique transcripts associated with CT18.1 expansions. Differential expression analysis highlighted total transcriptomic consequences in Exp FE cells. Exon usage, pathway, and spatial transcriptomics showed T4 isoform skewing in Exp FE with potential functional consequences. Rare T4 variants were identified in 7/134 Exp- FE cases, suggesting T4 variants independent of CT18.1 may increase FE risk. The study supports two pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and T4 iso-specific dysregulation, underpinning FE pathophysiology. Data will inform translational interventions for this triplet-repeat disease. T4 isoform dysregulation at the transcript level and downstream effects were detected in primary corne endothelial cells. Rare T4 variants may induce isoform dysregulation and act as risk factors for disease, irrespective of CT18.1 expansions.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination in rice, identifying quantitative trait locus qLT11 from variety Arroz Terra, which shows rapid seed germination at lower temperatures. The candidate region was delineated to a 52-kb interval containing REGULATORY FACTOR14 gene, expressed during seed germination. Arroz Terra GF14 encodes functional GF14, whereas Japanese variety Hitomebore has a 4-bp deletion. Knocking out GF14 decreased low-temperature germination, while overexpressing GF14 increased it, indicating GF14 is the causal gene behind qLT11. Analysis of Japanese accessions revealed the functional GF14 allele was lost during modern breeding. A near-isogenic line in Hitbore with a 172b fragment from Arroz Terra showed superior low-temperature germination with comparable agronomic traits. Functional GF14 from Arroz Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions. Overexpressing GF14 improved anaerobic germination and seedling establishment under anaerobic conditions. GF14 regulates germination by interacting with abscic acid and gibellin pathways at optimal temperatures. Haplotype analysis identified ten distinct haplotypes based on polymorphic sites in the GF14 coding region. Introducing functional GF14 into Hitb resulted in significant improvement in germination at low temperature. Multiple lines of evidence show GF14 contributes to low-temperature germination.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) contains an 8-9 nucleotide terminal redundancy (TR) on the negative (-) strand derived from the reverse transcription of viral pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). A mutant HBV cell line, Hep-C2DES182G, was established with a C182G mutation in the pgRNA sequence, altering the 3' TR of (-) DNA while keeping the 5' TR wild type. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed the positive (+) DNA of rcDNA and both strands of covalently closed DNA (ccDNA) predominantly carried the wild-type 182 residue, indicating the 5' TR serves as the template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with (+) DNA, while the 3' TR forms a flap-like structure removed during ccDNA formation. The 3 flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in ccDNA formation, alongside the 5 flap enduclease FEN. The overlapping function between Mus81 and F1 indicates the putative 5 and 3 flaps formed by TR are dynamically interchangeable on rc precursor. These findings shed light on HBV rcDNA structure and ccDNA mechanisms, contributing to the understanding of HBV replication. Mus81 and F1 cleavage sites were mapped within TR of nuclear rcDNA by RACE-NG analyses. The study reveals the selection of HB (-) DNA during rcDNA and cc biosynthesis, with the majority of recessed 3 ends mapped at 182A in control cells diminished upon Mus81 knockout, indicating Mus81 may cleave the 3 TR between 182A and 5.
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) efficiency in industrial wastewater treatment is influenced by the microbial community, which can be disrupted by variable operations. A microbe-micro interaction-scale metabolic model (mmEM) was developed to study the adaptation of microbial communities in FCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-apple factory, encompassing sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO). The model revealed a shift from SO-dominant to MET-domin community as organic loading rates increased, along with a decline in FC performance. The mmEM predicted microbial abundance at low and high organic loading rates and revealed constraints on SO growth due to reduced sulfate-sulfide cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SR. Cross-feeding dynamics under varying organic loading enabled scenario simulations to explore acidity impact on SO growth and FC performance. The work highlights the role of metabolic cross-feeding in shaping microbial structure in response to high organic loading. The insights will inform strategies for implementing FC technology in real-world environments. Simulations explored changes in metabolic capacities of key groups and substrate influence interactions, varying acetate consumption of SO and sulfide release of SR. Performance declined as organic loading increased, impacted by changes in microbial structure and composition. The mmEM facilitated a comprehensive study of metabolic interactions, enhancing understanding of ecology and optimization of FC for biotechnological applications, driven by metabolic characteristics and wastewater profile. The model simulated microbial abundances under varying conditions, highlighting roles of SR, MET, and SO in shaping community composition, linked to metabolic cross-feeding influencing FC performance.
Machine learning is increasingly used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine, prioritizing promising molecules in drug discovery by predicting properties of biological systems. However, models can be overconfident and produce false positives when applied to unseen situations. To address this, a framework called CPEC is proposed for FDR-controlled biological discovery, integrating a deep learning model with conformal prediction to provide accurate predictions with controlled false discovery rate. CPEC demonstrates effectiveness in enzyme annotation, simulating discovery of less-characterized enzymes, achieving reliable FDR control and comparable performance. Conformal prediction provides statistical guarantees, ensuring expected FDR does not exceed user-specified levels. Evaluation shows CPEC achieves reliable FDR control, better performance, and accurate predictions for underrepresented enzymes. CPEC is expected to be useful for applications where high yield in experiments is desired but budget is limited. The framework leverages conformal prediction, allowing users to specify desired FDR tolerance, making predictions with controlled FDR. CPEC addresses challenge of overconfident predictions, ensuring efficiency and reliability of ML-assisted discovery. Machine learning plays a vital role generating biological hypotheses, and CPEC enables FDR-controlled discoveries, allowing users to tailor predictions to experiment goals and budget.
Researchers investigated the role of heat shock protein HSP-90 in a C. elegans model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutant TDP-43 proteinopathy, finding that loss of HSP90 function protects against TDP43 neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration in adult animals. This protection is accompanied by a decrease in total and phosphorylated TDP43 protein. HSP90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key stress responsive heat shock gene expression, including HSP70 and H16.1, with normal levels of H16.1 required for HSP90 effects on TDP. The neuroprotective effect of H90 dysfunction does not involve regulation of proteasome activity in C.elegans. The study utilized C.elegans models expressing human ALS mutant TDP43, which exhibit progressive motility defects, selective degeneration of motor neurons, and accumulation of phosphorylated TDP43. Disrupting HSP function genetically or with small inhibitors protects against TDP neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. H90 has a role in modulating TDP misfolding and toxicity and its inhibition can be neuroprotective in ALS, facilitating clearance of TDP by releasing transcription factor HSF1, which activates the heat response. The study demonstrates H90 chaper activity contributes to adverse outcomes in TDP proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS.
Researchers have created a comprehensive single-nucleus RNA atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system using single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing, shedding light on conserved regulatory programs between distantly related Arthrop species. The study identified major cell types in the Artemia ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and ovarian cells, and explored gene regulation of the chromosome during meiosis, highlighting unique dynamics and meiotic sex silencing. Single-nucle RNA sequencing resolved cellular complexity, identifying clusters with distinct expression patterns sharing homology with Drosila ovarian clusters, suggesting conserved expression programs for cellular identity and function. Mapping Artemia clusters to Drosila ovary dataset showed high conservation of molecular pathways defining cellular identity. The study used 10x single RNA sequencing and 10x Multiome ATAC+Gene experiments on pooled ovaries from mated and unmated females to resolve cellular heterogeneity and chromatin accessibility. The work highlights single-nus RNA sequencing as an alternative to traditional approaches for studying meiotic sex regulation, particularly in species where isolating meiotic cells is difficult. The findings contribute to understanding the molecular pathways regulating oogenesis and cellular identity in Arthrop female reproductive systems, expanding knowledge beyond model systems like Drosila and Daph.
Chronic pain is a widespread and debilitating condition costing the United States around $600 billion, with allodynia being a common symptom where non-painful stimuli produce painful responses. The mechanisms of allodynia remain unclear, but are hypothesized to be caused by dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory balance in pain-processing circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. This study analyzes biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures representing common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I of the dorsal horn, hypothesized to mediate static and dynamic allodynia. Neural firing models describe the activity of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within subcircuits, accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions. A sensitivity approach identifies mechanisms likely to cause allody-producing dysregulation, finding disruption of excitatory-inhibitory balance due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling or upregulation of excitatory responses. Results suggest diverse mechanisms responsible for allody, offering predictions for high individual variability and targets for experimental studies. The identification of multiple excitatory and inhibitory interneurons in dorsal circuits suggests dysregulation may occur through multiple mechanisms dependent on the nature of the injury. Modeling interactions among interneuron populations for maintenance of excitatory-inhibitory balance in healthy conditions and disruption in allody is crucial. Dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory balance in dorsal circuitry is a compelling cause supported by preclinical studies, but understanding circuit complexity leaves questions on how dysregulation occurs. Subcircuit motifs reflect experimental evidence for structure of dorsal horn laminae-II networks mediating static and dynamic allody, allowing analysis of interactions of cellular patterns with network in maintaining or disrupting excitatory-inhibitory balance.
Protein homeostasis relies on accurate translation and folding of newly synthesized proteins, with eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) promoting GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome during translation. EF2 folding is dependent on Hsp90 and cochaperones Hgh, C1, Cns, and C7. Hsp90 and cochaperones have distinct roles regulating EF2 function, with yeast expressing H90 mutations or cochaper mutations having reduced EF2 steady-state levels. H90 mutants affecting EF accumulation are negatively impacted by H1 deletion, while EF mutations mimicking human disease-associated mutations are affected by H1 loss and partially rescued by H1 overexpression. Different H90 mutations and cochaper mutations alter sensitivity to diphther toxin, indicating post-translational modification on EF2. Results show H90 contributes to proteostasis by assisting protein folding and enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. H90 mutants have distinct in vivo effects correlating with cochaper defects, suggesting versions of the H90 pathway chaper different clients. EF is essential for ribosome translocation, with H90 modulating EF folding during translation elongation. H1 bridges EF interaction with C1, Cns, and H90 or TRC chaper. H90 and cochaper have genetically distinct roles mediating EF function, with EF folding dependent on H1, C7, and C1 cochones and sensitive to H90 mutants.
Researchers investigated how individuals make risky decisions in social contexts when their preferences are inaccessible or disrupted, such as in cases of cognitive impairment or novel options. Participants with lesions in the insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, key regions involved in decision-making, played a gambling task alone and after observing others' choices. Results showed disrupted use of standard utility-based computations for risky options and increased conformity with others' choices, independent of social-based computations. Findings suggest that in social contexts, following others' choices may serve as a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted. Individuals with impairments in utility-based decision-making relied on conformity to a greater extent, showing a parametric relationship between degree of impairment and use of the 'follow others' choices' heuristic. A correlation was found between the degree of disruption in utility-based decision-making and conformity with others' choices, indicating a trade-off between utility-based processes and cognitively demanding heuristics facilitating decisions in social contexts. This relationship was replicated in an independent sample, supporting the notion that social conformity can serve as an alternative to utility-based decision-making when risk processing is impaired.
Biomorphs, a model of morphological evolution, exhibit phenotype bias where certain phenotypes are more likely to appear through random mutations, with a preference for simpler phenotypes of low descriptive complexity. This bias is formalized by an information-theoretic principle and demonstrated through population genetics simulations, showing moderately adaptive phenotypic variation can fix at the expense of highly adaptive phenotypes. The results resemble findings in molecular genotype-phenotype maps, including high mutational robustness and correlation between evolvability and robustness. An analytic model based on constrained and unconstrained genome sections explains these patterns. Simulations show phenic bias influences adaptive evolution, with frequent phenotypes more likely to evolve when conveying an advantage. The "arrival-of-frequent" effect captures the fact that natural selection acts on frequently introduced structures through mutations. Biomorphs illustrate developmental bias shaping evolutionary outcomes, with simplicity observed beyond molecular scale, prompting the question of whether simplicity bias is general in development. Phenotype bias and simplicity may hold widely in developmental systems, with implications for understanding evolutionary processes. The study uses biomorphs to analyze generation of phenic variation, testing the hypothesis that morphological development exhibits simplicity and phenomena similar to molecular maps.
Researchers investigated human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems, where dynamics cannot be predicted analytically, using a numerical tool to compute nonlinear normal modes. A user study with three experiments had participants control a virtual double pendulum through a haptic joystick, aiming to hit targets aligned or offset from predicted normal modes. Results showed participants intuitively applied control strategies to excite resonance, stabilizing orbits close to ideal modes, even with increased accuracy demands or targets away from modes. Participants adjusted arm stiffness to alter system dynamics, aligning resonant motions to tasks. Findings extend existing research on human sensitivity with data-based evidence to nonlinear systems, emphasizing capabilities to apply strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic interactions. The study used a virtual double pendulum with compliance, where participants moved a virtual link coupled to the first link by a spring, testing hypotheses on human preferences and abilities in dynamic interactions. Measurements proved pendulum systems can be excited in various ways, not automatically falling to normal modes. Participants excited numerically predicted eigenfrequencies, supporting the hypothesis that humans are sensitive to resonance in nonlinear systems, intuitively stabilizing damped systems on trajectories close to normal modes.
Regulation of transcription in Bacillus subtilis allows the bacterium to respond to external stimuli with appropriate timing and magnitude of response, with transcriptional regulation being core to developmental processes for survival. The transition state regulators, including ScoC and Abr, influence numerous processes such as biofilm formation, motility, genetic competence, and sporulation. Research demonstrates that ScoC and Abr, along with Mar-family transcription factor Pch, negatively regulate production of the iron chelator pulchimin in B. subis. Genetic analysis indicates all three factors are necessary to limit pulchimin production during exponential phase and influence rate and amount produced. Expression of the pulchimin biosynthesis gene yvm is under control of ScoC, Abr, and Pch, correlating with amount produced. Biochemical analysis shows Sco and Abr bind yC promoter with differing off-rates. Results indicate pulimin regulation is under tight and repressed during exponential growth by distinct systems. Absence of regulators modifies sporulation, competence, protease production, and biofilm. Pch and Abr act as roadblocks to RNAP progression at yC promoter. Sco involves weak regulation and indirect regulation through another factor. Presence of three repressors is necessary to limit pulimin production, providing insight into regulatory network of pulimin production in bacteria.
Researchers developed a mathematical model to replicate neurogenic bladder dysfunction after spinal cord injuries and incorporated features to replicate improvements with lumbar transcutaneous magnetic stimulation. The model, based on Hodgkin-Hux equations, replicated normal bladder function and was modified to reproduce dysfunctional mictition after spinal cord injuries by adding interneurons and increasing network complexity. The model showed re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after injury and improved coordination between detrusor and urethral sphincter activity with low-frequency stimulation. High-frequency stimulation enhanced urine storage. Neuroplasticity and complexity of lumbar interneurons are necessary to replicate effects on mictition control and modifications are essential to understand how stimulation reduces bladder dysfunction. A framework was developed for model-based analyses of neural circuits controlling mictition after spinal injuries and effects of stimulation as a therapeutic intervention to alleviate bladder dysfunction. The model captured normal and disordered bladder functions and stimulation effects at single-cell level based on experimental findings. Dysfunctional patterns derive from interactions among spinal networks, neuronal plasticity, and reorganization that foster emergence of latent voiding reflex. Modeling provides a mechanism to explore how spinal injuries alter miction and stimulation may improve bladder function.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to estimate fungal growth rates from optical density measurements, specifically for the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumatus, using indirect optical density data at 600nm. The model accounts for the indirect relationship between optical density measurements and true fungal growth, eliminating the need for calibration data. The proposed model outperformed reference models in fitting and predicting growth curves, resolving discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from indirect versus directly measured data. It treats optical density as a variable distributed around a linear transformation of true fungal concentration, allowing estimation of morphology-specific growth rates without calibration. Evaluation using time-course data demonstrated the model's ability to fit and predict optical density for Asperillus fumatus and estimate growth rates using directly measured data. This method is accessible to all microbiology laboratories collecting optical density data, overcoming limitations of current methods requiring large-scale data collection of time-course morphology-specific data. The model addresses issues with directly fitting true growth to indirect data, which resulted in misfit and lower growth rates compared to direct measures for filamentous fungi, providing a solution for estimating morphology-specific growth from indirect data without calibration.
Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals and harbor diverse karyotypes, with most species having XY sex chromosomes, but X0 sex determination mechanisms also common in some groups. A whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confusum, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and eleven additional beetle genomes were utilized to reconstruct kary evolution across Coleoptera. Ancestral linkage groups, termed Stevens elements, share a conserved set of genes across beetles. The ancestral X chromosome is maintained across beetles, but independent additions of autosomes to the ancestral sex chromosomes were found. These neo-sex chromosomes evolve stereotypical properties of sex chromosomes, including dosage compensation and non-random distribution of genes with sex-based expression. Phylogenetic sampling of beetles suggests they are a model to study patterns of kary evolution and forces operating on chromosomes. Ancestral linkage groups are maintained, allowing kary evolution study at the molecular level, with the X conserved in Coleoptera but multiple formations of neo-chromosomes identified. Genomic approaches were used to reconstruct kary evolution, generating a new assembly for Tribolium and using published assemblies from eleven species to study sex and kary evolution in beetles. Beetle chromosome karyotypes are typically XY, X0, and Xy with fusions between sex and autosomes creating neo-chromosomes. The abundance of beetles and development of genomic tools make Coleoptera valuable to study molecular mechanisms driving sex differentiation across taxa.
Histone variant H2A.Z, encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in S. cerevisiae, is an evolutionarily conserved H2A histone variant that is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR-complex. While H2.Z has been implicated in transcription regulation, ht1 mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, given growth defects of ht1 mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SWR-C units, previous work examining the role of H2.Z in expression may be confounded by deleterious activity caused by SWR when its H2.Z substrate. Researchers generated mRNA profiles for wild-type, ht1, sw, and ht1sw mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea, which induces DNA stress. Data showed H.Z played a prominent role in gene activation during hydroxyure exposure and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several hydroxy-induced genes. Apo-SW contributed to expression defects in the ht mutant, particularly genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation. Mapping H.Z incorporation before and after hydroxy treatment revealed decreases in H.Z enrichment at transcription sites correlated but not required for upregulation during hydroxy exposure. This study characterized regulatory effects of H.Z during transcriptional response to hydroxy. H.Z played a larger role in gene activation than repression in S.cerevisiae, particularly during hydroxy exposure, and its incorporation is important for wild-type expression of several hydro-induced genes.
Single-cell RNA sequencing data plays a crucial role in advancing our understanding of developmental biology, but classifying transcriptomic profiles into cell types and identifying lineage relationships is challenging due to the accumulation and high dimensionality of data. To overcome this, automated methods are needed, and classical approaches rely on supervised datasets, but obtaining annotated data at single-cell resolution is difficult. A partial label framework is proposed, assuming a set of candidate labels containing the correct one for each data point, which is simpler than requiring a fully supervised dataset. State-of-the-art multi-class methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype-based, logistic, and ensemble methods, are extended to the partial learning framework, and the effect of incorporating label structure, particularly hierarchical, is studied. Results on simulated and real datasets show these extensions enable learning from partially labeled data with high accuracy, especially with nonlinear prototype-based methods, reaching the same performance as fully supervised data. The uncertainty in partially annotated data and its effect on accuracy is also studied, showing hierarchical and non-hierarchical label strategies can solve automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles with less stringent annotated datasets.
Researchers investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (P2) in the formation of nuclear compartments, such as nuclear speckles and nucleoli, and its relationship with RNA. They found that P2 is involved in RNA polymerase II transcription and its localization is RNA-dependent. Using mass spectrometry, they identified the RNA-dependent P2-associated proteome in human cells and discovered that intrinsically disordered regions with polybasic P2-binding motifs are prevalent in these proteins. These regions exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquination sites. The study showed that the protein Bromodomain-containing 4 associates with P2 in an RNA-dependent manner and altered P2 levels affect its nuclear foci. The results suggest P2 orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and proteins, affecting their ability to form foci via phase separation, playing a pivotal role in establishing a functional nuclear architecture for gene expression. The study provides mechanistic insights into the biological implications of P2-dependent subnuclear localization and its importance in nuclear architecture. The findings indicate an intimate relationship between P2 and RNA in the nucleus, with P2 acting as a molecular wedge to attract and retain different sets of proteins. The study developed an MS-based pipeline to identify the RNA-dependent P2 proteome, which can be applied to other lipid-protein interactors, shedding light on the role of P2 in gene expression and nuclear architecture.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, a species-rich clade of insects with highly diversified nutrition-responsive development, including the evolution of cephalic horns. They presented chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species and compared them to seven other species across the order Coleoptera, identifying evolutionary changes in coding sequences associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. The study found distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- and sex-responsive development, including recently evolved regulatory elements sensitive to horn determination. Binding motifs of known and new transcription factors were enriched in nutrition-responsive chromatin regions. The results highlight the importance of chromatin regulation in mediating development and evolution of traits, demonstrating gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals. The study used comparative genomics to identify coding and non-coding changes in dung beetles associated with metabolite and developmental regulation, potentially underpinning the evolution of nutritionally plastic phenotypes. Biological pathways involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, juvenile hormone production, and embryonic transcriptional regulation were identified, motivating new hypotheses for nutrition-responsive development. The findings document non-synonymous substitutions in developmental genes, some playing adaptive roles in species development, and provide reference genomes for future studies on developmental, ecological, and evolutionary aspects of this group.
Researchers investigated the pathogenesis of Lassa fever using a cynomolgus monkey model that reproduces different disease outcomes, performing histological and transcriptomic studies to examine the dynamics of Lassa virus infection and immune mechanisms associated with survival or death. Lymphoid organs are an early reservoir for replicating virus, with Lassa virus entering through the cortical sinus of lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome, but subsequent viral tropism varies with severity. In nonfatal cases, viral dissemination is limited to lymphoid organs and immune cells, whereas in fatal cases, the virus disseminates systemically to all organs and diverse cell types, leading to macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and excessive inflammatory response. The study shows secondary lymphoid organs are crucial for Lassa virus replication in all infected animals, but cell tropism, dissemination, and immune infiltration differ between fatal and nonfatal cases. A cynolgus monkey model infected with Josiah and AV strains of Lassa virus at the same dose and route leads to uniformly fatal and non-severe disease, respectively. The replication of Lassa virus in secondary lymphoid organs is followed by systemic dissemination in severe cases, but restricted in surviving animals. The findings provide insight into early viral dynamics and host response to Lassa infection according to disease outcome.
Researchers have identified a key role for Importin-β-specific nuclear transport defects in the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontal temporal dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Using novel mouse models of neurodegeneration, they found an Importin-β-specific nuclear block and cytoplasmic mis-localization of proteins implicated in disease pathogenesis, including TDP43, Import-β, RanGap, and Ran. Pathological interactions between Importin-β and mutant protein accumulations were observed, along with transcriptional dysregulation of key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Transient inhibition of Import-β in mouse and human cells induced proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in neurodegeneration. The findings suggest that many mis-localized proteins and dysregulated events in neurodegenerative diseases may arise from a primary defect in Import-β nuclear import. This has implications for investigating how sporadic forms of neurogeneration may arise from unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations in Import-β function. The study demonstrates a causative role for Import-β nuclear deficiency upstream of multiple proteinopathies and transcriptional pathologies in neurodegenerative disease, with disrupted Import-β import resulting in mis-localization of nuclear proteins to the cytoplasm and collapse of the Ran gradient.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to enhance the efficiency of CRISPR-Cas-based mutagenesis in lytic phages by utilizing the eukaryotic enzyme NgET to temporarily reduce cytosine modifications in phage DNA, facilitating nuclease cleavage and precise targeting. This method enables seamless point mutation integration, exemplified by deactivating specific ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. Temporarily removing DNA modifications elucidated the effects of these modifications on T4 phage infections without necessitating gene deletions. The study presents a strategy for investigating phage epigen functions and streamlining phage engineering with cytosine modifications, valuable for synthetic biology and comprehending phage mechanisms. Applying eukotic tenle translocation T methyltosine dioxygenase reduces 5-methylcytosine within the phage T4 genome, allowing efficient targeting with CRIS-Cas and introducing point mutations. DNA modifications protect the phage genome from nucleolytic cleavage, enabling efficient phage lysis. NgET-treated T4 showed delayed lysis when infecting E. coli expressing CRIS-Cas. The approach enhances DNA accessibility for nucleases, boosting efficiency of phage double-strand breaks. The scarless nature allows studying the impact of introduced mutations without side effects of gene deletion or insertion. Findings propose a strategy for introducing mutations into lytic phage genomes with cytosine modifications. Targeting T4 phage genes modA and alt, belonging to AD-ribosyltransferases, demonstrated takeover control of E. coli by T4, although mechanisms are not fully understood. The novel approach enables investigation of phage epigen functions and streamlining phage engineering, valuable for synthetic biology and comprehending phage mechanisms through mutant generation.
The genome of living cells is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication, and various mechanisms act to ensure DNA repair, gene expression, and genome stability. Bulky DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV light or the DNA-damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline oxide, act as transcriptional and replicational roadblocks and represent a major threat to cell metabolism. Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) handles these lesions on the transcribed strand of active genes. Using a genetic screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, histone variant H2 Z was identified as an important component to safeguard transcription and DNA integrity following UV irradiation. In the absence of H2 Z, repair by TCER is severely impaired and RNA polymerase II clearance reduced, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks. H2 Z is needed for proficient TCER and plays a major role in the maintenance of genome stability upon UV irradiation. H2 Z is required for efficient TCER and contributes to the prevention of UV-induced double-strand breaks, highlighting the significance of DNA-optimized chromatin environment in maintaining stability. The absence of H2 Z leads to accumulation of double-strand breaks, a major threat to genome stability, and defective response to UV damage leads to sustained double-strand breaks and genome instability. H2 Z plays a role in regulation of RNAPI occupancy and TCER efficiency upon UV irradiation and is conserved from yeast to human, essential for mammalian development, and linked to DNA checkpoint, DSB repair, and chromosome segregation.
Researchers investigated gene expression variation and its contribution to phenotypic variation in Drosophila melanaster, analyzing transcriptome and microbiome data from midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule tissues in four strains and F1 hybrids from European and African populations. Tissue and genetic-specific effects were detected, with tissue effects being stronger than genetic effects, and gut tissues showing more similarity to each other than to Malighian tubules. Allele-specific expression revealed both cis and trans effects were tissue-specific in differentially expressed genes, with trans effects more tissue-specific than cis. Despite variable regulatory architecture, this observation was consistent across tissues and genetic backgrounds, suggesting trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned during population divergence. Transcriptome data from parental and F1 hybrids showed genetic basis of expression and mode of inheritance were highly tissue and genetic-specific. Results demonstrate functionally related tissues can show divergent regulatory architecture, with gene expression most similar between Maligh tubule and midgut, despite being part of different systems. Findings provide insight into evolution of regulatory architecture, effects of variation on tissue specificity, genetic background on expression, and microbiome variation, emphasizing context-specificity in evolutionary studies.
Researchers have developed a population dynamics-based framework to estimate the emergence date of infectious diseases, including COVID-19, using early reported cases. The model was validated with simulated data and applied to Alpha variant infections in the UK, dating the first infection to August 21, 2020, with a 95% range of July 23-September 5, 2020. Applying the model to COVID-19 cases with symptom onset before January 2020, the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan was dated to November 28, 2019, with a 95 range of November 2-December 9, 2019. These results align with previous genomic-based studies. The framework estimates the delay from first infection to the Nth case, providing key epidemiological information such as the proportion of undetected cases. The median days between first SARSV-2 infection and Nth symptomatic case was 52, with a 95 range of 41-78 days. Previous studies estimated the first human SARSV2 infection between late October and early December 2019 using genomic and case data. The population-based approach provides a generic and flexible method to estimate outbreak start times, applicable to other diseases beyond COVID-19.
During meiosis, the pairing of homologous chromosomes is crucial for the formation of haploid gametes from diploid cells, a prerequisite for sexual reproduction. Researchers have developed an agent-based model to study homolog pairing derived from the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble, simulating unidirectional movements and collision dynamics determined by attractive and repulsive forces. The model identifies chromosome number, size, movement velocity, and repulsive forces as key factors in the kinetics and efficiency of homolog pairing, in addition to homolog attraction. Dissociation of interactions between non-holog chromosomes contributes to pairing by crowding homologs into a limited area, creating preconditions for close-range homolog attraction. The model accurately recapitulates efficiency and kinetics of hom pairing observed in wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast and can be adapted to other organisms. Simulations demonstrate repulsive forces are effective when chromosome numbers rise above a threshold, reducing available area per chromosome, while attractive forces come into play when distances between homs are small. The model suggests hom pairing is achieved by two mechanistically distinct processes: confinement to a nuclear area due to dissociation with non-homolog via repulsive force and assessment of similarities via attractive force. The approach allows analysis of individual chromosome trajectories throughout meiotic prophase, providing insights into contributions of factors such as chromosome number, size, and movement to hom pairing, and can be adapted to species-specific features such as nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets.
Li-Fraumen syndrome is caused by inherited TP53 tumor suppressor gene mutations and microRNA miR-34 is a p53 target and modifier gene. miR34-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no overt cancer development, but lack of miR34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. miR34 genes are highly conserved and syntenic between zebrafish and humans. Zebraf miR34 and miR34b have similar expression timing in development, but miR34 is more abundant. DNA damage by camptothecin led to p53-dependent induction of miR34, while mi34 mutants were adult-viable and had normal DNA-induced apoptosis. mi34-/- compound with gain-of-function tp53 or tp53/- mutants were more cancer-prone than tp53 alone, confirming tumor-suppressive function of mi34. Loss of mi34 enhanced erythrocyte levels and upregulated myb hematopoietic stem cells at 72 hpf. Overexpression of mi34 suppressed its mRNA but not p53 induction, sensitized embryos to camothin but not γ-irradiation. mi34 has small but significant transcriptomic effects in 28 hpf zebraf embryos under control and DNA conditions. Expression of mi34 is partially p53-dependent under conditions and fully p53-dependent under DNA damage. mi34 has independent effects on tumor development in p53 mutant zebraf. Compound mi34 and tp53 mutants showed earlier tumor onset than single tp53 mutants, demonstrating mi34 tumor-suppressive function.
Sex determination in the nematode C. elegans is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis, with its expression dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes and autosomes, differing between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. In males, XOL-1 is highly expressed, while in hermaphrodites, it is expressed at low levels. Contrary to previous assumptions, research reveals XOL1 plays a crucial role in regulating developmental timing during hermaphrod embryogenesis. Using imaging and bioinformatics techniques, heraphrod embryos lacking XOL-1 exhibit accelerated cell division rates and developmentally advanced transcriptional programs. XOL1 regulates the initiation of dosage compensation on X chromosomes and sex-based transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites. Loss of XOL leads to overexpression of H3K9 methyltransferase MET2, altering the H3K9 landscape, with some effects reversed by MET2 loss. These findings demonstrate XOL's role as a developmental regulator in both sexes, with MET2 acting as a downstream effector in hermaphrodites. XOL represses SDC proteins in males, which regulate sex determination and dosage in hermaphrodites. Hermaphrodites have an X:A ratio of 1, while males have 0.5, leading to XOL activation in males due to lower X:A ratio. The study confirms XOL transcription in hermaphrod embryos at low levels, with loss resulting in significant transcriptional changes, accelerated development, and precocious establishment of dosage and sex pathways.
Genetic surveillance of mosquito populations is crucial as genetics-based control strategies advance, particularly for detecting unintended spread of gene drive mosquitoes and emergence of resistant alleles. A computational framework, Mosquito Gene Surveillance (MGSurv), optimizes trap placement to minimize time to detection of an allele of interest. MGS accounts for biological features such as mosquito resources, movement, and trap attractiveness. Examples demonstrate optimal trap placement for Aedes aegypti in Queensland, Australia, and Anopheles gambia on São Tomé, São Tom and Principe. MGS is a resource for field and computational researchers in mosquito surveillance. Early detection is critical to minimizing invasion impact, preserving local elimination, and maximizing cost-effectiveness of programs. MGS is applied to distribute traps for An coluzz populations on São Tom and Ae aegpti in Yorkeys, Queensland. Discrete optimization is used due to spatial scale, with traps placed in localities, and fitness function corresponding to minimizing mean time for a mosquito to be trapped. The framework is available for use, with code at https://github, providing a tool for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations.
Symbiononas scillans, a tiny heterotrophic microbial eukaryote, was previously thought to harbor endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum, but the identity and functional association with its host were unknown. However, amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome sequencing of S. scillans strains RCC257 and RCC24 revealed no sequences from known lineages of endosymbiotic bacteria. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analyses also verified the absence of endobacteria. Instead, numerous contigs were related to prasinoviruses infecting green algae, including Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Bathycoccus prasinos, and Micromonas pusilla. A near-complete 190bp draft genome encoding hallmark prasinirus genes was assembled using the Bathycoccus pras virus as a reference. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a 190nm virus-like particle similar to the originally reported endosymbt. Multi-gene tree analysis showed S. scillans viruses branched within highly supported clades with Bathycoccus, Ostreoccus, and Micomonas viruses. Overall, S. scillans does not harbor endosymbiotic bacteria but is associated with giant viruses. Sequencing of geographically distinct strains RCC24 and RCC257 maintained under culture showed a large representation of host sequence, except in WGA data from RCC24 where no host sequences were identified. The absence of endosymb bacteria was supported by fluorescence in situ hybridization of subcultures grown in Canada and Japan. Contigs assigned to prasinirus were detected with up to 200 coverage in RCC257, while no sequences were assigned to Archaea in assembled WGA data.
Mutations in the leiomodin (Lmod) family of actin-binding proteins, including MOD1-3, result in human myopathies, with mutations in the cardiac isoform MOD2 leading to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations are nonsense or frameshift mutations predicted to result in truncated proteins, yet little to no MOD protein is expressed. Nonsense-mediated decay, a cellular mechanism eliminating mRNAs with premature termination codons, underlies loss of mutant protein from two MOD2 disease-causing mutations. Steric-blocking oligonucleotides obstructing the exon junction prevent nonsense-mediated decay of mutant MOD2 transcripts, restoring mutant expression. Homozygous or compound heterozyous mutations in MOD3 result in nemaline myopathy, a skeletal disorder characterized by muscle weakness, with over 20 reported mutations to date. Disease-causing mutations in MOD2 result in severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy, with decreased mature mRNA levels but no change in pre-mRNA levels. Multiple MOD2 mutations lead to lack of MOD2 expression through nonsense-mediated decay. Steric-blocking oligonucleotides inhibit nonsense decay, increasing mutant-truncated protein levels. Treatment with oligonucleides and stop-readthrough drugs may rescue cardiac function in MOD2 patients, addressing the common pathophysiology of thin filaments, reduced contractility, and muscle weakness in Lmod-linked diseases.
Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) polymorphisms modify the risk of Alzheimer's disease, with ApoE4 increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to ApoE3. To investigate how ApE isoforms alter risk, researchers measured proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing human ApE gene isoforms 2, 3, or 4. They identified 484 proteins and tested ApE isoform-dependent changes in homeostatic regulation of approximately 270 ontologies. In the brain, ApoE4 and Apo2 led to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to wild-type ApoE3. Apo4 mice showed lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins, suggesting dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy, reducing protein quality. Apo2 showed increased degradation of mitochondrial matrix and membrane proteins, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, indicating coordinated replacement of the organelle. In the liver, no changes were observed, suggesting ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues. Findings underscore the utility of combining protein abundance and turnover to decipher proteome mechanisms and their role in biology. ApoE4 increases Alzheimer's risk, while Apo2 is protective, with a 5-fold increase in AD prevalence in Apo4 carriers and decreased risk in Apo2 carriers. Apo4 dysregulates MAM structures, disrupting mitochondrial morphology and energy production, reducing autophagy and proteas activity.
Researchers have developed a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells in the Drosophila neuromuscular junction, a model for studying axon development, synaptogenesis, synaptic function, and plasticity, and locomotion. The toolkit, CRPR-TRM, was validated by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue and demonstrated orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS expression system and simultaneous knockout of redundant genes. Using CRPRTRM, an essential role for SNARE components in neuromuscular junction maintenance was discovered, and the ESCRT pathway was found to suppress neuromuscular junction bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Additionally, axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the neuromuscular junction. The results demonstrate efficient tissue-specific gene knockout for studying motoneuron development and neuromuscular junction biology, revealing genes important for neuromuscular junction structural plasticity. CRPRTR was applied in tissues relevant to neuromuscular junction biology by generating Cas9 lines expressed in motoneurons, glial cells, or somatic muscles. The data suggest SNARE-mediated secretory pathways are required for establishment or maintenance of neuromuscular junctions and CRPRTR can reveal loss-of-function phenotypes of essential and redundant genes at the neuromus junction.
Post-larval hematopoiesis in Drosila largely depends on the stockpile of progenitors present in the blood-forming organ/lymph gland of larvae. During larval stages, lymph progenitors accumulate reactive oxygen species, which is essential to prime them for differentiation. ROS triggers the activation of JNK, upregulating fatty acid oxidation to facilitate progenitor differentiation. However, despite ROS, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in late larval stages. The Drosila NF-κB transcription factor Relish shields the progenitor pool from metabolic pathways that induce differentiation by curtailing JNK activation. ROS serves as a signal for progenitor differentiation, monitored by developmental TAK, regulated by Relish. This circuit ensures the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted. Overexpressing Rel in progenitor leads to downregulation of fatty acid oxidation. Loss of Rel from progenitors leads to JNK-FA cascade activation, coaxing them to differentiate. Rel expression wanes as cells move towards differentiation, and inhibition on TAK is lost, resulting in sustained JNK activation, facilitating progenitor differentiation. NF-κB/Rel inhibits TAK to control JNK activation, preventing precocious differentiation of ROS-enrich myeloid-like progenitors. This developmental circuit integrates NF-κB-like factors with metabolic pathways, regulating cell fate during development.
Taybi-Linder syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by microcephaly, abnormal gyral pattern, severe growth retardation, and bone abnormalities, typically caused by pathogenic variants in the RNUATC4 gene. However, a patient presenting with Taybi-Linder-like features was found to have a homozygous RT c.295A>G variant in the RTTN gene instead. Whole-exome sequencing identified this variant, which alters splicing, and has been implicated in microcephaly, short stature, and polymicrogyria. Cellular models, including patient fibroblasts, engineered RPE cells, and CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells, revealed major cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities, leading to aneuploidy, cell arrest, and death. Neural stem cells derived from these models accumulated in G2 phase due to numerous mitotic defects and slight misorientation of mitotic spindles, resulting in premature differentiation into neurons. Cortical organoids showed RTTN's role in self-organisation of neural stem cells into rosettes, with delayed apico-basal polarization, contributing to delayed roset formation in RT-mutated organoids. These defects impede overall growth, shedding light on mechanisms leading to microcephaly. The RT c.295A>G variant alters the splicing site of intron 23, confirmed by RT-PCR, RT-qPCR, and RNA sequencing. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of disease associated with Taybi-Linder syndrome, establishing RTTN's role in centrosome and cilium function and neural development.
Escherichia coli can survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion by entering a state of growth called long-term stationary phase. Researchers initiated experiments in 2015 to characterize the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under long-term stationary phase, allowing populations to grow on fresh media without new resources. Whole genome sequencing of hundreds of clones at 12 time points over six years revealed E. coli continuously adapts genetically through convergent accumulation of mutations up to six years. Lineages established upon entry into long-term phase are convergent, with similar lineages arising independently across populations. Adaptations under long-term phase show high parallelism, enabling screening for loci with significant mutation associations, suggestive of historical contingency. A third of convergently mutated loci are involved in such associations, demonstrating long-term adaptation is characterized by high parallelism and frequent contingency. Lineage structure is convergent, with similar lineages defined by same mutations behaving similarly across populations. Convergent mutation was observed, with different populations accumulating mutations to similar loci. E. coli adaptation under long-term continues via convergent mutation, discerning lineage structure and identifying pairs of putatively contingent loci. Mutations occur more often than expected by chance in loci mutated multiple populations throughout the experiment.
The male-specific abdominal (MSA) RNA from Drosophila melanogaster, initially classified as non-coding, has been found to code for a micropeptide crucial in determining sperm usage in mated females. MS is a male-specific version of iab-8 lncRNA, a transcript produced in both sexes within the central nervous system from an alternative promoter. Although MS produces a small peptide, iab-8 does not, due to a repressive mechanism requiring the unique 5 exons of iab lncRNA. The absence of translation in iab is attributed to upstream open reading frames in these exons preventing protein production from downstream frames. Reporter constructs in cell culture and transgenic analysis show the presence of upstream ATG sequences or open frames in 5 exons of iab prevent translation. MS shares all but its first exon with iab lnc and acts as a template for the same miRNA, mi-iab8. Loss of iab lnc leads to male and female sterility due to loss of miRNA within its intronic sequences. MS transcript codes for microptide MSi mediating sperm usage in mated females. The difference between MS and iab lies in the first exons, with MS expressed in seminal fluid-producing accessory glands and iab in the posterior nervous system.
Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of ultra-rare multisystem disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and neurodevelopmental delays, with symptoms affecting most organ systems due to the ubiquity of glycosylation. Loss-of-function mutations in glycosylation genes, including N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and GPI synthesis, lead to CDG. Evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) analysis identified proteins with similar evolutionary rates indicating shared functions and pathways between glycosylation genes, revealing strong signatures between N-linked glycosylation and GPI synthesis. Genome analysis showed significant ERC with GPI anchor proteins and ncRNA modification and DNA repair proteins, and patterns based on cellular-localization of GPI synthesis enzymes. Functional testing validated genetic interactions and identified novel modifiers of CD genes. High ERC scores were found between glycosylation proteins, including GP1 and ALG1, PIG and UTP, and PIGN and WDR, associated with their own CD, suggesting known CD genes are candidates for genetic modifiers of other CD. Previously identified modifier genes for CD have high ERC values, and in vivo testing of top hits had a higher hit rate than other studies, providing potential therapeutic targets and understanding of disease pathophysiology.
The hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein contains an N-terminal domain for capsid assembly and an arginine-rich C-terminal domain for pregenomic RNA encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain, especially at Ser162 and Ser170, is essential for nucleation with polymerase to initiate RNA encapsidation. As capsids mature, the C-terminal undergoes dephosphlation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsation. Using a specific antibody, a transition from phosphorylated to dephosphlated state during RNA packaging was observed. The polymerase-dependent dephosphlation of Ser170 was confirmed by substitution of one amino acid in the RNase domain, which abolished dephosphlation. Immunoprecipitation and protein analyses showed recruitment of host phosphatase PP1 dependent on polymerase domain, requiring RNA signal but not core protein. PP1-mediated dephosphlation of Ser170 is essential for completion of RNA encapsation, associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies. HBV polymerase plays a dual role, bringing RNA to phosphorylated core and recruiting phosphatase for completion of packaging. The findings elucidate the mechanism of polymerase-mediated dephosphorylation regulating RNA encapsulation, revealing phosphatase as a potential antiviral target. Dephosphorylation of Ser170 coincides with RNA encapsation, suggesting polymerase acts as a carrier for phosphatase. Phosphorylated Ser170 plays a role in recruitment of polymer-RNA complex, nucleating caps assembly, while hyperphosphorylation reduces subsequent packaging. Dephosphorylation restores charge, promoting nucleocaps maturation and compaction.
Bacterial symbionts with shorter generation times and capacity for horizontal gene transfer play a critical role in allowing marine organisms to cope with environmental change. The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created distinct conditions in the Tropical Pacific and Caribbean, offering a natural experiment to study how related animals evolve under environmental change. Researchers sequenced genomes of endosymb bacteria in sister species of chemosymb bivalves from the genera Codak and Ctena to investigate environmental influence on symbion selection and metabolic capabilities. The lucid species hosted different Candidatus Thiazro symbion, with Caribbean species having genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while Pacific species did not. Nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbion phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing evolutionary history revealed the common ancestor lacked nif genes and populations in oligotrophic habitats reacquired n operon through horizontal gene transfer from Sedimentola symbt lineage. The study suggests horizontal gene transfer facilitated niche diversification of globally distributed Ca Thiazro endosymbion clade, highlighting nitrogen availability driving ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbt and the role of bacterial symbion in marine adaptation to changing conditions.
Researchers have identified 9,291 TAS2Rs from 661 vertebrate genomes, revealing that frogs and salamanders have an unusually high TAS2 gene content compared to other vertebrates. Phylogenomic analyses show that most species have TASR genes in clusters, but amphibians have additional clusters and more genes per cluster. Vertebrate TASRs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, although total TASR count is stable in most lineages. TASR count is proportional to receptors expressed in extra-oral tissues. In vitro activity assays show many amphibian TASRs function as tissue-specific chemosensors detecting ecologically important xenobiotics. The number of expressed receptors not in the tongue is directly proportional to the number of TASRs in the genome, suggesting increases in TASR number allowed for acquisition of tissue-specific functions. Gene mining across 600 vertebrates indicates a rapid expansion of the TASR family in frogs and salamanders, leading to a wider repertoire than other vertebrates. Transcriptome analysis of seven tissues shows extra-oral TASR expression in amphibians, illustrating the importance of extra-oral TASRs in these species. The study provides insight into the evolution and functional implications of TASRs in vertebrates, particularly in amphibians, and highlights the potential role of recombination in creating variation in the TASR repertoire through copy number and gene conversion.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch dimerization in mammals, specifically the protein complex containing NICD, RBP, and MAML, which binds to DNA as monomers or dimers to regulate transcription. Mice with Notch dimerization-deficient alleles of Notch1 and Notch2 developed normally but were sensitized to environmental insults. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids showed no evidence of dimer-dependent gene regulation, but impaired stem cell maintenance in vitro and an elevated epithelial immune response to symbionts. TurboID and mass spectrometry analyses revealed an unbalanced interactome with reduced interaction of NOTCHDD with transcription machinery but preserved interaction with HDAC. The HDAC inhibitor Valproic acid prevented intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitors in mice and spheroids, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and differentiation in intestinal stem cells. Notch dimerization in mammals appears to be less about transcriptional regulation and more about the proteome environment with indirect consequences to innate immunity and barrier functions. Notch activation expands the stem niche at the expense of goblet and enteroendocrine cells, while Notch dimer-deficient mice show susceptibility to DSS and decreased colonic stem cells. The study found that loss of Notch dimerization affects colonic cells via a cell-autonomous mechanism and that HDAC interacts with NICD regulating its stability and activity, contributing to Notch loss-of-function phenotypes.
Background selection reduces diversity at neutral sites linked to deleterious alleles and influences patterns of total diversity and genetic differentiation in structured populations. The theory of background selection is split into two regimes: the background regime where selection pressures are strong and mutation rates are low, and the interference regime where selection pressures are weak and mutation rates are high. Researchers derived novel theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection and extended previous theory to make predictions in an island model. Simulations showed the theory predicts genetic differentiation and diversity. Background selection generates minimal increases in genetic differentiation under high migration rates due to reduced correlated effects on fitness within subpopulations. However, it causes substantial reductions in diversity, particularly in metapopulations with larger population sizes. The work extends the theory of background selection into structured populations, suggesting it minimally confounds locus-to-locus scans. Migration lessens effects of background selection by truncating cross-generational associations between neutral and deleious alleles. Theoretical predictions support the expectation of background weakly confounding locus-locus scans when gene flow is common. Simulations highlight effects of background on genetic diversity and performance of theoretical predictions in an island model with migration and finite demes.
Increasing genetic and phenotypic data is crucial for understanding disease determinants, but collaboration and data sharing among institutions is hindered by methodological and privacy concerns, such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act regulations. To address this, a federated approaches can alleviate issues around privacy and performance. A new tool, FedGAT, utilizes a federated statistical approach for efficient association tests, correcting confounding and polygenic effects without sharing genetic data among sites. Intermediate statistics are protected by encryption. Simulated and real datasets demonstrate FedGAT achieves similar results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical requirements. Challenges in federated studies include collecting harmonized data and uniform sites with matching covariates and phenotypes, leading some to meta-analyses sharing only summary statistics. Existing research focuses on χ2 test, Principal Component Analysis, and logistic regression, lacking correction for polygenic effects due to complexity. FedGAT integrates subject-level random effects, flexible for different designs without algorithmic changes. FedGAT uses homomorphic encryption and symmetric One-Time Pad-like mechanism to protect statistics. Restrictions on sharing raw genotype-phen data remain, despite partial relief from NIH, emphasizing need for privacy-preserving algorithms like FedGAT for high-powered studies.
Prostate cancer is a heritable with ancestry-based incidence and mortality, and polygenic risk scores offer advancements in predicting disease risk. Recent algorithm developments have improved pan-ancestral risk prediction for several diseases. This study benchmarks the predictive power of six widely used polygenic risk score derivation algorithms against prostate cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts, finding modest improvement in discriminatory ability compared to traditional methods. The algorithms utilize variant prioritization, continuous shrinkage, joint analysis of summary statistics, functional annotation, fine mapping, and population-specific heritability estimates. The study assesses pan-ancestry polygenic risk for prostate cancer in the All of Us cohort and finds hierarchical clustering adequate to stratify polygenic scores by ancestry. Polygenic scores may help reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment associated with PSA screening, but must work equally across populations to limit disparities. The study evaluates published polygenic scores in the UK biob cohort and finds predictive performance improves with integration of participant age and polygenic score. Addition of family history and BMI does not increase predictive power, demonstrating genetic risk coupled with age is sufficient to predict prostate cancer. The findings underscore the importance of improving risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts for equitable use.
Researchers investigated DPAG1-CD, a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by mutations in the DPAG1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-linked glycosylation, using a Drosophila eye model with an improperly developed small eye phenotype. A drug repurposing screen of 1,520 small molecules, 98% of which are FDA/EMA-approved, identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the DP1-CD model. Notably, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DP1-CD model. Loss of dopamine synthesis and recycling also partially rescued the model, suggesting dopaminergic flux and subsequent binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DPAG1 deficiency. This links dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation, representing a potential therapeutic target for DP1-CD. Genetic validation of top categories including acetylcholine-related, COX inhibitors, and NK1 inhibitors revealed novel biology in DP1 mechanisms and potential therapeutic options for DP1-CD. A total of 8/21 and 6/16 drugs tested validated in dose response and improved the DP1 model, with most genetically validated by manipulating target genes in Drosila. Heterozygous null mutations of Dop1 and Dop2 were crossed into the DP1 model, resulting in worse eyes, supporting the hypothesis that these receptors have an opposite effect on eye size compared to Dop2.
Researchers developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity to compute a putative cortical map from a large set of natural movement data to understand proprioception, a fundamental sense crucial for movement control. The model reproduces observations from monkey center-out reaching, including shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive fields and distribution of neuronal directions, without prior knowledge of arm kinematics or hand coordinates. It predicts encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-wheel geometry and few neurons will encode a single joint. The model provides a basis for understanding sensorimotor representations and neural manifolds, applicable to brain-computer interfaces and humanoid control. The study aimed to relate kinematics to proprioceptive encoding, comparing to single-unit recordings from monkeys, and formulated a computational model predicting neural coding and spatial organization. The topo-VA model was trained on human arm kinematics, exploring emergent proprioceptive representations in its layer, and validated and tested, assuming principles captured would extend to monkeys. The model learns to translate proprioceptive inputs into latent representation and has minimal inductive bias, generalizing to other sensory cortex regions. Understanding constraints to reproduce features will elucidate principles shaping proprioceptive representations in the brain.
Researchers have identified a functional ethylene receptor, Azospillum Ethylene Response 1 (Azo1), in the bacterium Azospirillum brasilense, which directly binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant surfaces. Ethylene causes widespread metabolic changes affecting carbon and nitrogen metabolism, resulting in the accumulation of polyhydroxybutyrate. The findings suggest a model in which ethylene from host plants alters the density of colonization by A. brasil and rewires its metabolism, indicating the bacterium implements an adaptation upon sensing ethylene. This discovery provides new targets to regulate plant-microbe interactions. The study demonstrates Azo1 is a functional ethylene receptor affecting bacterial traits in stress and host colonization, the first described in a proteobacter. Ethylene inhibits biofilm formation resulting in reduced cell aggregation. Phylogenetic analyses indicate putative ethylene receptors are found in other bacterial phyla, including non-pathogenic proteobacteria that associate with plants, suggesting ethylene may mediate interactions with plant hosts. The role of ethylene in microbes has been underexplored, with most studies focusing on microbe-induced changes in ethylene levels or signaling in plants, whereas this study examines the biological role of ethylene as a signal in A. brasil and its effects on traits including root colonization.
The INO80 protein, a catalytic subunit of the IN80 chromatin remodeling complex, plays a critical role in DNA repair and transcription regulation in murine spermatocytes. Immunolocalization of INO at the XY body in pachene spermatocytes suggests its involvement in meiotic sex chromosome silencing. Deletion of In80 results in high expression of sex-linked genes and incomplete inactivation, indicated by active RNA polymerase II at sex chromosomes in In80-null pachene spermatocytes. Reduced recruitment of meiotic sex chromosome inhibition initiators argues for INO-facilitated recruitment of DNA repair factors for silencing sex-linked genes. This role is independent of H2A.Z, a common IN80 target. Instead, IN80 absence leads to reduced chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites on sex chromosomes. IN80 regulates chromatin accessibility during meiotic progression, essential for DNA repair and transcription factor recruitment. IN80 interacts with DNA repair factors ATR and MDC, facilitating MDC recruitment at sex chromosomes during pachema. Initial deposition of γH2A.X at synapse initiates IN80-facilitated recruitment of M1, amplifying γH2.X in chromatin loops in an IN80-dependent ATR fashion. Overall, IN80 facilitates silencing of sex-linked genes during pachema by regulating chromatin accessibility and DNA factor recruitment.
The study investigates the conversion of SVH-1, a dual-function factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family, from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans. SVH1 acts as an HGF growth factor to promote axon regeneration and a protease to regulate early development. Cytidine deaminase CDD, encoded by the sv-17/cdd2 gene, plays a crucial role in this conversion. A codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad of SV1 suppresses the cdd-2 defect in axon regeneration. The stem structure around His-755 in svh1 mRNA is required for activation of axon regeneration by SV1. Results suggest CDD promotes axon regeneration by transforming SV1 function from protease to growth through modification of sv1 mRNA. The SV1-SV2 signaling pathway is essential for neuronal regeneration but not development, with SV1 containing kringle, N-terminal, and serine protease domains. CDD2 is required for axon regeneration, converting SV1 from protease to growth factor. In cdd mutants, axons regenerate normally after injury, suggesting CDD plays a specific role in axon regeneration after axotomy. Overall, the study demonstrates the importance of CDD in converting SV1 function for axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans.
Zebrafish collective behavior is used to assess physical and mental state, serving as a tool to evaluate the impact of aging, disease, and the effect of drugs. Researchers genetically modified zebrafish to control collective behavior at the level of individual constituents, rather than externally, by probing the effect of the lack of col11a2 gene, which causes early onset osteoarthritis. The resulting col11a2-/- zebraf exhibited compromised vertebral column properties, bent less body while swimming, and took longer to change orientations. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish showed more orderly motion than wildtype. The behavior of wildtype and col11a2- zebish are captured with a simple active matter model, where mutant fish are modeled as self-propelling agents with higher orientational noise on average. This demonstrates the possibility of tuning a biological system by changing the space it occupies when interpreted with a simple active model. The study reveals physiologically relevant behaviors underpinned by changes to the skeleton, demonstrating the utility of this approach as a tool to follow genetic mutants and relate behaviors to genetic traits and physiological changes within the body. The genetic modification caused defects in vertebral column mutants, leading to less body-bending in swimming and slower reorientation, resulting in longer orientational time, effectively exhibiting less orientational noise when modeled as self-propelling agents with aligning interactions, captured by increased persistence length on the group level.
Researchers have developed a hybrid model to simulate short-term in vitro capillary incubations, combining the Cellular Potts model for cell migration and morphology with continuum mechanics for biogel deformation and VEG transport. The model bridges mechanical and chemical stimulation, showing agreement between predicted network topology and experimental results, with elongated cells forming cords and round cells creating cobblestone aggregates. Capillary networks develop with high integrity when mechanical and chemical couplings work together, driven by soluble and bound VEG forms. The model reveals capillary network development relies on biel deformation, sufficient bound VEG, and VEG gradient for endothelial cells, requiring simultaneous mechanical and chemical coupling. Computational results match experiments under certain conditions, but omit bound VEG necessity and struggle to reproduce biel experiments. The study investigates simultaneous mechanical and chemical stimulation in capillary development, building on previous mechanical and chemical-based models. A hybrid model using cell-based CPM and continuum PDEs predicts endothelial migration, morphology, biel deformation, and VEG transport, simulating short-term capillary network formation without endothelial secretion and intake of VEG, providing insight into capillary plexus cultivation in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.
The Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGF-β) family plays significant roles in cell function, tissue patterning, and organismal homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. In Caenorhabditis elegans, there are five TGF-β ligands, which can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and TGF/Activin subfamilies. The BMP ligand DBL-1 has been studied for its role in the innate immune response. All five TGFβ ligands play a role in survival against bacterial pathogens and multiple TGFβ ligand pairs act redundantly in this response. The BMP-like ligands DB-1 and TIG2 function independently, while TIG2 and TGF/Activ-like ligand TIG3 function together. Structural modeling supports T2 and T3 to form heterodimers, lacking conserved cystine for disulfide linking dimers. DB1/BMP and Smad signal transducers function in response to bacterial pathogens, while DAF7 TGF/Activ pathway components do not play a major role. The results demonstrate potential for BMP and TGFActiv subfamily ligands to interact, providing a mechanism for distinguishing developmental and homeostatic functions from acute responses like the innate immune response to pathogens. All five TGFβ ligands, including DBL1, DAF7, UNC129, TIG2, and TIG3, contribute to the immune response, with DB1 and T2 acting independently and T2 and T3 acting together, indicating non-redundant relationships between different TGFβ classes.
The DNA damage response is a vital cellular process that safeguards genome integrity, involving substantial alterations in chromatin structure orchestrated by epigenetic enzymes. The epigen modifier N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 (Nat4) is implicated in the response to DNA damage in S. cerevisiae, with yeast cells lacking Nat4 showing increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulating more breaks. Upon DNA damage, NAT4 expression is elevated and the enzyme is recruited at double-strand breaks. Nat4-deleted cells exhibit lower levels of damage-induced H2A modification and diminished binding of checkpoint protein Rad9, with impaired Mec1 recruitment and phosphorylation of downstream effector Rad53. The effects of Nat4 in regulating the checkpoint cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetylase activity towards histone H4. This study expands the repertoire of histone modifiers in DDR, shedding light on a novel function for Nat4 in regulating response to DNA damage and checkpoint dynamics. Loss of Nat4 sensitizes cells to genotoxic damage, associated with defective signaling and impaired checkpoint activation. Nat4 expression is induced upon damage and physically recruited at DSB-flanking chromatin, serving as a novel player in DDR, regulating DNA checkpoint through N-acetylase activity on histone H4.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Orchard for reconstructing cancer phylogenies, which are diagrams depicting the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer. Existing methods become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations, but Orchard accurately reconstructs phylogenies with up to 100 mutations. It samples from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, optimizing each factor sequentially to generate a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies. Evaluations demonstrate Orchard outperforms state-of-art methods in reconstructing plausible phyies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-proitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Orchard accurately reconstructs cancer phyies using up to 1,000 mutations and identifies patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among cancer subpopulations. The algorithm alleviates the need to pre-cluster mutations, reliably solving mixed sample phylogeny problems with many mutations and samples. Results show Orchard can match or beat ground-truth baselines on tree reconstruction with up to 300 mutations and recover larger trees on simulated data. The large and accurate phylogen reconstructed by Orchard are useful for understanding evolutionary events driving cancer progression, characterizing cancer heterogeneity, discovering driver mutations, and informing treatment regimens.
Immugen is a modular language model for immunogenic prediction of CD8+ epitopes, comprising a pMHC encoding module trained on multiple pHC prediction tasks, an optional TCR module, and context-specific immunogenic prediction modules. It performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art models on pM binding affinity, eluted ligand prediction, and stability tasks. Immugen outperforms all models on pM immunogenic prediction with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.619 and average precision of 0.514, a 7% increase over the next best model. Integration of TCR information improves immunogenic prediction. Immugen's performance analysis highlights weaknesses and biases in existing models and public datasets. CD8 neoepitope prediction plays a crucial role in cancer therapeutics development, allowing targeted treatments. Immugen achieves state-of-art performance on pHC immunogenic prediction and integrates new inputs like TCRs. The pHC module processes peptide:HL pairs and immunogenic classification is fine-tuned with TCR inputs. Additional datasets on low-reactivity epitopes would be valuable. Immugen provides a framework for immunogenic prediction, achieving state-of-art performance on publicly available CD8 reactivity data. A sub-module encodes peptide-MHC pairs for immunogenic prediction, trained iteratively on pHC tasks, allowing use of all available data. Immugen is extendable to patient-specific inputs by appending embeddings from purpose-trained networks, demonstrated with TCR sequences.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study and gene-based analysis on 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to identify genes related to meat lightness and redness, mapping them to a 6.24 kb QTL region. The protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma (PPP1CC) was found to be associated with meat color. Mendelian randomization analysis validated the causal relationship between PPPCC expression and lightness/redness. Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPPCC knockout mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in muscles, with a shift from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed inhibition of PPPCC decreased slow-twitch myofiber genes and enhanced glycolysis. A plasm reporter assay showed a SNP in PPPCC regulated gene activity. Differences in meat phenotypes, myoglobin, and PPPCC expression were detected between fast-growing and local chickens. PPPCC was identified as the causative gene for meat color, providing a novel target for improvement. The study suggests PPPCC influences meat color through myofiber specification and glycolytic potential. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding genetic basis of meat color for innovation in meat technology, with PPPCC being indispensable for muscle glycogen metabolism.
Researchers have developed a novel technique called super-resolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to efficiently identify the spatial layout of subunits within a retinal ganglion cell's receptive field. This method combines concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography to stimulate and locate receptive field subunits. Simulations demonstrate that STR can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations, and application in recordings of primate parasol ganglion cells validates the experimental feasibility. STR can reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within a few minutes of recording time, ideal for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field structure in retina. Rapid subunit identification leaves ample time to use obtained subunit layouts for in-depth studies of retinal circuitry, enabling targeted stimuli to characterize spatiotemporal properties and nonlinearities of each subunit. Electrophysiological recordings from primate retinal gang cells were used to test the method, projecting light stimuli onto retinal photoreceptors while using a multielectrode array. STR has potential to reduce required recording time, locate subunits consistently, and determine subunit shape accurately, allowing for further investigation of retinal computations and interactions between bipolar cells.
Researchers have developed a novel statistical method called CRISPR-DR to identify chemical-genetic interactions using CRISPR interference technology, which can reveal insights into drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance. CRISPR-DR incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation to capture non-linear interactions between them. The method requires multiple sgRNAs for each target, varying in strength, and experimentally quantified efficiencies as input. It extends the Hill equation to include an extra term representing sgRNA efficiency, allowing identification of genes whose depletion synergizes with increasing drug concentration. CRISPR-DR is applied to Mycobacterium tuberculosis and E. coli datasets, showing competitive performance with related methods while maintaining higher precision, especially in noisy datasets. Efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies, with intermediate strength sgRNAs maximizing concentration dependence. The approach can be generalized to non-CGI datasets, providing a valuable tool for understanding gene-drug interactions. CRISPR-DR captures dose-response behavior where interacting genes exhibit synergistic behavior with a drug, depletion of a protein inducing excess or enrichment of mutants in the presence of an inhibitor, concentration-dependent effect. The method accommodates variable sgRNA efficiency to identify genes whose level synergizes with increasing concentration.
Researchers investigated community detection in gene-expression networks without assuming modular organization, using the weighted stochastic block model, which separates genes into hierarchically organized blocks without assuming assortative modules. Analyzing RNAseq data from Drosophila melanaster, they found the model identified ten times more groups than competing methods, with several non-modular groups showing strong functional enrichment. Results indicate the transcriptome is structured in complex ways beyond traditional modularity, suggesting a revisit of the assumption that modularity drives gene-expression networks. Non-modular blocks are widespread, with functional relevance as strong as modular blocks, highlighting the need to incorporate beyond assortativity when exploring networks. Alternative methods like graphical lasso and combining community detection with network inference may provide better estimates of gene connections. The weighted Degree Corrected Stochastic Block Model allows finding meaningful non-assortative groups with biological interpretation, showing promising results in similar applications. Comparison with clustering algorithms relying on assortativity showed the model's performance in identifying communities without assuming modularity. The study's findings emphasize the need for methods not relying on modularity maximization to determine general patterns of non-modular organization in gene-expression networks.
Researchers investigated the role of cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP1) in post-transcriptional control, including translation, termination, and mRNA decay in yeast cells. Using mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and RiboSeq, they analyzed changes in the proteome and transcriptome of cells lacking the PAB gene. The results showed drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, defects in translation initiation and termination, and stabilization of specific mRNAs. The loss of PAB led to reduced levels of initiation factors, decapping activators, and deadenylation complex components. Cells without PAB also exhibited a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype, indicating a defect in translation termination. Deletion of PAB resulted in changes in the transcriptome and proteome, with minimal changes in translation efficiency. Some initiation factors were reduced at both mRNA and protein levels, suggesting indirect effects of PAB deletion on translation. The study found that PAB's role in translation initiation is complex and dependent on the stoichiometry between PAB, poly(A) tracts, and basal translation levels. Ribosome footprints in the 5'-UT region were increased in PAB-deleted cells, and recruitment of PAB to poly(A) tracts induced internal cap-independent initiation. Overall, the loss of PAB is pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcription regulation, with both direct and indirect effects on translation initiation, termination, and mRNA decay.
Researchers have identified a mechanism by which slow brain rhythms, such as those occurring during sleep or seizures, can arise from the interplay between fast-spiking dynamics and slow extracellular potassium concentration changes mediated by the Na+/K+-ATPase. This mechanism is available to all neurons with class I excitability and generates hysteresis loops around a bistable regions through saddle-node bifurcation. The strength of the Na+/K+-ATase determines whether bursts are generated, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolarization block. Transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting Na+/K+-Pase activity. A minimalistic models outline the sodium-potassium pump's contribution to burst dynamics, contributing to understanding pathologies like epilepsy and informing therapeutic strategies. The study highlights the role of extracellular potassium and Na+/K+-ATase in inducing slow rhythms in single neurons. The interplay between potassium dynamics and neuronal excitability in class I models can give rise to slow bursting under minimal conditions. The mechanism generates diverse spiking via feedback from increased extracellular potassium, supported by experimental evidence, presenting a minimal mechanism for deterministic activity from common spiking and potassium changes mediated by Na+/K+-Pase.
Researchers have developed the COPS package for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results, featuring advanced methods including similarity networks, kernel approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway integration. The framework was applied to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, utilizing mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data, contrasting data and knowledge-driven multi-view methods and incorporating cross-validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox models, and stability of results. The study found that Affinity Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Factorization, and Multiple K-means with linear or pathway-induced kernels were most stable and effective in discerning groups with different survival outcomes. The COPS package offers a range of methods and functionalities, including two new pathway kernels, BWK and RWR, suited for clustering analysis. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of COPS in benchmarking multi-view methods to categorize cancer patients based on multi-omics profiles and evaluates the potential of multi-omics analysis for cancer subtyping, with implications for patient stratification and treatment. Survival analysis was based on the capacity of multi-view algorithms to yield groupings providing predictive value beyond clinically available information, adjusting for covariates like age and cancer stage, highlighting the importance of subsampling in evaluating metrics and stability in the multi-omic context.
The development of multicellular organisms requires a well-orchestrated interplay between cell-intrinsic transcription factors and cell signaling, with the SoxC group being a highly conserved transcription factor playing diverse roles in development. In C. elegans, the sole SoxC protein SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development and specifying the sex myoblast fate in the postembryonic mesoderm lineage. A novel loss-of-function sem-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal of the conserved DNA-binding domain has been identified, revealing new functions of SEM2 in the lineage. SEM2 functions antagonistically regulates dorsoventral patterning of the lineage with LET-381 and is essential for proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage. Additionally, SEM2 directly regulates the expression of hlh-8, encoding a basic helix-loop-helix Twist factor critical for proper patterning of the lineage. The study suggests an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins and identifies new interactions in the gene regulatory network underlying C.elegans postembonic development, adding to the understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins. SEM2 regulates the expression of hl8, possibly directly in SMs, and is essential for proliferation and diversification of SMs. The work uncovers new interactions in the regulatory network, some likely conserved in other species, adding to the understanding of SoxC functions and structure.
