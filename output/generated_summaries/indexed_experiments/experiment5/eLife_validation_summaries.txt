Cell fate reprogramming is a crucial aspect of development, yet the molecular mechanisms that promote or inhibit reprogramming in intact organisms are not well understood. In the C. elegans germline, reprogramming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation. The GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway, known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem/progenitors, has been found to facilitate this reprogramming. Through a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes, it was discovered that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprogramming by activating genes silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (P2) and identifies the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GL-1/Notch target facilitating reprogramming. Notch signaling was identified as a critical player in this reprogramming model, which was unanticipated since signaling through the Notch receptor GL-1 maintains germl stem/proitor fate. To understand this novel reprogramming-promoting role of GL-1/Notch, genetics was combined with tissue-specific profiling. In the C. elegans germl, GL-1/Not signaling is essential for maintaining undifferentiated cells/progen, but also has an unexpected role in promoting cell reprogramming. Genes activated upon increased GL-1/Not signaling suggested an antagonistic relationship between GL-1/Not and P2. The C. elegans P2 consists of MES-2, -3, and -6, and levels of corresponding transcripts were not altered by GL-1/Not signaling. Analyzing genes with higher germl expression, the disproportional X-link of Not-activated genes was striking, with fifteen times more than expected. X-linked genes are largely silenced by C. eleg P2. Genes regulated by GL-1/Not include those maintaining germl/progen cells and genes repressed by P2. GL-1/Not and P2 have antagonistic effects on germ cell decisions and co-regulate common target UTX-1. Findings have implications from development to diseases with abnormal Notch signaling.
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a significant respiratory, blood, and bladder pathogen of clinical concern. The adaptor protein SK2 is required for protection against K. pneumoniae ATCC 438 pulmonary infections. Sk2-/- mice had a 100-fold higher bacterial burden compared to wild-type, controlled by SK2 expression in innate immune cells. Sk2/- neutrophils and monocytes were present in infected lungs, and neutrophils degranulated normally in response to K pneumonia infection, but K pneumonia-stimulated reactive oxygen species production was abolished. K pneumonia-induced neutroph ROS required activity of SFK, Syk, Btk, PLC2, and PK. Loss of SK2 hindered K pneumonia-induced phosphorylation of SFK, Sy, and Py2, implicating SK2 as proximal to activation in pathogen-signaling. SK2-dependent signaling in neutils is essential for K pneumonia-activated ROS production and bacterial clearance. Sensitivity of K pneumonia to ROS is supported by increased bacterial burden in Cybb-/- mice and observations in CGD patients. In murine neutils SK2 was required for full phosphorylation of SF, Sy, and Py2, demonstrating a critical role in K pneumonia-induced pathways for ROS production. SK2 plays a key role in host defense in hematietic compartment against pneumonia 438 in pulmonary infections in murine model. SK2 indispensable for pneumonia-stimulated neutroph ROS, not degran or phagocyt, suggesting increased bacterial burden in Sk2- mice affected by loss of ROS. K pneumonia 438 strain resistant to neutroph phagosis regardless of SK2 expression but elicits SK2-independent degran during infection. ROS is important for protection against pneumonia as mice lacking essential gp91phox of NAD oxidase were susceptible. SK2-expressing neutils contributed to pulmonary containment of pneumonia in lungs independent of monocytes. Sk2/-neutroph defective in triggering cascade for ROS after pneumonia binding to surface. Investigation of SK2 in K pneumonia-induced ROS evaluated requirement for several proteins critical for receptor-mediated ROS after pneumonia infection.
Plasmodium vivax relapse infections occur when latent liver-stage parasites, known as hypnoites, activate and cause new blood-stage infections weeks or months after the initial infection. A within-host mathematical model of liver-stage hypzoites has been developed and validated against data from tropical strains of P. vivax. This model demonstrates the build-up of the hypzoite reservoir following new infections and its depletion through hypzoite activation and death. The hypzo reservoir is predicted to be over-dispersed, with many individuals having few or no hypzoites and some having intensely infected livers. Individuals with more hypzoites are predicted to experience more relapses and contribute more to P.viv transmission. Incorporating hypite killing drugs, such as primaquine, into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P.v transmission as individuals with most hypites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment. Relapses from hypite activation have important consequences for transmission dynamics of P.viv and constitute a third malaria reservoir, in addition to blood and mosquito reservoirs. Models will play a crucial role in estimating the effectiveness of interventions targeting the hypite reservoir due to the absence of diagnostics for detecting liver-stage parasites. Most existing models do not account for the liver reservoir, but hypite has been incorporated into some P transmission models as a state or broods of hypites. The developed within-host model explains epidemiological patterns of relapse by assuming hypites activate and die at a constant rate and is integrated into Ross-Macdon models to account for relapse characteristic P malaria. Mathematical models provide insights into the impact of control interventions on parasite reservoirs in the vector, blood, and liver. The hypite reservoir build-up and depletion through activation and death is key to understanding P transmission dynamics, with primaquine treatment predicted to reduce transmission by targeting individuals with most hypites.
Selective logging in Amazonian forests results in the emission of over 90 Tg of carbon to the atmosphere annually, which is counterbalanced by forest regrowth. A study utilizing a network of 133 permanent forest plots across Amazonia found regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass impact survivors and recruits' carbon flux, providing predictions of post-logging recovery. Net aboveground carbon recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana and western regions, with 21 Mg ha-1, compared to southern regions with 12 Mg ha-1, where environmental stress is high due to low rainfall and high seasonality. Survivors play a key role in forest regrowth, and a comprehensive map of post-disturbance recovery potential in Amazonia has been developed. Long-term data from 13 experimentally disturbed sites in the Amazon Basin and Guiana, meeting specific criteria including annual precipitation above 100 mm, total censused area above 1 ha, and multiple censuses, were analyzed. Selective logging, due to its economic implications, is a long-studied human disturbance in tropical forests. Regional differences in Amazonian response to large carbon losses induced by other disturbances are also considered. Predictive maps of carbon changes over 10 years under 40% loss, common after conventional logging, were developed using global maps of carbon, climatic conditions, and soil density. Human activities on carbon cycles, particularly 2.1 Pg yr-1 loss by anthropogenic disturbances in tropical forests, draw increasing attention, with selective logging being a significant contributor. Carbon recovery following selective logging in Amazonian forests varies by region, influenced by climate, soil, and initial biomass, with survivors contributing to regrowth.
Researchers have identified and isolated two distinct populations of neural stem cells in the adult mouse forebrain, specifically in the lateral ventricular subventricular zone, using flow cytometry. The first population, referred to as GEOT cells, expresses high levels of Glast, EGFR, and PlexinB, and low levels of CD24, PSA-NCAM, Ter119, and CD45, and accounts for 3.2% of all cells in the zone. GEOT cells are highly mitotic, short-lived, and can form neurospheres, with 36% of them forming neurospheres over 50 micrometers in diameter and 74% undergoing multilineage differentiation. In contrast, pre-GEOT cells are quiescent, express higher levels of Glast and lower levels of EGFR and PlexinB, cannot form neurospheres, but express stem markers such as Slc1, GFAP, Sox2, and Gli, and are long-lived. Conditional deletion of the Bmi-1 polycomb protein depletes both GEOT and pre-GEOT cells, but pre-GEOT cells are more dependent on Bmi for Cdk2 repression. GEOT cells can be ablated by temozolide, while pre-GEOT cells survive and repopulate the zone. Fate mapping using Ascl1Cre2 and Dlx2 shows GEOT cells persist transiently in the zone, while pre-OT cells are long-lived based on mapping with Slc1, GF, Sox2, and G1. The study distinguishes quiescent neural stem cells from neurosphere-initiating cells, enabling further study of their properties in vivo.
Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel involved in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues. Cryo-electron microscopy has revealed that the Piezo structure is bowl-shaped and capable of inducing membrane curvature via its extended footprint. Researchers used cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp to examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Pie1 endogenously at low levels and overexpressing Pie1 at high levels. The data, together with stochastic simulations of Pie1 spatial distributions, show that at endogenous densities and non-physiological densities, Pie1 density has no effect on pressure sensitivity or open probability in the absence of membrane tension. The results suggest Pie channels, at densities likely to be physiologically, behave as independent mechanotrans. This property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire membrane. Electrophysiological data and simulations show Pie1 channels function as independent mechanotrans, enabling cells to transduce forces with spatial homogeneity. This is important as Pie1 channels have no intrinsic tendency to spatially concentrate and functionally modulate each other's mechanical sensitivity, ideal for cells to transduce mechanical forces homogeneously. Cells are exposed to mechanical forces and have evolved molecular mechanisms for detection, with rapid sensing achieved by force-gated channels converting mechanical energy into electrochemical signals. Pie1 is a mechanically gated cation channel sensing membrane tension with high sensitivity. The study aimed to quantify Pie1 spatial distribution and potential interactions across channel densities using electrophysiology, measuring channel number, single-channel current, open probability, and pressure sensitivity. Cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology was used, considering limitations such as spatial resolution limited by pipette size. The findings indicate Pie1 channels inherently function as independent mechanotrans at physiologically relevant densities, crucial for homogeneous force transduction across the cell membrane.
The influence of evidence volatility on choice, reaction time, and confidence in perceptual decision-making has been investigated through a novel sensory manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of the visual cortex. This manipulation was verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT and MST, and its effects were tested on both humans and monkeys. The results showed that increasing noise led to faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded accumulation model, where an increase in noise should lead to faster decisions, reduced accuracy, and paradoxically, higher confidence. A well-studied motion task was used, where much is known about the underlying physiology, and the effect of the manipulation was verified by recording from neurons in the visual cortex of the macaque. A framework based on bounded accumulation of evidence accounted for the joint effect of volatility on choice, reaction time, and confidence. The manipulation increased the variance of momentary evidence on decision, termed volatility, and increased decision speed and associated confidence. Testing the influence of volatility on decision process required independent control over signal and noise in evidence, achieved by changing statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus. Recordings from direction selective neurons in middle temporal and medial temporal areas of macaque visual cortex verified the desired properties of the manipulation. The relationship between volatility and decision speed was studied with reaction-time version of random-dot discrimination task, where three human participants completed 663 trials and one macaque monkey completed 14,137 trials. Each trial started with fixating on a central spot, followed by presentation of two targets. The manipulation tested influence of noise on three observables of behavior, accuracy, reaction time, and confidence, in monkeys and humans, showing faster decisions and greater confidence with minimal impairment in accuracy.
The insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway maintains a relatively short wild-type lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, the ortholog of FOXO transcription factors in mammalian cells. DAF16 is phosphorylated by AKT kinases, preventing its nuclear translocation. Calcineurin, a PP2 phosphatase, also limits the lifespan of C. elegans, but the mechanism through which it does so is unknown. Research has shown that TAX-6CN-1 and UNC-43, the C. elegans Calcineurin and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II orthologs, regulate lifespan through DAF16. UNC43 regulates DAF16 in response to various stress conditions, including starvation, heat, or oxidative stress, and cooperatively contributes to lifespan regulation by insulin signaling. Unlike insulin, UNC43 phosphorylates and activates DAF16, promoting its nuclear localization. The phosphorylation of DAF16 at serine 286 by UNC43 is removed by TAX6CN1, leading to DAF inactivation. Mammalian FOX3 is also regulated by CAMII and Calcinein. The direct targets of worm Calcinein have been identified as DAF16, which is phosphorylated and activated by UNC43 at serine 286. The phosphoryl group is removed by TAX6CN1. UNC43 and TAX6CN regulate C. elegans lifespan through reversible phosphorylation of DAF16. Data suggests CAMII and Calcinein, by phosphoryating or dephosphlating serine 286 of DAF, extend or shorten the lifespan of C.elegans. Multiple signaling pathways, including insulin/IGF1 signaling, germline signaling, mitochondrial signaling, and dietary restriction regulate aging in C.elegans. The insulin pathway includes the upstream insulin/IG1 receptor DAF2 and downstream FOX transcription factor DAF16. Insulin signaling overpowers CAMII and Calcine in regulation of DAF localization in C.eleg. TAX6 or UNC43 failed to abolish DAF nuclear accumulation by DAF2 RNAi, and TAX or UNC43 failed to overcome inhibition of DAF nuclear localization by DAF18 RNAi. A model shows regulation of DAF by insulin, UNC43, and TAX6CN.
Researchers have investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the sequential execution of motor movements in Drosophila, specifically the process of grooming, which involves the serial execution of distinct movements to clean different body parts. By using genetically targeted activation of neural subsets, distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts were driven, revealing that these programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy, where motor programs that occur first suppress those that occur later. Cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its motor program, relieving suppression of the next movement, allowing the sequence to progress down the hierarchy. A model featuring independently evoked movements activated in parallel but selected serially through hierarchical suppression successfully reproduced the grooming sequence. This provides the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model generating human action. The study demonstrates that dust on the body elicits different independently evoked motor programs for five body parts that progress in series and that these programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy. An empirically derived computational model demonstrates how suppression mediates the sequential selection of the motor programs. The evolutionarily ancient ability to select among behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided the necessary infrastructure to perform motor actions in sequence. Activation and parallel models describe different mechanisms generating sequential behavior, while tools have invigorated interest in identifying neurons driving behavior, enabling experiments to probe the organization of serial behavior through control of individual actions. The organizational principles underlying neural control of serial selection in innate behavior, common to most limbed animals, grooming, were studied. Animals have mechanisms for selecting favorable options and suppressing others due to different values on motor programs. The demonstration of hierarchical suppression among behaviors leading to sequence emergence is significant. Identifying circuitry for each cleaning module and determining interactions will reveal serial organization of behavior encoded in the nervous system through hierarchical mechanism.
Shugoshin-like protein 2 (Sg2) plays a crucial role in coordinating essential cell processes during meiosis I in oocytes, ensuring accurate chromosome segregation by regulating cohesion, kinetochore-microtubule interactions, and the spindle assembly checkpoint. S2 protects centromeric cohesin through interaction with PP2A and silences the spindle assembly checkpoint by binding to Mad2, promoting congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis spindles. Additionally, S2 facilitates kinetochore-microtubule interactions and limits bivalent stretching by recruiting MCA and inhibiting Aurora kinase activity at kinetochores. Depletion of S2 in oocytes leads to pleiotropic consequences, including inefficient silencing of the spindle checkpoint, increased bivalent stretching, and alterations in kinetochore-microtubule attachments. The absence of S2 causes delayed bi-orientation of bivalents, increased bivalent stretching, and Aurora kinase activity at kinetochores, accompanied by changes in kinetoch-microtubule attachments and delayed APC/CC20 activation. Notably, S2 regulates sister chromatid cohesion, chromosome traction, the spindle checkpoint, and Aurora kinases. Mutations in S2 alter some but not all processes, indicating its pleiotropy is not due to secondary effects of a single function loss. S2 defective in PP2 binding fails to protect centromeric coin, yet its deficiency causes changes in chromosome and microtubule dynamics. Overall, S2 coordinates diverse processes for faithful chromosome segregation through multiple interactions, including PP2, Mad2, MCA, and Aurora kinase.
Researchers investigated the role of RNA localization and protein synthesis in experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity, focusing on whether local stimulation triggers directed trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to synapses in addition to promoting local translation. Imaging of RNA localization and translation in cultured Aplysia sensory-motor neurons showed RNAs were delivered throughout the neuron arbor, but translation was enriched at sites of synaptic contact and stimulation. The study revealed a role for calcium-dependent retrograde netrin-1/DCC signaling in triggering local translation. Spatially restricting gene expression by regulating translation maximizes the readiness of the neuronal arbor to respond to local cues. Local stimulation regulates trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to specific subcellular sites, with previous studies indicating activity can regulate mRNA localization within neurons. A trans-synaptic signal promotes translation of localized mRNAs, with netrin-1/DCC signaling involved in local translation at synapses. rRNA, specific mRNAs, ribosomal proteins, and translation factors were delivered throughout the neuron to both synaptic and non-synaptic sites, but translation was enriched at sites of synaptic contact and stimulation. Spatial regulation of gene expression in Aplyia sensory-motor neurons is primarily at the level of translation rather than RNA targeting from the nucleus. Every measure of translation demonstrated localized translation at synapses and stimulated synapses, suggesting mRNAs are delivered throughout the neuronal arbor. Release of netrin-1 from sensory or motor neurons during synapse formation and synaptic plasticity triggers translation at synaptic but not non-synaptic contacts. Incubation of Aplyia sensory-motor neuronal cultures with recombinant Fc-netrin-1 tested netrin-1 regulation of localized transcript synthesis. Netrin-1/DCC signaling plays a key role in local translation at synapses, maximizing the readiness of the neuronal arbor to respond to local cues by regulating translation rather than directing delivery of mRNAs to stimulated synapses.
Researchers have developed a method to control the spatial patterning of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using CRISPR interference, allowing for the creation of complex multicellular structures with distinct cell types. Current methods to model morphogenic events lack control over cell-type emergence and the ability to selectively perturb specific subpopulations. The study employed an inducible CRISPR interference system in hiSCs to silence key proteins regulating cell adhesion and cortical tension, specifically ROCK1 and CDH. Mosaic knockdown of ROCK1 or CDH resulted in differential patterning within hiSC colonies due to cellular self-organization while retaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype. The knockdown induces a transient wave of differential gene expression within mixed populations that stabilizes in coordination with observed self-organization. This approach enables genetic interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, facilitating understanding of molecular pathways regulating symmetry-breaking during morphogenesis. By creating mixed populations of hiSCs with and without the CRISPR system and inducing mosaic knockdown, symmetry-breaking events were genetically controlled within hiSC populations. Silencing target genes by CRISi within subpopulations provides avenues to control emergence of asymmetric phenotypes and multicellular pattern development. Mosaic knockdown interrogates creation of physical asymmetries in homogeneous populations leading to multicellular organization and pattern formation. Induction of mosaic ROCK1 or CDH results in 'bottom-up' cell-driven pattern formation of hiSC colonies while preserving pluripotency. The study identifies a strategy to direct emergence of heterotypic populations to control multicellular organization in pluripotent cells, facilitating creation of robust models for mechanistic study of human tissue patterning and formation. This method allows for selective perturbation of specific cell subpopulations, enabling better understanding of interactions between distinct cell types in multicellular structures. By manipulating hiSC subpopulations, researchers can control driven self-organization into repeatable patterns, addressing limitations of current methods that fail to discriminate between cells or account for emergence of heterotypic interactions in multicellular organization.
Researchers have proposed a normative theory to explain the decrease in encoding precision of visual working memory with an increase in the number of items, suggesting the brain minimizes a weighted sum of error-based behavioral cost and neural cost. A model constructed from this theory predicts set size effects, which are mediated by probing probability, aligning with previous findings. The model accounts for effects of set size and probing probability on encoding precision in nine delayed-estimation experiments and supports the prediction that total invested resource varies non-monotonically with set size. It is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or none of relevant items in a task, raising the possibility that cognitive limitations arise from cost minimization rather than constraints. The theory provides a formalism to test speculation that selectivity of attention arises from balancing performance against costs associated with spiking and explains set effects in attention tasks. The model was tested on data from nine experiments, accounting for effects of set and probing with few parameters, including non-monotonic relation between set and total invested resource. At the neural level, this translates to a prediction of non-monotic relation between population-level spiking activity and set, which can be tested using neuroimaging experiments. The theory makes predictions about effects of incentive manipulations on precision as they affect the expected cost function.
Plants utilize autophagy as a defense mechanism to safeguard against infectious diseases, but the methods by which pathogens interfere with autophagy-related processes are not well understood. Research has shown that Pex54, an effector from the Irish potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans, binds to the autophagy protein ATG8, stimulating autophosome formation. Pex54 depletes the autagy receptor Joka out of ATG8 complexes and interferes with Joka's positive effect on pathogen defense. This indicates a plant pathogen has evolved to antagonize a host autagy receptor to counteract host defenses. Pex54 has an AT8 interacting motif that binds with high affinity to the autagy protein ATGCL and stimulates the formation of AT8-marked autagosomes. Unlike the Legionella effector RavZ, Pex54 activates selective autagy possibly to eliminate defense-related compounds or reattribute cellular resources by promoting nutrient recycling. Pex54 competes with the autagy receptor J2 and depletes it of AT8 autagosomes to promote disease susceptibility. Pathogens can disrupt and activate autagy for their own benefit, with Pex54 outcompeting the autagy receptor J2 and enhancing virulence. The molecular mechanisms that mediate defense-related autagy are poorly understood and how pathogens manipulate defense-related autagy or subvert autagy for nutrient uptake is unknown. Pex54 has evolved to bind host autagy protein AT8 to stimulate autophosome formation and depletes the autagy receptor J2 of AT8 complexes to counteract host defenses. Future studies will investigate pathogen modulation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of autagy and subcell trafficking during infection to determine whether other pathogens secrete effectors that target autagy in similar ways.
Human cardiac fibroblasts play a crucial role in tissue adaptation and inflammation in response to pathological conditions such as ischemia, where microenvironmental changes trigger a series of cellular responses. A comprehensive model of how environmental changes induce cardiac fibroblast responses is lacking due to the absence of approaches involving complex and simultaneous stimulation. This study provides an analysis of human cardiac fibroblast behavior using a multi-stimulus device for combined cyclic strain and controlled oxygen application, revealing differential responses to various stimuli combinations. Individual stimuli cause proliferative effects, including increased PH3 mitotic cells, YAP translocation, and PDGF secretion, or collagen presence. However, only the combination of hypoxia and simulated loss of contractility induces increased release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases.

Cardiac fibroblasts have been studied under physico-chemical stimulation such as mechanical stress, oxygen deprivation, and biochemical stimulation with pro-fibrotic cytokines. This study controlled mechanical strain and oxygen regimes sensed by fibroblasts to model environmental changes in cardiac injury, providing insights into individual and synergistic contributions of signals in activation of fibroblast responses relevant to fibrotic disease. After ischemic myocardial insult, tissue oxygen levels drop, and during the proliferative phase of myocardial healing, excessive fibroblast proliferation and phenotypic switch give rise to fibrot response. The study examined fraction of mitotic cells under combined stimulation and oxygen changes, showing mimicking hypox and reduced contractility proved crucial in eliciting inflammatory and fibrotic responses, while individual stimuli regulated proliferative and collagen-related responses.

The findings propose an innovative model recreating pathological environment for understanding fibroblast responses during injury, replicating the combination of oxygen and mechanical cues, highlighting adaptive mechanisms. The study provides a tool for understanding pathological mechanisms and tailoring reparative strategies, impacting future studies of myocardial remodeling. The combination of hypox and simulated loss of contractility is crucial for inflammatory and fibrotic responses, while individual stimuli regulate proliferation and collagen. The study elucidates human fibroblast behavior under controlled strain and oxygen, providing insights into environmental changes in cardiac injury and fibrotic disease. The model described in vitro provides a tool for understanding pathological mechanisms, tailoring reparative strategies, and studying myocardial remodeling.
Researchers have identified that alternative isoforms of the DOM nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, specify two distinct multiunit complexes in Drosophila, both necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A.V, the fly ortholog of H2.Z, genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex. In contrast, the DOM-A complex functions as an ATP-independent histone acetylase complex similar to yeast Nu4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. The DOM-A features arranged domains separated by the ATPase domain, suggesting it may serve as the central unit of a Nu4-type complex in Drosila. The ATP activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation by DOM, a principle possibly conserved across metazoans. H2.Z is primarily found at active promoters and enhancers, regulating transcription initiation and elongation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, H2.Z is introduced into chromatin by the SW1 complex, a multiunit ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler with IN80-type ATP SWR1 at its core. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetylase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification, whereas Drosila generates diversity through alternative splicing of a single gene. Knockdowns of DOM-A, DOM-B, TIP, or H2 resulted in changes in transcription, indicating functional differences of the two isoforms on transcription. The study provides an example of evolutionary strategies leading to functional separation, illustrating how alternative splicing generates diversity amongst chromatin regulators. The SW1 and Nu4 complexes are separate entities in yeast, while in humans paralogous SRCAP and EP400 proteinases organize distinct complexes serving conserved functions. Data suggests most TIP resides in the DOM complex in Dros cells, and the existence of a Nu4-type complex with functional and structural similarity to yeast has not been reported. Overall, the research highlights the distinct roles of DOM-A and DOM-B in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling in Drosila.
Neuromuscular junction formation requires proper interaction between motoneurons and muscle cells, and β-catenin (Ctnb1) in muscle is critical for motone differentiation. However, the relevant retrograde signal is not well understood. This study used an in vivo transgenic approach to dissect the functions of muscle Cnb1 and found that Cnb mutant without the transactivation domain was unable to rescue presynaptic deficits of Cnb mutation, indicating the involvement of transcription regulation. The cell-adhesion function of Cnb is dispensable. A screen for proteins that may serve as a Cnb-directed retrograde factor identified Slit2. Transgenic expression of Sl2 specifically in the muscle diminished presynaptic deficits by Cnb mutation in mice. Sl2 immobilized on beads induced synaptin puncta in axons of spinal cord explants, suggesting Sl2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Cnb to direct presyn differentiation. Rescue experiments indicated a necessary role for transcription activity of muscle Cnb in presyn differentiation. Exploration of targets of Cnb as muscle-derived retrograde factors led to the identification of Sl2, an environmental cue that repels or collapses neuronal axons. Muscle overexpression of the Cnb mutant without the TAD was unable to rescue presynaptic deficits, indicating transcription is critical for muscle Cnb to control presyn differentiation. Recent reports of stable Cnb in muscle impairing presyn differentiation in mutant mice support the notion that Cnb in muscle is critical for a retrograde to nerve terminal development. Cnb associates with Tcf/Lef-elements in the promoter of the Sl2 gene, and Sl2 expression in cells is promoted by elevating Cnb. Sl2 is concentrated at the neuromuscular junction. Transgenic mice expressing Sl2 specifically in muscle diminished presynaptic deficits by Cnb mutation, including poor innervation, reduced vesicle density, and active zone, and depressed miniature end-plate potential. The study determined which function of Cnb is required for neuromuscular junction formation by characterizing transgenic mice expressing wild-type or Cnb mutants impaired in transcription regulation or cell-adhesion, suggesting muscle Cnb regulates presyn differentiation via gene-expression.
Researchers have developed computational and experimental approaches to quantify the dynamics of force transmission in cell clusters with subcellular and multicellular resolution, applying this technology to spontaneously forming adherent epithelial cell clusters. The study found that basal force fluctuations were coupled to E-cadherin localization at the level of individual cell junctions and cell-cell force exchange depended on the position within a cluster, adapting to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements. Force transmission through a cell required coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors. Using a generalized cell-cell force measurement and analysis, the transmission of mechanical forces through cell-cell junctions of dynamic epithelial clusters was quantified spatially and temporally. Time-resolved force measurements demonstrated cell-cell forces at individual junctions fluctuate over time during interphase and cell divisions. The study investigated how basal force variations were coupled to the localization and recruitment of molecular components of cell-cell junctions, focusing on E-cadherin, the backbone of adherens junctions for epithelial cells. Local mechanical stresses correlated with localization of E-cadher molecules along the cell junction, and force propagation through cells can be intercepted by anchorage to the extracellular matrix and actomyin contraction. Force transmission across a cell is short-ranged, typically on the length of one cell diameter, due to anchoring and scrambling forces by cell-matrix adhesions and basal actomyin contractility. The study provides insights into tissue mechanics and highlights methods as a resource for studying mechanotransduction in cell adhesions, revealing mechanisms controlling mechanical homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues. Force exchange profiles along cell-cell interfaces were calculated at any point of a time-lapse video using fluorescence signals of GFP fused to E-cadherin, allowing for quantification of cell-cell force in a 3-cell cluster with changing topology.
Researchers investigated the structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin, a protein associated with Huntington's disease, using various biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle microscopy, and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Huntingtin is composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical solenoid structure, with the amino-terminal and carbox-terminal regions folding to contain a circumscribed central cavity. The polyglutamine expansion increases α-helical properties of huntingtin and affects intramolecular interactions among domains. The study aimed to solve the puzzle of how the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract confers novel properties on huntingtin, causing disease, by conducting systematic biophysical and biochemical analyses of purified human recombinant huntingtins with varied polyutamine tracts. The impact of the polyglutamine tract on huntingtin's basic features suggests it may undergo conformational change upon interaction with binding partners. Single-particle microscopy of recomant human huntingtins with polyutamine lengths of 23-78-residues showed the protein's shape enables structural impact of the amino-terminal polyglutamine. Biophysical analyses of allelic series native recomant human huntingtins provide a solution to the mystery of how the amino-terminal polyglutamine modulates hunting structure and function. Circular dichroism experiments showed an increase in α-helical properties with longer polyglutamine tracts, with an average mean residue ellipticity of deg cm/dmol at 222nm, characteristic of α-helix, plotted against polyglutamine length. The study provides an elegant solution to the conundrum of how the extreme-terminal polyglutamine confers novel properties on huntingtin, causing disease, and delineates structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin affected by the polyutamine expansion.
Researchers have investigated the role of NCO4, a selective receptor for the autophagic turnover of ferritin, in regulating intracellular iron bioavailability. Analysis of the NCO4-FTH interaction revealed a direct association between a key arginine in FTH and a C-terminal element in NCO4 is required for delivery of ferritin to lysosomes via autophagosomes. NCO4 abundance is under dual control via autophagy and the ubiquitin proteome, with ubiquitin-dependent NCO4 turnover promoted by excess iron involving an iron-dependent interaction between NCO4 and the HER2 ubiquitin ligase. When iron levels are high, NCO4 abundance is low, promoting ferritin accumulation and iron capture, but when iron is low, NCO4 levels increase to promote ferritinagy. The interaction between NCO4 and F1 is mediated by a conserved NCO4 C-terminal domain and a conserved residue on F1, with mutation at these sites abolishing binding in vivo and abolishing ferritinagy. The HER2 ligase recognizes NCO4 under high iron conditions to mediate NCO4 turnover via the ubiquitin-proteome system, reducing steady-state NCO4 levels and increasing ferritin for iron capture. NCO4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation in zebraf and cultured cells. The study reveals the molecular nature of the NCO4-ferr complex and explains how intracellular levels modulate NCO4-mediated ferritin in cells in an iron-dependent setting. NCO4-mediated ferritinagy is important for maintaining cellular homeostasis and aberrant degradation of ferritin in lysosomes would be deleterious to the cell when intracellular iron is high. The mechanism of NCO4 suppression under iron-replete conditions involves the HER2 ubiquitin ligase and ubiqu-proteome system. Overall, NCO4 is crucial for erythropoiesis and its regulation by iron-dependent HER2-mediated proteolysis is essential for maintaining intracellular iron homeostasis.
The lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) plays a crucial role in higher-level cognition, but its functional organization has remained unclear. An influential theory proposes that the LPFC is organized hierarchically, with progressively rostral areas processing increasingly abstract information to facilitate efficient and flexible cognition. Recent human fMRI data revealed rostral-caudal gradients of abstraction in the LP, with dynamic modeling showing asymmetrical LP interactions indicative of hierarchical processing. Contrary to dominant assumptions, the strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioned midFC as the apex of the hierarchy. Cognitive demands induced connectivity modulations towards midFC consistent with a role in integrating information for control operations. The strengths of these dynamics were related to trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability, suggesting the LP is hierarchically organized with midFC synthesizing abstract and concrete information to control behavior.

The rostral-caudal axis of LP operates according to abstraction principles, with gradients of domain-generality and temporal control over action. Interactions among LP subregions showed asymmetrical influences indicative of hierarchical processing under cognitive demands. Hierarchical orientation of midFC in fixed connectivity and top-down influences from rostral LP to midFC during engagement of cognitive control were positively related to higher-level ability. The functional organization of LP is tied to cognitive capacity, with top-down control within LP a determinant of higher-level function. Stronger asymmetrical projections from midFC to other LP regions were related to better-level ability, suggesting a beneficial effect of hierarchical organization with midFC at the apex.

LP interactions were examined by varying demands on domain and control, engaging most of LP for a comprehensive account of function. Progressively rostral areas processed abstract levels of control, with Feature, Context, and Temporal control eliciting increasingly rostral activations. Dynamic modeling showed asymmetries in connectivity strongest in midFC, with cognitive demands eliciting top-down influences from rostral to mid and bottom-up from caudal to mid. Effective connectivity and modulations suggest midFC forms a nexus where information converges to influence action. Collectively, results indicate LP is hierarchically organized, with midFC positioned to synthesize abstract and concrete information to control, and top-down control within LP important for higher-level function.
The hominoid-specific gene TBC1D has been found to play a crucial role in the generation of basal progenitors and cortical folding in mice. Expression of TBCD3 in ventricular cortical progenitors via in utero electroporation caused delamination of ventricular radial glial cells and promoted generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with morphology of outer radial glia, which are most abundant in primates. Downregulation of T1D3 in human brain slices decreased generation of outer radial glia. Localized proliferation resulting from in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of T1D3 often underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. T1 is required for outer radial glial generation regulating cortical expansion and folding. T1 promotes generation of outer radial cells in mice with high proliferative ability observed in primates accompanied by cortical folding. Human-specific ARHG11 has been shown to promote production of basal and cortical folding in electropated brain. T1 appeared earlier than ARHG11 during human evolution and acts as candidate controlling other genes in cortex and folding. Study provides proof that brain development can be regulated by duplicated genes during homoid evolution. Folding observed at regions containing electropated cells at postnatal and more pronounced at P7 suggesting cumulative effect of T1 on formation of gyrus cortical in mice. T expression in neurogenitors in utero at E13 caused reduced Trnp in flow cytometry-sorted cells at E15 indicating effect on intrinsic stemness pathways basal progenitors.
The activation of systemic acquired resistance in plants is associated with transcriptome reprogramming induced by the coactivator NPR1, which is facilitated by immune-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Research investigated the role of ubiquitination of NPR1 prior to proteasomal turnover, revealing that it is a progressive event where initial modification by Cullin-RING E3 ligase promotes chromatin association and expression of target genes. Polyubiquination of NPR1, enhanced by the E4 ligase UBE, targets it for proteasomal degradation, while ubiquitin ligase activities are opposed by UBP/7, two proteome-associated deubiquitinases that enhance NPR longevity. Immune-induced transcript reprogramming requires sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases balanced by opposing deubiquinases that fine-tune activity of NPR without strict requirement for sacrificial turnover. Loss of UBE largely uncouples NPR target gene expression from proteome activity, demonstrating the importance of progressive ubiquination for NPR activity. Initial CRL-mediated ubiquination is required for NPR to attain full transcriptional activity, while stepwise formation of ubiquitin chains mediated by UBE inactivates NPR and promotes degradation. Initial ubiquination boosts NPR transcriptional coactivator activity by enhancing promoter occupancy and potentially genomic mobility. The E4 ligase UBE extends pre-existing ubiquitin chains and has been implicated in degradation of NLR immune receptors. Prior to degradation, ubiquination acts as a transcription signal, providing a window for NPR to activate target genes. The study indicates ubiquitin chain and trimming activities fine-tune transcriptional outputs of unstable eukaryotic activators without requirement for sacrificial turnover. Ubiquination of NPR is a stepwise event requiring actions of CRL and E4 UBE, with CRL-mediated turnover preventing autoimmunity in absence of pathogen threat.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs guide cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes. The biogenesis of these 24nt siRNAs requires nuclear RNA polymerase IV, RNA-dependent RNAase 2, and DICER-like 3. Researchers identified Pol IV and RDR-dependent RNAs that accumulate in dcl mutants and are diced into 24nt RNAs by DCL in vitro. These P4 RNAs are mostly 26-45nt and initiate with a purine adjacent to pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. R2 terminal transferase activity demonstrated in vitro may account for non-templated nucleotides at P4 RNA 3 termini. The 24 siAs primarily correspond to the 5 or 3 ends of P4As, suggesting a model where siAs are generated from either end of P4 duplexes by single dicing events. Sequence features of 24 siAs and P RNAs show frequencies at which the four nucleotides are present at the 5 terminus of 20-25 small RNAs in wild-type plants or the 5i of PAs in d2d3d4 triple mutants. Pol and R2 are each essential for biogenesis of 24 siAs and physically associate in Arabidopsis and maize. Dozens of PAs can overlap at a given locus but individual PAs represent Pol-R2 transcription units. Data indicate short-stranded PAs in d3 mutants are immediate precursors of siAs based on ability of D3 to cut precursors into 24As in vitro. Browser views of si loci show PAs accumulate in d2d3d4 mutants observed in wild-type plants but not in Pol or R2 mutants. si signals reduced upon ribonuclease digestion yet unaffected by ribuclease suggesting si pool exists double-stranded. PAs in d2/3 triple mutants are substrates for D3 and RNA isolated from d2/3 mutant incubated with FLAG-D3 had affinity-purified from transgenic plants using anti-FLAG resin.
Mature neural networks synchronize and integrate spatiotemporal activity to support cognition, with the emergence of these patterns and functions believed to be developmentally regulated. However, the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations remains unknown. Research using high spatiemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice reveals that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. This transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. A similar developmental trajectory is demonstrated in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that facilitates a transition in network operation. The transient quiescent period is hypothesized to be requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated networks. The transition between immature and mature dynamics is marked by decreased cellular and synaptic activity at the beginning of the second week, followed by the emergence of precise synchronization and oscillatory coupling in space and time. Multiple cognitive functions emerge during early development, with neural networks enabling precise spatiotemporal coordination of synaptic and cellular activity in mature brain functions. The maturation of network dynamics is preceded by a discrete quiescent evolutionally conserved period during postnatal development, with oscillations and spiking displaying a nadir signaling a shift from local, loosely correlated, sensory-driven patterns to internally organized, spatially, temporally precise activity. Immature patterns disappearance herald the emergence of advanced network properties, with dramatic changes in anatomical and functional connectivity and synaptogenesis in superficial layers. Neural spiking is recruited to oscillatory activity with strong phase-locking and temporal precision, characteristic of adult networks in information processing, indicating a transient developmental perturbation as an evolution conserved indicator of a shift in network operations.
The population structure of multi-copy antigen-encoding genes in Plasmodium falciparum is a complex issue with significant implications for epidemiology and control. An agent-based model has been developed to extend earlier strain theory by addressing the var gene family of Plasium falciparum, considering the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation via sequential, mutually exclusive expression. The model tracks the dynamics of unique repertoires in a population of hosts and shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition mediated through cross-immunity structures the parasite into a subset of coexisting repires of var genes whose degree of antigen overlap depends on transmission intensity. Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigen and neutral sites supports the role of immune selection in structuring parasite diversity. The model considers the effects of immune selection in populations of pathogens whose antigen-encoding loci are multi-copy and recombining, exploring whether structured populations resulting from selection pressures exerted by competition among distinct repires for hosts, mediated by cross-immunity, can emerge. Mathematical models have demonstrated that immune selection can lead to the maintenance of discrete, non-overlapping antigenic repires, even when antigen variability is driven by several unlinked genes that undergo recombination. The var model suggests control strategies that reduce transmission will not drastically reduce gene diversity, as a reservoir of parasite genomes with diverse repires remains. The agent-based model extends strain theory to address the effect of immune acting on multi-copy genes using var family of Plasmodium falcum as the basis, encoding Plasmodium falcum erythrocyte membrane protein, the major surface antigen of parasite's blood stages binding host endothelial receptors allowing sequest within host tissues.
Deamidation of a glutamine residue in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 by the enteric bacteria Shigella flexneri deamase Osp converts it to glutamate, resulting in the silencing of polyubiquination activity in complex with the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase TRAF6 and the downstream NFκB inflammatory response. The precise role of deamation in silencing the U13/TRAF complex involves disrupting the interaction between U13 and TR6 RING-domain by perturbing native and transient interactions. Deamation creates a new intramolecular salt-bridge in U13 that competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge at the native U13/TR6 interface, preventing transient interactions necessary to form a typical U13/RING complex. Additionally, repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and the negatively charged surface of RING prevents transient interactions in the U13/RING complex. This post-translational modification perturbs the conformation and stability of transient complexes to inhibit protein-protein association. The Shigella flexi effector OI suppresses the inflammatory NF-κ pathway via deamation of U13 at Q100, inhibiting synthesis of K63-linked polyubitin chains by the U13/TR6 complex and preventing NF-κ activation. Q100 is present at the U13/TR6 interface but does not form direct contact with TR6, serving as a scaffold for TAK2 and IK kinases, leading to phosphorylation and activation of IK kinases, Iκ degradation, and nuclear translocation of transcription N-κ. OI functions as a deamase targeting glutamine in U13, converting it to glutamate. Deation inhibits U13 binding to TR6 and longer dimer TR6, confirming secondary interactions between Ub/RING or Ub/zincfinger cannot compensate the loss of primary E/RING interaction. Unlike RKIP, deamation does not alter U13 fold, with intramolecular salt-bridges competing intermolecular salt-bridge in U13. Hotspots and electrostatic substitutions at the interface can increase protein-protein affinity, shifting the equilibrium between native and transient complexes. Deam disrupts U13/TR interaction by three mechanisms: creating a new intramolecular R/E100 salt-bridge, pertbing U13/TR transient complexes, and repulsion between negatively charged E100 and TR interface.
Researchers investigated the effects of activating and inactivating cortical interneurons, specifically somatostatin-positive (Sst+) and parvalbumin-positive (Pb+) interneurons, in the auditory cortex of awake mice. Using optogenetic manipulation and single-unit recordings, they found that inactivation of S+ interurons increased response gain, while inactivation of P+ interurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer, suggesting these neurons support distinct functions. However, activating S+ and P+ interurons revealed no differences. A network model was used to understand this asymmetry, showing that small changes in parameters such as spontaneous activity or manipulation strength determined whether activation and inactivation produced consistent or paradoxical conclusions regarding interneuron functions. Inactivation of S+ interurons increased response, while inactivation of P+ interurons weakened tuning and decreased transfer, implying specific functions in the auditory cortex. Activating S+ and P+ interurons showed no differences. The study tested the assumption that causal data can be interpreted in a straightforward way by manipulating S+ or P+ interurons while recording neural responses to tones in the auditory cortex. A linear framework was applied to frequency-tuning curves of units from Ch2/S and Ch2 mice, excluding units suppressed by more than 80% and including narrow-spiking and broad-spiking units. Stimulus preferences of interneurons are important for determining output, with P+ cells activated by a broad set of tones and S+ responding to a narrower range. Comparing a neuron's frequency-tuning curve in light-on versus light-off conditions revealed whether the change in firing fit a multiplicative, divisive, additive, or combination model.
Researchers investigated the role of oscillatory synchronization in working memory, a cognitive function that emerges from large-scale network interactions, by applying transcranial alternating current stimulation to modulate oscillatory activity in the right frontoparietal network. Externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high, with simultaneously collected fMRI data revealing stimulation effects dependent on phase and internal processing state. Synchronous stimulation during verbal tasks increased parietal activity, correlating with behavioral performance, while functional connectivity results showed frontopari phase influences information flow within the network. The study aimed to provide causal evidence for oscillatory synchronization's role in demanding working memory, investigating neural mechanisms by which frontopari phase influences verbal working memory through two experiments using transcranial current stimulation to entrain endogenous rhythms. Findings indicate a direct link between behavioral performance in demanding working-memory tasks and large-scale synchronization across the rightopari network, demonstrating manipulations of phase modulate underlying brain activity and influence long-range connectivity in phase and state-dependent manner. Hypotheses tested included enhancement of behavioral performance by entraining synchronous activity, phase-dependent modulation of regional brain activity, correlation of BOLD changes with performance, and phase-dependent modulation of functional connectivity. Results showed front interactions increased with synchronous stimulation and posterior interactions with desynchronous stimulation, indicating information flow through brain regions can be differentially affected by phase. Synchronous stimulation caused improvement and increased frontopari activity when demands were high, demonstrating external manipulations of large-scale synchronization shape activity and connectivity within networks, detectable by fMRI. Overall, findings demonstrate a link between behavioral performance in demanding working-memory tasks and large-scale synchronization, providing a direct demonstration of phase synchronization's role in cognitive processes and associated neural correlates.
Embryonic polarity in in invertebrates, amphibians, and fish is specified by maternal determinants that fix cell fates early in development, whereas amniote embryos remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. In chick embryos, the earliest known factor is cV1, a transforming growth factor beta signal expressed posteriorly before gastrulation. A molecular screen to find upstream regulators of cV1 in normal and manipulated embryos to form twins uncovers the transcription factor Pitx as a candidate. Pitx is essential for axis formation and acts as a direct regulator of cV1 expression by binding to enhancers within neighboring genes. Pitx, Vg/GDF, and Nodal are key actors in left-right asymmetry, suggesting the same ancient polarity mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution. 

In most invertebrates and anamni vertebrates, embryonic polarity is established by localisation of maternal determinants in cytoplasm and/or cortex of fertilized egg, generating differences between blastomeres that form by cell division, culminating in orientation of embryonic axes. Higher vertebrate embryos retain regulative development until late stages, suggesting localization of maternally inherited determinants is not essential for specifying embryo polarity. The transcription factor Pitx regulates position of embryonic axis, embryonic regulation, and twinning. Pitx is a good candidate for upstream regulator of c1, a transcription factor expressed in same domain as c1 in whole embryos, bisected marginal zone, and before c1. Time-course expression of Pitx in whole embryos, isolated halves, and comparison with c1 shows Pitx is essential for axis formation, acting as direct regulator of c1. Results implicate Pitx as earliest gene regulating position of embryonic axis and twinning.
Temporal experience of odor gradients is crucial for spatial orientation in animals, and the fruit fly Drosophila melanaster exhibits robust odor-guided behaviors in odor fields. To investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variations of olfactory stimuli, researchers subjected flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and projection neurons (PNs). A significant transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns was found, with PN output strongly signaling OS spike rate and its rate of change. A two-dimensional model admitting OS spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted PN output. When cascaded with rate-change encoding by OSNs, PNs primarily signal acceleration and rate of change of dynamic stimuli to higher brain centers, enabling animals to respond reliably to onsets of concentrations.

PNs relay olfactory information to higher centers such as the mushroom body and lateral horn. Recent studies reported Drosila OSNs encode not only odor concentration but also its rate of change as a function of time. Building on this, researchers asked how PNs contribute to internal representations of dynamic olfactory environments. First and second-order neurons in Drosila olfactory system were tested with varying concentrations, constructing a 2D model for temporal olfactory processing. The 2D nonlinearity and low prediction error supported the hypothesis that PN rate is strongly dependent on rate of change of feedforward OS input.

Detecting encountered odor plumes is crucial for flying insects before drifting relative to adjacent plumes. Dros early olfactory system signals acceleration of concentrations to higher centers, allowing detection at an early phase. Studies investigated dynamic stimuli in early olfactory systems, observing temporal processing of signals. Researchers hypothesize acceleration encoding in Dros antennal lobe allows higher centers to respond to onsets of slowly rising stimuli. A cascade of rate-change encodings leads to rapid detection, advancing peak time near stimulus onset in response to triangle-shaped input. This mechanism enables animals to detect onsets of odor concentrations, crucial for orientation in dynamic environments.
In flowering plants, seed development is initiated by the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with two paternal cells, leading to the formation of the embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilization products are surrounded by a maternally derived seed coat, whose development prior to fertilization is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group protein family. Research has shown that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin, likely exported to maternal tissues, which drives seed coat development by removing Polycomb function. Mutants of the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have impaired transport of auxin from endosperm to integuments, resulting in seed abortion. AGL regulates auxin transport from endosperm to integuments, leading to removal of Polycomb block on seed development. Data suggests production of auxin in developing endosperm is the trigger for seed coat development. AGL62 mutants abort early after fertilization, correlating with endosperm cellularization and failure to develop a seed coat. A dual role for post-fertilization auxin production is proposed, driving endosperm and seed development. AGL, like auxin, is involved in mediating endosperm and seed developmental pathways. Multiple lines of evidence support this hypothesis, including auxin accumulation in integuments after fertilization, impaired auxin biosynthesis in endosperm causing seed coat defects, and ovules producing auxin ectopically in central cell initiating seed development without fertilization. Failure of seed development in AGL mutants correlates with failure of auxin transport. The seed-initiation signal is generated in fertilized central/endosperm, requiring auxin production and transport to ovule integuments in AGL-dependent manner. Fertilization of central cell results in auxin production, exported to integuments, lifting Polycomb block, allowing cell elongation and differentiation, dependent on AGL activity. AGL seeds fail to export auxin from endosperm, leading to accumulation and failure to develop seed coat.
The interaction between a bacteriophage and its host is mediated by the phage's receptor binding protein, and despite its fundamental role in governing phage activity and host range, the molecular rules of receptor binding protein function remain a mystery. Researchers systematically dissected the functional role of every residue in the tip of the T7 phage receptor binding protein domain by developing a high-throughput, locus-specific phage engineering method, creating 166 variants. This dataset allowed comparison of functional profiles across hosts to identify regions of importance, many previously unknown. Substitution patterns showed host-specific differences in position and physicochemical properties, revealing molecular adaptation to individual hosts. Gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constrict variants that eliminated certain hosts were discovered. Engineered T7 variants against urinary tract pathogens demonstrated therapeutic utility, presenting a framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in phage-bacterial systems.

A high-throughput locus-specific phage engineering method, ORACLE, was developed to create a large unbiased library of phage variants at a targeted locus. Using ORACLE, the tip domain was comprehensively mutated, making single amino acid substitutions at every site, and the functional role of variants on multiple hosts was quantified. High-resolution maps were generated, delineating regions with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific patterns, many previously unknown. T7 variants with greater virulence than wildtype T7 were discovered, demonstrating natural phages can be engineered for higher efficacy. Results indicate ORACLE can generate phage variants superior to wildtype, potential starting points for engineering therapeutic phages. Further experiments are required to assess in vivo efficacy of T7 variants.

Most phages selectively target a narrow range of hosts, unable to infect closely related hosts, suggesting directionality to phage-bacterial interactions and orientational bias of the tip with respect to the bacterial surface. Key lessons from host screens include single amino substitutions generating broad functional diversity, highlighting evolutionary adaptability of the receptor binding protein. Engineered T7 variants avert emergence of spontaneous resistance in pathogenic Escherichia coli urinary tract infections, explaining molecular drivers of adaptability of the domain and key regions determining activity and host range. The study presents a framework for characterizing sequence-function relationships in many phage-bacterial systems and demonstrates therapeutic utility of engineered T7 variants against urinary pathogens.
Individuals with congenital amusia have a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing and tend to downweight pitch cues during speech perception, instead relying on other dimensions such as duration. A study investigated the neural basis of this strategy using fMRI, where 15 individuals with amusia and 15 controls read sentences with a comma indicating a grammatical boundary and then selected the best match from two spoken sentences differing in pitch and/or duration cues. Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amus group between left prefrontal language-related and right hemisphere pitch-related regions, reflecting between-group differences in cue weights. Connectivity differences were not present during a control task. Results indicate the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked to functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions, suggesting a compensatory mechanism. Individuals with amus exhibited decreased connectivity between frontal areas and right hemisphere pitch-related regions, consistent with prior findings that they rely less on pitch to process spoken language. The study used a whole-brain-driven approach to examine differences in functional connectivity during speech encoding in pitch-related tasks, finding right hemisphere areas are less integrated with frontal regions when processing speech and language. Null results for group differences in activation during speech processing are consistent with prior reports that amus and controls do not differ in pitch representations within sensory regions. Brain encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli is unimpaired in individuals with amia, suggesting amus neglect pitch due to implicit learning of unreliable pitch memory, reflected in decreased connectivity between auditory and task-relevant areas integrating perceptual information.
Devil Facial Tumour 2 (D2) is a recently discovered contagious cancer affecting the Tasman devil, a species that already harbors another contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tum 1 (D1). In contrast to D1, D2 cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, indicating that loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of contagious cancer. However, the highly expressed MHC class I alleles in D2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenicity in the population sharing these alleles. D2 cells express classical and non-classical MHC I molecules both in vitro and in vivo, unlike D1, which has lost MHC I expression. The dominantly expressed MHC I allele in D2 is shared with host devils, and MHC I expression varies among D2 tumors in vivo, suggesting MHC I negative subclones could emerge as D2 transmits more widely. The similarity of MHC I alleles between D2 and devils may reflect a shared geographical and genotype pool to the cancer's founder, and the frequency of this allele among the population may impact D2 spread. Heterogenic expression of MHC molecules in D2 biopsies suggests MHC expression is not fixed and may be gradually lost in D2. The study proposes contagious cancers exploit histocompatibility between tumor and host, but loss of allogenic antigens could facilitate D2 transmission. The immune response to D2 and its role in tumor evolution requires further analysis, and it is possible D1 downregulated MHC I expression after becoming transmissible, with initial transmission among individuals sharing MHC I alleles. Overall, D2 reveals a mechanism for the emergence of contagious cancer, with partial histocompatibility between tumor and host and potential loss of allogenic antigens facilitating transmission.
The granular retrosplenial cortex (R) is crucial for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the underlying neural codes remain poorly understood. Research using optogenetic mapping in mice reveals a dissociation allowing parallel circuits in superficial R to process disparate inputs. The anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum, sources of spatial information, strongly recruit low-threshold (LR) pyramidal cells in R, while regular-spiking (RS) cells are preferentially controlled by claustral and anterior cing inputs, sources of non-spatial information. Precise sublaminar axonal and dendritic arborization within R layer 1 permits parallel processing. Thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable computational models of LR neurons to compute the speed of head rotation despite receiving head direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed. Parallel streams identify a distinct neuronal subtype positioned to support spatial computations in R. LR neurons receive directional and spatial inputs from the anterior thalam and subiculum. Synaptic dynamics of thamic inputs to cells give rise to coding of angular speed in cells. Anterior thalam and dorsal subiculum control LR neurons, while claustrum and anterior cing control RS cells. Synaptic dynamics of thamic inputs allow robust encoding of angular speed by cell models, though inputs contain information about head direction, not speed. Layer 3 of R contains two types of pyramidal neurons: low-threshold and regular-spiking. Distinct morphology and intrinsic properties of LR neurons make them suited to integrate head input from thalam and spatial inputs from hippocal formation via subiculum. Integration of directional and distance information is key function of retrosial as whole.
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a prominent risk factor for dementias including tauopathies like chronic traumatic encephalopathy (TE). The mechanisms that promote prion-like spreading of Tau aggregates after TBI are not fully understood, in part due to lack of tractable animal models. Researchers have introduced a 'tauopathy reporter' zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded Tau biosensor that reliably reports accumulation of human Tau species when seeded via intraventric brain injections. Subjecting zebrafish larvae to a novel TBI paradigm produced various TBI features including cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. The application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death, suggesting a role for seizure activity in the prion-like seeding and spreading of tau following TBI. Zebfish larvae offer a potent complement to rodent models of TBI and cellular models of tauopathy, allowing the revelation of post-traumatic seizures as a drable mechanistic link between TBI and prion progression of tauopathy. Neuronal excitability and seizure activity after TBI can play a role in accelerating the dissemination of Tau pathology. A novel in vivo biosensor in zebish visualizes pathological spreading and accumulation within the intact CNS, revealing a substantial burst of neural activity during TBI and a higher propensity for spontaneous seizures in zebfish exposed to TBI. TBI induces Tau aggregates in the Tau biosensor model and post-traumatic seizures correlate with spreading pathology. Manipulating seizure activity mitigates Tau aggregation, revealing a critical role for endocytosis in the prion spread of seeds in vivo. The results implicate seizures and dyn-dependent endocytosis in the spread of Tau, offering potential therapeutic targets. The study suggests anti-convants that dampen post-traumatic seizures as a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy.
Brain connectivity is often considered in terms of communication between functionally distinct brain regions, with many studies investigating the extent to which patterns of coupling between neural populations relate to behavior. The spatial arrangement of cortical regions interacts with measures of brain connectivity, and the shape and location of brain regions strongly influence the modeling of connectivity. The spatial arrangement of functional regions is predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle. Cross-subject variations in the spatial configuration of brain regions are often interpreted as changes in functional connectivity, highlighting the importance of understanding these effects when interpreting the relationship between functional imaging and cognitive traits. Interactions between neural populations and the spatial configuration of regions influence functional connectivity, with resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealing complex patterns of functional connectivity through spontaneous fluctuations in distinct brain regions. The organization of the brain into large-scale networks has been extensively investigated over the past decades, with significant advances made to tackle the issue of spatial misalignment across individuals. Partial canonical correlation analysis results show network matrices contain little unique trait-level cross-subject information not reflected in spatial organization, implying cross-subject information in commonly adopted connectivity fingerprints largely reflects spatial variability in location rather than coupling strength. The spatial arrangement of brain regions interacts with measures of connectivity and is predictive of behavior and lifestyle, emphasizing the need to disambiguate the influence of spatial topography to enable estimation of fMRI measures that uniquely reflect coupling strength between neural populations. Understanding these effects is crucial for interpreting the relationship between functional imaging and cognitive traits, as cross-subject variations in spatial configuration are often misinterpreted as changes in functional connectivity. Recent studies have used functional fingerprints to characterize individuals' brain activity, but evidence suggests these may reflect spatial variability in location rather than coupling, highlighting the need for a better understanding of these effects to accurately interpret functional data and cognitive traits.
Researchers investigated the role of TBP and TBP2 in the transcriptional regulation of muscle-specific genes in skeletal cells, as previous studies suggested that replacement of the canonical TFIID-TBP complex with TRF3/TBP is required for muscle gene expression. However, TBP null mice did not exhibit a developmental phenotype, prompting further analysis of TBP's role in adult myogenesis. Results showed TBP null mice have intact muscle regeneration potential upon injury and TBP is not expressed in C2C12 muscle cells or primary muscle stem cells. TFIID subunits and TBP are downregulated during myoblast differentiation, but reduced amounts of these proteins form a complex detectable on muscle gene promoters, essential for their expression, indicating TBP does not replace TBP during differentiation. TBP is the essential component of the pre-initiation complex that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated muscles. TBP2 is not expressed in myotubes derived from C2C12 myoblasts or primary muscle stem cells and TBP-deficient mice displayed intact regeneration potential. Muscle stem cells isolated from TBP-deficient muscles differentiated into myotubes with the same efficiency as wild-type cells. TBP expression was detected in muscle-derived myotubes and C2 myotubes. The requirement of TBP for muscle differentiation and absence of T2 in myotubes suggests the TFI complex may drive gene transcription during myoblast differentiation. Expression of TAF subunits of TFI complex was detected in C12 myoblast and myot at RNA and protein levels. Comparable numbers of muscle stem cells were found in wild-type and TBP null mice 12 days after injury, indicating an intact capacity for self-renewal and differentiation during muscle regeneration in the absence of T2. These findings demonstrate that TBP, not T2, is essential for muscle gene expression and T2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation, limiting amounts of TFI-TBP required to promote muscle-specific expression.
Researchers investigated the effects of targeted cortical reorganization using optogenetics in non-human primates, specifically examining how brain stimulation modulates the excitability of neural circuits and drives neuroplasticity. A large-scale optogenetic interface enabled simultaneous stimulation of excitatory neurons and electrocortic recording across primary somatosensory and motor cortex in macaques. The study tracked two measures of network connectivity, the response to focal stimulation and the coherence between electrodes, which were strongly correlated before stimulation. Stimulation in primary somatosensory or motor areas significantly strengthened functional connectivity between these areas within minutes. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous changes across the network, reflecting correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity consistent with Hebbian plasticity models. The findings demonstrate a relationship between stimulus-evoked correlations and changes in baseline connectivity across the network, explained by a Heian model of large-scale stimulation-induced plasticity. Stimulation-evoked activity drives large-scale plasticity in a Heian manner, informing future neurorehabilitation strategies. A large-scale optogen interface enabled simultaneous stimulation of populations of excitatory neurons while recording large-scale electrocortic activity across brain areas, establishing two measures of functional connectivity providing complementary views of mechanisms of plasticity. Hebb rules explain synaptic plasticity, and large-scale-induced changes are consistent with Hebbianity, comparing correlations directly induced by stimulation with changes in network correlations after conditioning. The ability to record artifact-free signals during stimulation allowed this test, supporting a role for Hebb learning in sensorimotor corticality. The large-scale interface enabled robust estimation of functional connectivity and stimulation-evoked correlations, extending Hebb models to large circuits with implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation.
A rare case of a Rhesus macaque monkey, likely born without primary visual cortex V1, was studied to understand the neural consequences of such damage on visual perception. Despite the absence of V1, the monkey's behavior was unremarkable, but visual task performance was impaired. Multimodal magnetic resonance imaging showed that visual structures outside the lesion appeared normal. Visual stimulation under anesthesia with checkerboards activated the lateral geniculate nucleus, while full-field moving dots activated the pulvinar. Cortical activation was sparse but included face patches, consistently across lesion and control monkeys, functional analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even without V1. Despite robust subcortical responses to visual stimulation, there was little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual function or blindsight phenomena. The monkey's visual structures, both cortical and subcortical, outside the large lesion of primary cortex remained intact, with little evidence of atrophy, suggesting a role in residual function consistent with an intact network of extrastriate cortical areas comparable to control monkeys. The structural connectivity between subcortical regions and area V5MT was weak, but the microstructure was intact. No significant V5MT activation was found in the monkey to either checkerboard or moving stimuli, however, connectivity analysis revealed a network of cortical areas showing similar BOLD response over time to V5MT. Foci of activation in the region of V5MT in dorsal STS of both hemispheres suggested possible subthreshold activation, difficult to detect with BOLD. Retinal information may reach dorsal areas via weak pathways LGN and pulvinar, but lack of consistent cortex activation possibly due to anesthesia made this difficult to confirm. The lack of differences between monkey and controls in pathways LGN-V5MT and pulvin-V5MT suggested either could support residual abilities. Overall, an intact extrastriate visual network was preserved in the monkey despite substantial naturally occurring damage to primary visual cortex.
The innate immune sensor IFI16 recognizes foreign DNA in the nucleus by scanning along the duplex. The ability to recognize double-stranded DNA of pathogenic origin in the intracellular environment is an essential defense mechanism of the human immune system. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying distinction between foreign DNA and host material inside the nucleus are not understood. By combining biochemical assays and single-molecule techniques, researchers show that the nuclear immune sensor IF16 one-dimensionally tracks long stretches of exposed foreign dsDNA to assemble supramolecular platforms. Nucleosomes represent barriers that prevent IF16 from targeting host DNA directly by interfering these one-dimensional movements. This unique scanning-assisted mechanism allows IF16 to distinguish friend from foe and assemble oligomers efficiently on foreign DNA. The interferon-inducible protein 16 is a key innate sensor detecting foreign DNA and uses it as a scaffold to assemble signaling platforms in the nucleus and cytoplasm. IF16 plays a central role in defense against pathogens such as herpes simplex-1. Researchers report the observation of a unifying mechanism explaining how IF16 resolves central issues in initiating foreign-DNA pathways. IF16 assembles faster on longer DNA composed of functional domains flanked unstructured linkers, namely pyrin domain and two DNA-binding domains. The 1-diffusion assembly plays a role regulating IF16 immune responses. Chromation acts a key feature allowing IF16 distinguish host from foreign DNA in the nucleus. By time-resolved bulk and single-molecule assays demonstrate IF16 scans exposed DNA assemble distinct clusters and chromation inhibits targeting host DNA for assembly. In vivo this mechanism allows a number of IF16 molecules to allocate large genomes of invading pathogens. The molecular mechanism by which innate sensors distinguish self from foreign DNA has been a major question in immunology. Using time-resolved bulk and single-molecule assays demonstrate IF16 scans along DNA assemble distinct clusters that chromation sufficient inhibit targeting host DNA for assembly.
Spatially Targeted Optical Microproteomics (STOMP) is a novel proteomics technique that allows for the interrogation of micron-scale regions of interest in mammalian tissue without the need for genetic manipulation. Methanol or formalin-fixed specimens are stained with fluorescent dyes or antibodies to visualize regions of interest, then soaked in solutions containing a photo-tag, 4-benzoylbenzyl-gly-hexahidine. Confocal imaging with two-photon excitation is used to covalently couple photo-tags to all proteins within the region of interest to a resolution of 0.67µm in the xy-plane and 1.48µm axially. After solubilization, photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. The technique was tested on amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model and post-mortem AD case, confirming known plaque constituents and discovering new ones. STOMP can be applied to various samples including cell lines, primary cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and post-mortem tissue.

Gel electrophoresis of indiscrimately tagged proteins reveals a different pattern of protein bands compared to specimens where amyloid plaques were specifically targeted for STOMP analysis. The volume of tissue needed for photo-tagging depends on instrument sensitivity, fixation method, sample complexity, and other factors. A semi-automated technique, STOMP combines two-photon laser microscopy with photochemical labeling and mass spectrometry. Two-photon excitation drives microscopic 3D-resolved photochemistry. The predominant protein tagged in STOMP sample is Aβ, which is not visible in non-plaque due to low abundance. The photo-tagging procedure uses two-photon microscopy rather than conventional confocal microscopy. STOMP offers single-micron three-dimensional resolution, an order of magnitude better than current state of the art.

Laser from microscope is used to image fluorescently stained specimen and photochemically crosslink purification ligands to protein components within pathological deposits. The photo-ligand used is a peptide sequence 4-benzlbenz-Gly-His-His-His-His-His-CON2. Benzoylbenzene forms covalent bonds with CH and NH groups upon excitation. STOMP provides clues to etiology of neurodegenerative disease, advancing research in cell biology by yielding composition of small features not amenable to biochemical purification. The technique has potential for various applications including cell lines, primary cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and post-mortem tissue. STOMP represents the first application of two-photon to photolabeling, offering high resolution and sensitivity.
The Frizzled3 (Fz3) gene plays a crucial role in controlling axonal development in distinct populations of cranial and spinal neurons. Disruption of the F3 gene leads to defects in axonal growth in the VIIth and XIIth cranial nerves, the phrenic nerve, and the dorsal nerve in fore- and hindlimbs. In F3−/− limbs, dorsal axons stall at a precise location in the nerve plexus and do not reroute to other trajectories. Affected motor neurons undergo cell death 2 days prior to the normal wave of developmental cell death that coincides with innervation of muscle targets, indicating that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. The absence of F3 leads to a specific stalling defect among LM axons in the limb, distinct from phenotypes produced by defects in other signaling systems in axon guidance. Affected cranial and spinal neurons die shortly after axons stall, providing in vivo evidence that growing axons arrive at intermediate essential survival signals are relayed to cell bodies. The primary cause of motoron deficiency in F3/− mice is not defective neuron differentiation or excessive neuron death, but rather defective axon growth and guidance. The majority of F3/ motorons do not follow erroneous trajectories, and aberrant pathfinding is unlikely to be relevant. A wave of precocious motor death is observed in F3 embryos at E11.5-12.5, which is not seen in F controls, indicating a subset of neurons exhibits axon growth and apoptotic death. Controlling axonal growth may be the only function of F3 in neurons, as F3 and Cels brains have identical defects in multiple ax tracts and F3, Cels, and Vangl spinal cords have the same rostral turning defect in commissural axons of dorsal sensory neurons. Planar cell polarity signaling is implicated in motoron growth, highlighting the question of how PC proteins, which form cell-cell complexes in epithelia, function in the context of axonal growth.
Researchers investigated the role of transposable elements (TEs) as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells, as they are thought to have helped establish gene regulatory networks in both embryonic and extraembryonic lineages of the early embryo. Epigenomic and transcriptomic data suggested a large number of TEs contribute to tissue-specific gene expression, and genetic editing of individual TEs confirmed a subset of these regulatory relationships. However, CRISPR interference of RLTR13D elements in embryonic stem cells revealed only a minority play significant roles in gene regulation. The results indicate a subset of TEs are important for regulation in early mouse development and highlight the importance of functional experiments when evaluating gene roles of TEs. Some TEs play minor or no role in regulation despite strong correlative evidence at chromatin composition and conformation. CRISPR interference targeted RL13D elements showed TE enhancers may support lineage expression of a subset of genes, but correlations may emerge without causal links between TEs and expression. CRPR-mediated excision of selected TEs validated the effect of some TE enhancers on expression. Genetic editing of two RLTRD elements showed little effect on neighboring gene expression. The study used genetic and epigen editing approaches to test TE function in ESCs and TSCs and compared with epigen and transcript data, identifying TEs driving expression of lineage genes. Extensive work is necessary to evaluate the proportion of TE enhancers acting redundantly with regulatory elements, contrasting with epigen editing work showing LTRs play roles in human carcinoma cells.
C4 photosynthesis has evolved independently from the ancestral C3 pathway in at least 60 plant lineages, but the evolutionary path to this complex trait is unclear. A meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C4, or intermediate C3-C4 forms of photosynthesis was conducted to parameterise a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape, revealing diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. A novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model was developed and experimentally verified to predict how the C4 phenotype evolved. The results show that the polyphyletic appearance of C4 photosynthesis is associated with alternative evolutionary histories underlying the appearance of C photosynthesis determined by ancestral and initial phenotypic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis. The order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers, facilitating the convergent evolution of this complex trait.

The emergence of the entire C4 phenotype cannot be comprehensively explored experimentally, making C4 photosynthesis an ideal for mathematical modelling of complex trait evolution transitions on an underlying phenotype landscape. Distinct sub-types evolved as a consequence of alternative histories in response to non-photosynthetic pressures, with early events determining downstream phenotypes of C sub-types by restricting lineages to pathways. Mechanistic diversity underlies multiple pathways generating C4 photosynthesis, facilitating convergent evolution of complex traits. This may aid efforts to recapitulate C4 through genetic engineering of C3 species, expanding the molecular toolbox to establish C traits in distinct backgrounds.

Cellular alterations are acquired early in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, consistent with observations from several genera. Including additional traits in the analysis did not alter the predicted order, suggesting conclusions are robust. Ancestral lineage and initial phenic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis determine the evolutionary paths to C4 photosynthesis. Non-photosynthetic pressures drive the convergent evolution of the C4 trait. The study provides insights into the evolution of one of the most complex traits to arise in multiple lineages, C4 photosynthesis, using a predictive Bayesian approach to infer evolutionary trajectories from sparsely sampled data. The results have implications for understanding the evolution of complex traits and potential applications in genetic engineering.
Researchers investigated the bacterial cytoskeletal protein SpoIVA, which hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during Bacillus subtilis sporulation, and evolved from a TRAF class P-loop GTPase. To understand the evolutionary pressure driving the change in nucleotide specificity, they reengineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTP activity. SpoIVAGase functioned properly as a Gase but failed to polymerize due to not forming an NDP-bound intermediate required for polymerization. Incubation of SpoAGase with limiting ATP did not promote polymerization, revealing the nucleotide base, in addition to energy from hydrolysis, is critical for specific functions. Data suggests increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation drove the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA. SpoAGase, functional in vivo, used ATP or GTP to induce a conformational change after hydrolysis but only polymerized in the presence of ATP, indicating a specific requirement for the nucleotide base. Physiological levels of intracellular ATP facilitated conformation changes in SpoIVA and SpoAGase. Both failed hydrolysis-mediated changes in 0.06mM GTP but occurred in 1.5mM ATP. Examination of Spo polymerization at different ATP concentrations showed neither Spo nor SpoAGase polymerized in 0mM ATP. SpoIVA is derived from an Era-like GTP, a pan-bacterial ribosomal maturation protein belonging the TRAC class P-loop GTP. SpoAGase promiscuously hydrolyzed ATP and GTP functioned similar to extant SpoIVA in vivo, leading to questions on why the protein evolved further. The study reveals the importance of nucleotide base in biological functions beyond energy release from hydrolysis.
Leptin plays a crucial role in regulating energy balance and exhibits neurotrophic effects during critical developmental periods, but its function during development is not fully understood. To investigate the importance of leptin in early life, researchers restored leptin signaling at the fourth or tenth week of age in mice lacking the leptin receptor gene and found some previously irreversible defects, including poor development of arcuate neural projections, were recovered in adulthood. However, early leptin deficiency led to irreversible obesity via suppressed energy expenditure. Reactivation of leptin in adulthood resulted in persistent reduction of hypothalamic Pomc, Cart, and Prlh mRNA expression and defects in reproductive and brain growth. Early leptin signaling defects cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems. Changes in leptin during development affect neural circuits regulating homeostasis, favoring metabolic diseases later in life. Early postnatal leptin blockage leads to long-term leptin resistance and susceptibility to diet-induced obesity. Lept or Lep deficiency results in reduced brain mass, disruption of projections from ARH neurons to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, behavioral and cognitive problems. Rodents exhibit a postnatal leptin surge between the first and second week not associated with fat or food intake. Findings indicate specific metabolic, neuroendocrine, developmental consequences arise from leptin absence in early life, contributing to understanding of metabolic programming in the context of childhood obesity.
Arabidopsis heterotrimeric G proteins, composed of the non-canonical G protein XLG2, the G protein AGB, and the G proteins AGG1 and AG2, regulate immunity by directly coupling to the FLS2 receptor. The FLS receptor perceives bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the cytoplasmic kinase BIK. In the pre-activation state, XLG2 interacts with FLS and BIK, and functions with AGB and AG1 to attenuate proteasome degradation of BIK, allowing optimum immune activation. Following activation by flg22, XL2 dissociates from AGB and is phosphorylated by BIK in the N terminus. The phosphorylated XL2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species by modulating the NAD oxidase RboD. Introduction of a transgenic copy of BIK restored fl22-triggered immune responses and disease resistance in x2 and ag1 mutants, demonstrating that a major function of the heterotrimer G is to maintain signaling competence of FLS-BIK in preactivation. The proteins dynamically interact with FLS-BIK during signaling and findings are consistent with observed defects in fl22-induced responses and RboD phosphorylation in G mutants. AGB is required for accumulation of BIK but not FLS and BAK. XL2 directly interacts with FLS and BIK to regulate FLS-mediated immunity, supporting that plant kinases fulfill roles of GPC by coupling to heterotrimer G. The proteins coupled to FLS complex are subject to multiple regulations during FLS signaling. The heterotrimer proteins formed by XL2, AGB, AG1, and AG2 attenuate proteasome degradation of BIK and P20. Regulation of BIK stability contributes to the role of heterotrimer proteins in fl22-induced responses. Phosphorylation of XL2 in N terminus enhances production of reactive oxygen species likely modulating NAD oxidase Rbo. The study demonstrates G proteins directly couple to FLS receptor and regulate signaling through pre and post-activation mechanisms.
The Arabidopsis circadian clock orchestrates gene regulation across the day-night cycle, generating a 24-hour rhythm through multiple feedback loops, but the robustness and coordination of the clock at the individual cell level and across the plant remains unclear. Researchers examined clock activity at the single cell level in Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant conditions, revealing robust single-cell oscillations that are desynchronized. Two waves of clock activity were observed, one going down and one up the root, with evidence of cell-to-cell coupling, particularly in the root tip. A model showed that cell-to-cell coupling and measured period differences between cells can generate the observed waves. The results reveal the spatial structure of the plant and suggest the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points, unlike the centralized mammalian clock. Single-cell data allowed estimation of coupling strength between cells and evidence of coupling, especially in the root tip. A model suggests observed period and cell-to-cell coupling can generate waves in gene expression, revealing the structure and robustness of the circadian system. However, results indicate the plant clock structure is more complicated, with a hierarchical model not explaining short oscillations in the root or wave of gene expression from the tip, supporting a decentralized model of clock coordination. Previous studies argued cellular oscillations are uncoupled, while others attempted to measure the clock at single-cell resolution but focused on specific parts for short periods. Using a reporter for the core gene CIRIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1, researchers examined the Arabidopsis clock across the whole plant at single-cell level over days. Coherent waves of expression suggested the plant signal could be coupled, estimating coupling using the Kuramoto parameter and technique developed for mammalian circadian cells. Damping of rhythms at the plant level is mainly due to desynchronization of oscillating cells with different periods, not noise or low molecule numbers. Two waves of gene expression were observed, up and down the root, with variable periods at each position causing desynchronization.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes speech in noisy environments where multiple speakers' voices mix together, focusing on adults with normal hearing who experience difficulties understanding speech in such settings. Despite having normal hearing, approximately 10% of patients visiting clinics report communication difficulties. The study found that the ability to understand speech in multi-talker environments varies widely among adults with normal hearing and can be predicted by neural responses to frequency modulation cues measured through ear EEG recordings. Combining neural processing, listening effort, and frequency modulation cues accounted for 78% of variability in multi-talker speech understanding. The study applied psychophysical and neurophysiological tests to identify biomarkers for poor speech intelligibility in adults with normal hearing, aiming to develop new diagnostic measures for those struggling in noisy environments. Results showed considerable individual variability in measures among subjects with normal hearing, but found a correlation between pupil function and speech intelligibility. Individuals with steeper pupil recruitment had more difficulty in multi-talker tasks, indicating a link between pupil change and speech threshold. The study aimed to develop objective markers for poor communication complaints in individuals with normal hearing, suggesting a strong association between psychophysical tests for frequency detection and speech-noise-intelligibility due to early auditory processing encoding. The correlation between low-level encoding and speech intelligibility may reflect a link between temporal processing fidelity and speech. The findings could inform the design of next-generation clinical tests for hidden hearing disorders, providing a battery of behavioral and physiological tests accounting for nearly 80% of variability in multi-talker speech intelligibility without linguistic cues.
Researchers have developed a method to non-invasively image single-cell blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels in the living retina using 15 kHz adaptive optics. The transparency of the mammalian eye allows for a non-invasive view of the microvessels of the retina, a part of the central nervous system. However, imperfections in the optics of the eye blur microscopic retinal capillaries and single cells flowing within, limiting evaluation of microvascular diseases that originate in capillaries. Measured flow ranged four orders of magnitude across the full spectrum of retinal diameters without surgery or contrast. The ultrafast imaging pipeline and automated measurement of millions of blood speeds enabled high-throughput measurement of hundreds of thousands of cells per second. Single-cell velocity and flow in the smallest to largest vessels in the mouse retina was enabled by ALO imaging with ultrafast capture to noninively image cells without foreign agents. Pairing this novel imaging with an automated workflow enabled quantitative measurements in larger vessels containing hundreds of thousands of cells flowing per second. Development of mouse flow approaches will be applicable to clinical approaches using the same instrumentation. Imaging strategies and custom algorithms image single cells noninively in smallest to largest vessels of retinal circulation without exogenous agents facilitate measurement. Label-free adaptive optics achieved improved contrast of single cells in the retina compared to dye techniques, especially in high flow conditions. Noninvasive studying the retina serves as a window to understanding microcirculation dynamics in CNS and systemic microvascular health. Combined capabilities enabled single cell resolution as flowed in tight and sparse formations inside microvessels. All cells imaged noninively with infrared backscatter without dye, enabling submicrometer precision measuring lumen diameters of retinal vessels. In total, 123 vessels in 19 mice were studied with measured flow ranging 0.0001-1.55µL/min across 3.2-45.8µm vessel diameters.
Spontaneous symbiotic reprogramming of plant roots is triggered by receptor-like kinases, with Symbiosis Receptor Kinase (SYK) being indispensable for the development of phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza and nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis. The mechanisms that discriminate between the two symbiotic developmental fates have been unclear, but research shows that ectopic expression of receptor kinase genes Nod Factor 1 and N5, along with SYK, initiate nodule organogenesis and nodulation-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Overexpression of N1 or N5 associated with endogenous SYK in roots of legume Lotus japonicus reveals that the active SYK allele initiates signaling independently of N1 or N5 and upstream of a set of genes required for generation or decoding calcium-spiking in symbiosis. Only SYK, not N overexpression, triggers the expression of AM-related genes, indicating the receptors play a key role in the decision between AM or root nodule symbiosis development. The SYK loss of specificity may be explained by complex formation with N1 and N5, and related Lys-RLs that mediate recognition signals from the fungus, resulting in release of negative mechanisms or unbalanced stoichiometry of SYK and regulators. The common symbiosis genes of legumes are required for AM and nodule symbiosis, with a subset essential for generation or decoding of calcium-spiking. In L japonicus, the group encodes RL Symb Receptor Kinase SYK, and N5 Lys-RL has been pinpointed as a candidate for perception. The discovery that expression of three symbiotic RL constructs leads to spontaneous nodule formation in transgenic L japonicus indicates a critical step in signal initiation, with ligand-induced receptor dimerization being key in mammalian tyrosine kinases and plant RLs. A hallmark of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis is the accommodation of rhizobia in plant cells in specialized organs, providing a favorable environment for nitrogen fixation, with the common symbiosis pathway operating in most land plants.
Researchers have developed a new software toolkit called DeepKit for fast and robust animal pose estimation using deep learning, addressing limitations in speed and robustness of current methods. DeepKit utilizes an efficient multi-scale deep learning model, StackedNet, and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm for estimating keypoint locations with subpixel precision, improving processing speed by over two times without loss of accuracy. The toolkit demonstrates versatility in multiple animal estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings, including groups of interacting individuals, reducing barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior. DeepKit builds on state-of-the-art individual estimation using convolutional neural networks to achieve fast inference without reducing accuracy or generalization, offering considerable improvements over existing models. The software, code, and documentation are available under a permissive open-source license. Achieving fast pose estimation typically relies on massively parallel processing on GPU with large batches or downsampling images, increasing error, but StackedNet can run at 30-110 Hz depending on resolution with a batch size of one. Deep learning-based methods can achieve near human accuracy by annotating data and training a convolutional neural network to estimate animal body parts from images. DeepKit's advances could lead to larger, higher-resolution, reliable datasets, revolutionizing understanding of relationships between behavior, brain, and environment. The toolkit automatically measures animal posture from images and has broad applicability across behavioral sciences, from neuroscience to ecology, providing quantitative measurements for answering scientific questions.
Disruption of glycolytic flux serves as a signal for inflammasome signaling and pyroptotic cell death in innate immune cells, such as macrophages, when challenged with environmental stresses or infections by pathogens. The assembly of multi-protein complexes called inflammasomes initiates pro-inflammatory responses and a form of cell death termed pyroptosis. The identification of an intracellular trigger of NLR3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1 production, and pyroptosis in primed murine bone-derived macrophages is mediated by disruption of glycolytic flux, resulting in a drop of NAD levels and induction of mitochondrial ROS. This signal can be rescued by addition of products that restore NAD production. The disruption of glycolytic flux is a biologically relevant trigger of NLR3 inflamome activation, mediated by mitochondrial redox changes, revealing a mechanistic link between cellular metabolism and initiation of inflammation. Innate cells sense perturbed metabolite production and flux through the glycolytic pathway, activating NLR3 to initiate inflammatory responses. Inhibitors of flux-limiting enzymes and Salmonella typhimurium effectively limit glycolysis through distinct mechanisms, resulting in NLR3-mediated inflamome formation and pyptosis. NAD consumption increases upon pyruvate treatment, indicating induction of productive metabolism downstream glycolysis in infected BMD. Glycolytic perturbation is a mechanism by which innate cells sense altered homeostasis during S. typhurium infection, inducing pro-inflammatory response via NLR3 inflamome and pyotic cell death. Innate cells sense metabolic perturbation as danger, resulting in inflamome formation, caspase-1 activation, and cytokine secretion. Disrupting glycolytic flux triggers inflammation and death in macrophages. Supplementation of glycolytic pyruvate prevents inflamome formation and reduces caspase-1 activation, IL-1 secretion, and cell death. Pyvate supplementation does not impair NLR3 inflamome signaling by nonspecific mechanism.
Researchers have investigated the role of the PALB2 DNA binding domain in DNA repair, specifically its interaction with BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins, which are tumor suppressors linked to various malignancies including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. PAL2 coordinates BRCA1 and BRCA during homology-directed repair and interacts with several chromatin proteins. The study identified a major DNA-binding site of PAL2 and found that mutations in this site reduce RAD51 foci formation and overall efficiency in cells by 50%. The PAL2 N-terminal DNA-binding domain stimulates RAD51 recombinase function and possesses strand exchange activity without RAD51. Surprisingly, it also stimulates inverse strand exchange and can use DNA and RNA substrates. Data reveal a versatile DNA interaction of PAL2 and demonstrate a critical role of PAL2 DNA binding for chromosome repair in cells. PAL2 is described as a scaffold linking BRCA with BR2 during homology-directed repair and interacting with other chromatin proteins. However, a truncation variant with preserved BRCA and BR2 binding motifs but without the middle portion containing DBDs does not support BR2 and RAD recruitment to DSBs. Mutations of four amino acids significantly reduce RAD51 foci and efficiency in a model system. PAL2 NDB stimulates RAD strand reactions and supports forward and inverse exchange even without RAD51 and uses RNA as a substrate. PAL2 interaction with DNA is critical for recruitment of BR2 and RAD to DSB and efficient repair in cells. PAL2 NDB stimulates RAD-mediated strand exchange in vitro. Breast cancer proteins BR1 and 2 regulate efficient nonmutic pathway of chromosome repair and initiate RAD-mediated homologous recombination and facilitate stalled replication. PAL2 truncation of 500 amino acids between BR1 and BR2 motifs containing DB does not support BR2 RAD foci in cells during DNA damage. Results point to the importance of DB in PAL2 function. PAL2 complemented cells display a defect in HR due to defective DNA binding. PAL2 interaction with DNA is critical for BR2 and RAD recruitment to DSB and efficient repair in cells. PAL2 NDB stimulates RAD-mediated strand exchange in vitro highlighting the importance of PAL2 DNA binding in chromosome maintenance.
Researchers have discovered that the prokaryotic actin homologue MreB forms pairs of protofilaments in an antiparallel arrangement, both in vitro and in vivo, which is unprecedented among actin-like proteins. The atomic structure of antiparallel protoaments of Caulobacter MreB reveals that a protofilament doublet is essential for Mre's function in cell shape maintenance. In vivo site-specific cross-linking demonstrates the antiparallel orientation of Mre protoaments in E. coli and 3D cryo-EM shows pairs of protoaments of Caulobacter Mre bind tightly to membranes. Crystal structures of different nucleotide and polymerisation states of Caulobacter Mre reveal conserved conformation changes accompanying antiparallel filament formation. Antimicrobial agents A22/265 bind to the bound nucleotide of Mre, preventing nucleotide hydrolysis and destabilising double filaments. Mre from Caulobacter crescent forms pairs of antiparallel protoaments as revealed by crystal structures. The straight antiparallel arrangement of Mre protoaments ensures each subunit interacts with membrane-bound components. Non-polar nature of Mre filaments explains common assembly and disassembly for filament ends. The mechanism of protofilament formation of C. crescent Mre is elucidated by crystallography, revealing typical domain closure upon polymerisation. Co-crystallisation of Caulob Mre with antimicrobial reagents explains inhibitory mechanism and sheds light on activation of ATP hydrolysis during polymerisation. The antiparallel arrangement of protoaments of C.crescent Mre ensures amphipathic helix of both filaments bind to membrane, interacting with bitopic proteins. Deleting the N-terminal amphipathic helix makes protein less prone to aggregation. The crystal structure of Caul Mre reveals the actin fold containing two domains on either side of a nucleotide binding cleft. Both domains are separated into subdomains A and B. The antiparallel arrangement is unprecedented among actin family proteins, describing a novel architecture of actin-like protoament pairs of eukaryotic or prokotic origin.
The role of APETALA1 in petal number robustness is crucial for reproductive success and resistance to natural perturbations. In Arabidopsis thaliana, petal number is invariant, whereas in the closely related Cardamine hirs, petal number varies, and the genetic basis for this difference between species is unknown. Research shows that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator APET1 accounts for the species-specific difference in petal number robustness. The effect of AP1 is explained by epistatic interactions, where A thalian AP1 confers robustness by masking the phenotypic expression of quantitative trait loci controlling petal number in C hirs. However, C hirs AP1 fails to complement this function of A thalian AP, resulting in variable petal number. Upstream regulatory regions of AP1 contribute to this divergence, and variable petal number is maintained in C hirs despite sufficient genetic variation in accessions to produce four-petaled flowers. AP1 is an important regulator of A thalian flower development, acting early to initiate flowers and later to specify floral organs. The study identified AP1 as a gene of major effect in the evolutionary transition from robust phenotype of four petals in A thalian to variable petal number in C hirs. AP polymorphisms do not directly contribute to within-species variation in C hirs petal number, instead, the canalization of petal in A thalian reflects robustness to genetic variation. Complementation of ap mutants with the AP genomic locus from C hirs resulted in variable petal number, suggesting hidden variability in the gene network controlling petal number in A thalian. Floral organs with petal identity show no variation if they arise outside the second whorl, and ectopic expression of AP1 is associated with an invariant number of petals, whereas endogenous AP expression in whor two of C hirs floral meristem is associated with variable petal number. The results suggest AP divergence likely exposed cryptic variation in C hirs contributing to maintaining variable petal number within accessions of C hirs.
Proinsulin misfolding is an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes. The biosynthesis of insulin begins with the folding of the proinsulin precursor, including the formation of three evolutionarily conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. However, normal pancreatic islets contain a subset of proinsulin molecules with at least one free cysteine thiol. In human or rodent islets with perturbed endoplasmic retic folding environment, non-native proins enters intermolecular disulfide-linked complexes. In genetically obese mice with wild-type islets, disulfide-linked complexes of proins are more abundant, and in leptin-deficient mice, the increase of such complexes tracks the onset of islet deficiency and diabetes. Proins-Cys B and Cys A are necessary and sufficient for the formation of proins disulfide-linked complexes. Proins Cys B-Cys B coent homodimers resist reductive dissociation, highlighting a structural basis for aberrant proins complex formation. Increased proins misfolding via disulfide complexes is an early event associated with prediabetes that worsens ß-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.

Proins misfolding includes the inability to complete internal disulf bonds with a subfraction proins molecules in the ER bearing unpaired cysteine residues. This population of improperly folded proins enters aberrant disulfide partnerships with proins in the ER, resulting misfolded proins complexes identified in human islets. Islets from hyperphagic, glucose-intolerant LepRk2.1 mice demonstrated increased disulf-linked proins complexes with 90 of proins entangled. Rodent islets and human islets in states that alter ER environment and T2 progression prior to ß-cell dedifferentiation or death show similar results. Proins in islet lysates of prediabetic Lepdb mice contain steady level proins with 90 molecules entangled disulfide dimers and higher-order complexes. Young normoglycemic homozyous Lepdb male islets destined for diabetes show increased proinsulfide complexes and insulin levels compared to heterozygous Lep males that do not progress to diabetes. The formation of disulfide-linked proins complexes is necessary and sufficient for proins misfolding, indicating an early event in type 2 diabetes progression.
SUV39H1 is a histone H3 lysine 9-specific methyltransferase that targets pericentric regions and is crucial for assembling heterochatin. The protein recognizes trimethylated H3K9 via its chromodomain and H3Kme3 allows SUVH to target chromosomal regions. Research has shown that Suvh1's chromodomain binds nucleic acids, which is important for its function in heterochatin assembly, with higher affinity for RNA than DNA and independent of H3Kme recognition. Suv1 binds major satellite RNAs in vivo and knockdown of major RNAs lowers Suv retention on perentere. Mutational studies indicate both nucleic acid and H3me binding activities of Suv are crucial for perentric heterochatin assembly. Results suggest chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to SUV target specificity. Suv1's nucleic acid activity integrates with recognition of methylated H3 to establish perentric heterochatin, including Hme formation, HP accumulation, and transcription repressive status. Suv binds major RNA in a manner dependent on nucleic-binding and knockdown of RNAs lowers S retention on perentric. Data indicate chrom-bound RNAs contribute to targeting and retention of S at chromosomal regions. In addition to Hme, Suv's RNA activity contributes to stable association with Hme-rich perent regions. Knockdown of major repeat transcripts supports notion that RNA binding contributes stability on chromatin. Suv-YA interacts with major RNAs but loosely binds chromatin, suggesting interaction with cellular RNAs without stable binding. The HP-binding and chromatin activities of Suv's N region contribute to perentric H formation. Collectively, results demonstrate four activities of Suv regulate perentric heterochatin assembly, including nucleic acid, Hme, HP, and chromatin binding, in addition to lysine methyltransferase activity.
Researchers investigated the role of entorhinal cortex grid cells in spatial navigation and mental operations, hypothesizing that their activity may not depend on physical movement. To test this, they recorded from single units in the entorhinal cortex of monkeys trained to perform a covert attention task, maintaining central fixation while attending to a moving stimulus in the periphery. A significant population of entorinal cells, 20/141 or 14% at FDR <5%, showed spatially structured fields with triangular tiling of space, contrasting with hippocampus recordings where grid-like representations were not observed. This suggests neurons in macaque entorhinal cortex do not rely on physical movement for activation. Monkeys performed the task with >70% accuracy, completing between two and eight cycles per session, with errors mainly due to saccades outside the fixation window. The standard gridness measure was used to evaluate spatial representations among enthinal neurons. Results provide strong evidence that activation of cells in enthinal cortex with spatially firing does not require physical environment movement, supporting the hypothesis that grid cells participate in range of cognitive functions and can be activated by movements of attention. Previous studies showed stationary monkeys' grid cells can be activated by eye movements while visually exploring scenes. The neural substrate for overt and covert attention is largely overlapping, indicating grid cells can represent not only gaze but also locus of attention. This study demonstrates enthinal cells are modulated by spatial attention even without movement, contributing to understanding their role in navigation and mental operations.
Researchers have developed a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice, which produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories, addressing concerns of reproducibility in neuroscience, particularly for measurements of mouse behavior. A head-fixed task was adopted to assay perceptual and value-based decision-making, with standardized training, experimental hardware, software, and procedures. One hundred forty mice were trained across seven laboratories in three countries, generating a publicly available database of five million mouse choices. Learning speed varied, but once training was complete, there were no differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, past successes, failures, and estimates of stimulus probability to guide choices, revealing complex behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories. This establishes a standard for reproducible rodent behavior and provides an open-access dataset to study decision-making in mice, indicating a path toward achieving reproducibility through collaborative open-science approaches. 

The experimental equipment and protocols were identical, and mice learned the task in all laboratories, performing comparably after learning. To facilitate reuse and reproducibility, an open approach was adopted, describing and sharing hardware, software, and protocols, as data and techniques should be available to the broader community. Results from a large cohort of trained mice demonstrate reproducible methods and results, with most learning the task, although at different paces, and performing comparably after, with no significant differences. Physiological studies of decision-making in mice utilize genetic, imaging and physiological tools, and this collaboration aims to explore neural basis of behavior in multiple laboratories. This enables comparison of results, knowing differences are unlikely due to behavior, and hopes to catalyze new adaptations, accelerating high-quality studies of neural correlates of decision-making.
The proper function and repair of the digestive system are vital to most animals, and deciphering the mechanisms involved in these processes requires an atlas of gene and cell types. Researchers applied laser-capture microdissection and RNA sequencing to characterize the intestinal transcriptome of Schmidtea mediterranea, a planarian flatworm that can regenerate organs including the gut, identifying hundreds of genes with intestinal expression undetected by previous approaches. Systematic analyses revealed extensive conservation of digestive physiology and cell types with other animals, including humans. Spatial laser-capture microdissection enabled the discovery of previously unappreciated regionalization of gene expression in the planarian intestine along the medio-lateral axis, especially among intestinal goblet cells. Two intestine-enriched transcription factors were identified that regulate regeneration, specifically hedge signaling effector gli-1, or maintenance, Rb2 of goblet cells. The planarian intestinal transcriptome is a foundational resource for investigating numerous aspects of intestine regeneration and physiology. Twenty-two intestine-enrich transcription factors were identified, including those required for production and maintenance of goblet cells, setting the stage for further studies of this cell type. Intestine-enrich transcription factors play distinct roles in gob cell differentiation and maintenance, and depletion of goblet cells reduces planarians willingness to feed and viability with negligible effects on regeneration of other cell types. Characterization of the planarian transcriptome provides a framework for several steps, defining gene expression and cell types in the intestine. The intestine expresses genes involved in metabolism, nutrient storage, transport, innate immunity, and physiological roles demonstrating functional homology with digestive systems of other animals, including humans. Transcription factors gli-1 and Rb RNA phenotypes suggest distinct mechanisms govern differentiation and maintenance of goblet cells. Observations reinforce evolutionary conservation of intestinal expression indicating roles performed by multiple human organs consolidated in the planarian intestine. Definition of the intestinal transcriptome enables identification of genes for regeneration and functions of distinct cell types.
Researchers investigated how evolutionary divergence in sensory perception relates to physiological coding of stimuli in mormyrid fish, which detect subtle variations in electric signals and encode them into spike-timing differences between sensory receptors. In contrast, receptors insensitive to waveform variation produce spontaneously oscillating potentials. The study found that oscillating receptors respond to electric pulses by resetting their phase, resulting in transient synchrony among receptors that encodes signal timing and location, but not waveform. These receptors were most sensitive to frequencies found in collective signals of conspecifics and correlated with increased behavioral responses to these frequencies. Different perceptual capabilities correspond to different receptor physiologies, suggesting divergent mechanisms represent adaptations for different social environments. A novel mechanism for peripheral coding was described where sensory receptors with spontaneous oscillatory activity respond to stimuli with phase resets that result in synchrony across the population, providing information about pulse timing and polarity but not precise cues within the waveform. Mormy fish communicate through species-specific electric discharge at variable interpulse intervals and oscillating receptors are tuned to lower frequencies, conferring sensitivity to interpulse intervals produced by groups. Playback experiments demonstrated species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to sub-millisecond interpulse intervals within the range of enhanced sensitivity. Behavioral experiments tested the hypothesis that species with oscillating receptors exhibit selective responses to sub-millisecond interpulse intervals and species with spiking receptors do not, presenting a single fish with a train of conspecific electric discharges at constant interpulse intervals. The findings provide evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony, suggesting an adaptation for detecting communication from large groups of fish.
Bacteriophage BPP1 infects and kills Bordetella species that cause whooping cough and has a diversity-generating retroelement providing a naturally occurring phage display system. However, engineering efforts have been hampered without atomic structures. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of BPP1 head at 3.5 Å resolution reveals an atomic model showing two of three protein folds representing viral lineages: jellyroll for cement protein and HK97-like for major capsid protein. The topology of the major capsid protein is permuted non-circularly from the Johnson topology previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. This new topology is likely the only feasible alternative to the old topology with β-sheet and electrostatic interactions contributing to non-covalent chain formation in BPP1, unlike covalent interprotein linkages in HK97. The termini of both proteins are positioned for DGR-based phage engineering. 

The 3D structure of the BPP head at 3.5 Å resolution was determined by single-particle cryoEM and derived an atomic model. The jellyroll motif in BPP1 forms an auxiliary protein to stabilize the viral capsid made of another fold, unlike its role as major capsid in other viruses. BPP1 adopts two characteristic folds of major lineages, jellyroll and HK97. The Johnson fold in BPP is non-circular permuted compared to the known topology. Until now, the Johnson fold has been observed in Siphiridae and Myoviridae families of tailed-bacteriophages, exemplified by gp5 of HK97. The BPP topology and HK topology represent two feasible topologies of the Johnson fold. All known structures of proteins with Johnson adopt the HK topology, including gp of HK97 in Siphidae. 

Bacteriophage B1 is a short-tailed, dsDNA virus and member of Podiridae, infecting Bordella causing whooping cough and respiratory diseases. It has a T=7 icosahedral capsid and 670 Å diameter. A 7 resolution cryEM structure showed the capsid has an HK-like fold with an additional component. An atomic description of B1 will enhance bioengineering, reveal noncovalent interactions, stable capsid formation, and evolutionary relationships of B1 proteins with other viruses. The termini of both proteins are positioned for DGR-based phage engineering, despite complex interactions. Noncoval molecular interactions contribute stable capsid formation, unlike coval interprotein linkages in HK97. The structure provides insight into evolutionary relationships of B1 and proteins in other viruses.
Dengue virus (DENV) cycles between mosquito and mammalian hosts, and to examine how DENV populations adapt to these different environments, researchers used serial passage in human and mosquito cell lines and estimated fitness effects for all single-nucleotide variants in these populations using ultra-deep sequencing. This allowed determination of the contributions of beneficial and deleterious mutations to the collective fitness of the population. The analysis revealed the continuous influx of a large burden of deleterious mutations counterbalances the effect of rare, host-specific beneficial mutations to shape the path of adaptation. Beneficial mutations preferentially map to intrinsically disordered domains in the viral proteome and cluster to defined regions in the genome, these phenotypically redundant alleles facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation. The evolutionary constraints described in the system mirror trends observed across DENV and Zika strains, indicating it recapitulates key biophysical and biological constraints shaping long-term viral evolution. The findings quantify the cost of deleious mutation across the deng genome, highlighting negative selection shapes diversity in viral populations. The ability to recapitulate and identify shifts in the DMFE uncovers molecular mechanisms of selection and adaptation operating on DENV populations in cells and host. Clusters of adaptive mutations in specific regions of deng genome suggest discrete elements targeted by selection in each host. The fitness of the population represents a balance between the dynamics of rare beneficial mutations and significant and constantly replenished load of deleterious alleles during adaptation. Adaptation relies on host-specific mutations clustered in regions of DENV and enriched in regions of proteome exhibiting structural flexibility. CirSeq characterizes fitness landscapes of DENV adapting distinct environments and cellular machineries of human and mosquito cells by tracing allele trajectories almost all possible single nucleotide variants. The influence of positive and negative selection shapes evolutionary paths of DENV in distinct environments is revealed. Beneficial mutations cluster at specific locations in genome, suggesting hotspots of host selection, mapped on three-dimensional structure of deng protein, a transmembrane protein forming outer layer of viral envelope.
Researchers utilized single-particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy and detailed analysis to investigate the interaction between membrane nanodomains and KRas12, an active mutant of Ras, in U2 cells. The results showed that distinct membrane domains dictate KRas12 diffusion and trafficking, with KRas12 exhibiting an immobile state in ~70 nm domains, embedded in a larger domain ~200 nm that confers intermediate mobility, while the rest of the membrane supports fast diffusion. KRas12 is continuously removed from the membrane via the immobile state and replenished to the fast state, similar to internalization and recycling. The diffusion and trafficking properties of KRas12 remain invariant over a broad range of protein expression levels. The partitioning of KRas12 into three states, immobile, intermediate, and fast, remains invariant over a wide range of KRas12 expression levels, demonstrating that KRas12 diffusion and trafficking through the mobility states and nanodomains is maintained in a homeostatic condition. The measured sizes of immobilization and intermediate domains of KRas12 were ~70 nm and ~200 nm, respectively, consistent with previous findings that nanoscopic domains regulate Ras organization on the membrane. A new model is proposed where nested membrane nanodomains dictate the diffusion and trafficking of KRas12 with implications in multimer formation and signaling. Membrane nanodomains directly influence the mobility, trafficking, and potentially multimer formation and signaling of KRas12, although details of trafficking and multimer processes are yet to be defined. The study sheds light on how nanodomains organize the membrane to dictate Ras diffusion and trafficking, offering guidance for future experiments to determine molecular and structural identities of Ras-associated nanodomains and mechanisms of multimer formation and signaling.
Researchers investigated the mechanism of Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) gradient formation in zebrafish embryos, which patterns the dorsoventral axis in vertebrates and invertebrates. The prevailing view in vertebrates for BMP gradient formation involves a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists and ligand shuttling to generate peak signaling levels. To determine the mechanism in zebrafish, they quantified BMP activity in wild-type and mutant embryos, combining data with a mathematical model-based computational screen to test hypotheses. Analysis ruled out BMP shuttling and transcriptionally-formed gradient mechanisms, instead supporting a source-sink mechanism where restricted BMP antagonist distribution acts as a sink driving BMP flux dorsally and gradient formation. Measuring Bmp2 diffusion supported the source-sink model, suggesting a new mechanism to shape BMP gradients during development. 

The study established a quantitative imaging method to measure the BMP gradient, integrating results with a mathematical approach to inform model selection and identify key parameters. Recent observations of bmp2 and bmp7 expression led to the hypothesis that BMP signaling reflects expression, but three results did not support this. Quantification and modeling presented a new view of BMP antagonists and ligand establishing the signaling gradient patterning the dorsoventral axis in zebish. BMPs act as morphogens during development, including patterning the embryonic axis, neural tube, and Drosophila disc, established by a network of extracellular regulators. In vertebrates, the mechanism by which BMP ligands and antagonists shape the gradient is unclear, with proposed mechanisms including an inverse gradient of antagonists and shutling ligand to regions. 

The source-sink mechanism relies on restricted antagonist distribution acting as a sink, driving BMP flux dorsally and formation, differing from prevailing views of counter-gradients and shutling. BMPs play a crucial role in development, including patterning the dorsovent axis, neural tube, and Drosila disc, with BMP systems established by extracellular regulators. The study provides a new understanding of BMP gradient formation in zebrafish, with implications for understanding development and patterning in vertebrates and invertebrates.
Lysosomes are crucial sites for intracellular degradation and proteolysis, and the export of low-molecular-weight catabolic end-products is facilitated by polytopic transmembrane proteins. Researchers investigated MFSD, a previously uncharacterized lysosomal member of the major facilitator superfamily, and found it is not N-glycosylated and contains a dileucine-based sorting motif for transport to lysosomes. Mfsd knockout mice developed splenomegaly and severe liver disease, and proteomics of isolated lysosomes revealed GLMP as a critical accessory subunit for MFSD. MF1 and GL physically interact, and GL is essential for maintaining normal levels of MF1 in lysosomes, and vice versa. Gl knockout mice mimic the phenotype of Mf1 knockout, indicating a tightly linked MF1/GL lysosomal membrane transporter complex. Previous studies identified putative lysosomal transporters, and this study characterized MF1 in detail, establishing an essential role for GL and MF1 in liver homeostasis, particularly in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. MF1 is endogenously localized in lysosomes under steady state, ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues, and its transport to lysosomes is mediated by a dileine-based motif in the N-terminus. Mf1 knockout mice were generated to determine physiological functions, and by differential proteomics, GL was identified as essential for MF1, a highly glycosylated lysosomal protein of unknown function. Deficiency of Mf1 leads to reduced GL and vice versa. MF1 belongs to the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, one of the largest family mediating secondary or passive processes, and Chapel et al aimed to identify lysosomal transporters, with MF1 as a top candidate. Lysosomes from wildtype and Mf1 knockout mice were isolated, and proteomics revealed drastically reduced levels of GL. The data indicate MF1 is not a transporter for tested amino acids under conditions, and its deficiency affects lysosomal composition. The study reveals a critical role for MF1 and GL in liver homeostasis, particularly in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and establishes a tightly linked MF1/GL complex essential for liver function.
Researchers have gained insight into the process of microtubule-based transport by kines motors, powered by ATP hydrolysis, which is essential for various vital processes in eukaryotes. Atomic models of the monomeric kines motor domain on microtules were developed from cryo-EM reconstructions at 5-6 Å resolution, providing high-resolution structures of kines on microtubules. By comparing these models with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kines, a mechanistic scheme was inferred where microtub attachment triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and release of ADP, mediated by a universally conserved 'linpin' residue in kines. Binding of ATP re-closes the cleft, tightly coupling translocation of cargo via kines' 'neck' element. These structural transitions are similar to nucleotide-exchange steps in myosin and F1-ATPase motors, informing how two heads of kines dimer 'gate' each other to promote coordinated stepping along microtubules. The mechanism allows microtules to regulate kines affinities for ADP and ATP by modulating conformation of switch loops, yielding an elegant basis for kines nucleotide behavior on microtubules. High-resolution cryoEM reconstructions of human monomeric kines motor domain attached to microtub in different chemical states were solved, representing the motor before and after ATP binding. No-nucle and ATP-bound models of kines-microtub complex were compared to X-ray structures of AD-bound kines, revealing clam-like closure of kines nucleotide cleft triggered by ATP on microtules. CryoEM analysis of AD and ATP-bound states of N255 mutant supported the hypothesis, revealing previously unidentified binding modes of kines where motor attaches to microt tightly but is rotationally mobile. The findings provide a structural basis for kines nucleotide-gated force generation and inform how microtules regulate kines affinities, shedding light on the mechanism of kines microtub-attached cycle.
Maintaining the essential functions of mitochondria requires mechanisms to recognize and remove misfolded proteins, however, quality control pathways for misfolded mitochondrial proteins remain poorly defined. A novel quality control pathway at the mitochondrial outer membrane has been established using temperature-sensitive peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane proteins as model substrates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The ts-proteins sen1-Hs and sam35-Hs are degraded from the mitochondrial outer membrane by the ubiquitin-proteasome system, with ubiquination of sen1-Hs mediated by ubiquitin ligase Ubr1 and sam35-Hs primarily by San1. Mitochondria-associated degradation of both substrates requires the SSA family Hsp70 and Hsp40 Sis, providing evidence for chaperone involvement. The Cdc-Npl-Ufd1 AAA-ATP complex, Doa, and a mitochondrial pool of transmembrane Cdc adaptor Ubx are also implicated in their degradation. This study reveals a unique quality control pathway comprised of a combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors that distinguishes it from other cellular pathways. Ubiquination and proteasomal degradation play roles in the turnover of sam-Hs and sen-Hs at the mitochondrial outer membrane. The known ubiquitin ligases acting on mitochondrial proteins in yeast are SCdm and Rsp, however, the known substrates for these are native proteins. Temperature-dependent misfolding and degradation have been used to study protein quality control in the ER, cytos, and nucleus. The ts-alleles sam and sen have been used to elucidate how misfolded mitochondrial proteins are targeted for destruction. Pathways converge post-ubiquination where the Cdcpl-Ufd complex facilitates unfolding and extraction of substrates prior to targeting 26S proteomes for degradation. Mitrial proteins are subject to oxidative insults resulting in damage and misfolding. Ubiquinated forms of ts-proteins accumulate in the mitochondrial fraction under proteome impairment, correlating with unmodified species distributions. Deletion of proteome shuttling factors does not affect degradation, distinguishing from ERAD, indicating ubiquinated mitochondrial substrates require the Cdcplfd complex for efficient proteasomal degradation. The Cdcplfd complex is recruited via Cdc interaction with co-factors, establishing a unique quality control pathway at the mitochondrial outer membrane.
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) is a key effector of many signaling pathways, and its regulation is crucial for homeostasis in the epidermis and other tissues. Researchers used a FRET biosensor to visualize epidermal ERK activity in living mice, revealing bursts of ERK activation patterns where ER activity radially propagated from cell to cell under steady-state conditions. The frequency of this spatial propagation, termed Spatial Propagation of Radial ER Activity Distribution (SPREAD), correlated with the rate of epidermal cell division. READs and proliferation were stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) in a manner dependent on EGF receptors and their cognate ligands. At wounded skin, ERK activation propagated as a wave parallel to the wound edge, suggesting ER activation can be superimposed. Visualizing the cell cycle showed that READs were associated with G2/M cell progression. Long-time imaging of intact epidermis revealed radial propagation of ER activity, originating from a few cells and propagating radially up to 50 μm over 30 minutes until disappearance. READs were observed in the epidermis of back skin, indicating they are generally present in mouse epidermis. The ERK pattern mainly propagated in the basal layer of epidermis and to a lesser extent in the suprabasal layer. ER activation is triggered by the activation of epidermal growth factor receptors through binding to cognate ligands. Exquisite control of ERK MAP signaling is required for homeostasis in the epider and tissues. The study provides new insights into how proliferation and transient ER activity are synchronized in a living tissue, showing two types of novel ER activation patterns, and how growth signal is regulated in steady-state and wounded skin.
Circadian rhythms are biological oscillations that schedule daily changes in physiology, but outside the laboratory, circadian clocks do not generally free-run and are driven by daily cues whose timing varies with the seasons. Researchers have developed experimental platforms for driving the cyanobacterial circadian clock both in vivo and in vitro and found that the phase of the circadian rhythm follows a simple scaling law in light-dark cycles, tracking midday across variable day lengths. The core oscillator comprised of Kai proteins behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating such dynamics are intrinsic to these proteins. A mathematical framework was developed based on instantaneous transformation of the clock by external cues, which predicts clock behavior under many environments. The entrained behavior of the circadian clock can be captured quantitatively by a mathematical framework with a small number of parameters, guiding the design of experiments to probe molecular origins of key features. The cyanobacterial clock can be reconstituted in vitro from purified Kai proteins and presents a unique opportunity to elucidate molecular mechanisms in circadian biology. Biochemical simulations of seasonal effects in the reconstuted Kai oscillator by driving proteins with nucleotides on a 24-hour cycle showed similar scaling of clock phase with simulated day length, indicating core mechanisms for seasonal adaptation are intrinsic to Kai proteins. The linear model holds promise of predicting behavior of circadian rhythms in varying environments from minimal data characterizing oscillator response and may be applicable to clocks in many organisms. The key determinant of entrained behavior is how the clock cycle is deformed by coupling to the environment. The cyanobacterial circadian clock follows midday both in vivo and in vitro, and its core oscillator comprised of Kai proteins drives genome-wide transcriptional rhythms, which have been extensively studied biochemically in constant conditions. The ability to track midday in vivo is intrinsic to the core oscillator and does not require additional factors present in the cell. The model is general and expected to be useful for other organisms, providing insights into molecular mechanisms of circadian biology and seasonal adaptation.
Cardiovascular incidents and sudden cardiac death are leading causes of premature death, yet the origins remain unidentified in many cases. Genome-wide studies have identified Meis1 as a risk factor for sudden cardiac death. Research has shown that Meis inactivation in the neural crest leads to altered sympathovagal regulation of cardiac rhythmicity in adults, characterized by chronotropic incompetence and conduction defects, increasing susceptibility to sudden cardiac death. Meis1 is a major regulator of sympathetic target-field innervation, and Meis deficient neurons die by apoptosis from embryonic to perinatal stages. Meis regulates transcription of key molecules necessary for endosomal machinery, and traffic of Rab+ endosomes is severely altered in Meis-inactivated neurons. This suggests Meis interacts with trophic signaling pathways during postmitotic differentiation. Neurodevelopmental defects lead to sympathetic apoptosis, positioning Meis as a novel actor in sympathetic differentiation by its role in distal-field innervation. Genes regulated by Meis include transcriptional regulation of proteins for retrograde transport, endosomes, and traffic. Genetic inactivation of Meis results in imbalanced sympathovagal regulation of heart functions, conduction defects, and premature sudden death. Meis acts independently of well-studied transcription factors governing early neuron specification to orchestrate later phases of differentiation. Loss of Me1 function in sympathetic neurons leads to imbalanced sympathovagal regulation in adult mice, increasing susceptibility to sudden death. Inactivation of Me1 in peripheral neurons impairs traffic of Rab+endosomes and compromises target innervation. This study complements research demonstrating Meis function in neonatal cardiomyocyte mitosis following myocardial infarction. However, Meis inactivation or overexpression in cardiomyocytes does not affect cardiac functions. The Meis family participates in cardiogenesis, indicating Meis role in cardiac regulation through sympathetic neuron differentiation and susceptibility to unexplained sudden death.
Researchers have investigated the morphogenesis of surface-attached bacterial communities, known as biofilms, using Vibrio cholerae as a model system, combining mechanical measurements, theory, simulation, quantitative image analysis, surface characterization, and mutagenesis. The study reveals that mechanical instabilities, including wrinkling and delamination, underlie the morphogenesis of growing biofilms. Interfacial energy is identified as a key driving force for mechanomorphogenesis, dictating the generation and annihilation of new and existing interfaces. A feedback between mechanomorphogenesis and biofilm expansion shapes the overall biofilm contour. The findings suggest that exploiting mechanical principles to drive key morphogenic events is an ancient process that occurs in bacteria and has been reused in eukaryotes. Biofilms represent a model to investigate the role of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and provide a system for morpho-engineering. The study proposes a mechanomorph model where biofilms wrinkle and delaminate as growth builds up compressive stress, and changing the spatial distribution of mechanical stress can alter biofilm topography. Experiments where V. cholera biofilms were inoculated onto the same agar plate and allowed to collide support this model. The Δz P aerosa mutant forms peripheral wrinkles and delaminations due to the same mechanical instability described in V. cholera, illustrating how gene regulation and cell physiology can be coupled to mechanical instability to promote biofilm morphologies. Theoretical work on bacterial biofilms has considered mechanical instabilities, and findings suggest genes or compounds that alter biofilm morphology by mechanics could be discovered to address biofilm problems. Morphological patterns involve gene programs, but mechanical findings in V cholera are expected to apply generally to morphogenesis in tissues in higher organisms.
The mechanisms underlying the development of epileptic networks following severe seizures are not well understood, but research has shown that interfering with the function of the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRS/REST), a transcription factor that influences neuronal phenotype, can attenuate the disorder. This study found that epilepsy-provoking seizures increased NRS levels in the hippocampus several fold, yet only a subset of approximately 10% of potential NRS target genes were repressed. The repressed genes were rescued when NRS binding to chromatin was blocked. The genes selectively repressed by NRS had mid-range binding frequencies to the repressor, rendering them sensitive to moderate fluctuations in NF levels. These genes, regulated by NRS during epileptogenesis, coded for ion channels, receptors, and other contributors to neuronal function. Dynamic regulation of NRS target genes may play a role in influencing neuronal properties in pathological and physiological contexts. Hundreds of NRSE-containing hippocampal genes are potential targets, but only a subset are repressed by NRS in the context of seizure-induced epilepsy, evident from their rescue when NRS function is blocked. The basis of selective regulation includes mid-range binding frequencies to NRS, influenced by moderate fluctuations in NRS levels. NRS-regulated hippocampal genes include ion channels, receptors, calcium molecules, and transcription factors governing neuronal function and plasticity, suggesting their repression contributes to epilepsy pathogenesis. Key findings are that NRS contributes to epileptogenesis by regulating genes influencing neuronal function, hundreds of hippocal genes are potential targets but only a dozen are repressed in seizure-induced epilepsy, and selective regulation basis is due to mid-range binding frequencies to NRS. The study used large-scale transcriptome arrays, qPCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation and gene enrichment analysis to examine NRS-dependent expression during epileptogenesis. A twofold to threefold increase in NRS levels led to repression of a subset of regulated genes, rescued by interfering with NRS function.
Researchers have investigated the parallel pathways formed by mitral and tufted cells in the olfactory system of mice to understand how circuits in parallel pathways maintain or enhance the encoding of specific stimulus features. The study found differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between mitral and tuft cells, likely due to differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations showed that these circuit-level differences allow mitral and tuft cells to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of parallel pathways. The mammalian olfactory bulb contains two classes of projection neurons, mitral cells and tuft cells, which receive input from olfactory sensory neurons and exhibit distinct responses to odors due to differences in connectivity. The combination of activity-dependent inhibition at low and intermediate rates enables mitral and tuft cells to collectively encode odors better than either population alone, supporting novel computations that are unlikely with a single neuron type. Local circuit activity creates selectivity in parallel pathways remains poorly understood, particularly in brain areas where distinct outputs are generated from initially homogeneous sources, such as the olfactory system. The study identified a novel mechanism generating differential responses across parallel pathways and examined the emergence of feature selectivity in mitral and tuft cells. Similarities between the olfactory and visual systems suggest mechanisms behind parallel processing may be shared, with feature selectivity emerging due to connectivity to specific cell types, such as bipolar and amacrine cells in the retina. In the olfactory system, differences in odor-evoked responses in mitral and tuft cells emerge due to differences in connectivity to olfactory sensory neurons and external tuft cells. The proposed mechanism involves activity-dependent inhibition in mitral and tuft cells, with distinct levels of activity in the olfactory circuit consisting of presynaptic and postsynaptic mitral tuft cells and associated granule cells, allowing for segregation of information about different ranges of stimulus intensity. The findings indicate that parallel pathways may be important for encoding specific stimulus features, with implications for understanding sensory processing in the mammalian olfactory bulb.
The M2 muscarinic receptor is a prototypic model of allostery in G-protein-coupled receptors, yet the molecular and supramolecular determinants of such effects are unknown. To identify allosteric properties gained in oligomers, monomers and oligomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor were compared. Alloster interactions were monitored using a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the alloster site and pharmacological assays involving mutants to preclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of allost at the atomic level were examined in molecular dynamics simulations. Results showed that alloic effects in monomers were exclusively negative and primarily derived from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the alloster and orthosteric ligands. In contrast, alloic effects in oligomers could be positive or negative depending on the alloster-orthestic pair and arose from interactions within and between constituent protomers. The complex behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations. Studies have generally understood allost at the M2 muscar receptor in terms of interactions within a monomer, disregarding the tendency of G-protein-coupled receptors to form oligomers. However, the oligomeric nature of the M2 receptor is evident in multiphasic effects of alloic ligands on dissociation of orthosteric antagonists and their binding equilibrium. The M2 muscar receptor has been a prototype for such effects within the broader family of G-protein-coupled receptors, with most studies based on modulation of events at orthestic site typically on receptors in native or detergent-solubilized extracts. To understand how multimeric complex might account for alloster behavior resisting explanation in monomers, positive and negative alloster modulators were compared for effects on oligomers and purified monomers of the M2 muscar receptor. Alloster effects were examined in molecular dynamics at atomic level starting from the crystal structure of monomeric M receptor occupied by agonist ipxo. The ligand and accessory proteins were removed, and conformations of receptor sampled from canonical ensemble within 30ns period. Different liganded states identified as X_Y where X and Y are alloster and orthestic ligands respectively. Chemical structures of alloster and orthestic ligands to M2 muscar receptor include N-methylscopolamine, quinuclidylbenzilate, strychnine, and gallamine.
SETD2, the enzyme responsible for trimethylating histone H3 lysine 36, is required for ATM activation upon DNA double-strand breaks and homologous recombination repair of DNA double-strand breaks by promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments. SET2 is necessary for the recruitment of RAD51 to resected DNA 5' ends and SET2-depleted cells show reduced homology-directed repair of double-strand breaks. Depletion of SET2 impairs ATM activation and leads to delayed recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of double-strand breaks. SET2 mutations were found in several cancers, including clear cell renal cell carcinoma, where loss of SET2 may afford an alternative mechanism for inactivation of the p53 checkpoint without genetic mutations in TP53. Despite persistence of DNA lesions, SET2-deficient cells failed to activate p53 and showed decreased survival after DNA damage. SET2-dependent provides a chromatin bookmarking instrument facilitating signaling and repair of double-strand breaks. SET2 is necessary for the DNA damage response and depletion of SET2 impairs ATM activation. Data reveal SET2 is required for recruitment of RAD51 to resect DNA 5' ends and SET2-depleted cells show reduced homology-directed repair of double-strands. Unlike histone modifications, SET2 does not promote increased H3K36me levels at DNA damage sites or DDR-dependent recruitment of SET2 to doublestrands. The study provides a functional link between genomic alterations and inactivating mutations and deletions of histone modifiers extending understanding of the impact of altered chromatin on mechanisms maintaining genome integrity. SET2 is necessary for activation of ATM following DNA damage and compromised in SET2-depleted cells treated with NCS or etopide but marginally affected in doublestrands induced phlemycin. The study identifies a novel role of histone methyltransferase rendering cells competent to repair doublestrands by priming chromatin for response to DNA damage.
Researchers have identified a new missense variant, Rasgrp1Ana, in the Rasgrp1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which exhibits antinuclear autoantibodies and accumulates a CD44hi Helios+ PD-1+ CD4+ T cell population dependent on B cells. Despite reduced Ras1-Ras-ER activation in vitro, thymocyte selection in Ras1Ana is mostly normal in vivo, although CD44 is overexpressed on naïve thymocytes and T cells in a T-autonomous manner. CD44 expression is identified as a reporter of tonic mTOR signaling through a novel strain, chino, with reduction-of-function in Mtor. Elevated mTOR signaling occurs in Ras1Ana naïve CD4 cells, and CD44 expression, CD4 cell ratios, and serum autoantibodies return to normal in Ras1AnaMtor double mutant mice, demonstrating increased mTOR activity is essential for Ras1 cell dysregulation. Ras1Ana is distinct from previously described autoimmune mutations in Ras1, Zap, or Lat, with no effect on thymocyte development, normal TCR repertoires, but peripheral accumulation of distinct Helios+ PD1 T cells and production of antinuclear autoantibodies. Ras1Ana increases mTOR signaling in naïve CD4 cells, dissociating this function from its role in thymic selection. Biochemical and genetic studies identify overactive mTOR within naïve CD4 cells driving two abnormalities: constitutive CD44 increase in naïve CD4 cells and accumulation of Helios CD44 CD cells and autoantibodies. Genetic reduction of mTOR normalizes CD44 on naïve CD4 cells and abolishes excessive effector cells and autoantibodies, demonstrating a central role for increased mTOR in immune dysregulation. RasAna effect on RasER signaling in vivo was milder than expected from in vitro assays. The findings reveal a new role for Ras1 in cell intrinsic regulation of CD4 cells, analyzing miss mutation in Ras1 EF, dissociating function from thymic selection, identifying overactive mTOR as key component driving abnormalities.
Mutations in the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex are common in cancer, but the mechanisms by which disruption of SWI/SNF components alter tumorigenesis remain poorly understood. To model the effect of loss of function in the SWI/SNF subunit Arid1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PD) initiation, researchers used shRNA triggered, inducible, and reversible suppression of Arid1 in the mouse pancreas with oncogenic KrasG12. Arid1 cooperates with Kras in the adult pancreas, as postnatal silencing of Ar1 following KrasG12 expression induces rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous PD precursor lesions. In contrast, Ar1 silencing during embryogenesis, concurrent with Kras12 activation, leads to retention of acinar fate. Suppression of Ar1 in adult acinar cells harboring oncogenic Kras mutations accelerates acinar to duct reprogramming and specification of mucinous pancreatic precursor lesions that cannot be reversed by restoring endogenous Ar1 expression, suggesting Ar1 provides a barrier to K driven acinar duct metaplasia and early pancreatic neoplasia. Alcian blue staining confirmed retention of mucinous lesions in Ar1-restored mice. Ar1 loss enables non-reversible reprogramming of cell fate dependent on cellular and genetic context. Perturbation of the SW/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex impacts expression of SW/SNF target genes. Genomic areas rendered by Ar1 harbor elements involved in preventing acinar duct transdifferentiation in mutant Kras. Transcriptional and chromatin profiling imply Ar1 disruption in oncogenic Kras reduces chromatin accessibility to enhancers of genes sustaining acinar fate. Ar1 stabilizes acinar identity acting as a barrier to pancreatic initiation, but other factors promote the PanIN-PDAC transition. Data suggest acute Ar1 loss in pre-existing Kras rapidly perturbs identity and function of pancreatic acinar cells, enhancing sensitivity to metlastic and Pan-inducing signals from oncogenic Kras. A mouse-model platform enables inducible disruption of gene function showing Ar1 modulates early pancreatic neoplasia context-dependent on timing of Ar1 inactivation and oncogenic Kras.
Research has shown that social networks can buffer the effects of stress, but the absence of a social network can also be stressful. A study examined the neuroendocrine paraventricular nucleus (PVN) corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) neurons and found that social isolation alters the intrinsic properties of these cells in a sexually dimorphic fashion. Specifically, isolating pre-adolescent female mice from littermates for 24 hours increased first spike latency and decreased excitability of CRH neurons, changes not evident in age-matched males. In contrast, subjecting either males or grouped or housed females to acute physical stress increased first spike latency. The increase in first spike latency following social isolation or physical stress was blocked by glucocortic synthesis inhibitor metyrapone and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone, resulting in decreased excitability of CRH neurons. Observations demonstrate social isolation, not acute stress, has sex-specific effects on PVN neurons.

The study found brief social isolation affects biophysical properties of PVN CRH neurons in a sexually dimorphic fashion, increasing first spike latency and decreasing neuronal excitability in socially isolated female but not age-matched male mice. Acute physical stress increased first spike latency in group-housed females and single-housed males. Social isolation occluded the effects of stress on female mice. Hypothalamic brain slices examined synaptic and intrinsic properties of identified CRH neurons in PV in acute slices. Activation of these cells is obligatory for launching neuroendocrine response to stress. Social isolation altered intrinsic properties of CRH neurons in female not male mice.

Subjecting single-housed male to acute stress increased first spike latency, while prior isolation occluded effects of acute stress in females. Findings demonstrate males and females react differently to some stressors, social isolation having definitive CORT-dependent effects on CR neurons in female not male. Both males and females show indistinguishable responses to acute physical stress. Prior social isolation occludes effects of subsequent physical stress on first spike latency in females, no effect on males. The glucortic synthesis inhibitor blocked the increase in first spike latency following social or physical stress, and exogenous corticosterone mimicked the increase, resulting in decreased excitability of CRH neurons. Overall, the study demonstrates sex-specific effects of social isolation on PVN neurons.
Hemoglobin is a crucial protein for studying molecular adaptation in vertebrates, with both affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding affecting tissue delivery. Research suggests that hemoglobin affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptations optimized for tissue oxygen delivery. The relationship between the Hill coefficient and relative conformational changes of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux allosteric model reveals a 'biophysical landscape' describing this relation. Mammalian hemoglobin cooperativity values reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity, allowing for gross and fine-tuning of oxygen unloading to meet distinct metabolic tissue requirements. Evolutionary tuning of mammalian hemoglobin maximum cooperativity and affinity regulates oxygen delivery by varying quatern states, meeting distinct tissue oxygen needs. Different mammalian hemoglobins exhibit varying maximum Hill values, with higher values giving rise to higher sensitivities to substrate unloading. The cooperativity of hemoglobin has been tuned during evolution to satisfy tissue oxygen supply requirements. Small animals with high metabolic rates display lower oxygen affinity than large animals, reflecting adaptive adjustment of oxygen unloading. Changes in mammalian hemoglobin binding conformation have been tuned during evolution, yielding maximum cooperativity and varying Hill values. The human physiological dataset shows greater animal metabolic rate correlates with higher Hill cooperativity and inverse correlation between metabolic rate and hemoglobin affinity. These findings reveal the mechanism of body-size adaptation of mammalian hemoglobin.
Malaria infection begins with the injection of Plasmodium sporozoites by Anopheles mosquitoes into the skin of mammalian hosts, and understanding how sporozoites locate and enter blood vessels is crucial. Researchers used intravital microscopy in mice to examine sporozoite motility and interaction with dermal blood vessels, revealing two types of motility: avascular and perivascular. Avascular motility is characterized by high speed and less confinement in areas far from vessels, while perivascular motility is more constrained near vessels. The curvature of sporozoite tracks optimizes contact with dermal capillaries. Imaging sporozoites with mutations in key proteins highlighted the importance of gliding speed and modulating adhesive properties for successful exit from the inoculation site. 

The study presents a quantitative in vivo analysis of Plmodium sporozoite motility over time and interaction with dermal vascular endothelia, characterizing changes in motility over the first two hours after intradermal inoculation. CSN and TRAP sporozoites were rendered fluorescent to study surface protein function in dermal motility and vessel recognition. CSN sporozoites spent more time with vessels but failed to enter circulation, while TRAP sporozoites had reduced gliding speed and explored less tissue volume, resulting in decreased vessel encounters. Gliding motility is essential for infectivity, with previous reports observing dermal motility but lacking in-depth analysis over time. Intrital imaging over 120 minutes post-inoculation showed significant motility changes. 

Data demonstrate sporozoite motility changes in response to environmental signals, exhibiting avascular and perivascular motility. Avascular motility has high speed and less confinement in avascular areas, while perivascular motility is constrained near vessels. Mutant sporozoites with altered motility patterns or speed had decreased vessel invasion and infectivity. The study refines understanding of sporozoite navigation through the dermis, indicating exit from the inoculation as a barrier and opportune time to intervene. The findings highlight the importance of gliding speed and adhesive properties for successful blood vessel invasion. The research provides insight into Plasmodium sporozo motility and interaction with dermal vessels, crucial for understanding malaria infection and potential interventions.
Cells are organized into functional modules, typically containing components whose removal severely compromises the module's function, yet these components are not absolutely conserved across the tree of life, suggesting cells can evolve to perform the same biological functions with different proteins. Researchers evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 100 generations without the important polarity gene BEM1 and found the bem1∆ lineages initially rapidly increased in fitness and then slowly reached over 90% of the fitness of their BEM ancestors at the end of the evolution. Sequencing their genomes and monitoring polarization revealed a common evolutionary trajectory with a sequence of adaptive mutations improving cell polarization by inactivating proteins. The results show organisms can be evolutionarily robust to physiologically destructive perturbations and recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in parts for biologically important functions. The loss of BEM1 led to a reproducible evolutionary trajectory largely explained by interactions amongst mutated genes resulting in substantial recovery in speed and accuracy of cell polarization. Deleting BEM, a relatively young component in polarity establishment with a different role in ancestral fungi, revealed alternative evolutionarily ancient polarization modules. Multiple layers of regulation allow cells to polarize and adapt to strong perturbations under selective pressure favoring evolutionary trajectories removing components from modules over quantitatively altering properties. Adaptive mutations changed polarization dynamics to re-establish efficient polarization and bem1 cells often contained more than one polarity site, suggesting weaker positive feedback for single site polarization. The study demonstrates cells can evolve to perform the same functions with different proteins and recover from destructive perturbations through gene inactivation, leading to divergence in biologically important functions.
Neurobiologists have traditionally studied decision-making by offering successive, independent choices between goods or gambles, but real-life choices often have lasting consequences, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. Researchers investigated how humans decide to commit or reject prospects with sustained financial returns and found that BOLD signals in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) encoded value when acceptance or rejection was deferred, suggesting a role in integrating signals over time. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) encoded value when participants rejected or deferred a prospect. The dACC signals reflected two biases: deferring commitments to later and weighing potential losses more heavily than gains, paradoxically maximizing reward in the task. 

Previous studies examined neural mechanisms of economic behavior through independent gambles or consumer choices, but this study devised a task involving commitment to assets with enduring financial consequences. The aim was to understand computational mechanisms of economic commitments and neural implementation in the reward circuitry of the medial prefrontal cortex. Commitments often follow deliberation, where items are considered but acceptance or rejection is deferred. It remains unknown whether value coding depends on acceptance or rejection and how encoding in the prefrontal cortex depends on economic commitment. 

The study investigated mechanisms accompanying commitment, rejection, and deferral during economic choice using a multi-alternative task with financial ramifications over episodes that could not be reversed. In half the blocks, participants chose between accepting or deferring a prospect. The dACC encoded value when a prospect was excluded, while the rmPFC encoded during deferral. Joint consideration of behavioral data and dACC activity pinpointed two pressures shaping decisions: a bias to defer and a bias to unfavorable options. The findings offer insights into pressures shaping economic decisions and computation in the prefrontal cortex. The study used a task where humans decided to commit by acceptance or rejection to prospects with sustained financial returns and found that BOLD signals in the rmPFC encoded value when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future. The dACC encoded value when participants rejected or deferred a prospect, reflecting biases that maximized reward in the task, providing fresh insights into pressures shaping economic decisions and computation in the prefront cortex.
Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies formed around the long non-coding RNA Neat1 and RNA-binding proteins, and their role is believed to control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by means of nuclear retention of mRNA containing 3'-UT inverted repeats of Alu sequences. This study found that in pituitary cells, all components of paraspeckles, including four major proteins and Neat1, displayed a circadian pattern. The insertion of IRAl at the 3'-UT of the EGFP cDNA led to rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of egfp mRNA that was lost when parasckles were disrupted, whereas insertion of a single antisense Alu had a weak effect. Real-time microscopy showed IRAl drove circadian expression of EGFP protein, indicating parasckles control circadian expression at post-transcription level. Nuclear retention of IRus in 3'-UT of genes provides an additional layer of gene regulation by sequestering mature mRNAs within the nucleus. Components of parasckles, namely NONO and SFP, display circadian pattern in primary cultures of pitary cells and rat pitary cell line GH4. Disruption of parasckles resulted in loss of rhythmic pattern in circadian genes, suggesting parasck retention plays a role in circadian expression. Post-transcription circadian regulation plays a major role in determining oscillations at mRNA level. Parasck bodies may rhythmically retain RNAs in nucleus, leading to rhythmic expression of corresponding gene. The GH4 pitary cell line was used to determine if posttranscription mechanisms allowing circadian expression in pitary cells involve circadian nuclear retention by parasck bodies. The presence of parasck was characterized, showing nuclear bodies were rhythmically expressed in the rat4 pitary cell line. RNA-binding proteins target antisense Alu elements within 3'-UT of mRNAs, HNPC display circadian pattern in several tissues including mouse pitary. The study shows parasckles control circadian expression at post-transcription level through nuclear retention of mRNA containing 3'-UT inverted Alu sequences.
Researchers have identified the active-zone protein Munc13 as a crucial regulator of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, which are essential for converting electrical signals into chemical communication. Munc13, previously known for its role in exocytosis, interacts with voltage-gated calcium channels via a pair of basic residues in its C2 domain, dictating their behavior during various forms of activity. Studies demonstrate that eliminating this interaction by removing M13 or replacing it with a mutant M13 C2 alters synaptic calcium channel response and recovery from high-frequency action bursts and calcium influx from single action stimuli. This reveals a novel form of synaptic modulation where M13 impacts information transfer at nerve terminals by controlling both vesicle priming and the trigger for exocytosis. The presence of M13 has a potent influence on voltage-gated calcium channel function and delineates a new class of mechanisms for sculpting synaptic efficacy. The dependence of exytosis on calcium influx and control of voltage-gated channels on fast scales implies synaptic throughput can be actively controlled by voltage-gated channel-active zone interactions. M13 interacts with voltage-gated channels in a way that controls calcium channel dependence on millisecond to second time scales at nerve terminals, with a critical site pinpointed to two basic residues within the C2 domain of M13. This interaction enhances calcium influx and modulates kinetic properties of voltage-gated channels across a range of stimulation conditions, with implications for understanding synaptic transmission control. Removing M13 results in a 94% depletion of the protein at nerve terminals, blocking exytosis, and altering action-driven calcium influx. Rescue experiments suggest the increase in exytosis during paired pulses is a direct effect of the lack of M13-voltage-gated channel interaction, not a secondary effect of reduced exytosis. The interaction site in M13's C2 domain mediates voltage-gated channel reactivation in nerve terminals.
The shape and function of plant cells are highly interdependent, with puzzle-shaped cells in the epidermis of many plants being a striking example of complex cell shape, but their functional benefit has remained elusive. Researchers propose that these intricate forms provide an effective strategy to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall of the epidermis. When tissue growth is isotropic, lobes emerge at the cellular level to prevent the formation of isodiametric cells that would bulge under stress produced by turgor pressure. Data from various plant organs and species support the relationship between lobes and growth isotropy, tested with mutants where growth direction is perturbed. Simulation models show a mechanism regulating cellular stress plausibly reproduces the development of epmal shape, suggesting mechanical stress is a key driver of cell-shape morphogenesis.

Puzzle-shaped cells in the epider of many plant species emerge from a mechanism to limit mechanical stress in tissues that grow isotropically, such as the epider of leaves and cotyledons. FEM analysis of 3D pressized cells shows cell shape influences the direction and magnitude of mechanical stress exerted on the cell. When epmal cell becomes large in two directions, stress is greatly increased. The puzzle shape, with lobes and indentations, provides a solution to avoid excessive stress in tissues growing two directions, such as the surface of broad leaves. Analyzing stress in a model of the cotyled epider of Arabidopsis thalian, stems, roots, and sili, growth is strongly anisotropic and cells can elongate, but not possible for isodiam organs such as broad leaves, cotyled, and silicle pods.

Puzzle cells in epider of isodiam organs provide means to avoid large areas in cell and high stresses. The correspondence between fruit shape and puzzle epmal cells fits the prediction that puzzle shapes are required to allow cells to enlarge in isotropically growing tissues but not in elongated organs. The model predicts plant cells regulate shape to prevent LEC, a proxy for stress, from becoming large. The puzzle shape is an adaptation to developmental constraint related to mechanical forces acting on turg plant cells in epider. Mechanically, plant cells are small balloons with considerable turg pressure up to 10 bar in Arabidopsis leaf, reaching 50 bar in specialized cells such as stomata. Researchers propose a function for the puzzle as an adaptation to developmental constraint related to mechanical forces acting on turg plant cells that reside in epider.
Human genes contain multiple introns, necessitating mechanisms to define exons and ensure their proper connection by spliceosomes. Spliceosome assembly involves both cross-intron and cross-exon interactions, but how these work together is unclear. Researchers examined human nuclear extracts dynamic interactions of single pre-mRNA molecules with fluorescently tagged spliceosomal complexes to investigate cross-intron and cross-exon processes promoting pre-splice assembly. U1 complex bound to the 5' splice site of an intron acts jointly with U1 bound to the 5' site of the next intron, increasing the rate and efficiency of U2 complex recruitment to the branch/3 splice site of the upstream intron. The flanking 5 splice sites have greater than additive effects, implying distinct mechanisms facilitating U recruitment. This synergy of 5 splice sites across introns and exons likely promotes correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs. An ordered pre-splice assembly pathway is suggested where stable U2 association in the presence of ATP requires prior U1 binding. In multi-intron preRNAs, internal exons have 5S both upstream and downstream, either of which could bind U1 and act to recruit U2 to 3S. The dynamics of U binding the 5S are largely unaffected by U2 sites positioned downstream or upstream of the 5S. Pre-splice can form on multi-intron preRNAs through two pathways, an intron recognition via cross-intron interactions or cross-exon interactions where exons are defined. Collaboration between flanking 5S increases the rate of stable U2 recruitment during pre-splice formation, a major contributor to exon inclusion. The presence of a downstream U does not affect lifetimes of stable U2 complexes once formed. U1-U2 pre-splice forms across the intron, interactions with U bound to the downstream 5S provide additional U2 stabilization or stimulation of subsequent steps of splice assembly. Implementing CoSM in extracts from human cells expressing tagged proteins shows collaboration between flanking 5S dramatically increases the rate of stable U2 recruitment during pre-splice formation, contributing to accurate splicing of multi-intron preRNAs.
Researchers have discovered a novel folding system that assists membrane proteins on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum, specifically the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6, which requires help to fold efficiently. The folding of LRP6 is promoted by ubiquination of a specific lysine, retaining it in the ER while avoiding degradation. Subsequent ER exit requires removal of ubiquitin from this lysine by the deubiquinating enzyme USP19. This ubiquination-deubiquination is reminiscent of glucylation-deglucylation occurring in the ER lumen during the calnex/calretulin cycle. To avoid futile cycles, folded LRP molecules undergo palmitation and export, while unsuccessfully folded proteins are polyubiquinated on other lysines and targeted to degradation. The ubiquitin-dependent system controls proteostasis of other membrane proteins, such as CFTR and anthrax receptor 2, involved in severe diseases. Upon ubiquination on Lys-140, LRP interacts with an ubiquitin-binding protein acting as a chaperone, providing time to fold. If folding is successful, LRP is transported out of the ER, favored by palmitation. If folding is impaired, polyubiquination of other lysines targets LRP to ERAD. The identified ubiquination-deubiquination assisted-folding cycle operates on other membrane proteins, including CFTR and anthrax receptor 2. Following synthesis, LRP undergoes ubiquination on Lys-140, likely a specific form, and if folding is delayed, polyubiquination targets L6 to ERAD. The Lys140-ubiqu can interact with putative ER-ubiqu binding protein acting as chone, and upon release, L6 is deubiquinated by USP19. This system is analogous to newly synthesized mono-glucylated proteins binding calnex in ER lumen. Loss of function of CFTR and anthrax receptor 2 leads to diseases, such as Hyaline Fibromatosis. The ubiquitin-dependent folding machinery operates on the cytos side of ER, showing that following synthesis, L6 undergoes ubiquination, and if folding is successful, is transported out of ER, and if not, polyubiquinated and targeted to degradation.
Research has shown that sex-based modulation of cognitive processes may contribute to individual differences in vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders, with value-based decision making being a key area of interest. While overall performance in decision-making tasks often shows minimal sex differences, computational tools can uncover latent variables that define decision approaches. A study examined sex differences in mice in a classic value-based decision task, the restless two-armed bandit, and found that male and female mice achieved similar accuracy through different patterns of exploration. Male mice made more exploratory choices, getting "stuck" in exploration once started, whereas female mice explored less but learned quickly. The results suggest sex influences decision-making during learning and exploration periods rather than stable choices. Exploration during decision-making is altered in people with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing neural mechanisms of exploration as a translational avenue for sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.

Male and female mice were trained on an explore-exploit task, a restless two-armed bandit, and males showed higher levels of exploration throughout. Computational tools characterized sex differences in latent variables to understand reward-guided behaviors, balancing exploration, and exploitation. The results revealed significant sex differences in exploration and learning rates. Post-hoc win-stay-shift analyses found female mice displayed more win-stay behaviors, repeating behaviors that produced rewards on the previous trial. The study used a combination of modeling approaches to characterize sex differences in a canonical explore-exploit task and found males and females used different explore-exploit strategies to learn the environment despite similar performance. The findings indicate sex mechanisms biasing preferred approaches during tasks contribute to performance and are significant contributors to task variability across species. The study highlights the importance of understanding how sex, explore-exploit states, and outcomes interact to influence choices and decision-making, particularly in the context of neuropsychiatric disorders.
Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD) is a process where membrane proteins are ubiquitinated, extracted from the membrane, and degraded by the proteasome, with the cytosolic ATPase Cdc48 driving extraction by pulling polyubiquinated substrates. The mechanism of how hydrophobic transmembrane segments are moved from the phospholipid bilayer into cytosol, together with hydrophil and folded ER luminal parts, is not well understood. Using a reconstituted system with purified proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, researchers have shown that the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 is a retrotransase that facilitates membrane extraction. The substrate's TM segment interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Doa and passively moves into the aqueous phase, while luminal segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state. Unfolding occurs on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasmic Cdc action, revealing how a membrane-bound retrotransase cooperates with the Cdc ATPase in membrane extraction. Doa10 is a 150 kDa protein with 14 TM segments and has been suggested to act as a retrotransase for membrane proteins, along with other multipass transmembrane proteins such as Derlin family members, Hrd1, and Do10. The folding state of luminal domains during retrolocation has been unclear, whether moved in a folded state, unfolding prior to retrolocation, or directly coupled to retrolocation. Quality pathways for membrane proteins require extraction from the membrane exist not only in ER, but in other organelles like Golgi, mitochondria, and chloroplast, dependent on ubiquination and C48 for proteomal degradation in cytosol. The reconstituted system allowed mechanistic investigation of membrane extraction without indirect readouts, showing Do10 cooperates with Cdc ATPase in extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains, providing insight into ERAD mediated by ubiquitin ligase Do10 from S cerevisiae.
Hedgehog (H) proteins play a crucial role in guiding development and maintaining tissue homeostasis in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Aberrant H protein production, distribution, and responses are common causes of developmental defects and cancer, including holoprosencephaly, limb abnormalities, medulloblastoma, and basal carcinoma. In Drosophila, H signaling induces transcriptional changes in target cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Ci proteins to transcriptional repressors and activating full-length Ci proteins. Researchers used Ci variants expressed at physiological levels to investigate the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent H signaling in Dophila wing imaginal discs. The results showed that Ci variants that cannot be processed supported a normal pattern of graded gene activation and development of adults with normal wing morphology when supplemented by constitutive repressor. This indicates that H can signal normally in the absence of regulated processing. The processing-resistant Ci variants were also activated in the absence of H by elimination of Cos2, likely through binding the CORD domain of Ci or PKA, revealing separate inhibitory roles of these components in addition to their roles in promoting Ci processing. Furthermore, Ci variants supported the development of adults with normal patterning provided a constitutive source of repressor was present to suppress ectopic expression in anterior cells. Thus, Ci can mediate H morphogen action in wing discs in the absence of regulated processing. The Ci profile was similar to wild-type with robust H-stimulated reduction in the posterior part of the AP border. In third instar Drosila wing discs, H is expressed in posterior cells and Ci in anterior cells, H signals to a band of cells at the AP border with declining strength from posterior to anterior. The results show that wing patterning by H does not require regulation of the level of repressor or full-length protein by processing. Animals lacking Fu and Su also develop normal wings, although third instar discs lack anterior induction. Overall, the study demonstrates that H can act as a morphogen in the absence of regulated Ci processing and highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of H signaling in development and disease.
Researchers have identified a network of excitatory neurons in the spinal dorsal horn that play a crucial role in pain processing and amplification. The study utilized optogenetics to selectively activate spinal interneurons expressing the calcium-binding protein calretinin, demonstrating that these interneurons form an interconnected network capable of initiating and sustaining excitatory signaling and directly relaying signals to lamina I projection neurons. Activation of these interneurons resulted in significant nocifensive behavior that was morphine sensitive, caused conditioned aversion, and was enhanced by nerve injury, while halorhodin-mediated inhibition elevated sensory thresholds. The findings suggest that dorsal horn circuits involving excitatory neurons are important for pain generation and amplification, identifying these interneurons as a potential analgesic target. The results confirm that calretinin neurons form an excitatory network in the dorsal horn contributing to spinal signaling and amplifying pain signals in the absence of peripheral input. The strong interconnectivity of this neurochemically-defined subpopulation positions them to alter sensory information prior to its relay to higher centers, demonstrated by the nocifensive responses elicited by photostimulation. The study focused on characterizing microcircuits and their roles in sensory experience through optogenetic activation, with future work needed to determine circuit responses during peripherally evoked processing. Several groups have implicated neurochemically-distinct subpopulations of dorsal horn interneurons in acute and chronic pain perception. Current models place calretinin neurons in polysynaptic circuits signaling through SOM neurons to activate lamina projection and initiate pain, compatible with data showing CR-Ch2 photostimulation evoking EPSCs in dorsal neurons including superficial populations. The observations extend the view of excitatory interneurons in sensory processing, ascribing a role beyond low threshold modality innocuous input to excite nociceptive circuitry. The study highlights the importance of clarifying neuronal circuits in the spinal dorsal horn to understand dysfunction leading to pathological pain and identifies calretinin neurons as a potential target for analgesic intervention.
Mutations in the gene encoding Ras-associated protein 23 (R23) cause Carpenter Syndrome, characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities including polysyndactyly and defects in skull morphogenesis. To understand how R23 regulates skull development, R23-deficient mice were generated that survive to an age where skeletal development can be studied. Along with polysyactyly, these mice exhibit premature fusion of sutures resultant from aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture. FGF-driven FGFR1 signaling is elevated in R23-/- sutures with consequent imbalance in MAPK, Hedgehog and RUN2 expression. Inhibition of elevated pER1/2 signaling results in normalization of osteopitor proliferation with concomitant reduction of osteogenic expression and prevention of craniosynostosis. R23 deficient mice exhibited polysyndyacty and craniosynoses similar to Carpenter syndrome patients, with disruption of R23 leading to upregulation of Pit2, Fgf and Ffrb expression, decreased p38 and enhanced pER1-RX signaling along with osteoprogen proliferation. R23 regulates the sutural stem cell marker GL1, represses Hh and inhibits osteoprogen expansion. R23 represses FGF-driven pER1 signaling which regulates osteoprogen development, RUNX-mediated differentiation and repress GL1. R23 coordinates suture biogenesis by regulating FGF-ER1-RX activity and activation of GL. R23 controls suture morphogenesis through FGF-p1 signaling, repression of H targets and repression of GL1 by p1. FGF-p1 and H signaling regulate osteoprogen cell proliferation. Overlapping skeletal phenotypes caused by mutations in FGFR, H regulators and R23 are suggestive of common etiological mechanisms. F and H signaling have roles during intramembranous osteogenesis, regulating mesenchal condensation, osteoprogen proliferation and RUN2 activation. Inhibition of p1 normalized osteop proliferation, corrected GL and RUN expressions and rescued lamboid suture fusion. R23 is an upstream regulator of F-p1 and H-GL and additional regulation of GL by p to coordinate osteogenesis.
The inheritance of gene expression states is crucial for cells to remember past events, such as environmental or developmental cues. The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants and modifies chromatin at its targets, allowing histones modified by PR2 to be inherited through cell division. However, it remains unclear whether this inheritance directs long-term memory of individual gene states, known as cis memory, or if local chromatin states are dictated by concentrations of diffusible factors, known as trans. To address this, researchers monitored the expression of two copies of the Arabidopsis Polycomb target FLOWERING LOCUS (LC) in the same plants and found that one copy can be repressed while the other is active. This mixed expression state is inherited through many cell divisions as plants develop, demonstrating epigenetic memory of LC expression is stored in cis, not trans. The study utilized the epigenetic process vernalization in Arabidopsis, where vernalization is the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure, mediated by cold-induced epigen repression of the Polycomb target and floral repressor LC. LC repression requires PR2 but is independent of DNA methylation, making it a useful system for studying cis-memory capability of Polycomb at a single gene. In vernalized plants, LC expression is bistable, with the number of cells in which LC stably repressed increasing quantitatively with the duration of prior cold exposure. The researchers developed an assay to visualize mitotic heritability of LC states at the single-cell level and crossed LC-mCherry to LC-Venus plants to generate F1 hybrids carrying a single copy of each transgene. The results showed that epigen memory can be stored locally in the chromatin environment of individual genes, in the form of post-translational modifications of histones, rather than in concentrations of diffus regulatory factors maintained through feedback loops. This study demonstrates that Polycomb-repressed chromatin at a single gene instructs its own epigenetic inheritance and constitutes a cis memory system, providing insight into the long-term memory of individual gene states.
Researchers investigated the structure and function of oligomers formed by the endoplasmic retic reticulum Hsp70 chaperone BiP, using site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking to probe their architecture. The results showed that adjacent protomers engage the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate site of another, attenuating the chaper function of oligomeric BiP. Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapidly-modulated relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers and slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive covalently-modified BiP. Lumen ER calcium depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian Bi and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding, indicating the relative inertness of oligomers. The equilibration between inactive oligomers and active monomeric Bi is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale attainable neither by interconversion of active and covalently-modified Bi nor the conventional unfolded response. BiP oligization is rapidly tuned to the physiological state of the cell and given oligomerization inactivates participating Bi protomers, making the oligomeric form a relatively inactive storage of chaper accessible on a short timescale. Findings are consistent with a model where competition between oligomerization and substrate buffers ER against rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load in both directions. The affinity of Hsp proteins for substrates is governed by protein-driven non-equilibrium mechanisms, allowing BiP to favor itself as client over other clients as calcium declines. Calcium depletion shifts the equilibrium between unfolded proteins and chaperones in favor of the former. The inverse correlation between unfolded protein burden and Bi oligomerization breaks down in the context of calcium depletion, which induces UPR and promotes Bi oligomerization. Enhanced production of unfolded proteins draws on the pool of inactive oligeric Bi to service its growing clientele. Reports of oligomers in stressed cells may reflect partitioning excess chaper produced during UPR made redundant following resolution. Exploring the relationship between unfolded load and oligeric Hsp chaperones is confounded by feedback dominating unfolded responses coupling chaper production to unfolded stress levels.
Flexible filamentous viruses are economically important plant pathogens that contain hundreds of copies of helically arrayed coat protein protecting a positive-sense single-stranded RNA. The near-atomic cryo-electron microscopy structure of Pepino mosaic virus, a representative of the Potexvirus family, has been determined at 3.9 Å resolution, allowing modeling of the coat protein and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of Pepino mosaic virus coat protein resembles that of nucleoproteins from the Phlebovirus, a group of enveloped negative-sense RNA viruses. The main difference between potexvirus coat and phlebovirus is in their C-terminal extensions, which determine the characteristics of distinct multimer assemblies, a flexuous helical rod or loose ribonucleoprotein. This homology suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic positive and negative-sense RNA viruses. The structural homology between the coat of flexuous viruses and nucleoproteins of Phlebovirus, a group of enveloped viruses with segmented negative-sense genome, has been found. Nucleoproteins from phleboviruses are associated with the viral genome in loose ribonucleoproteins inside an envelope, which glycoproteins construct icosahedral shell. Flexible filamentous viruses are non-enveloped flexible rod-shaped virions containing hundreds of copies of coat protein arranged helically, protecting positive-sense RNA. High-resolution structures for flexuous filamentous plant viruses correspond to representatives of Potexvirus family, including current data and previously reported structures of PapMV and BaMV. Members of other families of flexuous filamentous viruses may have similar fold in their coat proteins. Both potvirus coat and phlebovirus nucleoproteins bind and protect the genomic single-stranded RNA.
Antibody binding to cell surface proteins plays a crucial role in immunity, and the location of an epitope can determine the immunological outcome of host interaction. Current techniques for epitope identification are costly and time-consuming, making them unsuitable for high-throughput analysis. Fast and efficient screening of epitope location can aid in the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines. Cellular morphology varies, and antibodies bind heterogeneously across the surface, making traditional particle-averaging strategies challenging for accurate localization. A new method, SiteLoc, has been developed for imaging-based molecular localization on cellular proteins, achieving nanometer resolution through localization in one dimension, the distance from a bound ligand to a reference, using topological averaging. This method is suited for antibody site measurements on native surface morphology and can be applied to other molecular estimations. Fast and efficient screening of epitope locations is useful for therapeutic development, while averaging methods for nanometer localization exist but do not work for binding sites on proteins with heterogeneous expression. Knowing the location of epitope aids mechanistic understanding and facilitates therapeutic development. Super-resolution techniques achieve ~10 nm resolution but are costly and require complex sample preparation. Binding site localization is based on resolving axial distance between ligands and surface by implementing averaging on high-resolution images, achieving nanometer precision by reducing surface data within an image. Site measurement on antibody-coated bacteria is exemplified, and the method can estimate molecular heights on spherical and non-spherical surfaces. Site measurements for ligands on bacterial protein agree with reported data, and antibody Fc site on protein is located at a specific region. Non-specific monoclonal IgG antibody is used for localization, demonstrating the method's ability to accurately estimate molecular binding sites on native cell surfaces with nanometer precision.
Cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia is a complex process regulated by various factors, including peripheral resistance in tissue capillary beds. The relationship between central control of vascular flow and peripheral resistance is not fully understood, particularly in response to hypoxic conditions. Researchers investigated the role of hypoxic response in individual tissues and its effect on systemic adaptation to oxygen deprivation, focusing on the skin as a model for peripheral tissue with substantial vascular bed. They found that hypoxic response via HIF transcription factors in the skin influences cardiovascular response to hypoxia in mice, affecting parameters such as heart rate, arterial pressures, and body temperature. This study demonstrates a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in peripheral tissue modifying cardiovascular response to hypoxia. Peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing in the skin play an essential role in systemic response, showing tissues can adapt to hypoxia. Analysis of hypox-responsive genes in skin revealed a decrease in temperature in mice lacking HIF-1α in keratinocytes. Experiments using 10% oxygen challenge showed significant changes in systemic pressures and cutaneous temperatures in mice lacking HIF1α, H2, NOS, and Arg1 expression. Keratinocyte HIF1 and H2 expression affects immediate and chronic phases of cardiovascular response to hypia, with hypia heightening sympathetic tone in skin to increase peripheral resistance. A proposed model for hypoxic responses involves HIF isoform and nitric oxide homeostasis, where hypia results in H1α/N2/NO increase in vascular diameter and perfusion, followed by H2/Arg-induced reduction of intracellular L-arginine. This study provides the first demonstration of a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in peripheral tissue directly modifying cardiovascular response to hypia, highlighting the importance of peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing in cardiovascular adaptation to hypox.
Researchers have developed a refined optogenetic method for mapping that enables measurements of functional connectivity with single-neuron resolution by expanding two-photon beam imaging in the plane using temporal focusing and restricting channelrhodopsin to the soma and proximal dendrites. This approach allows for the reliable evocation of action potentials in individual neurons, verification of spike generation with GCaMPs, and determination of the presence or absence of synaptic connections with patch-clamp electrophysiological recording. Optical activation of single neurons using two-photon excitation of caged neurotransmitters or optogen probes, such as channelrhodopsin, provides a powerful approach for assessing synaptic connections of single neurons. Optogen mapping utilizing channelrhodin and its variants has increased flexibility and precision, but leaves an indeterminate regions coinciding with the dendritic arbors of the recorded neuron, which can extend 200µm or more around the soma. Unintended activation of fibers of passage or local axonal boutons responding to temporal two-photon excitation can also compromise the optogen approach. Combining temporal focusing two-photon activation of channelrhodin with restriction to the soma and proximal dendrites yields a reliable method for evaluating synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution. The synaptic organization of neurons into circuits is the basis for interpreting sensory input and producing behavioral responses. Understanding connectivity patterns among distinct neurons is critical for elucidating circuit function and requires methods that map connectivity with single-cell resolution. This study demonstrates the ability to use optogen stimulation to selectively target single neurons by restricting channelrhodin expression to the soma and proximal dendrites, overcoming limitations of previous approaches where opsins expressed throughout dendritic and axon fields generated confounding light-induced responses. By doing so, it provides a method to map functional connectivity with single-neuron resolution, critical for understanding neural circuit function.
The interaction mode of transcription factors on eukaryotic genomes remains a topic of debate, with single-molecule data for Sox2 and Oct4 previously interpreted as evidence of ordered assembly on DNA. However, a rigorous biophysical analysis reveals that the quantity calculated does not determine binding order but rather energy away from thermodynamic equilibrium, leading to the concept of reciprocity. Single-molecule data implies Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit negative reciprocity, with expression of Sox2 increasing Oct4's genomic binding but expression of Oct4 decreasing Sox2's binding. Models show negative reciprocity can arise from energy expenditure or a mixture of positive and negative cooperativity at distinct genomic loci, implying complexity in transcription factor interaction on DNA. The analysis found the sign of reciprocity is different from ordered assembly, with Sox2 and Oct4 sometimes helping and hindering each other across the genome, which is unexpected but not surprising given transcription factors exhibit different cooperativities at different loci. The implications of this finding need to be addressed in future studies, with the most intriguing consequence being the possibility of energy expenditure in the action of Sox2 and Oct on DNA. Evidence of mixed cooperativity or energy has not been found in living cells, suggesting complexity in how Sox2 and Oct interact on DNA, with single-molecule methods offering capabilities for unraveling mechanisms. The variation in sign of cooperativity across the genome has significant ramifications, providing more information when coupled with experimental strategy, and a single number can suggest Sox2 and Oct exhibit positive and negative cooperativity genomic loci in vivo. The genomic-diversity model suggests energy expenditure maintains loci away from thermodynamic equilibrium or mixed cooperativity with Sox and Oct helping or hindering at other loci.
Detecting pathogens and mounting immune responses upon infection is crucial for animal health, but these responses come at a high metabolic cost, and avoiding pathogens before infection may be advantageous. Bacterial endotoxins lipopolysaccharides are important immune system cues, but it remains unknown whether animals possess sensory mechanisms to detect them prior to infection. Drosophila melanaster display strong aversive responses to lipopolysaccharides and gustatory neurons expressing Gr66 bitter receptors mediate avoidance of lipopolysaccharides in feeding and egg laying assays. The expression of the chemosensory cation channel TRPA1 in these cells is necessary and sufficient for lipopolysaccharide avoidance. Lipopolysaccharides stimulate Drosila neurons in a TRPA-dependent manner and activate exogenous TRPA channels in human cells. The findings demonstrate flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TRPA activation as a conserved molecular mechanism. TRPA mediates acute nocensive responses to lipopolaccharides in mice and avoidance of bitter and noxious compounds in Drosila. Blocking neurotransmission in neurons by expressing tetanus toxin abolished lipopolysaccharide avoidance, indicating flies detect lipopolyscharides through a gustatory mechanism. The avoidance of lipopolyscharide-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may serve to prevent Gram-negative bacterial infections, potentially compensating for the lack of adaptive immunity in these animals. The sensory mechanism exploits TRPA, suggesting a broadly conserved principle where channels play a crucial role in lipopolysaccharide detection by sensory neurons in flies and mammals, regardless of the sensory modality involved. The data show lipopolysaccharide is avoided during feeding and oviposition and TR1 expression in bitter-sensing gustatory neurons is necessary and sufficient for lipysaccharide avoidance, serving to prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Control animals preferred laying eggs on control food rather than on contaminated food with lipopolysaccharides, whereas TR1 mutants did not. Lipopolyscharides stimulate Drosila neurons in TR1-dependent manner and activate exogenous TR1 channels in human cells, demonstrating a conserved molecular mechanism of detection and avoidance of bacterial endotoxins via TR1 activation.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the zinc finger protein Zfp335 in the formation of the naïve T cell compartment, a critical for immune function. A mouse mutant, bloto, with a hypomorphic mutation in Zfp335, exhibits a naïve T cell deficiency due to an intrinsic developmental defect that begins in the thymus and continues into the periphery, affecting cells that have recently undergone thymic egress. The effects of Zfpbloto are multigenic and cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation, or Bcl-dependent survival. Zfp binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its target genes are enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcription regulation. Restoring expression of one target, Ankle2, partially rescues T maturation, indicating Zfp as a transcription factor essential for late-stage intrathym and post-thic cell maturation. Analyzing mice with a hypomorphic missense mutation in a C2 zinc finger of Zfp reveals a selective defect in accumulation of naïve cells resulting from maturation block in SP thymocytes and recent thym emigrants. Zfp regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes, with decreased occupancy at a subset altering gene expression in mutant thymocytes. Findings provide evidence Zfp functions as a transcription factor and key regulator of transcription program for T maturation. Ankle is a functional gene of Zfp, its dysregulation by ZfpR2W contributes to maturation defect in blt cells, shown by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis. An ENU-induced allele of Zfp results in defective accumulation of naïve cells due to impaired maturation in SP thymocytes and recent thymic emigrants, independent of thym selection or effects on proliferation but associated with reduced viability. Focusing on genes with clear evidence of reduced Zfp occupancy and mRNA, Ankle is prominent, an an ankyrin repeat and LEM-containing protein. Zfp335 is required for formation of the naïve T compartment and essential regulator of late-stage intrath and post-thym cell maturation.
Researchers have identified a new factor, termed mRNA-ncRNA avoidance, that influences protein expression levels in bacteria and archaea, challenging the assumption that mRNA abundance directly correlates with protein abundance. Studies have shown that mRNA features such as codon usage and secondary structure contribute to discrepancies between mRNA and protein levels, but a new evidence suggests stochastic mRNA-nc interactions also play a significant role. By analyzing 97% of species, a reduced capacity for interaction between native RNAs relative to controls was found, indicating a strong selection for avoidance of stochastic mRNA-nc interactions across prokaryotes, which has a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. Generating synonymous variant green fluorescent protein mRNAs with varying potential for mRNA-nc interactions demonstrated that GFP levels correlate with avoidance, enabling precise modulation of protein abundance. Measuring extrinsic avoidance using shuffled mRNAs as controls revealed stochastic mRNA-nc interactions are underrepresented in 73% of prokaryotic phyla, establishing a signature of selection that minimizes interactions. However, complete avoidance is combinatorially unlikely due to thousands of potential interacting RNA species, suggesting a tradeoff between avoidance and optimal expression. Results indicate avoidance explains variation in protein abundance as well as codon usage and internal mRNA structure, and crosstalk between mRNAs and ncRNAs impacts expression levels. Taking crosstalk into account may enable design of constructs where protein levels can be precisely controlled, predicting mAs with low avoidance produce fewer proteins per transcript than those with high avoidance. Meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data revealed statistically significant regions with high correlation coefficient throughout GFP mRNAs, supporting the relationship between mRNA-nc avoidance and protein levels. These findings provide evidence that stochastic mRNA-nc interactions can be harnessed to control protein expression in bacteria and archaea.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by upper and lower motor neuron loss, with loss of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) being a key pathological event in patients and animal models of the disease. Denervation of NMJs is observed prior to symptom onset and is considered an early event in ALS, however, it remains unclear whether it is the first manifestation of a globally degenerating motor neuron. Using in vivo imaging of single axons and NMJs over a three-month period in SOD1G37 mice, researchers identified that single motor-units are dismantled asynchronously. The dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous new axonal sprouting resulting in synapse formation onto nearby NMJs, weeks prior to complete axonal degeneration. Denervation tends to propagate from the first lost NMJ, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. These results show that NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex and dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of sudden global neuron degeneration. Longitudinal in vivo analysis reveals previously unsuspected dynamism at the NM in an animal model of ALS, highlighting a temporal window between early branch-specific dismantling and global axon degeneration that could be therapeutically exploited. Local alterations of synaptic and molecular signaling take place early at the NM, suggesting local-specific events may play a key role in NM denervation. Rescue of neuronal loss in S1 mice does not necessarily improve NM denervation, indicating local branch-specific events contribute to NMJ denervation. The study used repeated in vivo imaging of motor neuron arbors and NMJs to assess the time and dynamics of structural changes during ALS progression, predicting a MU-dependent mechanism would result in more or less synchronous degeneration of the whole MU over a brief period, while a contribution of neuuscular changes would result in asynchronous loss of NMJs within a single MU. Early NMJ denervation is observed prior to significant MN or cell loss, but whether it arises from branch-specific degeneration or is globally degenerating neuron remains ill-defined. Overall, NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of global neuron degeneration.
Adjuvant tamoxifen therapy improves survival in breast cancer patients, but long-term treatment comes with side effects that impact health and quality of life, including hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. Research has been hindered by a lack of proven animal models, making it unclear which tissues and cells mediate these negative effects. Mice undergoing tamox treatment experience changes in temperature, bone, and movement. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals tamox treatment induces widespread gene changes in the hypothalamus and preoptic area, dependent on estrogen receptor alpha. Conditional knockout of estrogen receptor alpha in the hypothus-PO ablates or reverses tamox-induced gene expression. Estrogen alpha-deficient mice do not exhibit tamox-induced changes in temperature, bone, or movement. Estrogen receptor expression in the hypothusPO is necessary for tamox-induced gene expression and effects on thermoregulation, bone, and movement. Tamox treatment modulates estrogen receptor signaling in the central system to alter fundamental aspects of physiology. Estrogen receptor mediates many aspects of physiology and estrogen conditional knockout affects transcriptomic effects of tamox. Loss of estrogen receptor affects physiological responses to tamox in mice, including body temperature, movement, and bone density. Estrogen beta is also expressed in hypothusPO but physical activity is primarily regulated by estrogen signaling. Tamox acts as estrogen antagonist in estrogen-sensitive regions to suppress physical activity. Similar to endogenous estrogens, tamox has effects on bone remodeling. The study defines cell types and mechanisms mediating undesirable effects of tamox therapy, demonstrating mice as a model to study tamox physiological effects, including increased heat, decreased movement, and bone density. The rodent model mimics key effects of endocrine therapy observed in humans, implicating estrogen signaling as mediator of tamox effects on thermoregulation, movement and homeostasis.
Interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) is a linear ubiquitin-like protein with known for its anti-viral activity, but its role during bacterial infections remains unclear. Recent research reveals that ISG15 expression in non-phagocytic cells is significantly induced upon Listeria monocytogenes infection. This induction can occur independently of type I interferon and relies on the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. Notably, IS15 restricts Lister infection both in vitro and in vivo. Utilizing stable isotope labeling in tissue culture (SILAC), researchers identified ISGylated proteins responsible for the protective effect. Overexpression of IS15 leads to ISylation of endoplasmic retic reticulum (ER) and Golgi proteins, correlating with increased secretion of cytokines known to counteract infection. Collectively, the data reveal a previously uncharacterized IS15-dependent restriction of Lister infection, reinforcing IS15 as a key component of the innate immune response. In nonphocytic cells, IS15 is dramatically induced upon Lister infection in an interfer-independent manner. Lister-mediated IS15 induction depends on the cytosolic surveillance pathway sensing bacterial DNA through STING, TBK, IRF3, IRF7. IS15 counteracts Lister infection in vitro and in vivo. IS15 modification of ER and Golgi proteins increases secretion of cytokines known to counteract infection. IS15 can be induced by Lister in an interfer-independent manner in human nonphocytic cells. The role of IS15 in host defense against Lister requires ISylation. IS15 is a ubiquitin modifier covalently linked to cellular and viral substrates. Transcripts are concomitantly induced after 3 hours of infection with Lister, leading to the hypothesis that IS15 could be induced in interfer-independent during Lister infection. Utilizing viral protein B18 to block interferon receptor signaling, the hypothesis was tested. The protein acts similarly to a blocking antibody.
Single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer (smFRET) is a method for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules, but the development of high-throughput methodologies and instrumentation has outpaced the development of rapid and standardized analysis methods to objectively analyze the wealth of produced data. DeepFRET is an automated, open-source solution based on deep learning, requiring only human intervention in setting a user-adjustable quality threshold to transition from raw images to histograms of biomolecule behavior. Integrating standard features of smFRET analysis, DeepRET outputs common kinetic metrics with accuracy on ground truth data reaching over 95%, outperforming human operators and commonly used thresholds, requiring only 1% of the time. DeepFRET's precise and rapid operation demonstrates its capacity to objectively quantify biomolecular dynamics, contributing to benchmarking smFRET for structural biology.

DeepFRET is an all-inclusive software with a pre-trained deep neural network at its core for rapid, objective, and accurate assessment of smRET data, quantifying biomolecular dynamics with minimal human intervention, requiring only a threshold on data quality as an initial step to output detailed quantification of structural dynamics from images. The software operates without extensive preprocessing or empirically defined rules, offering reproducible and less opinionated evaluation of single-molecule data, and is significantly faster than human annotation for large datasets. DeepFRET recognizes patterns and learns features directly from raw data, allowing implementation of routines that do not require preprocessing, and comes as a free-to-use executable for Windows and Mac users, enabling end-users with limited programming skills to operate it.

DeepFRET's classification was achieved without preprocessing or post-inspection, illustrating its power to operate without human intervention, and potential to benchmark reproducibility of smFRET data methods for multiple biomolecular systems across laboratories. The discordance between ground truth and classified data was quantified and displayed using a confusion matrix, demonstrating DeepRET's accuracy. The development of DeepRET and similar approaches is expected to enable fully automated methodologies for biomolecular recognition, protein folding, and dynamics, and super-resolution, increasing the breadth and impact of single-molecule studies in structural biology.
The Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) is essential for epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and SCML2, a mammalian homolog of Drosophila SCM, is a Polycomb-group protein that associates with RC1. SCMLA, an SC2 isoform tightly associated with chromatin, contributes to RC1 localization and directly enforces repression of certain Polycomb target genes. SC2 binds RC1 via its SPM domain and interacts with ncRNAs through a novel RNA-binding region (R). Targeting of SC2 to chromatin involves coordinated action of MBT domains, RNA binding, and interaction with RC through the SPM domain. Deletion of R reduces occupancy of SC2 at target and overexpression of mutant SC2 lacking R causes defects in RC recruitment. SC2 appears to enforce repression directly, independent of RC recruitment, via mechanisms that remain to be elucidated. The identification of SC2 as Pc protein that binds RNA and contributes to repression of Polycomb targets sheds light on interplay between ncRN and epigen regulation and combinatorial factors that drive specificity of diverse Pc complexes. RNA binding plays role in SC function as required for localization to chromatin. Interaction of SCM and RC relies on C-terminal SPM domain conserved in humans. Data supports model where R contributes to localization of SC2 to chromatin, interacts with RC, and creates chromatin environment refractory to transcription. SC2 binds at least one Pc target and recognized methylated lysines by MB domain, RNA activity required to recruit or stabilize SC on chrom. SC retained at genes through interaction with RC and contributes stabilizing RC. SC recruited to target through RNA activity and presence of mutant SC2R not chrom-bound causes partial release of BMI and RC. SC binds RNA through R required for genome-wide targeting and recruitment of RC.
Regulation of translating ribosomes is a crucial component of gene expression control, and in Escherichia coli, ribosome stalling by the C-terminal sequence of SecM regulates the SecA-dependent pathway. Researchers have used cryo-EM to determine the structures of SecM-stalled ribosomes at 3.3-3.7 Å resolution, revealing two distinct stalling mechanisms at different elongation steps of the translation cycle. One mechanism involves inactivation of the ribosomal peptidyl-transfer center, inhibiting peptide bond formation with incoming proly-tRNA, while the other involves prolonged residence of peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid/P site, inhibiting full-scale tRNA translocation. To understand the molecular mechanism of Sec-dependent translational stalling, researchers purified Sec-stalled ribosome nascent chain complexes and analyzed their structures using single particle cryoEM, revealing two mechanisms of stalling and providing details on how SecM nascent peptide modulates translation in distinct steps. The analysis of ribosome-Sec interactions at near-atomic level shows interactions between SecM and the exit tunnel induce conformation changes of the peptidyl-transfer center, leading to translation arrest at distinct elongation steps, including peptide-bond formation and tRNA translocation. The position of tRNA-nascent linkage of Sec-tRNA is similar to that seen in the structure of the ribosome with active peptid-transfer center. Comparison with reference states of ribosomes capable or incapable of peptide-bond formation provides an alternative mechanism of Sec-induced stalling. The results demonstrate an elegant control of the translation cycle by regulatory peptides through continuous dynamic reshaping of the functional center of the ribosome. Two predominant forms of stalled ribosomes, post-state and hybrid state, indicate a collection of interactions between SecM and the tunnel cooperatively induce conformation changes of the peid-transfer center, leading to translation arrest at distinct elongation steps. Overall, the study reveals the molecular mechanism of Sec-dependent translational stalling at the atomic level, providing insights into how regulatory peptides modulate translation.
Researchers utilized a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects, providing the first measures of foveal cone density as a function of axial length in living eyes. The study computed cone density and other metrics in units of visual angle and linear retinal units, finding that the fove cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fove, but not proportionally to eye length. Despite retinal stretching resulting in decreased cones per square millimeter, myopes generally have higher angular density, measured in cones per degree squared, around the fove compared to emmetropes, offering potential for better visual acuity. The findings suggest that reports of deficits in best-corrected fove vision in myopes compared to emmetes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression. The study aimed to investigate how the length of the eye affects cone density and near the fove center, focusing on two types of cone densities. Previous studies implicated retinal stretching as a possible cause of myopic deficits, but the structural changes at the fove center during myopic progression were unknown. Advances in adaptive optics enable high-contrast images of the fove photoreceptor mosaic, allowing analysis of cone packing and eye length at the fove center, crucial for spatial vision. Myopes have higher fove photoreceptor resolution with potential for better performance on visual tasks compared to emmetes, ruling out increased separation between cones by retinal stretching as the simplest explanation for visual deficits. Large-scale studies show myopes attain reasonably good visual acuity with correction, indicating that retinal image enlargement does not exactly match cone mosaic stretching, allowing eyes of different lengths to sample the visual field similarly. The study's findings have implications for understanding the physical and visual implications of fove cone topography and dependence on eye length.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, especially in low-income settings, and asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease. Researchers developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data and combined these results with whole genome sequence data, estimating pneumococcal variation accounted for 63% of the variation in carriage duration, while host traits such as age and previous carriage accounted for less than 5%. The study partitioned heritability into lineage and locus effects, finding serotype accounted for 17%, drug resistance 9%, and other locus effects 7% of the variation in carriage duration. A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype, potentially by disrupting the competence mechanism. The findings support theoretical models of pneumoccal competition and antibiotic resistance. Genetic determinants of pneumoccal carriage, other than serotype, were previously unknown, but this study quantified and mapped the genetic contribution to carriage of S. pneumonia, showing variants in the pneumoccal genome alter duration, linked to antibiotic resistance. Sequence variation of pneumoccal genome explains 63% of variability, common serotypes and resistance to erythromycin 19%, and prophage presence 7%. The study provides a quantitative estimate of how transmission pairs share carriage duration, showing differences between and within serotypes. The implication of phage having a significant effect on duration has interesting corollaries on pneumcal genome diversification through frequent infection and loss of prophage during episodes. The genetics of S pneumonia is an important in determining carriage, and if environmental conditions are associated with streptoccal genotype, heritability may differ. A lower bound on heritability can be calculated by fitting a linear model through maximum likelihood to common SNPs.
The slow rectifier current, IKs, plays a crucial role in cardiac repolarization and is mediated by the tetrameric voltage-gated channel KCNQ1 and its β-subunit KCNE. The stoichiometry between α and β-subunits has been a topic of controversy, with studies suggesting either a strict 2:4 or variable ratio up to 4:4. Researchers used fusion proteins linking KCNE to one, two, or four KCN1 subunits to reproduce 4:4, 2:4, or 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole cell and single-channel recordings showed EQ and EQQQ have hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter latency compared to EQ, abolished by KC1 addition. Using UV-crosslink unnatural amino acid in KCNE, EQQ and EQQ crosslinking rates were slowed compared to KCN1, demonstrating no intrinsic limits to association of up to four βunits within the IK complex. KCN1 is a voltage-gated potassium channel expressed throughout the body and paired with KCNE has unique properties, particularly in myocardium and inner ear. Together, KCN1 and KCNE conduct the slow rectifier current, responsible for stabilizing repolarization and shortening action potential duration at high heart rates. The stoichiometry can be regulated based on availability, altering expression could change channel composition, shifting overall kinetics. Five KCNE genes can be expressed in cardiomyocytes. Fusion channels were evaluated in mammalian cells using whole patch clamp, single-channel recordings, and UV-crosslink unnatural acid approaches. The role of the ion complex in health and disease is significant, yet the stoichiometry of binding between KCN1 and KC1 remains unclear. Studies reported a ratio of two βunits to four αunits since identification of components almost 20 years ago. Flexibility in KCN1 β-subunit association allows a mechanism to modulate repolarization in the heart through changes in expression.
Cellular responses to injury are crucial for complete tissue regeneration, but the underlying processes remain incompletely understood. Research on zebrafish fin regeneration has shown that myeloid-defective mutants display apoptosis of regenerative cells during fin regeneration, which is induced by prolonged expression of interleukin-1 beta (Il-1β). Myeloid cells are considered the principal source of Il-1, but epithelial cells express Il-1 in response to tissue injury and initiate the inflammatory response. Macrophages are necessary for the resolution of inflammation and survival of regenerative cells. Il-1 plays an essential role in normal fin regeneration by regulating expression of regeneration-induced genes. The study reveals that proper levels of Il-1 signaling and tissue inflammation, tuned by macroages, play a crucial role in tissue regeneration. Il-1 signaling and inflammation act as a double-edged sword, required for regeneration but impairing tissue in excess. Tissue injury induces Il-1 expression in epithelial cells and macroages attenuate Il-1 expression and inflammation during tissue regeneration. The pro-inflammatory cytokine Il-1 is provided by epidermal cells in response to injury and apoptosis occurs if Il-1 action at the injury site is prolonged. Macrophages are responsible for attenuation of Il-1 expression and resolution of inflammation. Normal Il-1 expression and inflammatory response are necessary in tissue regeneration to activate expression of regeneration-induced genes. Excessive Il-1 signaling and inflammation in response to injury represent a cause of apoptosis in the mutant. Myoid cells, such as neutrophils and macroages, migrate to the injured fin and Il-1 signaling plays an indispensable role in tissue regeneration by activating expression of regeneration genes. A proper level of Il-1 expression and inflammatory response, tuned by macroages, are necessary for progression of tissue regeneration. The study elucidates the role of macroages in attenuating Il-1 expression and inflammation during tissue regeneration and highlights the function of Il-1 in tissue regeneration.
Researchers studied the dependence of protein mobility on surface properties and ionic strength in the cytoplasm of Escheria coli, Lactoccus lactis, and Haloax volcanii using surface-modified fluorescent proteins and determined their translational diffusion coefficients. The results show that in E. coli, the diffusion coefficient depends on the net charge and its distribution over the protein, with positive proteins diffusing up to 100-fold slower than negative ones. This effect is weaker in L. lactis and H. volcanii due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in mobility is caused by interaction of positive proteins with ribosomes as shown in vivo measurements and confirmed in vitro with purified ribosomes. The slowdown in diffusion with increasing positive surface charge in L. lactis and H. volcanii is less than in E. coli due to electrostatic screening, mainly caused by binding of positive proteins to ribosomes with KD values on the order of µM. The findings indicate that ribosome properties may limit the composition of the cytoplasmic proteome. Positive proteins not only diffuse slowly but their binding to ribosomes might inhibit protein synthesis by affecting the assembly or activity of ribosomes. Analysis of proteomes of E. coli, L. lactis, H. volcanii, and four endosymbiotic bacteria was conducted to determine how a protein will diffuse in light of the composition of the proteome and how ribosomes affect the diffusion of proteome constituents. Many processes in cells depend on interactions between macromolecules and their ability to find each other by translational diffusion, especially in prokaryotes due to the absence of active mechanisms of cytoplasm transport. The study reveals that macromolecules need to diffuse for cells to function and that ribosome properties may impose limits on the nature of the cytoplasmic proteome.
Regeneration is a widespread phenomenon across the animal kingdom, but the mechanisms that activate it remain poorly understood. Planarians are capable of whole-body regeneration and exhibit distinct molecular responses to wounds that result in tissue absence and those that do not. Researchers have identified a follistatin homolog, Smed-follatin, required for planarian regeneration, which blocks responses to tissue absence but does not prevent normal tissue turnover. Two activin homologs, Smed-activ-1 and S-activ-2, are required for the S-follatin phenotype. S-follatin is wound-induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue absence, suggesting it inhibits S-activ proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence. This identifies a critical mechanism for regeneration initiation, a process important across the animal kingdom. Animals distinguish between injuries involving varying amounts of tissue loss and regulate distinct wound programs remains unknown, with S-follatin required for molecular and cellular'missing-tissue' responses during regeneration. Follist-mediated inhibition of activin signaling is necessary for regeneration to occur, with S-foll expression controlled by the extent of tissue absence following injury. A gene encoding a homolog of the TGF-β inhibitor, follist, is required for regeneration and regeneration-specific cellular and molecular responses to injury. Inhibition of activin signaling by Fst is necessary for initiating a regenerative response at wounds following major injury, with fst wound-induced and persisting at high levels longer following major injury. TGF signaling plays a major role in many forms of regeneration, and uncovering'missing-tissue' signals in planarians will inform a broad understanding of core regenerative mechanisms. Planarians exhibit distinct cellular and molecular programs responding to simple injury versus missing tissue, mounting unique mitotic and apoptotic responses and producing an extended program of wound-induced gene expression following substantial tissue loss. Wound-induced fst expression allows regenerative responses to be initiated as a consequence of tissue absence, with fst the first gene known to be required for regeneration-specific responses in planarians. Not all missing-tissue responses are abolished following fst inhibition, with neoblast migration to amputation sites occurring normally in fst RNA animals despite the absence of a proliferative response.
Mismatch repair (MR)-deficient tumors exhibit a distinct molecular fingerprint characterized by persistent DNA replication errors that manifest as mutations, rendering them resistant to standard therapy. Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing confirm a unique MR-deficient mutation signature, distinct from other tumors but similar to germline DNA, suggesting a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises from mutations escaping MR. A set of recurrent indels may serve to detect microsatellite instability (MSI), and using endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MR deficiency, a novel marker detects MSI with greater specificity and selectivity than standard tests. Recurrent indels are enriched for DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination, indicating reduced double-strand break repair in MR-deficient tumors and triggering sensitivity to double-strand break inducers. Whole-genome sequencing of 28 tumor-normal pairs, including 22 MR-deficient, revealed an average of 201 somatic events in MR-deficient tumors versus 39 in MR-proficient, a 52-fold increase. Validation rates for substitutions and indels were 87% and 86%. MR-deficient tumors accumulate indel mutations in mono- and dinucleotide repeats, a phenomenon referred to as microsatellite instability, leading to different prognosis and therapeutic outcomes after chemotherapy. MR machinery deficiency leads to DNA errors in tumor tissue, not normal tissue, and MR-deficient tumors exhibit distinct mutation spectra with clinical relevance for diagnostically assessing MSI and therapeutically targeting MR-deficient tumors.
Researchers have developed an optimized version of Magnets, a light-inducible dimerization module derived from the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid, which enables precise temporal and spatial control of biological processes in a non-invasive manner. The original Magnets require concatemerization and preincubation at 28°C to be functional, but the new enhanced Magnets (eMags) overcome these limitations. The eMags are engineered to have greater thermal stability, dimer efficiency, and faster association and dissociation kinetics, allowing them to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, induce organel contacts, and reconstitute OSBP-VAP-ER-Golgi tethering implicated in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate transport and metabolism. The eMags consist of two components, nMag (negative) and pMag (positive), which are small photoreceptors that require simultaneous photoactivation to interact, enabling high spatiotemporal confinement of dimerization with a single excitation wavelength. They exhibit fast association and dissociation kinetics and function when fused to a range of proteins, including peripheral and intrinsic membrane proteins. The eMags have been validated in various applications, including protein recruitment to different organelles, generation of organel contact sites, and reconstitution of VAP-dependent interorganel tethers that have key functions in lipid transport. The development of eMags involved optimizing the placement of charge-complement amino acids in the Vivid dimer interface using the crystal structure of the light-activated dimer as a guide and mitochondrial recruitment as a testbed. The eMags offer advantages over other systems, including rapid association and dissociation kinetics, low background activation, and suitability for optogenetic modulation of small volumes and subcellular organelles. They represent an effective tool to optogenetically manipulate physiological processes over whole cells or small subcell volumes, enabling precise control of biological processes in a non-invasive fashion.
Researchers investigated the signaling pathways triggered by ribosome stalling during translation, which has been linked to neurodegeneration, using a mouse model with a mutation in the Gbp2 gene, leading to stalled elongation complexes at AGA codons due to deficiencies in tRNA and GTP. Analysis revealed increased phosphorylation of eIFα and activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response pathway, prior to neurodegeneration. Genetic experiments showed this pathway was activated by eIF2 kinase GCN in an acylated tRNA-independent manner. GCN2 activation resulted in eIFα phosphorylation and induction of ATF-target genes in the cerebellum and hippocampus. Genetic studies demonstrated GC2 functions to attenuate neurogeneration, suggesting ribosome stalling activates GC2 as a regulatory mechanism linking elongation and initiation steps of translation. Failure to resolve stalled elongation complexes in mammalian neurons results in degeneration but the pathways evoked are unknown. GC2 activates the integrated stress response in the brain with stalled ribosomes, demonstrating a feedback loop between elongation defects and translation initiation. In the hippocampus of mice lacking GC2, degeneration of CA pyramidal cells was observed, suggesting the eIFα/ATF pathway is vital for neuron survival during ribosome stalling. ATF activation also occurs in brains with no unprocessed tRNA, raising the possibility ribosome stalling contributes to GC2 activation in conditions like amino deprivation. The mechanism for GC2 activation by ribosome stalling remains unclear. These results demonstrate interplay between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress and the importance of cellular context on the outcome of this pathway activation.
A comprehensive analysis of 147 population-based studies with measurements from over 18.6 million participants across 199 countries reveals significant trends in adult height over the past century. Being taller is associated with enhanced longevity, higher education, and earnings. The largest gains in adult height have occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who have become 20.2 cm and 16.5 cm taller, respectively. In contrast, there has been little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan countries and Asia over the past century. The tallest populations are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, with average heights surpassing 182.5 cm, while the shortest are women born in Guatemala in 1896 at 140.3 cm. The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19-20 cm a century ago, remaining the same for women and increasing for men despite changes in country rankings.

Adult height has changed unevenly across the world's countries with no indication of convergence. The differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19 cm for men and 20 cm for women a century ago, remaining the same for women and increasing for men. The largest gains since the 189 birth cohort occurred in South Korean and Iranian men, becoming 20.2 cm and 16.5 cm taller. Men in the Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia, and Denmark surpass average heights of 181 cm, with Dutch men at 182.5 cm, the tallest on the planet. The gap with the shortest countries, Timor-Leste, Yemen, and Laos, where men are 160 cm, is 22-23 cm, an increase of 4 cm on the global gap in the 189 birth cohort. Women in Norway, Iceland, the USA, and American Samoa were taller than 158 cm, while El Salvador, Peru, Bangladesh, Korea, and Japan had the shortest women. The tallest populations lived in Central and Northern Europe, North America, and Pacific islands, with Swedish and Norwegian men surpassing 171 cm, 18-19 cm taller than men in Laos. Swedish women had an average height of 160 cm, similar to a well-nourished 10-year-old girl.
The opioid overdose epidemic in the United States has quadrupled between 1999 and 2017, resulting in a staggering 130 deaths per day, necessitating innovative solutions to uncover the key brain areas and cell types mediating opioid-induced respiratory depression. Research has identified two primary changes to murine breathing after administering opioids, implicating the brainstem's breathing circuitry, confirmed by locally eliminating the µ-opioid receptor. The preBötz Complex, where breathing originates, is a critical site, with 70-140 neurons responsible for sensitivity to opioids. Characterization of these neurons may lead to novel therapies preventing respiratory depression while sparing analgesia. Approximately 140 Oprm1 glutamatergic preöt neurons mediate this effect, with 70 sufficient to rescue opioid depression of the preöt rhythm. Db1 and Foxp2 neurons are crucial in respiratory generation, suggesting opioids act by silencing presynaptic release or targeting a subset of preöt excitatory neurons generating the inspiratory rhythm. Opr1 is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, including sites modulating breathing such as the cerebral cortex, brainstem control centers, and oxygen afferents. Two sites mediate the depressive effects of opioids on breathing, with one dominant driven by 140 neurons, not required for opioid-induced analgesia, suggesting a target for safer opioids or rescue strategies. Deletion of µ-opioid receptor from both sites eliminates opioid-induced respiratory depression, even with high doses of fentanyl, indicating targeting these sites rescues respiratory depression. Remaining effects are attributed to incomplete transduction or minor contributing sites.
Human hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and HBV-related diseases remain a major public health problem, with individuals coinfected with satellite hepatitis D virus (HDV) experiencing more severe disease. The cellular entry of both viruses is mediated by HBV envelope proteins, specifically the pre-S domain of the large protein, which is a key determinant for receptor binding. Researchers have identified sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP), a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver, as the receptor for HBV and HDV. Using near distance photo-crossing and tandem purification, the receptor-binding region of pre1 specifically interacts with NT. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatarcinoma cells susceptible to viral infections. Replacing amino acids 157-165 of nonfunctional monkey NT with the human counterpart conferred its ability to support both infections, demonstrating NT is a functional receptor for HBV and HD. The pre-S domain mediates viral interaction with cellular receptors on hepatocytes, and an N-terminal myristoylated peptide corresponding to amino acids 2-48 of pre1 blocks HBV and HDV infections through an unknown component, likely a receptor. Photoreactive peptide ligands and antibodies identified pre1 binding partners by zero crosslinking, showing residues 157-165 of NT are crucial for binding the receptor region of pre1, contributing to NT-mediated HB and HDV infections. HepG2 cells expressing hNT with monkey-like mutations abolished HBV, while NT-bearing human residues restored infection, confirming NTCP's role in HBV and HD infections.
Sepsis leads to lasting changes in the phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells, which provide rapid cytosis and cytokine production following re-encounter with their cognate antigen to promote long-term immunity. The acute influence of seps on memory CD8 cells has been characterized, but the extent to which pre-existing memory CD8 cells recover remains unknown. Central memory CD8 cells from septic patients proliferate more than those from healthy individuals, utilizing LCM immune and CL model to induce seps demonstrated that TCM proliferation is associated with numerical recovery of pathogen-specific CD8 cells following seps-induced lymphopenia. This increased proliferation leads to changes in composition of memory CD8 cell and altered tissue localization. Memory CD8 cells from seps survivors have altered transcriptional profile and chromatin accessibility indicating long-lasting cell intrinsic changes. The seps-induced changes in composition of memory8 cell pool and transcription landscape culminated altered cell function and reduced capacity to control L monocytogen infection. Seps leads to long-term alterations in memory8 cell phenotype, protective function, and potentially changing host capacity to respond to re-infection. The study demonstrates seps leads to a change in composition of memory8 cell in seps survivors as a result of proliferation in lymphic environment after seps. TCM have higher proliferative capacity than TEM, biasing toward TCM alters localization of memory8 cells. Pre-existing memory8 cells numerically recover with time after seps due to increased proliferation in response seps-induced lymphic environment. Preferential proliferation by TCM alters composition and localization pre-existing8 cells after seps. Seps accelerating adoption time-dependent changes composition8 cell pool. Capacity of memory14 cells to undergo TCR-dependent adhesion and immunologic synapse formation assessed after Sham or CL surgery. Increased proliferation of8 cells, particularly central memory cells in septic patients and mice after cecal ligation puncture-induced seps relative non-septic controls, consequence remodeling memory8 pool. Seps-induced changes in memory8 pool culminated altered function reduced capacity control L monocytogen infection.

Long Interspersed Element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) retrotransposition poses a mutagenic threat to human genomes, and human cells have evolved strategies to regulate L1 retroposition. The APOEC3 (A3) family of enzymes catalyze deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides in single-strand DNA substrates, with APOEC3A (A3) being the most potent inhibitor of L1 retroposition in cultured cell assays. However, previous characterization of L1 retroposition events generated in the presence of A3 did not yield evidence of deamination, leaving the molecular mechanism by which A3 inhibits L1 retroposition enigmatic. This study demonstrates that A3 can inhibit L1 retroposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. Engineered L retroposition events from human cells coexpressing A3 and uracil glycosylase inhibitor contain strand-specific A3-mediated C-to-U deamination, indicating A3 can inhibit L1 retroposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA. Overexpression of wild-type APOEC3 cytidine deamin protein, but not deamin-defective mutants, potently inhibits L1 retroposition in human cells, yet deamination events were not detected in L1 retroposition generated in the presence of wild-type A3. An in vitro assay, L Element Amplification Protocol, was used to elucidate the mechanism for A3-mediated inhibition of L1 retroposition. Degradation of deaminated retrotrans intermediates could reduce L retroposition levels and eliminate evidence of A-mediated deamination, explaining why previous studies failed to detect A-mediated deamination. Deamination of single-strand genomic DNA leads to inexact TSD in post-integration, and UGI alleviates A3-mediated L inhibition. The study provides a mechanistic explanation of how the A3 cytid deamin protein inhibits L retroposition.
Researchers investigated the role of the activity-regulated non-canonical Ras-like GTPase Rem2 in visual circuit plasticity, demonstrating that Rem2-/- mice fail to exhibit normal ocular dominance during the critical period. At the cellular level, Rem2 has a cell-autonomous role in regulating intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons prior to changes in synaptic function. Both in vitro and in vivo recordings reveal increased spontaneous firing rates in the absence of Rem2. Rem2 functions at the nexus of a signaling network that senses and responds to changes in neuronal activity to preserve circuit function in the face of changing sensory experience. Defining Rem2-dependent mechanisms will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that instruct activity-dependent modifications of neuralry. Rem2 may regulate the responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation through neuronal excitability or synaptic scaling. Findings indicate Rem2 functions as a regulator of experience-dependent plasticity at morphological, cellular, and circuit levels, connecting molecular regulators of morphology with broader function. Rem2 expression is regulated by visual experience and plays a role in activity-dependent processes in the visual cortex following sensory deprivation by investigating ocular dominance. The activity-regulated Rem2 is a candidate to link circuit activity with functional plasticity, a member of Rad/Rem/Gem/Kir family, Ras-related small GTP, whose expression and function are regulated by neuronal activity in response to calcium influx through voltage-gated channels. Data establish Rem2 as key molecule regulating neuronal excitability and circuit function in context of changing experience. Rem2 stabilizes intrinsic excitability and spontaneous firing in visual circuits.
Recent reports have suggested that magnetic fields can affect biological molecules and cells, including claims of a protein acting as a compass to guide magnetic orientation in animals and magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel. However, these claims conflict with basic laws of physics, with discrepancies of 5 to 10 orders of magnitude, indicating that if the phenomena occur, they must have entirely different causes than proposed. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes limits their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells. The forces or torques produced are too small for desired effects on molecular orientation or membrane, suggesting alternative mechanisms if phenomena occur. Proposed routes to magnetogenetics, based on pulling or heating ferritin with magnetic fields, are unlikely to succeed without new discoveries about biological matter structure. 

A molecular system was designed to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across cell membranes using a putative mechano-sensitive cation channel fused with ferritin, aiming to enable magnetic torque to open the channel and depolarize cells. Experimental results suggested neural activity modulation by static fields, but evidence is limited, with only 18 of 200 cells responding. The biophysical mechanism is unclear, with ferritin being a large protein complex forming a spherical shell around 12 nm in diameter. There is renewed interest in effects of magnetic fields on cells, including magnetosensation, where organisms sense Earth's magnetic field for navigation, and magnetogenetics, controlling cell activity with magnetic fields. Magnetosensation may rely on magnetite or magnetic field acting on single molecules in biochemical reactions, but biophysical basis remains unresolved.
Researchers have made a significant discovery about the role of the Prospero factor in Drosophila neural progenitors, also known as neuroblasts, which are used as a model for studying self-renewal and differentiation. When neuroblasts enter quiescence, Prospero is transiently detected in the neuroblast nucleus at low levels, followed by the establishment of a unique molecular profile lacking progenitor and differentiation markers. The pulse of low nuclear Prospero precedes entry into neuroblast quies even when the timing of quies is advanced or delayed by changing temporal factors. Loss of Prospero prevents entry into quies, whereas a pulse of low nuclear Prospero drives proliferating larval neuroblasts into quies. Prospero levels distinguish three progenitor fates: absent for self-renew, low for quies, and high for differentiation. Drosila neuroblasts have served as a system for identifying conserved pathways regulating cell proliferation and quies. Nearly all quiescent neuroblasts had reactivated proliferation and re-expressed progenitor markers after induction. Precocious low nuclear Prospero advances the timing of neuroblast quies. Transient low-level nuclear Prospero is sufficient to induce neuroblast quies. The timing of nuclear Prospero correlates with neuroblast entry into quies. Loss of Prospero delays the timing of neuroblast quies, shown by quantifying Ed+ neuroblasts in prosper null embryos. The pulse of nuclear Prospero matches the timing of neuroblast quies, occurring earlier in pdm mutants and later in cas mutants. A pulse of low nuclear Prospero marks neuroblast entry quies, suggesting a functional relationship.
Researchers have developed a single-particle fluorescence microscopy method to study the real-time uncoating kinetics of authentic HIV-1 capsids in vitro after permeabilizing the viral membrane. The uncoating of the metastable HIV-1 capsid is a tightly regulated disassembly process required for release of the viral DNA prior to nuclear import. The study reveals that opening of the first defect in the lattice is the rate-limiting step of uncoating, which is followed by rapid, catastrophic collapse. The caps-binding inhibitor PF74 accelerates capsid opening but stabilizes the remaining lattice, while binding of a polyanion to a conserved arginine in the lattice delays initiation of uncoating but does not prevent subsequent lattice disassembly. Different stages of uncoating can be controlled independently and the interplay between different capsid regulators determines the overall unco kinetics. Single-particle unco kinetics measurement of authentic capsids after removing the protective barrier of the viral membrane allowed observation of the effects of caps-binding molecules on discrete steps in the caps unco process. Ensemble measurements would have obscured the order of events due to dephasing. Caps-binding molecules exhibit differential effects on steps controlling initiation and continuation of unco. The structural heterogeneity of the HIVid is well described, with assembly yielding conical, tubular and other shapes containing structural defects such as gaps in the CA lattice. The single-molecule imaging assay follows unco kinetics of hundreds of capsids, resolving intermediates in disassembly averaged in traditional assays, classifying caps according to unco behaviors. Characteristics of HIV-1 caps unco and interactions with capsid molecules include caps integrity and stability being highly heterogeneous, majority containing defects and uncoating after membrane removal, and in absence of binders unco is all-or-none process after first defect creation. The half-life of HIVid is long to use permeabilized particles as a platform to quantify labeled protein binding to authentic caps at single-particle level, demonstrated by adding labeled CA and following fluorescence signals using dual-color TIR microscopy.
Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women, and analysis of breast cancer DNA indicates frequent loss-of-function mutations in components of the cJ NH-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway. Despite JNK signaling promoting cell proliferation by activating the AP transcription factor, its association with reduced tumor development was unexpected. Research examined the effect of JNK deficiency in murine breast epithelium and found loss of J signaling caused genomic instability and development of breast cancer. JNK deficiency also caused widespread neoplasia and rapid tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer. This tumor suppressive function was not mediated by a role of JNK in growth of established tumors, but by a requirement of JNK to prevent initiation. Data identify J pathway defects as driver mutations that promote genome instability and tumor initiation. Loss of J signaling in mammary epithelial cells caused cancer, and J deficiency accelerated tumor formation in a murine model of breast, associated with widespread neoplas and genomic instability. J plays a key role in initiation of tumor development. Frequent J pathway loss-function mutations in human cancer may represent driver mutations that promote development. J loss plays a key role at early stages of breast development by promoting mammary neoplas, accounting for mutational inactivation of J signaling to promote development. The J signaling pathway may be suppressed in many cancers, with association of breast and reduced J signaling a correlation. Study tested the role of J signaling in breast development, anticipating J may act to promote growth due to AP transcription activation. Conclusions are J deficiency in mammary epithelium causes murine cancer, and J accelerates tumor development in mouse model breast.
Researchers have identified peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (PAM), an enzyme required for generating amidated bioactive peptides, as a crucial factor in ciliogenesis in Chlamydomonas and mammalian cells. AM is necessary for the normal assembly of motile and primary cilia in Chlamdomonas, planaria, and mice. In Chlamydomonas, AM knockdown lines failed to assemble cilia beyond the transition zone, had abnormal Golgi architecture, and altered levels of cilia components. Decreased AM expression reduced motile ciliary density on the ventral surface of planaria, resulting in cytosolic axonemes lacking a ciliary membrane. Primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in Pam-/- mouse embryos had aberrant architecture. Data suggests AM activity and alterations in post-Golgi trafficking contribute to observed cili defects, providing a conserved link between AM, amidation, and ciliary assembly. AM plays a conserved role during early steps of ciliogenesis, revealing a novel link between amidation and cilium assembly in multiple cell types. AM may have been included in signaling proteins trafficked to ciliary compartment from Golgi in ancestral eukaryote. Results indicate both amidation and membrane roles of AM contribute ciliogenesis. Key steps in ciliogenic pathways may exhibit sensitivity to lack of AM in distinct organisms and tissues. Reduction of AM in C. reinhardtii and planaria resulted in ciliary assembly defects, while complete loss in mice did not abolish primary cilia in neuroepithelial cells, although they were shorter and often only ciliary stubs were evident. The functionality of these short cilia is unknown. Overall, AM is an evolutionarily conserved factor required for ciliogenesis in multiple cell types, including motile cilia in C. reinhardtii, ventral epithelium planaria, and primary cilia neuroepithelial cells in mammals.
Class III myosins (Myo3) and actin-bundling protein Espin play critical roles in regulating the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells, and their defects cause hereditary impairments. Myo3 interacts with Espin1 through its tail homology motif (THD1), however, it is not clear how Myo3 specifically acts through Esp1 to regulate actin assembly and stabilization. Researchers have discovered that My3 TH1 contains a pair of repeat sequences capable of independently and strongly binding ankyrin repeats of Esp1, revealing an unexpected Myo-mediated crossing mechanism of Esp1. The structures of My3 in complex with Esp1 elucidate the mechanism of binding and reveal a Myo-induced release of Esp1 autoinhibition. My3-mediated crossing can further promote actin fiber bundling activity of Esp1. My3a/My3b are known to co-localize with Esp1 at the tips of stereocilia of hair cells, and co-expression of My3 and Esp1 can stimulate elongation of stereocilia in cultured organ of Corti cells. The key function of the My3/Esp1 interaction is to promote formation of thicker parallel actin fibers in cellular structures such as stereocilia. My3 binding Esp1 higher order actin bundling activity. TH1 mediates binding of My3 to Esp1, allowing My3 to transport Esp1 to the tips of actin-based structures such as filopodia and stereocilia. Once localized, Esp1 WH2 domain promotes elongation of actin protrusions. The full-length My3/Esp1 complex may have higher actin bundling activity than the My3AB12/E1 complex. The study reveals a previously unrecognized myosin binding actin bundling regulation of actin filament crosser. Genetic findings convincingly point to critical roles of Espin in stereocilia development and maintenance by promoting assembly and stabilization of parallel actin bundles. Both My3a and My3b contain highly similar sequences in TH1, each capable of binding Esp1-AR with high affinity. My3 binding can release autoinhibition and increase the diameter of Esp1-promoted actin bundles. My3 TH1 contains repeat sequences capable of strongly binding ankyrin repeats of Esp1, revealing an unexpected crossing mechanism. The study provides evidence that My3-mediated crossing promotes actin bundling activity of Esp1.
Voltage-gated calcium channels play a crucial role in controlling key functions of excitable cells, including synaptic transmission in neurons and contraction of heart and skeletal muscles, by activating at different voltages with distinct kinetics. To understand the molecular mechanisms governing these specific voltage properties, researchers combined structure modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition of activated and resting states of two functionally distinct voltage-sensing domains of the eukaryotic calcium channel CaV1.1. Both voltage-sensing domains displayed typical features of the sliding helix model but greatly differed in ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges. Stabilization of the activated state enhanced voltage dependence of activation, while stabilization of resting states slowed kinetics, providing a mechanistic model explaining how ion-pair formation in separate voltage-sensing domains can realize characteristic properties of voltage-gated cation channels. 

Voltage-gated calcium channels translate membrane depolarization into calcium influx, contributing to cellular excitability and coupling electrical activity to fundamental cell functions such as contraction, neurotransmitter and hormone secretion, and gene regulation. Together with voltage-gated sodium channels, they form a structurally related ion channel superfamily with fourfold symmetry. Advanced models of activated and resting states of CaV1.1 voltage-sensing domains fill an important gap in understanding voltage-sensing mechanisms in eukotic voltage-gated cation channels. All interaction partners suggested by the model showed predicted effects on channel gating when experimentally tested by mutagenesis and electrophysiology, and alterations of kinetic properties recognized experimentally were reliably explained by the computer model. The structures of lowest energy of Ca1.1 voltage-sensing domains display basic features of the sliding helix model based on cryo-EM structure of Ca1.1 and generated using Rosetta computational software to build a homology model of human eukary CaV1. The resting states of eukary Ca and Na channels remained inaccessible to experimental determination but years of work and modeling provide support the sliding helix model of voltage sensor action. Researchers used mutagenesis and electrophysiology to analyze structures, free energy, and transition of activated and resting states of functionally distinct voltage-sensing domains of eukary calcium channel CaV1 to identify molecular mechanisms governing specific voltage properties.
The ability of the adult brain to undergo changes is of particular interest in medicine, especially regarding recovery from injuries or improving cognition. Matrix metalloproteinases have been associated with juvenile-dependent visual cortex plasticity, yet little is known about their role in this process in the adult visual cortex. Activation of matrix metalloproteinases is crucial for facilitating changes in a healthy brain, however, upon brain injury upregulated metalloproteinases promote the spread of a lesion and impair recovery. Researchers examined the effects of metalloprotein inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected mice. In healthy animals, a 7-day application of metalloprotein inhibitor prevented plasticity, while treatment with metallo inhibitor once but not twice following stroke rescued plasticity normally lost under these conditions. Data imply an optimal metalloprotein activity level is crucial for adult plasticity to occur. Metalloproteinases play a critical role in visual plasticity, suggesting upregulation after cortical lesion compromises experience-induced plasticity, which can be rescued by brief inhibition. Precise regulation of metalloprotein activity is essential for facilitating plasticity in the brain, offering new opportunities in treatment and recovery after stroke. A single treatment after stroke rescued plasticity in paradigms, whereas treatment twice diminished the effect, revealing metalloprotein's role in adult plasticity. Metalprotein activity must be within a narrow window for experience-induced plasticity to occur. The study objective was to examine if metalloprotein is crucial for adult plasticity and if inhibition after stroke may rescue lost plasticity. A combination of in vivo imaging and behavioral tests revealed an optimal metallo level is essential for adult plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected brain. Data demonstrate metallo's vital role for adult cortex plasticity, expanding previous studies from juvenile rats. Under normal conditions, metallo supports development and function, yet a different outcome has been described for diseased brain. Increased metallo was observed within hours of photothrombotically induced stroke and application partially rescued impaired cortex plasticity. Researchers tested if stroke-induced impairment of cortical plasticity can be rescued by inhibiting metal after stroke.
Signal transduction at vertebrate excitatory synapses involves the activation of AMPA receptors, glutamate-gated ion channels composed of four subunits assembled as dimer-of-dimers. Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have provided full-length structures of AMPA receptors, alone and in combination with auxiliary subunits, indicating dimers may undergo substantial lateral motions during gating, opening the extracellular layer along the central twofold symmetry axis. Bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers were used to calibrate conformations in functional AMPA receptors in the presence and absence of auxiliary subunit Stargaz, revealing the extracellular layer of AMP receptors can get trapped in stable, opened conformations, especially upon long exposures to glutamate. However, Stargin limits conformation flexibility, suggesting under synaptic conditions where brief glutamate exposures and auxiliary proteins dominate, extracellular domains of AMPA likely stay compact during gating. The extracellular domains of synaptic AMPA are unlikely to undergo large structural rearrangements during transmission and work in a compact conformation regime unless faced with long exposures to glutamate in pathological conditions. The presence of auxiliary subunits, such as Stargin, affects conformation flexibility of AMP receptors. Cryo-EM structures of AMPA in complex with auxiliary subunits have been acquired in resting, active, and desensitized states. AMP receptors are tetrameric ligand-gated channels consisting of three layers from distinct domains, with extracellular layers assembling from amino-terminal and ligand-binding domains adopting dimer pairs in resting and active receptors. Assuming the length of bis-MTS cross-linkers reflects structural rearrangements, AMP receptors at synapses exposed to brief glutamate and complex with auxiliary subunits are unlikely to undergo extreme conformation changes. Technical advances in cry-electron microscopy revolutionized the study of membrane proteins, providing a greater supply of structural information, emphasizing the need to relate geometry to dynamics, particularly in the case of AMP receptors with full-length structures in complexes with ligands and auxiliary subunits published.
Researchers have overcome the challenge of isolating single cells from helminth-infected murine intestines, which has been hindered by strong anti-parasite type 2 immune responses that drive mucus production, tissue remodeling, and immune cell infiltration. By optimizing a standard intestinal digestion protocol, millions of immune cells were successfully isolated from the heavily infected duodenum. To validate the accuracy of these cells in representing intestinal responses, a 23-color spectral flow cytometry panel was used, incorporating surface and intracellular markers for type 2 immune responses associated with helmin infections, and findings were confirmed by confocal microscopy. The cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis identified hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the course of helmin infection, accelerating single-cell discoveries of local helmin immune responses previously unfeasible. Characterization of isolated cells using spectral cytometry validated the protocol's suitability for single-cell analysis and immunophenotyping. Hallmarks of innate and adaptive-parasite immune responses were characterized throughout the course of helmin infection, validated by confocal microscopy. Observed changes in cell ratios between naïve and infected samples were faithfully reported by both approaches, highlighting the requirement for good cell isolation techniques to investigate intestinal responses against helmin directly. Quantification of specific cell populations, including B220+, Siglec+, CD3+ CD4+, CD+4, and CD64+ cells, using confocal microscopy and spectral flow cytometry confirmed the accuracy of the cell isolation protocol in representing intestinal responses. Difficulties with intestinal digestion during helmin infection have been associated with anti-parite type 2 immune responses driving mucus production, altering epithelium, inducing cell infiltration, and tissue remodeling. The optimized cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis provides an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses during helmin infection.
Proteasomal protein degradation plays a crucial role in determining protein half-life and is essential for various cellular processes, including metabolism and immunological functions. Despite its importance, the mechanisms regulating proteasome activity are not fully understood. Researchers employed an integrated experimental and modeling approach to develop and validate mechanistic models of proteasomal peptide hydrolysis dynamics. The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme with varying activity over time due to interactions between substrates, products, and proteolytic and regulatory sites. The locations of these sites and interactions are predicted by the model and experimentally supported, suggesting the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is substrate transport into the proteasome, which varies between standard and immuno-proteomes, affecting degradation and cleavage usage. 

The study combined experimental and computational analyses to elaborate a comprehensive model describing regulatory components of 20S proteomes, interactions between substrate transport, and hydrolysis over time for representative peptides. A dearth of mechanistic analyses of proteome functions and complexity of polypeptide hydrosis precluded detailed analysis. Insights come from short fluorogenic peptides with a single proteas-catalyzed cleavage site, allowing real-time kinetics follow-up. Similar proteasome dynamics were observed using purified 20S proteas and protein homogenates, suggesting the model describes core proteasome features reflecting dynamics in complex cellular environments. Poly-ubiquitin tagging, transport, and peptide-bond hydrolysis regulate protein-life, affecting metabolic processes, yet mechanisms of proteomal action, particularly differences in substrate proteolysis between proteome isoforms, are incompletely understood.

The 20S proteome's catalytic activity varies over time, influenced by structural characteristics and interactions with substrates and products at proteolytic and regulatory sites. Kinetics change over longer scales than structural dynamics and are influenced by these interactions. The study sheds light on proteasome mechanisms using designed assays and modeling, describing regulatory components, substrate transport, and hydrolysis. The model predicts locations of proteolytic and regulatory sites and their interactions, experimentally supported, indicating transport as the rate-limiting step. Efficiency varies between standard and immuno-proteomes impacting total degradation and cleavage usage. The findings advance understanding of proteome structure, function, and dynamics, providing insights into mechanisms regulating proteas activity and differences between proteome isoforms.
The recycling of neurotransmitters is essential for sustained synaptic transmission in Drosophila, where histamine recycling is required for visual transmission. Synaptic histamine is rapidly taken up by laminar glia and converted to carcinine, which is then delivered back to photoreceptors where it is hydrolyzed to release histamine and β-alanine. While histamine is repackaged into synaptic vesicles, the return of β-alanine to laminial cells was unclear. Researchers identified a new β-alanine transporter, Bala, which is expressed and required in retinal cells for maintaining synaptic transmission and phototaxis. Null Bala mutants exhibited lower β-alanine levels and reduced β-alanine accumulation in the retina, suggesting Bala-dependent β-alanine trafficking is required for histamine homeostasis and neurotransmission. Disrupting histamine and carcinine synthesis abolishes photoreceptor synaptic transmission and β-alanine recycling is essential for maintaining histamine homeostasis and photoreceptor synaptic transmission. Establishing and maintaining a β-alanine pool plays a key role in sustaining synaptic transmission. The majority of pigment granules which reduce light exposure are formed in retinal cells of the Dophila compound eye. High β-alanine levels detected in retinal cells suggest pigment cells are critical for β-alanine transport and storage. Mutations in Bala disrupted β-alanine transport and storage in the retina, resulting in reduced photoreceptor synaptic activity and visual behavior. An efficient β-alanine recycling system compensates for rapid β-alanine loss during histamine to carcinine conversion. The current work provides evidence for a complete histamine recycling pathway critical for photoreceptor synaptic transmission where carcinine is synthesized in epithelial glial cells and transported to photoreceptors via the synaptic cleft. The findings suggest a conserved function for β-alanine trafficking in mammals and Dophila and provide genetic evidence retinal cells play a critical role in neurotransmission.
Researchers have made a significant discovery regarding the role of oxidants in aging, finding that chronologically aging yeast cells undergo a sudden redox collapse affecting over 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins. This redox collapse is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants as previously thought, but rather by a substantial drop in cellular NAD, which maintains redox homeostasis. The decrease in NAD levels occurs early in lifespan and sets off a cascade downregulating most cellular processes. Caloric restriction increases NAD levels and delays this cascade. The study reveals a timeline of events leading to system-wide oxidation of the proteome before cell death. Chronological aging represents a stress condition utilizing redox capacity of the thiol proteome, potentially contributing to beneficial downregulation of cellular processes. Early in the aging process, yeast cells undergo an abrupt loss of redox homeostasis, indicated by massive oxidation of thiol-containing cytosolic, nuclear, and mitochondrial proteins. The decrease in NAD and increase in redox potential may not be specific to yeast, but shared with other aging organisms. Yeast undergo the same pattern of NAD decrease, T1 oxidation, and redox collapse when cultivated in 2% glucose. The study used chronologically aging S cerevisiae to determine the onset, extent, and targets of protein oxidation in postmitotic cells, discovering a global redox collapse leading to thiol oxidation in almost 80% of proteins several days prior to death. The findings suggest a correlation between onset and extent of oxidative stress and lifespan. The chronological lifespan of S cerevis represents a model for analyzing aging in postmitotic cells, allowing for uncovering protein targets whose oxidative thiol modifications contribute to physiological alterations in aging and establishing a correlation between oxidative stress and lifespan. The study provides evidence that caloric restriction, a universal lifespan-extending measure, increases NAD levels and delays the cascade of events leading to redox collapse. Overall, the study sheds light on the timeline of redox events in aging postmitotic cells and the role of NAD in maintaining redox homeostasis.
The biological macromolecular world is homochiral and the enforcement of this homochirality is essential for cell survival. A study presents the mechanistic basis of a configuration-specific enzyme, D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase, that selectively removes D-amino acids erroneously coupled to tRNAs. The crystal structure of dimer D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase from Plasmodium falciparum in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog shows it uses an invariant cross-subunit Gly-Pro dipeptide to capture the chiral centre of incoming D-amino-tRNA. No protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, the unique side chain-independent mode of substrate recognition provides an explanation for the enzyme's ability to act on multiple D-amino acids. The chiral specificity explains how the enriched pool of L-amino-tRNAs escapes this proofreading step. The study provides insights into a fundamental enantioselective process and elucidates a chiral mechanism with a role in preventing D-amino acid infiltration during the evolution of translational apparatus.

D-amino-tRNA deacylase removes D-amino acids mischarged tRNAs and ensures D-amino acids do not get incorporated into proteins. The enzyme acts as freestanding modules, likely operating through resampling by recapturing aminoacyl-tRNAs from EF-Tu. The amino acid site captures all atoms attached to the chiral Cα, with crossunit interactions, particularly a Gly-Pro motif from monomers inserted into the active site of the dimer, playing a central role in recognition. The aminoacyl moiety interacts with residues from both monomers. Considering the actual substrate, D-amino acid linked to tRNA, multiple binding modes are improbable due to the fixed orientation and position of D-amino acid by terminal adenosine binding.

A side-chain-free mechanism provides the basis for nature's design of a single deacylase to deal with D-tRNA, revealing the role of weak bonds in chirality. If L-amino was to bind, it would do so in one of three possible conformations. The study provides insights into enantioselective mechanisms in homochirality enforcement, specifically decoupling D-amino acids from tRNAs. Earlier structural studies on D-amino-tRNA deacylase provided a model based on docking or structures with non-cognate ligands. The reported structures of proofreading domains with substrate-mimicking analogs elucidate the mechanism of L-amino acid rejection from the active site.
The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel that belongs to the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins, where ATP-induced dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) opens the pore and dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis closes it. Spontaneous openings without ATP are rare in wild-type CFTR, but in certain mutants constitute the only gating mechanism stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CFTR potentiator. Research has correlated energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous pore opening/closure in single CF channels, showing that spontaneous openings are strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which can occur even without ATP. Coordinated NBD/pore movements are intrinsic to CFTR, with ATP altering stability but not the fundamental architecture of open and closed conformations. This explains the effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity, providing insights into CF mutation and drug mechanisms. Phosphorylation of the cytosolic regulatory domain by cAMP-dependent kinase gates CF channels by cytosolic ATP. Strict coupling between NBD and pore movements constrains mechanistic models of ATP-dependent gating, understanding driving forces conserved among ABC proteins, and explains modulatory effects of mutations or physiological regulators. The ligand binding site is occluded in open channels, preventing open-state affinity definition, and disruption of ATP hydrolysis forces CF channels to gate at equilibrium following a reversible sequence rather than a cycle subject to the principle of detailed balance. Low-probability ATP-independent pore openings of a CF construct lacking N2 can be linked to NBD dimer formation, but results argue pore opening remaining NBD-TMD machinery undergoes similar movements to NBD dimerization.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism of assembly and mobility for transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, referred to as the "orderphobic effect", which is a pre-transition or pre-melting effect at the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane. Large-scale molecular simulations demonstrate that a protein with hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic order-disorder interface with finite stiffness. When two such proteins approach each other, they assemble due to reduced interfacial energy. The orderobic effect is mediated by proximity to the order-disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those from membrane elasticity. The orderobic effect leverages the power of a phase transition, depending on the ability of the protein to induce a disordered layer in its vicinity, influenced by proximity to the membrane's phase and protein's radius and hydrophobic mismatch. For instance, a transmembrane protein with hydroobic thickness of approximately 2.6 nm favors the structure of the disordered phase and can melt the ordered phase near the protein, resulting in the formation of an order-disorder interface. Enhanced lipid mobility surrounding orderobic proteins may be experimentally tested by single molecule techniques. Biological membranes and transmembrane proteins are more complex, with multiple components allowing more than one order-disorder transition. A dual to the orderobic effect exists, where a transmembrane protein in the disordered phase favors the ordered can nucleate an ordered region and orderdisorder interface. Interfaces separating ordered and disordered regions provide a force for assembly, influenced by hydroobic thickness and area per lipid differences between phases.
Genetically encoded calcium indicators are widely used to investigate neural dynamics, but the relationship between fluorescence signals and action potentials remains unclear. Researchers characterized the action potential-fluorescence transfer function in 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex with simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice expressing GCaMPs or GCaMPf. Under optimal conditions, most action potentials can be detected when the soma fills the microscope's field of view, but under typical population imaging conditions, only a minority of action potentials are detected, often less than 10% and 20% for single and double action potentials respectively. This emphasizes the limits of detection under realistic conditions. To construct action-calcium response curves, isolated action potential events were identified and summed over 250 milliseconds. For GCaMPs, isolated events were separated from previous and subsequent events by 100 and 500 milliseconds, and for GCaMPf by 300 milliseconds. Results show that only a minority of action potentials were used to construct action-calcium response curves. The study tested performance of several spike models detecting action potentials under optimal and less optimal conditions, providing insight into the relationship between spiking activity in vivo and fluorescence signals. Genetically encoded calcium indicators are used with two-photon scanning microscopy to report neuronal activity within populations in vivo, enabling measurement from hundreds of neurons at single-cell resolution over multiple sessions. Previous studies established most action potentials can be detected with GCa6 indicators under near-optimal conditions. This work facilitates interpretation of existing and future calcium studies using mainstream transgenic lines, such as the Allen's Brain Observatory Visual dataset. The study's findings highlight the challenges of inferring underlying action potential trains from calcium imaging due to population studies employing a large field of view containing many neurons, compromising signal-to-noise ratio. The results aid interpretation of existing and future imaging datasets and provide a better understanding of the relationship between spiking activity and fluorescence signals in transgenic mice.
Researchers have discovered a unique biological valve in the female genitalia of the Brazilian cave insect Neotla, composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-out canals, allowing females to receive multiple seminal packages from the same or different males within a short time. Females of Neotla possess a penis-like intromittent organ used to coercively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen, which is packed in a capsule initiated by seminal injection and serves not only for fertilization but also as nutrition. The valve has two slots for insemination, enabling Neotla to continue mating while the first slot is occupied. This valve, in conjunction with the female penis, is a morphological novelty allowing females to compete for seminal gifts in nutrient-poor habitats through prolonged copulation and multiple injections. The evolution of this valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the introment organ in Neotla. The male-holding organ and long copulation durations of 40-70 hours, compared to 50 minutes in close relatives, can be considered adaptations for escalated competition for nuptial gifts in this group inhabiting oligrophic habitats. Females of Neotla use a mechanism to control seminal flow, allowing to receive two packages from the same or different males within a short time. The valve enables females to receive a second capsule while the first is consumed. Females can selectively use one of two slots for insemination, leaving the other empty, and immediately receive an additional package from the same or other male using the empty slot. The presence of a sperhecal plate with valve may refine understanding of the causes and consequences of reversed selection in this genus. Female-female competition for males to receive seminal substances is considered the driving evolution of the female penis. In a related species lacking genital reversal, seminal transfer for a voluminous capsule is complete in 50 minutes. The female Neotla penis bears spines, anchoring males coercively during copulation, indicating females are responsible for prolonged copulation to obtain more semen.
Synaptic soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins play a crucial role in the rapid exocytosis of neurotransmitters in a Munc-18-dependent manner. The functions of different stages in exocytosis and the role of Munc-18 in SNARE assembly are not well understood. Using optical tweezers, researchers observed four distinct stages of assembly in SNARE N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains. SNARE mutations differentially affect SNARE assembly, with N-terminal and C-terminal domains responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, and middle domain regulating SNARE assembly and fusion. Munc-18 initiates SNARE assembly and structures t-SNARE, independent of syntaxin N-terminal domain, and stabilizes the half-zippered SN complex dependent on the N-terminal domain. In the absence of Munc-18, SNAP-25 dissociates from tethered syntaxin and VAMP when the t-SN complex unfolds, with no SNARE reassembly observed due to dissociation of SNAP-25. In contrast, in the presence of M-18, 45% of completely unfolded SNARE complexes show full reassembly, suggesting M-18 holds SNAP-25 together with tethered syntaxin or VAMP, facilitating de novo SN assembly. M-18 has three force-dependent activities in SNARE assembly, consistent with multiple modes of binding between M-18 and SNARE complex. M-18 regulates every stage of SNARE assembly, proposing a working model to account for multiple roles in stage-wise zippering and membrane fusion. SNARE mutations compromise interactions between fully assembled SNARE and cognate proteins can support membrane fusion, concluding M-18 acts on folding intermediates of SNs to chaperone assembly.
Researchers investigated how integrin adhesomes self-assemble locally and correctly at diverse cell-matrix adhesion sites by exploring the cytosolic state of integrin-adhesome components and their dynamic exchange between adhesion sites and cytosol. Using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, they found the integrin adhesome is preassembled in the cytos as multi-protein blocks for adhesion sites. Stationary focal adhesions release symmetrically the same types of protein complexes they recruit, keeping the cytos pool of building blocks spatially uniform. The integrin adhesome is preassembled in the cytos forming multi-protein blocks that facilitate rapid and modular assembly of adhesion sites. Physical associations between adhesion components are spatially uniform around stationary adhesions, indicating sites exchange building blocks with cytos without altering them. In the cytos, blocks cannot form bigger structures due to dependencies between protein interactions. At the plasma membrane, the system can locally self-assemble adhesion sites by passing checkpoints inducing interactions in the integrin adhesome. The integrin adhesome is preassembled in cytos forming blocks for cell-matrix adhesion, size-confined and corresponding to layers across focal adhes anchoring and integrin regulation, force transduction, and actin regulation. Symmetric exchange between adhesion and cytos ensures blocks enter and exit adhesion without alteration. A model proposes switchable formation of adhesion via preassembled blocks where the integrin adhesome is preassembled in cytos as blocks for adhesion. Self-assembly would lose control on identity of co-recruited proteins when recruiting a protein in a block, forming aberrant structures, highlighting the need to integrate interaction-dependencies across the integrin adhesome.
Researchers have identified a novel electrophysiological marker of arousal levels in humans, utilizing intracranial and surface electroencephalogram recordings across four independent datasets. The 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum, representing the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, distinguishes wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, non-rapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep. Notably, the spectral slope discriminates wakefulness from rapid eye movement sleep based solely on the neurophysiological brain state, indicating that reduced states are not only defined by synchronous oscillatory activity. The study demonstrates that the spectral slope becomes more negative in sleep and under anesthesia compared to wakefulness and discriminates wakefulness from non-rapid eye movement and rapid eye sleep. Analysis of two datasets during a full night of sleep revealed that the spectral slope differs significantly between wakefulness and sleep stages. The frequency range of 30-45 Hz is suited to track arousal in both anesthesia and different sleep levels, including rapid eye and non-rapid eye sleep. The slope mirrors rapid changes in excitability over the course of a slow wave, providing a mechanistic link between the slope and population synchrony during slow oscillations. The non-oscillatory part of the power spectrum reliably differentiates wakefulness from reduced arousal states, namely rapid eye, non-rapid sleep, and propof anesthesia. Collectively, the results provide evidence that the spectral tracks changes in levels in propof anesthesia and sleep with high precision, observable on a range of timescales, and correlates with all stages of arousal. The findings describe a common electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal, including sleep stages and anesthesia in humans. The spectral slope in the 30-45 Hz range correlates with all stages of arousal, providing empirical evidence for its role in tracking changes in levels. Overall, the study establishes the 1/f spectral slope as a reliable electrophysiological marker of arousal in humans, applicable to various states of reduced arousal, including sleep and anesthesia.
Researchers have discovered that dynamic extensions from chloroplasts, known as stromules, connect with nuclei and play a role in innate immunity. The study demonstrates that stromules extend along microtubules and that microtubule organization directly affects stromule dynamics, with stabilization of microtubules increasing stromule numbers and length. Actin filaments are not required for stromule extension but provide anchor points for stromules, and there is a correlation between the direction of stromules from chloroplasts and the direction of chloroplast movement. Stromule-directed chloroplast movement was observed in steady-state conditions without immune induction, suggesting it is a general function of stromules in epidermal cells. The results show microtubules and actin filaments facilitate perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts during an immune response. A proposed model suggests stromules extend along microtubules, connect to actin anchor points surrounding nuclei, facilitating stromule movement of chloroplasts to nuclei during innate immunity. Microtubules are required for stromule extension and movement, with depolymerization leading to retraction and stabilization increasing frequency. The cytoskeleton supports cellular functions including cytoplasmic streaming, cell division, elongation, polar growth, vesicle trafficking, nuclear positioning, and morphogenesis. The study shows dynamic stromules extend along microtubules, actin filaments stabilize stromules, and chloroplast-nuclear connections during immune response. Microtubule-mediated stromule extension and actin-mediated stromule anchoring are complementary during stromule formation and movement, providing mechanistic insights into interactions with cytoskeleton and stabilizing stromules. A new type of organellar movement along microtubules, stromule-directed, reveals a mechanism for perinuclear clustering during innate immunity. The precise role of actin filaments and microtubules in stromule dynamics in green tissue chloroplasts was not well understood, but analysis of the mechanism of stromule extension and movement in chloroplasts of green tissue and perinuclear clustering during immunity shows microtubules are required for stromule extension and movement. Future investigation will focus on molecular components for stromule dynamics, stromule movement, and importance of perinuclear clustering during immunity.
Researchers investigated whether amino acid sequences of residues that contact across protein interfaces covary during evolution and if such covariance can be used to predict contacts and assemble models of biological complexes. They found that residue pairs identified using a pseudo-likelihood method to covary across protein-protein interfaces in the 50S ribosomal unit and 28 bacterial complexes with known structures are almost always in contact, provided the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average length of the proteins. This method was used to make subunit predictions for 36 protein complexes with unknown structures and models for the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic transporter, tripart efflux system, pyruvate formate-activating enzyme, and methion ABC transporter. Results suggest interactions can be accurately predicted across protein-protein interfaces given sufficient aligned sequences. Residue-residue contact predictions were made for 36 of 64 complexes with unknown structures and models presented for four well-constrained complexes. Significant residue-residue covariance occurs frequently between physically interacting protein pairs but rarely non-interacting pairs, useful for predicting protein interactions. Application of statistical models to coevolution-based contact prediction has been limited, this study examines residue-residue covariation across protein-protein interfaces using pseudo-likelihood statistical method. Predictions contribute to the determination of structures of biologically important complexes. Strongly co-evolving residue pairs for complexes without structure had at least one prediction with GREML score greater or equal to 0.85.
Researchers investigated how individuals accumulate information from multiple locations in a scene to interpret visual patterns, using a novel gaze-conting paradigm in a visual categorization task. The results showed that participants' scan paths follow an active strategy that incorporates information already acquired about the scene and knowledge of statistical patterns. Notably, categorization performance improved when locations were revealed by an optimal Bayesian active algorithm. Combining a Bayesian observer and active algorithm estimated that a major portion of apparent suboptimality of fixation arises from prior biases, perceptual noise, inaccuracies in eye movements, and the process selecting locations is 70% efficient. The findings suggest participants select eye movements to maximize information about abstract categories requiring integration from multiple locations. The study extends the range of active sensing to tasks with arbitrary latent features, providing fixation-by-fixation analysis of gathering under eye movements by matching the observer model to participants' performance. This allowed dissociation of eye-movement selection from perceptual, motor, and decision processes, identifying sources of sub-optimality and quantifying efficiency in choosing fixation throughout the scene. The approach is amenable to multiple perceptual domains, estimating efficiency of eye movements in high-level tasks on a fixation-by-fixation basis, focusing on pattern categorization different from visual search. Participants' eye movements were more efficient than heuristic strategies employing a subset of elements, about 70% as efficient as the optimal sensor operating with participants' prior, perception, noise, and inaccuracies. An experiment with statistically-controlled visual patterns allowed mathematically tractable quantification of information at each fixation, using gaze-conting categorization tracking eye and revealing small apertures of the image at each location, ensuring foveal vision dominated.
Nuclear transport is a tightly regulated process controlled by the nuclear pore complex, allowing thousands of molecules to cross, including large cargoes such as pathogens, mRNAs, and pre-ribosomes, with little understanding of the requirements for their import, especially the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors via nuclear localisation sequences and the effect of size on import efficiency. Researchers assayed nuclear import kinetics of 30 large cargo models based on capsid-like particles, 17-36 nm in size, with up to 240 nuclear localisation sequences, showing requirements for transport can be recapitulated by a two-parameter biophysical model correlating import flux with energetics of cargo through the nuclear pore. Results reveal key determinants of large cargo import in cells, scaling non-linearly with size, influenced by biochemical and physicochemical properties of cargo surface for small transport. Theoretical model assumes capsids do not interact during transport, but cargoes with nuclear localisation sequences bind nuclear receptors, entering the nucleus rapidly. Studies characterized nuclear receptor-mediated transport, focusing on cargoes with one to five sequences, showing nuclear kinetics follow mono-exponential behavior. Functional nucleocytoplasmic transport can be reconstituted by adding key components: Importinβ, Importα, RanDP, NTF2, and GTP, validated by control experiments using fluorescent dextran and model cargoes. Nuclear transport is a hallmark of eukaryotic cells, central to viability, with more than 200 nuclear pore complexes spanning the envelope in HeLa cells, ≈120 MD in metazoans and roughly half in yeast.
The co-stimulatory molecule CD28 is essential for the activation of helper T cells, and its role in maintaining T cell responses following activation has been investigated. A strain of mice where CD28 is removed from CD4+ T cells after priming was generated to determine the function of CD28 after T cell priming. The results show that continued CD28 expression is important for effector CD4 T cells following infection, with maintained CD28 required for the expansion of T helper type 1 cells and the differentiation and maintenance of follicular helper cells during viral infection. Persistent CD28 is also required for clearance of the bacterium Citrobacter rodium from the gastrointestinal tract. CD28 is essential for CD4 T cell priming and differentiation into effector cell subsets, demonstrating a previously undescribed role for CD28 following cell activation. CD28 expression is required after cell priming for the expansion of Th1 cells and the differentiation and maintenance of Tfh cells. Maintained CD expression is also required for clearance of enteropathic bacteria after oral infection, demonstrating CD expression is required for intact effector CD4 T responses during infection. CD28 signaling is essential for multiple facets of CD4 T activation including proliferation, survival, glucose metabolism, and migration. Consequently, CD-deficient mice have reduced expansion of effector CD4 cells and do not form Th1 and Tfh cells after infection or immunization. Tfh differentiation requires CD28 ligation during interactions of primed cells with B cells, fully differentiated Tfh require CD28 for survival, while Th1 do not require CD28 for maintenance but for expansion following T activation. Mice unable to clear Citrobacterium from the gastrointestinal tract following oral infection demonstrate the importance of CD28 in immune response to bacterial infection.
Helicobacter pylori's helical shape is crucial for efficient stomach colonization, but the molecular mechanisms generating this shape remain unclear. The helical center pitch and radius of wild-type H. pylori dictate surface curvatures with higher positive and negative Gaussian curvatures than straight or curved-rod H. pylori. Quantitative 3D microscopy analysis using N-acetylmamic acid or D-alanine probes showed cell growth is enhanced at sidewall curvature extremes. Immunofluorescence revealed Mre is abundant at negative curvature, while bactin Ccm is abundant at positive curvature. Strains with altered Ccm polymerization properties lose helical shape and positive curvatures. A model is proposed where Ccm and Mre promote PG synthesis at positive and negative curvatures, necessary for maintaining helical shape.

To investigate H. pylori diameter control and sidewall curvature, metabolic probes were used to study PG synthesis patterning. Superresolution and 3D image analysis showed synthesis is enhanced at negative curvature and a range of positive curvatures. Cytoskeletal proteins Mre and Ccm localization were investigated. Mre promotes synthesis at negative curvature due to its preference and role in localizing PG activity. To maintain sidewall curvature with Mre-driven growth, H.pylori enhances growth at the major axis independent of Mre. Bactin Ccm localizes to the helical axis, promoting synthesis at positive curvatures, supplementing Mre-associated synthesis at negative curvatures.

Mre and Ccm contribute to PG patterning, allowing H.pylori to maintain curvatures with Mre-associated synthesis. In E. coli, Mre is enriched at negative curvature, Ccm at positive curvatures where synthesis is enhanced. Both Mre and Ccm maintain PG activity, and patterning plays a role in helical shape maintenance. Computational tools demonstrated H.pylori achieves broader sidewall Gaussian curvature distribution than curved-rod bacteria, using distinct mechanisms to achieve curvatures. The distribution of sidewall Gaussian curvature in H.pylori is higher than in C.crescentus and V.cholera, indicating a unique mechanism for helical shape maintenance. Ccm variants with altered polymerization properties result in loss of helical shape and positive curvatures, supporting the model of Ccm and Mre promoting PG synthesis at positive and negative curvatures for helical shape maintenance.
Cdc48, a ubiquitin-selective chaperone, plays a crucial role in regulating mitochondrial dynamics by orchestrating the function of E3 ligases and deubiquitases. The deubiquitases Ubp12 and Ubp exert opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion and cleave different ubiquitin chains on mitofusin Fzo. Cdc48 integrates the activities of these two deubiquases, which are themselves ubiquitylated, to control the balance between activation or repression of mitochondrial fusion. Cdc promotes proteolysis of U12, stabilizing pro-fusion ubiquity on F1, while loss of U12 stabilizes Ubp and facilitates removal of ubiquitin chains on F1, inhibiting fusion. This cascade ensures tight control of F1 ubiquitylation levels, allowing sufficient for mitochondrial fusion while preventing unnecessary ubiquity that targets F1 for proteasomal turnover. The cascade between Ubp and U2 revises recent results linking U2 and M30, where M30 catalyzes the formation of pro-fusion ubiquitin forms on F1. Cdc negatively regulates U12, which negatively regulates U2, explaining their opposite effects on targets and ubiquitin homeostasis. U12 and U2 cleave different ubiquity forms of F1 that promote or repress mitochondrial fusion, with U12-specificity preceding U2-specificity on F1. Unopposed anti-fusion ubiquity disrupts mitochondrial tubulation. U12 recognizes ubiquity chains on F1 composed of a small number of ubiquitin moieties, proposing U12 does not stabilize substrates due to short ubiquitin chains. Both U12 and U2 deubity F1, binding different forms of ubiquity F1, with U12 binding forms stabilizing F1 and promoting fusion, while U2 recognizing chains targeting F1 for proteas degradation and inhibiting fusion. Ubiquitin is a double regulator of mitochondrial fusion, with U2 and U12 exerting opposite effects on F1 and fusion. Cdc regulates the ubiquity status of F1 through a novel cascade with U12 and U2, fine-tuning the fusogenic activity of F1, allowing control between activation or repression of mitochondrial fusion.
Researchers investigated whether vision is necessary for the development of categorical organization in the Ventral Occipito-Temporal Cortex (VOT) by using fMRI to characterize VOT responses to eight categories presented acoustically in sighted and early blind individuals and visually in a separate sighted group. The results showed that VOT reliably encodes sound categories in both sighted and blind people using a representational structure and connectivity similar to the one found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group using a representational format closer to the one found in vision. Crucially, VOT in blind represents categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. The findings suggest that sounds trigger categorical responses in the VOT of congenitally blind and sighted people that partially match the topography and functional profile of the visual response despite qualitative nuances in categorical organization between modalities and groups. The categorical organization similar to one found in vision emerged in VOT in absence of visual experience and such categorical response to sounds was enhanced and more stable in congenitally blind people. Studies have shown that in absence of vision the occital cortex enhances response to non-visual processing. Representational analysis demonstrated that categorical membership is the main factor predicting representational structure of sounds in VOT in blind rather than lower-level acoustic attributes. VOT reliably encodes categorical membership of sounds from eight categories in sighted and blind using topography, representational format, and representational connectivity similar to one observed in response to images in vision. However, categorical representation of auditory stimuli in VOT exhibits different nuances compared to categorical generated by visual stimuli in sighted. The overlap in responses may come from VOT representing visual attributes in sighted and acoustic in blind due to crossmodal plasticity. Studies involving congenitally blind have shown occital cortex may represent acoustic features such as frequencies. The results demonstrate that VOT encodes sound categories in both sighted and blind with representational structure and connectivity similar to vision and categorical membership is main factor predicting representational structure in blind.
Researchers have discovered a strain of the behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen Entomophthora muscae that infects wild Drosophila and established methods to infect Drosophila melanogaster in the laboratory. Infected flies exhibit moribund behaviors characteristic of E. muscae infection, including climbing upward, extending their proboscis, affixing in place, and raising their wings, clearing a path for infectious spores to launch from their abdomens. The fungus invades the nervous system, suggesting a direct means by which it could induce behavioral changes. The E. muscae-D melanaster system is proposed as a model for developing a mechanistic understanding of parasitic manipulation of host behavior due to the vast molecular toolkit available for D. melanaster. The invasion of the nervous system by E. muscae grants the fungus direct access to host neurons and may be mechanistically important for achieving behavioral manipulation of the host. Four general mechanisms are proposed by which E. muscae achieves behavioral manipulation. To gauge if E. muscae is capable of causing patent infection in hosts outside Drosidae, flies were exposed to E. muscae-infected D. melanaster and observed to die and sporulate, indicating they had been killed by the fungus. Transcription changes in host and fungus were measured at 24 time points over 5 days to gain a comprehensive look into how E. mus infection progresses in D. melanaster at the molecular level. Early infected flies are phenotypically indistinguishable from uninfected flies, complicating the analysis. Similar behaviors are induced in dipterans by distantly related Zygomycete fungi within the Entomophthora muscae complex. The E. muscae-D. melanaster system will enable rapid progress in understanding how E. muscae manipulates host behavior due to the availability of genetic and neurobiological tools in the host.
Researchers have generated transcriptome-wide RNA-binding profiles of 30 general RNA degradation factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to better understand RNA processing and degradation in eukaryotic cells. The profiles reveal the distribution of degradation factors between different RNA classes and are consistent with the canonical degradation pathway for closed-loop forming mRNAs after deadenylation. Modeling based on mRNA half-lives suggests most factors bind intact mRNAs, whereas decapping factors are recruited only for mRNA degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step. Decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons, consistent with rapid degradation of inefficiently translated mRNAs. Global analysis suggests the nuclear machinery, including complexes Nrd1/Nab and TRAMP, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and processes snoRNAs. 

The study used photoactivatable ribonucleide-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation to generate transcript-wide protein profiles for 30 RNA factors involved in deadenylation, decapping, exosome-mediated degradation, and RNA surveillance pathways, including nuclear surveillance and cytoplasmic nonsense-mediated decay. Bioinformatic analysis revealed how degradation factors vary in binding specificities for different RNAs and preferred locations on transcripts. Comparisons with published profiles of other RNA-binding factors revealed clusters that co-occupy RNAs or co-localize RNAs. The dataset provides a resource for future studies of earyotic RNA pathways, mechanisms, and integration of mRNA metabolism. 

Transcriptome binding for 30 RNA degradation factors in yeast revealed factor enrichment on different RNA classes and behavior for mRNAs and associated antisense transcripts. RNA degradation pathways enable regulation of RNA levels and surveillance of aberrant or poorly functional RNAs in cells. The large variety of RNA factors poses questions on how pathways are selected and whether RNA sequence can influence selection, requiring systematic analysis of RNA profiles of involved factors. Several transcript profiles of RNA factors have been reported, but this study provides comprehensive analysis of RNA-binding of 30 general degradation factors in S cerevisiae.
Researchers have discovered a novel bivalent chromatin structure associated with the rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes in response to pathogen signals in Arabidopsis. The study found that camin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications, trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3) and acetylation of lysine 18 histone 3 (H3K18ac), which have opposite effects on gene expression, forming a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. Mutants with reduced H3K27me or H3Kac suggested both modifications are required to determine the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of the stress response. The H3K27me-HK3ac bivalent chromatin, named kairo, plays a crucial role in controlling the timely induction of gene expression upon stress stimuli in plants. By integrating epigenomic profiles with genome-wide metabolic networks in Arabidopsis, two epigen marks playing opposite roles on gene expression, H3K27me and H3Kac, were enriched at camin biosynthesis and other metabolic pathways. In mutants with defective H3Kme or H3ac, the induction of cam biosynthesis genes and metabolite accumulation was accelerated or delayed. The results provide new evidence for how chemical defense by camin may be regulated at the epigen level. The H3me-HKac bivalent chromatin and its role on cam biosynthesis provide a molecular handle to investigate transcription factors that directly bind to promoters of biosynthesis genes interacting with proteins that deposit or remove epigen marks forming bivalent chromatin upon stress signals. The study found Hme and Hac co-localized on biosynthesis genes forming a previously uncharacterized form of bivalent chromatin and examined the role of Hme-Hac bivalent chromatin on the induction of biosynthesis by combining epigenomics, genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry. The results indicate the Hme-Hac bivalent chromatin maintains the proper timing of biosynthesis gene upon pathogen signal. Overall, the study reveals the importance of Hme-Hac bivalent chromatin in controlling the induction of cam biosynthesis genes in response to pathogen signals in Arabidopsis.
The epigenetic mechanisms that enable astrocytes to retain neurogenic competence throughout adult life are poorly understood. Research has shown that astrocytes serving as neural cells in the mouse subventricular zone express the histone methyltransferase EZ2, a polycomb repressive factor required for neurogenesis independent of its role in subventricular zone neural stem cell proliferation. Ink4/Arf-deficiency in Ezh-deleted subventricular zone neural stem cells rescues cell proliferation but neurogenesis remains defective. Olig2 is a direct target of EZ2, and repression of this bHL transcription factor is critical for neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, Ezh prevents the activation of genes associated with non-subventricular zone neuronal types. In the human brain, subventricular zone cells including astroglia express EZ2, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. EZ2 is an epigen regulator that distinguishes neurogenic astrocytes, orchestrating distinct and separable aspects of adult cell biology with implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis.

 EZ2 expression is a distinguishing feature of neurogenic astrocytes in the adult brain, required for distinct functions regulating cell proliferation and neuronal specification. To enable self-renewal, EZ2 directly represses the Ink4/Ar locus. Studies establish EZ2 as a feature of astrogl cells in postnatal subvent zone of mouse and human brain, identifying separable roles for EZ2 in neuron production from multipotent stem population. Results provide insights into the complex role of polycomb repressive factor in development and gliagenesis. EZ2 expressed in astroia and neuronal precursors of infant subvent zone suggests key roles in postnatal human neurogenesis. Data indicate EZ2 a critical epigen determinant for maintenance of multipotent astrogl, enabling proliferation and cell specification of adult population.

 EZ2 has a role in subvent zone neurogenesis distinct from function in Ink4Ar repression, rescuing only proliferation not neuronal, enabling investigation of additional roles in neurogenic astro population. Acute deletion of EZ2 in subvent zone neural cells resulted in decreased neurogenesis related to reduced proliferation. Future studies may address re-expression of EZ2 in non-sub zone astrotes enabling neurogenesis or transdifferentiation into neurons for therapeutic purposes. Overall, EZ2 is critical epigen regulator distinguishing neurogenic astrocytes, with implications for regenerative medicine and oncogenesis.
Researchers investigated the ecology and evolution of viruses infecting uncultivated SUP05 bacteria in a marine oxygen minimum zone using single-cell and meta-genomics. They analyzed 127 single-cell amplified genomes from SUP05 bacteria and identified 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA Caudovales and ssDNA Microviridae. The results showed that approximately one-third of SUP05 bacteria were infected with viruses, with higher infection frequencies in areas of severe oxygen deficiency. Microviridae clonality suggested recovery of bloom-terminating viruses, while co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses indicated previously unrecognized modes of cooperation. Analysis of 186 microbial and viral metagenomes revealed that SUP viruses persisted for years but remained endemic to the oxygen minimum zone. The study also identified virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase, suggesting that SUP viruses reprogram their host's energy metabolism. The findings demonstrate closely coupled SUP virus-host co-evolutionary dynamics with potential to modulate biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical oxygen minimum zones. Single-cell genomics linked SUP viruses and hosts across gradients of oxygen and sulfide over a 3-year interval, revealing patterns of co-infection between ssDNA and dsDNA viruses and auxiliary metabolic genes modulating electron transfer essential to SUP energy metabolism. SUP05 viruses were detected within and below the oxycline, consistent with SUP water column disposition, and contained genes encoding dissimilatory sulfite reductase, indicating a role in modulating the marine sulfur cycle. Fragment recruitment from microbial metagenomes to reference contigs was used as a proxy for abundance, providing insights into SUP lineage-specific virus-host ecology. The results highlight the importance of viruses in modulating microbial communities and ecosystem functions, with implications for understanding biogeochemical cycling in expanding oxygen minimum zones.
Cilia and flagella are assembled and maintained by the process of intraflagellar transport, a highly conserved mechanism involving more than 20 intraflagellar transport proteins. Researchers investigated the putative intraflagellar transport protein TTC26/DY13 to understand its function. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches, they found that TTC26/D13 is an intraflagellar transport complex B protein in mammalian cells and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Knockdown of TTC26/D13 in zebrafish embryos or mutation of TTC26/D13 in C. reinhardtii resulted in short cilia with abnormal motility. Surprisingly, intraflagellar transport particle assembly and speed were normal in dy13 mutant flagella, unlike other intraflagellar transport B complex mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analyses showed a set of proteins involved in motility was depleted in the dy13 mutant, indicating different intraflagellar transport proteins are responsible for different cargo subsets. Deletion of dy13 in C. reinhardt still resulted in flagella, indicating TTC26/DY13 is not required for ciliogenesis, but flagella were shorter with pronounced motility defects. Similar phenotypes were observed in zebraf cilia when ttc was depleted. Intraflag transport particle movement was normal in dy13 flagella, but inner dyne arm components were reduced, indicating a specific role for TTC26/D13 in transporting a subset of ciliary proteins. Comparative proteomic analysis supported a function for TTC26/D13 in transporting a subset of cargo involved in flagellar motility. Unlike other intraflag transport proteins, TTC26/D13 is not required for ciliogenesis or assembly of intraflag transport particles, but plays a role in transporting specific motility-related ciliary proteins into ciliaflagella. Mutant cells assembled ciliaflag but they were shorter, coinciding with observations in C eleg dy13, which has abnormal cilia with short length. Most intraflag transport proteins are necessary to assemble ciliaflag in the first place, for example C reinhardt mutants ift46, ift52, and ift88 cannot assemble flagella. Knockdown of IFT56 in zebfish embryos and C reinhardti dy13 cells showed motility defects ciliaflag, further analysis is necessary to clarify the role of IFT56TTC26DY13 in determining cilia length.
Lymphatic endothelial cells (EC) stimulate melanoma metastasis and invasion through a mechanism involving matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14)-dependent Notch3 and β1-integrin activation. Research has shown that exposure of expansively growing human melanoma cells to lymphatic endothelial cells in 3D co-culture facilitates melanoma distant metastasis in mice. The interaction between melanoma cells and lymphatic endothelial cells induces MMP14-dependent Notch3 and β-integr activation, leading to an invasive sprouting phenotype in 3D matrices. Notably, MMP14 is necessary for lymph endothelial cell-induced Notch induction and coincident β-integr activation, and both MMP and Notch are required for lymph endothelial cell-mediated metastasis in zebrafish xenografts. The interaction between melanoma cells and lymphatic endothelial cells leads to increased metastasis of melanoma xenografts in vivo, which is dependent on MMP and Notch. Studies using 2D and 3D lymph endothelial-melanoma co-culture models, in vivo tumor models, transcriptome profiling, in vitro studies, and zebrafish xenograft metastasis assays demonstrate that lymphatic endothelial cells promote melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch from 3D growth to invasive sprouting cell phenotype. In xenograft models, dissemination of metastatic melanoma cells to distant organs is increased by lymphatic endothelial priming. Lymphatic endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment affect the metastatic melanoma phenotype through molecular crosstalk between the tumor and lymphatic endothelium. Notch receptors 1 and 3 are highly activated in melanoma with pro-tumorigenic functions, and the identified MMP-dependent Notch upregulation may be important in metastatic melanoma progression. Lymph endothelial contact induces β-int activation in metastatic cells, required for 3D sprouting. The upregulation of Notch upon lymph endothelial priming reveals the lymph- melanoma model can identify clinically relevant molecules for cancer dissemination and unrecognized pathways contributing to lymphatic metastasis of melanoma.
MicroRNAs are conserved noncoding RNAs that function as posttranscription regulators of gene expression and miR-9 is one of the most abundant miAs in the brain. Although the function of miR9 has been characterized in neural progenitors, its role in dendritic and synaptic development remains unknown. Researchers developed a transgenic miRNA sponge mouse line allowing inactivation of mi9 in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner and found that mi9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. The mi9-mediated downregulation of transcription repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth. The study defines a key role for mi9 during postmitotic differentiation of neurons and presents a new reporter mouse line to characterize the activity of mi9 in different cell types in the brain. Inhibition of mi9 results in aberrant dend growth in vivo accompanied by impairment in synaptic transmission. A conditional transgenic mouse model revealed a developmental role of mi9 in postmitotic neurons as a regulator of dend growth and transmission. The study focused on postmit stages of neuronal differentiation and demonstrated a critical role for mi9 in control of dend development. Other miAs influence dend growth suggesting expression is under complex post-transcription regulation. The transgenic mouse line allows inactivation of an mi family in spatio-temporal manner and analysis reveals a role for mi9 on postmit neuronal as regulator of dend through repression of REST. The effects in mi9 mice are cell-intrinsic and mi9 exerts function modeling dend arbors as key of genetic controlling dend development. Synaptic transmission was impaired in mi9 sponge mice.
Researchers investigated the link between social visual difficulties and atypical brain organization in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a large sample of toddlers with ASD and non-ASD comparison groups. They found ASD-related functional hypoconnectivity between social brain circuitry, including the default mode network (DM) and visual and attention networks. A subtype of ASD with pronounced social engagement difficulties, identified through eye-tracking, was characterized by marked DM-occipito-temporal cortex (TC) hypoconnectivity. Increased DM-TC hypoconnectivity was related to increased severity of social-communication difficulties in this subtype. Early social-visual hypoconnectivity is a key neurobiological feature of this subtype and may be critical for future social-communicative development. This subtype can be identified with high precision via a simple eye test of social or non-social preferences in early development. Atypical intrinsic brain organization involving circuitry relevant to social engagement was found in early ASD development, with the default mode network functionally disconnected from visual cortices and dorsal attention network. Heterogeneity in social engagement is important for some but not all functional differences in early ASD, supporting the idea that toddler ASD is characterized by hypoconnectivity between DM and visual circuits and attention. Resting-state fMRI measured intrinsic connectivity between neural circuits affected in early ASD, with heterogeneity in social engagement explaining connectivity differences. The findings suggest early social-visual hypoconnectivity is a key neurobiological feature of this ASD subtype, critical for social-communicative development, and a potential target for early intervention.
Drosophila sessile hemocyte clusters are true hematopoietic tissues that regulate larval blood cell differentiation. Virtually all species of coelate animals contain blood cells that display a division of labor necessary for homeostasis, which depends on the balance between proliferation and differentiation accomplished in hematietic organs. In Drosophila melanaster, the lymph gland produces plasmatocytes and crystal cells that are not released until pupation, yet throughout larval development both hemocyte types increase in numbers. Mature plasocytes can proliferate, but it is not known if crystal numbers increase by self-renew or de novo differentiation. New crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation, occurring in sessile clusters and contingent upon the integrity of these structures. The existence of this hematietic tissue, relying on structure-dependent events to promote homeostasis, creates a paradigm for addressing questions in Drosila hematopoiesis and parallels with vertebrate systems.

Macrophages are the most plastic cells in vertebrate hematiet tissue and their specialization in vivo depends on the local microenvironment provided by the tissue they colonize. Similarly, in Drosila larvae the microenvironment by hemocyte clusters is necessary to induce crystal differentiation from plasmocytes, through cell-contact involving Notch-Serr. The study of hematiet organs and function is essential to understand how mature cells arise and their numbers are controlled. Drosila melanaster embryonic hematies produces two types of mature hemocytes: plasmocytes and crystal, plasmocytes are phagocytic compared to vertebrate macrophages. The increase of circulating and sessile crystal numbers during Dila development is lined with an apparent paradox: no mature cell has been dividing during larval and crystal in lymph do not enter circulation in homeatic conditions.

The novel hematiet organ, attached to circulating hemocyte population and relying on structure-dependent events to promote homeost, brings closer to addressing fundamental questions Dila hematies. In homeatic conditions, differentiated hemocytes in lymph do not contribute to circulating and sessile population, nonetheless hemocyte in circulation and sessile patches expands throughout development. Plasmocytes are mitotically active, expanding development by self-renewal, while crystal numbers increase through Notch-dependent plasmocyte transdifferentiation in sessile clusters. The integrity of these structures is necessary for this process, creating a new paradigm for understanding Dila hematopoies and establishing parallels vertebrate systems.
Aneuploidy, a condition where cells have abnormal numbers of chromosomes, is linked to various diseases but also facilitates organismal evolution. However, it remains unclear how cells overcome the deleterious effects of aneupidy until new phenotypes evolve. Laboratory strains are extremely sensitive to aneupidy, but aneupidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. Researchers generated diploid strain panels with cells carrying two, three, or four copies of affected chromosomes and found gene-dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations but show elevated rates of gene amplification, suggesting copy-number is buffered at these genes. Aneupidy provides an ecological advantage to oak strain YPS9 by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation. Dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneupidy to provide a natural route to rapid phenotypic evolution.

Chromosomal amplification is common in non-laboratory yeast, which are inherently tolerant of anupidy and display active gene-dosage compensation for specific amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are buffered against copy-number variation and show elevated rates of amplification. Mutations or adaptation could reduce expression at toxic genes, or wild strains downregulate in proportion to gene dose. Researchers generated isogenic aneuploid-euploid pairs and found up to 40% of amplified genes in naturally aneup strains show lower expression due to heritable polymorphisms. Reduced expression is due to polymorphisms downregulating amplified genes selected during adaptation to aneupidy.

Significant phenotypic differences between laboratory and non-laboratory aneup strains led to investigation of amplified gene expression. Researchers interrogated 220 genes across six aneuploids and found Class 2 genes could be misclassified, raising the possibility of genetic variation in dosage. Expression of dosage-compensated genes is controlled, many genes escape compensation and contribute to phenic variation. Whole and partial chromosome amplification is common in selection experiments. Results provide insight into how cells tolerate duplication of toxic genes long enough for new phenotypes to evolve, showing dosage compensation buffers aneupidy to provide a transient route to evolution.
Researchers have characterized xenopsin, a recently classified subtype of opsin, in the flatworm Maritrella crozier, and found it is expressed in ciliary cells of eyes in the larva and in extraocular cells around the brain in the adult. These extraocular cells house hundreds of cilia in an intra-cellular vacuole, similar to jawed vertebrate rod photoreceptors, which enclose their cilia within their own plasma membrane. Functional assays in human cells show Maritrella xenin drives phototransduction primarily by coupling to Gα. The discovery of xenin+ ciliary cells in the eyes of protostome larvae challenges views on opsin and photoreceptor evolution, deviating from the invertebrate trend of extraocular ciliary photoreceptors and ocular rhabdomeric/microvillar photoreceptors. Xenin expression is both ocular and extraocular, and its ability to drive phototransduction in live cell assays and expression in ciliary cells in Maritrella add molecular and functional evidence for the presence of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms. Metazo ciliary photoreceptors are morphologically diverse, especially in the outer segment where ciliary membranes increase cell surface area through stacking or greater numbers of cilia. Xenin's primary coupling to Gα is supported by two pieces of evidence: activation of a Gα signal cascade in human cells and xenin and Gα localization in the putative ciliary photoreceptor in flatworm. Xenin protein expression on cilia cells that form eyes supports the possibility that the VPx motif is involved in transporting xenin to cilia. The findings highlight similarities between xenin and c-ops, revealing a novel type of opsin-expressing cell, and provide the first molecular and functional evidence of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms. Xenin's ability to drive phototransduction and expression in ciliary cells provide indirect evidence for the presence of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms, contributing to the understanding of opsin and photoreceptor evolution.
Spatial and temporal cues are required to specify neuronal diversity, but how these cues are integrated in neural progenitors remains unknown. Drosophila progenitors, or neuroblasts, are a good model to study this as they are individually identifiable with relevant spatial and temporal factors known. Researchers tested whether spatial and temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts by using Targeted DamID to identify genomic sites of the Hunchback temporal factor in neuroblasts NB-5 and NB-7 that make different progeny. Hunch targets were found to be different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains which correlated with H-bound loci in each neuroblast. The Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor, expressed in NB5 but not NB7, had genomic sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5 but not NB7. This data supports a model in which early-acting spatial factors establish neuroblast-specific chromatin, leading to neuroblast temporal factor binding and production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage. Over 100 loci differentially bound by Hb in NB5 or NB7 were identified as candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification. Drosila is an excellent system to investigate spatial and temporal integration during neurogenesis due to a deep understanding of neural progenitor lineages and mechanisms involved in patterning. Spatial and temporal cues integrate to generate lineage-specific neuronal diversity in Drosila and mammalian progenitors but how spatial and temporal transcription factors integrate is unknown. Two mechanisms were hypothesized: independent and sequential specification. In the independent model, transcription factor binding is identical in all neuroblasts, whereas in sequential, binding occurs at different loci in each neuroblast. Hb genomic targets were determined in NB5 versus NB7 to discriminate between these models. Spatial and temporal factors are integrated in Drosila embryonic neuroblasts and optic lobe neuroblasts and likely in mammalian lineages. Temporal transcription factors sequentially expressed in neural progenitors regulate this process in Dros and mammals.
Researchers utilized photo-switchable cross-linkers as molecular tweezers to investigate the pore-opening mechanism of the ATP-gated P2X ion channel, which functions by opening a transmembrane pore in response to extracellular ATP. Recent crystal structures in apo and ATP-bound states revealed molecular motions of the extracellular domain following agonist binding, but the mechanism of pore opening remains unclear. The study employed photo-switchable crossers to monitor inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain of the P2 receptor during activation, providing experimentally based constraints combined with computational studies for high-resolution models of the channel in open and closed states. Results showed the outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure, with the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices coming closer during opening through a hinge-bending motion. A decrease in distance between the inner and outer ends of pore-lining TM helices, likely through bending at a critical gating hinge, is essential for activation of the P2 receptor. Breaking one TM2-TM interface is sufficient for gating without altering ATP sensitivity, indicating the light-induced expansion is a local rearrangement of the TMD. The study applied photo-switchable derivatives to investigate the mechanism of pore gating in P2 receptors, providing the first application to explore the motion of rat P2X receptor by cross-linking engineered cysteine residues in TMD with photo-switchable azobenzene tweers. A set of structural constraints with Molecular Dynamics provided high-resolution models of the channel in open and closed states in physiological environment. Data demonstrated a 2.4-fold decrease of ATP sensitivity for the G342 mutant, consistent with the fact that alanine rigidifies α-helices, indicating TM helices contain a critical hinge facilitating vertical bending, allowing inner and outer ends of TM2 to come closer during activation.
Cytokinesis, the process of cell division into two daughter cells, is powered by constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring and has been assumed to occur through similar mechanisms in all animal cells. However, recent evidence suggests cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types exhibits more variation than previously realized. In the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, each blastomere has distinct fate specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute treatment, researchers identified cell-type variation in cytoketic requirements for for forminCYK-1-dependent filamentous-actin cytoskeleton. In one cell, P2, this variation is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in another, EMS, it is cell-extrinsically regulated, dependent on Src-1 signaling and direct contact with neighbor P2. Both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms control cytoketic variation in cell types, protecting against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened.

Researchers used thermogenetics, drug treatment, and embryo microsection to probe mechanisms of cell-based variation in cytokinesis among blastomeres in four-cell C elegans embryo, finding cell-type differences in functional and temporal activity for forminK1 but not myosin-I. In one-cell embryos, forminK1 inactivation by thermal upshift to restrictive temperature before mid-constriction resulted in 100% cytokinesis failure. Fast-acting temperature-sensitive alleles were used to inactivate contractile ring proteins myos-II and diaphanous forK1 in one-cell, identifying cell-type variation in four-cell embryos for forminK1 but not myos-II.

Data show cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms contribute to cytoketic diversity, promoting robust cytokinesis when contractile ring is weakened in specific cell types within four-cell C elegans embryo. Each cell has unique identity and can be scored for contractile constriction during cytokinesis. Thermogenetics combined with cell-specific in vivo and ex vivo analysis of cytokinesis in each blastomere of four-cell C elegans embryo studied mechanisms of cytoketic variation. Cell-type differences in functional and temporal forminK activity but not myos-I were found among blastomeres. Results indicate both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms promote cell-type cytoketic diversity and protect against division failure when contractile ring is weakened in specific cell types within four-cell C elegans embryo.
Bacterial flagella play a crucial role in mediating host-microbe interactions through tissue tropism during colonization and activating immune responses. The flagellar shaft of some bacteria, including human pathogens, is encased in a membranous sheath of unknown function. Researchers have hypothesized that the sheath may allow bacteria to evade host responses to immunogenic flagellin subunit, but this structural feature has remained an enigma. A recent study demonstrates that rotation of sheathed flagellum in mutualist Vibrio fischer and pathogen Vibrio cholera promotes release of potent bacteria-derived immunogen lipopolysaccharide found in flagellar sheath. The study reveals a new role for flagellar sheath in triggering, rather than circumventing, host responses in squid-vibrio symbiosis. Using squid-vibrio symbiosis as a tool, researchers probed the effect of enigmatic flagellar sheath on host recognition, uncovering a previously unrecognized role for rotation of sheathedella in mediating release of immunogenic lipopolysaccharide. The flagellar sheath has been problematic to study due to lack of mutations resulting in loss of sheath in otherwise sheathed flagella. The functional role of sheath, even in relation to bacterial motility, remains poorly characterized. Observation of this phenomenon furthers understanding of enigmatic structure and contribution to bacterial virulence. Further work will build upon discoveries, clarifying mechanisms underlying signaling during squid-vrio symbiosis, including characterizing composition of lipopolysaccharide released by Vibrio fischer during flagellar rotation and identifying squid receptors recognizing Vibrio lipopolysaccharide. Flagellar activation of immunity has been limited to responses to protein flagellin, despite flagellar sheath flagin monomers being prevalent in secretome of Vibrio cholera and Vibrio fischer. Limited tools to study flagellar sheath led researchers to use model symbiosis between Vibrio fischer and Hawaiian bobtail squid to probe sheathedellum role in inducing symbiont-specific response. Rotation of sheathed flagell in both Vibrio fischer and Vibrio cholera promotes release of lipopolysaccharide, found in flagellar sheath, presenting new implications for study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella, raising biophysical questions of sheathed-flagell function.
Genome instability is associated with mitotic errors and can lead to deleterious rearrangements, but also genetic novelty, and many questions regarding its genesis and evolutionary role remain unanswered. Researchers have described extreme chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination, a process resulting from hybridization of Arabidopsis plants expressing different centromere histones. Shattered chromosomes are formed from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with catastrophes affecting a single, large compartmentalized within a micronucle. Analysis of breakpoint implicates breaks followed by repair through non-homologous end joining or stalled repair. Mutation of non-homologous end joining factor DNA Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery, and heritability and stability of rearranged chromosomes suggest potential for enduring genomic novelty. These findings provide a tractable natural system towards investigating causes and mechanisms of complex rearrangements similar to those associated with human disorders.

The phenomenon studied depends on chimeric CEN3, but a similar effect was observed when the haploid inducer expresses CEN3 of a close species. Results using DNA lig4 mutants suggest non-homolog end joining plays a role in repair of haploid chromosomes contributing to diploid and aneuploid progeny. When non-hom end joining is inhibited, haploid frequency increases. In silico reconstruction indicates non-hom end joining is involved in repairing breaks on shattered chromosomes, contributing to formation or persistence of aneuploid and diploid progeny. Unrepaired double-stranded breaks increase haploid genome elimination similar to observations in mouse-human hybrid elimination.

Consequences of mitotic malfunction on genome integrity can be dire, missegregated chromosomes lead to aneuploidy, extensive and catastrophic restructuring resulting in sequestration in micronuclei, endonolytic damage, defective repair, and rescue. Researchers hypothesize missegregated chromosomes enter degradative pathway initiated by endonucleolytic breaks, occasionally rescued. Results provide evidence for occurrence of chromosomal restructuring when diverged individuals hybridize, identifying centrom-based mechanism for genomic instability. Altered CEN3 strain hybridized to recessive glabrous-1 mutant results in ploidy from centrom-mediated uniparent genome elimination. Non-hom end joining pathway plays a role in haploid chromosomes contributing diploid aneup progeny and unrepaired breaks increase haploid genome elimination. Findings indicate non-hom joining contributes formation persistence aneup and diploid and haploid progeny.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is causally linked to several human cancers and expresses viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit apoptotic response to uncontrolled proliferation. The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates NFκB and is critical for survival of EBV-immortalized B cells. However, during early infection, EBV induces rapid cell proliferation with low levels of LMP and little apoptosis. To define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP/NFκ early infection, researchers used BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and defined a transition from uninfected cells (BCL-2) to early-infected (MCL-1/BCL) and immortalized cells (BFL1). This dynamic change in cell mechanisms relies on regulation of MCL1 mitochondrial localization and BFL1 transcription by the viral EBNA3 protein. EBNA3 regulates the BH3 profile of EBV-infected cells and suppresses apoptosis by promoting MCL1 mitochondrial localization and increasing BFL mRNA transcription. Transcription of BFL is regulated by EB transcription factor EB2 and LMP-induced NFκ. Mature human peripheral B cells depend on BCL2 for survival, while EB latent infection suppresses apoptotic priming during outgrowth by initially upregulating MCL, followed by B1. Mechanistically, a new role for viral protein EB3 in apoptosis resistance during early and late EB-induced cell proliferation was identified. Uninfected human peripheral CD19 B cells depend on B2 for survival, and EB upregulates additional proteins to suppress apoptosis by B2 antagonism. BH profiling predicted EB-infected cells are less primed for apoptosis due to combined effects of M1 and B2 during proliferation, with protection by B1 in immortalized cells. Constitutive NF signaling from L1, a TN homologue, is responsible for suppression in latently proliferating cells, but the initial burst of cell proliferation is driven by EB transcription factors in absence of L or NF activity. The mechanism by which EB3 enhances M1 function at the mitochondria provides insight into apoptotic regulation during B maturation and lymphagenesis. The early phase of EB infection where EBs are expressed with little Ls is known as latency II. The study defines a new role for EB3 in suppression of apoptosis with implications for EB lymphagenesis.
Plants produce diverse metabolites to cope with environmental challenges, driving the diversification of specialized metabolites within and between species. Researchers are beginning to understand how new alleles controlling metabolite diversity arise and how their geographic distribution is structured by ecological and demographic pressures. A study measured variation in specialized metabolites across 797 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions, showing a combination of geography, environmental parameters, demography, and genetic processes influence chemotypes and distribution. Causal loci in metabolism contain frequent independently generated alleles, suggesting within-species convergence, providing a new perspective on selective forces shaping allelic variation and local adaptation. Genetic variants influencing plant chemical variation derive from gene duplication in enzyme encoding genes for metabolism, with mechanistic studies focusing on bialle phenotypic variation linked to loss-of-function variants. The Arabidopsis glucosinolate system is an optimal model to study species-wide processes driving metabolite variation due to known biosynthetic pathways and causal loci for variation. High allelic diversity at these loci raises questions on how pathways pass through speciation boundaries, confounded by observations of similar chemotyp variation in Brassica species. Understanding genetic, demographic, and environmental factors shaping trait variation within a population is key to understanding evolution. This study used aliphatic glucosinolates in Arabidopsis thalian seeds to query genetics, geography, environment, and demography intersecting chemotyp variation across Europe. The intersection of environmental pressure, demography, and genomic complexity gives rise to metabolic variation, using the glucosinolate pathway as a model to understand genomic variation, demography, and environmental pressure shaping metabolism within species.
Apoptosis and its molecular mediators, caspases, have long been regarded as tumor suppressors, with evasion of apoptosis being a hallmark of cancer. However, recent work suggests that apoptotic caspases can also promote proliferation and tumor growth under certain conditions. In a well-studied neoplastic model in Drosophila, oncogenic mutations of the proto-oncogene Ras (RasV12) maintain tumorous cells in an 'undead-like condition and transform caspases from tumor suppressors into promotors. Instead of killing cells, caspases promote the generation of intra and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which recruit and activate macrophage-like immune cells, signaling back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK. JNK further amplifies casase activity, constituting a feedback loop. Interfering with this loop reduces neoplastic behavior and improves organismal survival. Ras-modified casases initiate a feedback loop involving tumorous epithelial and macroage-like cells necessary for uncontrolled growth and invasive behavior.

Oncogenic Ras suppresses the apoptotic activity of casases, keeping scri−/−Ras12 cells in 'und-like condition. Casases induce apoptosis in few cells, but largely promote intra and extracellular ROS required for growth and invasion of neoplastic cells. This work extends models of Eiger and JNK signaling conversion from anti-tumor to pro-tumor by oncogenic Ras, identifying casases as essential components. Although apoptotic casases are tumor suppressors, under conditions like presence of oncogenic Ras12 in scri mutant cells, they adopt tumor-promoting roles. Oncogenic Ras switches caspase activity into tumor-promoting, maintaining scri−/−Ras12 in 'und-like state. Inhibition blocks tumor growth and invasion. The tumor-promoting function is dependent on intra and extracellular ROS required for neoplastic scri−/−Ras clones.

Duox-generated ROS activate hemocytes, JNK signaling, and hyperplastic overgrowth in 'und Ai model. ROS examined in neoplastic scri−/−Ras12 tumor in Dophila show similar function. Eiger and JNK signaling have proliferation and growth-promoting functions in 'und Ai model, prompting investigation of ROS and caspase roles in scri/−Ras growth in Dophila. Oncogenic Ras transforms caspases from tumor suppressors to promotors, generating intra and extracellular ROS, recruiting macrophage-like cells, activating JNK, and amplifying caspase activity. Interfering with this loop reduces neoplastic behavior and improves survival, indicating a tumor-promoting function of apoptotic caspases in presence of oncogenic Ras.
Perception of social interactions compresses subjective duration in an oxytocin-dependent manner. Communication through body gestures permeates daily life and efficient perception of messages reflects one's social competency, which is manifested temporally as shortened subjective duration of social interactions. Motion sequences showing agents acting communicatively are perceived to be significantly shorter in duration compared to those acting non-communicatively. The strength of this effect is negatively correlated with one's autistic tendency. Intranasal oxytocin administration restores the temporal effect in socially less proficient individuals, whereas administration of atosiban, a competitive antagonist of oxytocin, diminishes the effect in socially proficient individuals. These findings indicate perceived time is highly idiosyncratic and ingrained with one's personality, suggesting oxytocin is involved in mediating time perception of social interaction, supporting its role in human cognition. Autistic traits have been associated with reduced oxytocin levels and can be ameliorated with intranasal oxytocin administration. The link between autistic-like tendency and duration of social interactions raises the question of oxytoc's role. Antagonizing oxytoc's effect diminishes temporal compression in socially proficient individuals. The mechanism involves oxytocin, with socially less proficient individuals having lower endogenous oxytoc levels. Application of oxytoc promotes social-induced temporal compression in socially proficient individuals. Results reaffirm perceived social interactions influence on subjective duration, highlighting idiosyncrasy tied to social proficiency, a stable personality trait. Oxytoc plays a critical role in time perception of social interaction, supporting its involvement in human cognition.
The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 virus Spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) and the ACE2 cell surface protein is required for viral infection of cells. Mutations in the RBD present in SARSV-2 variants of concern have emerged worldwide, such as the B.1.1.7 lineage with a N501Y mutation that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the RBD site. A detailed affinity and kinetics analysis of the effect of five RBD mutations (K417N, K417T, N501, E484, and S477) and two ACE2 mutations (SP and KR) on the RBD/ACE interaction was performed. The effects of individual RBD mutations and combinations found in new SARS-CoV2 Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants were analyzed. Most of these mutations increased the affinity of the R/ACE interaction, except for KN/T which decreased affinity. The N501 and S477 mutations enhance transmission primarily by enhancing binding, the KN mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484 mutation enhances binding and immune escape. Studies of enveloped viruses, including SARSV, suggest increases in affinity of viral ligands for cellular receptors can increase infection and disease severity. The effect of increased affinity for SARS2 RBD of the KR and SP ACE mutants is less clear. Carriers of ACE variants may be at greater risk of infection and severe disease as RBDACE binding is limiting for SARS transmission. The effects of ACE variants are primarily relevant to carriers of these mutations. The SARS2 virus enters cells following interaction between the Spike protein and ACE on cell surfaces, with the RBD binding the membrane-distal portion of ACE. Precise information is needed to assess the extent RBD mutations enhance ACE binding or immune evasion. A detailed affinity kinetic analysis of the interaction between RBD and ACE at physiological temperature was undertaken, taking care to avoid common pitfalls. Combinations of RBD mutations including present in VOC20202, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants were examined. The results suggest the N501 and S477 mutations enhance transmission, KN mutations facilitate immune escape, and E484 enhances binding and escape. The study provides insight into the effects of RBD and ACE mutations on viral infection and transmission.
Researchers have generated a large-scale map of genetic interactions in metazo cells, specifically in Drosophila cells, to understand how gene-gene interactions shape phenotypes and modify the effects of mutations during development and disease. The study utilized combinatorial RNA interference and automated single-cell phenotyping to generate a genetic map for 21 phenotypic features, devising a method that combines interactions on multiple phenotypes to reveal directional relationships. This approach reconstructed the sequence of protein activities in mitosis and revealed the Ras pathway interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodelling complex, an interaction conserved in human cells. The map comprises 136 Drosila genes implicated in cellular processes including signaling, chromatin, and cell regulation, with quantitative scoring of 21 phenotypes in cultured cells using automated imaging. Gene functions were inferred based on statistical interactions, predicted complexes, and clustered by similarity. An epistatic relationship between Ras/MAP signaling and SWI/SNF regulators of chromatin remodeling was demonstrated in vivo. Directional genetic interactions were identified at scale and mapped to other genomic sets to identify regulatory relationships. The multivariate phenotyping approach revealed a circuit of temporal and causal relationships of complexes during the M-phase of the cell cycle. Inspection highlighted an unexpected link between chromatin remodeling and RAS signaling with interactions between the SWI/SNF complex and SWI-associated chromatin remodeler. The study presents a powerful approach for reconstructing regulatory networks and provides a resource for interpreting functional consequences of genetic alterations, offering the largest map of multi-phenotype interaction profiles in metazo cells to date.
Heterostly is a widespread floral adaptation that promotes outbreeding, yet its genetic and evolutionary basis remains poorly understood. In Primula, heterosty is controlled by the S-locus supergene that determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organ incompatibility between two morphs. Researchers have identified the Primula CYP73450 gene, encoding a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, as the locus that determines style-length dimorphism. CYPA50 is present only on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, specifically expressed in S-morph styles, and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. The gene arose via a specific duplication to the Primulaceae lineage and shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution. The combined evidence indicates CYP50 represents the locus in the Primula heterostly supergene, whose expression in S-morph styles causes brassinoster degradation, limiting cell expansion and style elongation. Evolutionarily, CYP50 arose via lineage-specific duplication and gain of style-specific expression. The proposed duplication and gain of style-specific expression of CYP50 in the ancestor of Primulaceae likely represents the dominant shortening mutation. CYP50 is an example of an identified causal locus in a supergene underlying adaptive polymorphism, opening the way for understanding the evolutionary origin of the Primula S-loc as an iconic case of complex supergene. Heterostly evolved once in the genus Primula and the causal genes should co-segregate with morphotypes in all heterostylous species. The CYP50 presence/absence polymorphism strictly cosegregates with the morph in all heterostyl species sampled across the phylogeny and the gene is absent or inactivated in all cases of derived homostly. This supports the conclusion that CYP50 is the locus of the Primula heterosty supergene determining style-length polymorphism. Heterly in Primula is controlled by the S-loc supergene comprising five linked genes determining style, anther height, pollen size, and male and female incompatibility.
Kisspeptin and neurokin B neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus are essential for pubertal development and fertility, with kisspept neurons co-expressing kiss1, neurokin B, dynorphin, and glutamate to provide an episodic excitatory drive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons. High-frequency photostimulation of kisspept neurons evokes local release of excitatory neurokin B and inhibitory dynorph peptides, synchronizing kisspept neuronal firing and causing robust excitation of gonadotropin-releasing hormone neurons through a mechanism involving glutamatergic input to preoptic kisspe neurons. Kisspept neurons play a dual role in driving episodic secretion of gonotropin-releasing hormone through differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function. Nerve fibers expressing kisspein are localized in the internal zone of the median eminence, and simultaneous activation of kisspept neurons generates LH release in vivo via kisspept-mediated depolarization of gonotropin-releasing nerve terminals. High-frequency photostimulation of kisspe neurons induces a neurokin B-mediated slow excitatory postsynaptic potential modulated by co-released dynorph and synchronization of kisspe neurons. Activation of kisspe neurons co-releases glutamate, exciting rostral kisspe neurons and resulting in robust excitation of gonotin-releasing neurons. Kisspe neurons communicate with kisspe neurons via glutamate, stimulating burst-firing and releasing kisspein to excite gonotin-releasing neurons via the GPR signaling cascade. Kisspe, GPR, neurokin, and gonotin-releasing hormone are required for normal fertility. High-frequency photostimulation of kisspe neurons releases neuro B, depolarizing and recruiting other kisspe neurons, with dynorph co-released and acting presynaptically to modulate neuro release, governing synchronous activity and promoting kisspe release to stimulate gonin-releasing hormone release. Kisspe neurons play a dual role driving pulsatile secretion of gonin-releasing hormone through kiss release into the external median eminence and excite kiss neurons via glutamate to generate the preovulatory surge through a di-synaptic pathway.
Bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signalling plays a crucial role in maintaining pluripotency and favours mesodermal over neural fates upon differentiation, but the mechanisms by which BMP controls differentiation are not well understood. BMP regulates differentiation by blocking downregulation of Cdh1, an event that accompanies the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. Loss of Cdh is a requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells and suppression of Cdh activity rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. BMP acts prior to and independently of Cdh to prime pluripotent cells for mesod differentiation, thus helping to reinforce the block to neural differentiation. Differentiation depends on exposure to extrinsic cues and morphogen events that control receptivity to those cues. BMP, a key pluripency signal, feeds into this mechanism by maintaining Cdh expression which interferes with efficient neural and mesermal differentiation. Higher levels of BMP impose a posterior identity that primes cells for meserm and is incompatible with neural fate, explaining why BMP protects pluripency and promotes mesod differentiation. The loss of Cdh activity is identified as a limiting event for earliest stages of neural differentiation and BMP controls differentiation by maintaining Cdh expression. BMP target Id1 imposes proximal posterior identity on undifferentiated cells, priming them towards meserm. The ability of Id to block neural differentiation is due to a shift in positional identity of pluripotent cells in absence of overt differentiation. BMP signalling protects pluripency, suppresses neural specification, and required for meserm formation in vivo. BMP signalling contributes to maintenance of pluripency, but underlying mechanisms remain unclear, proposing BMP suppresses differentiation by maintaining Cdh expression. Suppression of Cdh rescues the BMP-imposed block to multilineage differentiation. BMP favours mesermal over neural fates by maintaining Cdh which interferes with efficient neural and mesermal differentiation and primes cells for meserm. The transition from pluripency to lineage commitment remains poorly understood, BMP signalling protects pluripency and suppresses neural specification, but mechanisms remain unclear. BMP required for meserm formation and maintains pluripency through Cdh expression.
Researchers have identified a novel mechanism by which a protein called Cep120 inhibits centriole maturation in quiescent cells, shedding light on how asymmetric properties of centrioles in the centrosome are established and maintained during quiescence. Cep120, a daughter centriole-associated ciliopathy protein, plays a critical inhibitory role at daughter centrioles, and its depletion in quiescent mouse and human cells leads to accumulation of pericentriolar material components including perentrin, CdkRap2, ninein, and Cep170. Elevated levels of these components result in increased microtubule-nucleation activity at the centrosome, causing aberrant dyne-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, dispersal of centri satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. Cep120 helps maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting untimely maturation of the daughter centri and defines a new molecular defect underlying pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune Asphyating Thoracic Dystrophy and Joub syndrome. Loss of Cep120 initiates changes in protein localization and abundance resulting in defective ciliary assembly, starting with changes in the maturation state of the daughter centri where Cep is preferentially enriched, disrupting ciliary signaling requiring CS-dependent delivery of essential factors to the centrosome. Cep regulates asymmetric distribution of PCM proteins at centrosome residing on the outer wall of centolar microtubules. Loss of Cep during quies is detrimental to ciliary function due to aberrant CS trafficking of proteins to centrosome, disrupting localization due to changes in PCM, microtubule organization and dyne-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins. Dispersal of satellites upon Cep loss disrupts cilia formation and function during quies. Findings establish sensitive control of centrosome homeostasis and relationship to primary cilium assembly and signaling, uncovering a molecular defect that underlies pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune and Jert syndrome.
Neuron-glia interactions play a critical role in the maturation of neural circuits, however, little is known about the pathways that mediate their communication in the central nervous system. Researchers investigated neuron-glia signaling in the developing retina and found that retinal waves induce calcium transients in Müller cells. During cholinergic waves, calcium transients were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine antagonists, whereas during glutamatergic waves, calcium transients were inhibited by ionotropic glutamate antagonists, indicating the responsiveness of Müller cells changes to match the neurotransmitter used to support retinal waves. An optical glutamate sensor showed the decline in Müller cell calcium transients was caused by a reduction in the amount of glutamate reaching Müller cells. These studies indicate neurons and Müller cells exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses.

Whole-cell recordings of retinal ganglion cells and two-photon imaging of calcium indicators or glutamate sensors expressed in Müller cells showed neurotransmitters released during retinal waves induce calcium transients in Müller cells. The spatio-temporal characteristics and molecular pathways by which neurons and Müller cells communicate in the developing retina were elucidated, finding retinal waves correlated with calciumients in a large proportion of Müller cells. The mechanism of interaction between neurons and Müller cells observed during cholinergic retinal waves is similar to previous findings in visual cortex and hippocampus where cholinergic stimulation leads to astrocyte transients via muscarinic accholine receptors. 

Müller cells express multiple neurotransmitter types throughout the period, allowing neuronal control of Müller activity to be sustained as synchronization shifts from cholinergic to glutamatergic signaling. The proportion of Müller cells responding to waves with calcium transients decreased significantly despite the presence of retinal waves. Müller cells express a variety of neurotransmitter receptors, including glutamatergic and cholinergic, and calcium transients at different ages could be evoked by different neurotransmitters during retinal waves. Researchers explored which transmitters modulated neuron-Müller signaling at developmental ages and found correlated activity between neurons and Müller cells during critical retinal maturation enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses.
Establishing the time since death is critical in every death investigation, yet existing techniques are susceptible to a range of errors. For example, forensic entomology, widely used to assess the postmortem interval (PMI), can have errors ranging from days to months. Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that avoids these limitations. Researchers have shown that postmortem microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse model, allowing PMI to be estimated approximately within 3 days over 48 days. The results provide a detailed understanding of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse, suggesting microbial data can be developed into a forensic tool for estimating PMI. The study aimed to assess long-held hypotheses about the role of microbes in corpse decomposition and test whether changes in microbial communities are predictable over the decomposition timeline, crucial for using microbes as a 'clock' to estimate PMI. Data allowed understanding of the underlying microbial ecology of decomposition and feasibility of using microbes as evidence, testing whether community change is measurable and directional during decomposition for accurate estimates of past events such as PMI. Previous research demonstrated skin and mouth bacterial communities followed a consistent trajectory of change during decomposition of swine corpses over 5 days. This study expanded on initial results by characterizing microbial change in external and internal sites in destructively sampled mouse corpses over 48 days, providing a proof-of-principle demonstration that microbial ecology has potential as a forensics tool for PMI estimation. A laboratory experiment characterized temporal changes in microbial communities associated with mouse corpses decomposing on soil under controlled conditions for 48 days, using culture-independent high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches for each sample, distinguishing bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukotes. The approach differs from prior work where regression models explained variation after being fit to all data, instead providing a demonstration that microbial ecology can estimate PMI. The study shows microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable, allowing PMI estimation within 3 days over 48, suggesting microbial data can be developed into a forensic tool, providing a novel method for estimating PMI that avoids limitations of existing techniques.
The Hox genes are a set of developmental genes that display conserved expression patterns in the embryo and define identities along the anterior-posterior axis in bilaterian animals, exerting their function through interaction with TALE transcription factors. Hox and TALE members are present in some but not all non-bilateria phyla, raising the question of how Hox-TALE interactions evolved to provide positional information. Using proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages, it was found that these networks emerged from an ancestral motif present in Hox and other protein families. Hox-TALE networks experienced extensive molecular innovations crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. The results highlight how homeobox families evolved during eukote evolution to constitute a patterning system in Eumetazoa. Hox-TALE networks constituted an ancestral regulatory module later exploited for patterning in Bilateria, effective when interaction modes existed with duplicated Hox family members, allowing diversifying patterning functions along the axis. This system was co-opted by various contexts of embryogenesis in eumazoan phyla for axis or tissue. Hox genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of bilian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis, contributing to morphological diversification of bilian organisms during evolution. Although networks rely on intricate properties, they originated from an ancestral mode kept in other homebox families. The study describes molecular cues underlying H-TA patterning in Bilateria established stepwise during eukote evolution. Developmental genes display dissimilar patterns or be absent in non-bilateria, showing genetic mechanisms are not universal. Cnidaria has a bona fide Hox repertoire, others lack H genes, raising the question how Hox acquired axial patterning during metazo evolution. In Bilateria, H patterning relies on PBC and Meis proteins, present in non-bilateria. Hox-T networks emerged from ancestral motif in H and related families, experiencing innovations for H functions along body plans, highlighting evolution of homeobox during eukote to patterning in Eumazoa.
Researchers utilized super-resolution microscopy to examine the impact of fluorophore size and photostability on AMPA receptor trafficking within and outside post-synaptic densities in rats. AMPA receptors were labeled with organic dyes, small quantum dots, or big quantum dots via different-sized linkers. Results showed over 90% of AMP receptors labeled with dyes or small quantum dots diffused in confined nanodomains within post-synaptic densities, stable for 15 minutes or longer, while less than 10% were extrasynaptic and highly mobile. Conversely, 5-10% of big quantum dot-labeled AMP receptors were in post-synaptic densities and 90-95% were extrasynaptic. The findings suggest AMP receptors rapidly enter stable nanodomains in post-synaptic densities with lifetimes over 15 minutes and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes. A total of 126 synapses were observed using small quantum dots to study AMPA receptor dynamics over 15-60 minutes. Similar results were obtained using sparsely labeled small quantum dots and organic dyes on live neurons, showing AMPA receptors predominantly localized at synaptic regions. Typically one nanodomain per synapse was observed, although multiple nanodomains existed. Labeling with big quantum dots correlated with the number of days in vitro, while small quantum dots showed no accumulation of large extrasynaptic receptor pools and constrained diffusion in post-synaptic density nanodomains. AMP receptors tagged with smaller fluorophores were mostly immobilized within post-synaptic densities, 84-97%, and 5-16% freely diffused in the dendrite membrane. Big quantum dots were too large to enable AMP receptors to enter the synaptic cleft. Determining receptor location has been challenging due to synapse nanoscale size, two-dimensional imaging, and inability to distinguish intracellular versus extracellular.
Researchers have identified the mechanism underlying the earliest response of central neurons to hypoxia, an increase in voltage-gated sodium current, as SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels. Hypoxia activates the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier pathway in cerebellar granule neurons, leading to SUMOylation of NaV1.2 channels, which increases voltage-gated sodium current. The time course of SUMylation of single NaV1.2 channels at the surface and changes in voltage-gated sodium current coincide and are prevented by mutation of NaV1.2-Lys38 or application of a deSUMOating enzyme. Within 40 seconds, hypia-induced linkage of SUMO to channels is complete, shifting voltage dependence of channel activation, allowing depolarizing steps to evoke larger sodium currents. The SUMO pathway and NaV1.2 are potential targets for neuroprotective interventions due to their role in hypoxic brain damage. Hypia-mediated SUMylation of Na1.2 is observed in the presence of TTX, indicating sodium flux is not a prerequisite for channel SUMylation. SUM1 and SENP increase and decrease voltage-gated current under normoxic conditions. The response to hypia is ablated by µ-Conotoxin-TII, a blocker of Na1.2 channels, supporting rapid SUMylation of Na1.2 at the plasma membrane in response to hypia. Hypia directly increases interaction of native SUM1 and Na1.2. The findings suggest Na1.2 channels and SUM pathway may be valuable targets for reducing damage due to acute hypoxic insults to central neurons. Acute hypia induces SUMylation of Na1.2 on Lys38 in rat Na1.2 expressed in CHO cells with the β subunit under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Data shows mean ± S.E.M for 10-15 cells per group. The study demonstrates SUMylation of Na1.2 at the plasma membrane underlies the increase in voltage-gated sodium in response to acute hypia in neurons and CHO cells.
Researchers have developed a mechanistic model to understand the thermal response of Ross River virus, a mosquito-borne pathogen prevalent in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to predict its transmission patterns. The model reveals that transmission peaks at moderate temperatures of 26.4°C and declines to zero at thermal limits of 17.0 and 31.5°C. The findings indicate that transmission is year-round in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in a nationwide peak in human cases. Climate warming is expected to increase transmission in temperate areas but decrease it in tropical areas where temperatures are already near the thermal optimum. The study emphasizes the importance of nonlinear models to infer the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predict responses to climate change. As the climate warms, understanding temperature effects on mosquito-borne disease transmission is critical, particularly with new pathogens emerging worldwide. Identifying thermal optima and limits by characterizing nonlinear responses can accurately predict geographic, seasonal, and interannual variation in disease. Thermal responses vary among diseases and vector species, yet mechanistic models based on empirical unimodal responses are lacking for many diseases and vectors. The study parameterized a temperature-dependent model for Ross River virus transmission using data from two vector species, Cx annirostris and Ae vigilax. The results support a general pattern of intermediate thermal optima for transmission where optimal temperature is driven by adult mosquito lifespan but upper and lower limits are uncertain. The strongest signal of temperature on disease is expected in temperate regions where mean temperature varies along the rising portion of the curve. Upper thermal limits of mosquito-borne transmission are determined by vector life traits with symmetrical performance curves like fecundity and survival rather than rate-based traits with asymmetrical curves like biting or pathogen development. The study highlights the significance of nonlinear models in predicting disease dynamics and responses to climate change.
Motor cortical beta oscillations have been observed for decades, yet their behavioral correlates remain unresolved. To investigate how changes in population activity, beta oscillations, and behavior are linked, researchers recorded multi-scale neural activity from motor cortex while macaques performed a neurofeedback task. Subjects brought their beta oscillatory power to an instructed state and executed an arm reach. Reaches preceded by reduction in beta power exhibited faster movement times than reaches by increase in power. Population activity was found to shift from a movement state during oscillations neuro-induced or naturally during tasks. This establishes a neural basis for slowed movement following periods of oscillatory activity. Notably, this shift in population seen in naturally occurring oscillations during tasks, suggesting oscillations reflect common signature of spiking patterns different contexts. The study ties existing works on behavioral correlates of oscillations with hypotheses of motor encodes onset through population-level activity. Volitionally increasing and decreasing cortical power with neurofeedback precedes slower and faster movement times, supporting the hypothesis that oscillations linked to patterns slowing new movements. Results add to previously findings of elevated power prior and after well-trained movements. Behavioral effect from neuro-induced oscillations matches hypotheses claiming movement-slowing role during natural movements. Individual responses during activity were different across tasks. Underlying motor population shifts from threshold when producing oscillations in task or naturally in task. Researchers analyzed units exhibiting activity during neuro-induced oscillations compared natural during reaching, despite differences at unit level, population show oscillations promote consistent movement-slow state both tasks, matching observed behavior. The study recorded neural activity from motor cortex while macaques performed a novel neurofeedback task and found that changes in population activity, beta oscillations, and behavior are linked. The findings suggest that beta oscillations reflect a common signature of spiking patterns even in different contexts and provide a neural basis for slowed movement following periods of oscillatory activity. The results support the hypothesis that beta oscillations are linked to neural patterns that slow the onset of new movements and add to previously reported findings of elevated power prior to and after well-trained movements. The study ties existing works on behavioral correlates of oscillations with hypotheses of how the motor cortex encodes movement through the lens of population-level activity, providing new insights into the role of beta oscillations in motor control.
TRAF2, a component of the TNF superfamily signaling complexes, plays a crucial role in regulating immune cell homeostasis. TR2 deficient mice die at birth, limiting understanding of its role in adult tissues. The function of TR2 RING is debated, with some claiming it cannot function as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, while others argue it requires sphingosine-1-phosphate, generated by sphingine kinase 1, to function as E3 ligase. Keratinocyte-specific deletion of Traf2, but not sph1 deficiency, disrupts TNF mediated NF-κB and MAPK signaling, causing epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic inflammation. This inflammation is driven by TNF, cell death, non-canonical NF-κB, and the adaptive immune system, representing a clinically relevant model of psoriasis. TR2 has tissue-specific functions independent of sph1. Absence of TR2 in keratinocytes in vivo results in psoriasis-like epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation. Deleting Tnf and Nf2 genes reverses the inflammatory phenotype, highlighting TR2's role in protecting keratinocytes from death and downregulating inflammatory responses. TR2-deficient keratinocytes produce inflammatory cytokines via non-canonical NF-κ pathway, recruiting immune cells, including neutrophils and IFN+ cells, generating a psoriasis-like phenotype with slower onset. Primary keratinocytes isolated from T2KO and Sk1 mice show TN signaling delayed and weakened in T2 deficient, but not Sk deficient keratinocytes. T2 deficient keratinocytes are sensitive to TN-induced death, associated with cFLPL reduction and caspase cleavage. Concomitant deletion of Tnf in T2 deficient keratin breaks the cycle, preventing apoptosis and psoriasis onset. TR2 regulates TN and NF-κ signaling to suppress apoptosis and inflammation independently of sphing kinase 1.
Synaptic vesicles are specialized organelles that store and secrete non-peptide neurotransmitters at synapses, and following exocytosis, their membranes are rapidly recaptured by endocytosis and recycled for the generation of new fusion-competent vesicles. Research has shown that clathrin-mediated endocytosis plays a key role in this endytic traffic, but the mechanisms underlying process is poorly understood. A recent study used synapses of dynamin 1 and 3 double-knockout neurons, where clathrin-mediated endocytosis is impaired, to gain insight into this process. The results showed that massive formation of large endocytic vacuoles, or bulkosomes, was not defective but rather enhanced in the absence of dynamin 1 and 3. The conversion of bulkosomes into synaptic vesicles was not accompanied by the accumulation of clathrin-coated buds on their surface and proceeded even after clathrin knockdown, suggesting its independence of clathrin. These findings support the existence of a pathway for synaptic vesicle reformation that bypasses the requirement for clathrin and dynamin 1 and 3 that operates during intense synaptic activity. The study found that neither dynamin 1 nor dyn 3 is required for bulk endocytosis and their absence delays but does not abolish synaptic vesicle formation from internal membranes. The results are based on studies of dynamin 1 3 double-knockout synapses and ultrastructural analysis of the time course of synaptic vesicle recovery from bulkosomes in presence or near depletion of clath. The study contradicts previous evidence that bulk endocytosis in response to strong stimulus is dynamin 1 3 dependent and proposed an important role for clath in synaptic vesicle budding from endosomes. Overall, the study demonstrates a clathrin and dynamin-independent pathway of synaptic vesicle recycling mediated by bulk endocytosis that operates during intense synaptic activity.
Researchers conducted a randomized, single-blind, crossover study to identify and validate biomarkers of glucocorticoid action in 10 subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency. The study involved physiological glucortic exposure and withdrawal, with no serious adverse events reported except mild physical and mental fatigue and salt craving. Integrated multi-omic analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, adipose tissue, plasma miRNA, and serum metabolomics revealed a transcriptomic profile and multi-omic cluster predictive of glucortic exposure. A microRNA, miR-122-5p, correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by glucortic exposure, was identified and replicated in independent studies with varying glucortic exposure. The findings provide a basis for the discovery of biomarkers to measure glucortic effects, allowing for individualized and optimized glucortic therapy, and shed light on diseases related to unphysiological glucortic exposure, such as cardiovascular disease and obesity. The study utilized a multi-omic strategy combining gene expression in circulation and metabolic tissue, integrated with microRNAs and metabolites to identify putative biomarkers, which were then replicated in independent groups with different glucortic exposure. A transcriptomic profile similar in peripheral blood monuclear cells and adipose tissue was validated by comparison to published data, and miR122-5p correlated with circulating transcriptome and metabolome, suggesting a functional role in glucortic action. Two subjects did not show the miR122-5p response, experiencing mild fatigue during glucortic withdrawal. The study was funded by the Swedish Council, Swedish government, Endocrin Association, Wellcome Trust, Medical Council UK, Eva’s Foundation, Copenhagen Hospital, and Danish Rheumat Association.
The dynamics of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids involves a complex process where amino acids activate mTOR1 via a complex containing RAG GTPases, RAGULATOR, and vacuolar ATPase, leading to the translocation of mTOR1 to lysosomes, an obligatory step for activation. Live imaging of the mTOR1 component RAPTOR and a cell-permeant fluorescent analogue of di-leucine methyl ester revealed that translocation to lysosomes is a transient event, occurring within 2 minutes of amino acid addition and peaking within 5 minutes. This event is temporally coupled with fluorescent leucine appearance in lysosomes and sustained in comparison to amino acid stimulation. Sestr2 and vacuolar ATPase are negative and positive regulators of mTOR1 activity. Phosphorylation of canonical mTOR targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation, suggesting a dynamic and transient passage of mTOR1 from the lysosomal surface before targeting its substrates elsewhere. Leucine has a prominent role in mTOR activation and leuc methyl ester that enters cells and accumulates in lysosomes can activate mTOR on its own. The lysosome is a crucial for m activation but the dynamics of this process and how mTOR1 activity is connected to lysosomal residence may be more complicated than current models. Expressing subunits of mTOR tagged with GFP to follow localization in live cells revealed a sustained translocation of the complex owing to its property to continuously accumulate within the lysosomal lumen. Amino acids ultimately activate mTOR in the interior and more than one type of sensing and acid is involved, with leuc sensed by Sestr1/2 and arginine entering lysosomes via SLC38 important for mTOR activation.
Research has shown that the modification of antigens with specific glycan structures can alter their intracellular routing in dendritic cells, influencing the priming of T cells. The study focused on the modification of Ovalbumin (OVA) with the glycan-structure LewisX (LeX), which directs OVA to the C-type lectin receptor MGL. This modification favored Th1 skewing of CD4+ cells and enhanced cross-priming of CD8 cells. Notably, cross-presentation of native OVA requires high antigen dose and TLR stimuli, whereas Le modification reduces the required amount 100-fold and obviates its dependence on TLR signaling. The OVA-LeX-induced enhancement of T cell cross-priming is M1-dependent, demonstrated by reduced CD8 effector T cell frequencies in MGL-deficient mice. MGL-mediated crosspresentation of OVA-LeX neither required TAP transporters nor Cathepsin and was observed after prolonged intracellular storage in Rab11+LAMP+ compartments. Glycosylation of antigens has a major influence on antigen uptake and compartmentalization, affecting presentation and the strength of the immune response. Modification of OVA with LeX glycans directs OVA towards MGL, skewing naive CD4 cell differentiation towards IFN-producing Th1 cells. Immunization with OVA-LeX increased CD8 T responses in vivo, with expression of murine MGL on BM-DCs and CD11+ sps analyzed by flow cytometry. Conjugation of LeX to OVA alters routing from MR and TAP-dependent cross-presentation into a TAP and Catheps-independent pathway, devoid of TLR dependence, enhancing CD8 cell priming and Th1 skewing CD4 cells. Crosspresentation is associated with prolonged storage in Rab11LAMP vesicles. Targeting OVA to MGL through Le conjugation enhances crosspresentation, increasing OVA-specific CD8 effector cells in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, MGL-dependent crosspresentation occurs at low antigen dose and independently of TLR, without TAP and Catheps. Using M1KO mice lacking MGL, it was ascertained M1 is the lectin involved in boosting antigen-specific effector cells, with no enhanced frequencies of OVA-specific IFN and TNα-producing cells detected upon immunization with Le-conjugated OVA. Overall, controlled glycosylation of antigens can influence intracellular routing, the nature and strength of immune responses, and should be considered for optimizing vaccination strategies.
Burkholderia thailandensis utilizes acyl-homoserine lactone-mediated quorum sensing to regulate hundreds of genes, including those involved in cell-cell-dependent type VI secretion (T6) toxin-immunity systems. Research demonstrates that T6 is required to constrain the proliferation of quorum sensing mutants in cocultures of a BtaI quorum-sensing receptor mutant and its parent. However, the BtaI mutant is not constrained and outcompetes its parent in broth culture due to the lack of cell contact and metabolic cost associated with quorum gene activation. The increased fitness of the wild type over the Bta mutant during surface growth is dependent on an intact TSS-1 apparatus. Quorum sensing activates B thailand TSS1 growth inhibition, serving to police and constrain quorum-sensing mutants, defining a novel role for TSS in intraspecies control. Evidence shows QS control of T6-mediated toxicity and immunity allows QS competent B thailand colonies to police against Bta QS mutants. In planktonic growth where T6 does not function due to limited contact, Bta mutants have a substantial advantage over wild cells due to the cost of Bta-dependent activities. A mechanism is described where wild populations mitigate the cost by hindering QS mutant growth via regulation of cell-dependent toxin and immunity, a form of microbial policing where QS-proficient bacteria outcompete signal nonoperators in the absence of T cell growth inhibition. Policing of social deviants has been reported in Myxococcus xanthus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with this study describing a novel mechanism for limiting quorum mutant growth in bacterial groups. Several functions have been ascribed to T6, with B thailand T-mediated killing active against Proteobacteria and important for interspecies competition. Results demonstrate TSS-mediated killing does not occur in liquid cocultures. Quorum sensing often controls factors benefiting cells in groups and cooperative activities, commonly mediated by acyl-hoserine lactone signals made by LuxI synthases that diffuse in and out of cells. The parent with an intact QS system expresses quorum-activated TSS toxin and immunity, whereas the Bta mutant does not fully induce TSS effectors and factors.
Research has shown that long-range coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks is crucial for cognitive performance and emerges early in life, with discontinuous hippocampal theta bursts proposed to drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations. To elucidate the cellular substrate of these interactions, glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus were selectively targeted at neonatal age using optogenetic manipulation. Results indicate that despite stronger theta and ripples in the dorsal hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking neuronal firing via direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation by pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 boosts prefront oscillations. The temporal delay of 10-20 ms between prefront and hippocal spike trains and the directionality of information flow between the two areas suggest hippocal drives the oscillatory entrainment of local circuits in the prefrontal cortex. Data provide causal evidence that theta-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of intermediate and ventral elicits broad oscillations in the prefrontal cortex via axonal projections. Tight coupling synchrony and directed flow from hippocal CA1 to prefrontal suggest the hippocampus acts as a drive for prelimbic activation at neonatal age. Differences between dorsal and intermediate/ventral communication argue for a driving force along the septo-temporal hippocamp axis. The study reveals that sharp wave ripples from intermediate/ventral hippocal correlate with pronounced firing and entrainment in the prefrontal cortex of neonatal mice. Anatomical substrate of coupling between hippocal subdivisions and prefrontal cortex was identified by monitoring projections from CA1 to prefrontal cortex. Optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic neurons in CA1 of intermediate/ventral hippocampus boosts prefrontal oscillations in neonatal mice, demonstrating the cellular origin of long-range coupling in the developing brain.
Dynamic post-translational modification of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) plays a crucial role in coordinating the co-transcriptional recruitment of enzymatic complexes that regulate chromatin states and processing of nascent RNA. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest RAPI subunit is composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats with a consensus sequence that includes serine residues, which undergo extensive phosphorylation. Serine-5 and Ser-7 phosphorylation mark transcription initiation, while Ser-2 phosphorylation coincides with productive elongation. However, in vertebrates, the CTD has non-canonical substitutions of Ser-7 into Lys-7, which can be acetylated. This study describes the discovery of mono- and di-methylation of CTD Lys-7 residues (Kme1 and Kme2), observed during the earliest stages of transcription, preceding or accompanying Ser-5 and Ser-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, Kac is associated with RNAPI elongation, Ser-2 phosphorylation, and mRNA expression. An unexpected balance between RNAPI K7 methylation and acetylation at promoters fine-tunes gene expression levels.

RNAPI binds to promoter regions in a hypophosphorylated state before the CTD becomes phosphorylated at Ser-5 and Ser7, marking the earliest stages of transcription. Productive elongation is characterized by an increase in phosphorylation of Ser2 throughout gene bodies. Novel antibodies specific to CTD-Kme1 and CTDme2 show these modifications precede or accompany phosphorylation of S5 and S7, upstream of S2 phosphorylation. CTD methylation is present at the promoters of genes productively transcribed into mature RNA, defining the earliest stages of the transcription cycle. Mutation of CTD7 residues is compatible with viability of mouse fibroblasts, and global serine phosphorylation and RNAPI localization are independent of the presence or absence of K residues. Acylation of CTD7 is associated with inducible expression.

Mono and di-methylation of CTD7 is detected primarily in hypophorylated forms of RPB, suggesting CTD methylation is associated with early stages of transcription. The extent of productive transcription at active genes with RNAPI recruitment to promoters is modulated at the level of CTD7 modifications. Methylation is associated with less productive transcription, while K acylation is most enriched at the highest expressed genes. The detection of K1 and K2 increases with the number of K residues in mammalian CTD cell lines, flanked by different amino acids, supports this conclusion. Overall, the findings suggest a balance between RNAPI K7 methylation and acylation at promoters fine-tunes gene expression levels, with methylation associated with early transcription stages and acylation with elongation and expression.
Skeletal muscle satellite cells remain quiescent in their niche but exit quiescence upon muscle injury to proliferate and repair tissue and self-renew to replenish the satellite population. To understand the mechanisms maintaining satellite quiescence, researchers identified differentially expressed transcripts during satellite activation following injury and found RNA binding proteins, including Tristetrapin, to be significantly changed. Tristrapin promotes decay of MyoD mRNA, a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment, via binding to the 3' untranslated region. Upon activation, p38/β MAPK phosphorylates and inactivates Tristrapin, stabilizing MyD mRNA. Satellite-specific knockdown of Tristrapin preciously activates cells in vivo, enabling MyD accumulation, differentiation, and cell fusion into myofibers. Regulation of mRNAs by Tristrapin functions as a critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism controlling satellite homeostasis. MyD upregulates its transcription, and muscle injury triggers a rapid feed-forward loop resulting in MyD expression driving satellite cells to commit to myoblasts. TTP may be involved in downregulation of MyD mRNA and other TTP-target transcripts by myoblasts during quiescent population formation or reacquisition following injury. Inhibition of TTP by p38/ MAP initiates a circuit committing satellite cells to myogenic lineage. Muscle regeneration requires rapid exit from quies but also renewal of quiescent population upon completion. TTP suppresses transcripts for activation as a mechanism for immediate exit quies. Upon injury, p38 MAP is activated, phosphorylating TTP. Transcripts encoding proteins regulating mRNAs, including mRNA binding proteins in skeletal diseases, support post-transcription regulation of RNA in muscle homeostasis. The involvement of p38 MAP signaling in satellite activation, division, and loss of function during aging indicates TTP may be required for quies. TTP is present in quiescent satellite, inhibited by p38 MAP signaling, and reduces MyD mRNA half-life. Loss of TTP from muscle should preciously activate satellite, promoting MyD expression and aberrant cell entry. The p38-dependent phosphorylation of T upon activation suggests T plays a role maintaining quies. T inactivation preceding MyD upregulation is consistent with T suppressing pro-myogenic targets.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-10 receptor (IL-10R) in regulating lamina propria macrophage function during infant development in mice and its impact on preventing colitis. IL-10 deficient mice did not exhibit signs of colitis during the first two weeks of life, but developed intestinal inflammation and macroage dysfunction during the third week, concurrent with weaning and diversification of the intestinal microbiota. However, IL-10 did not directly regulate microbial ecology during infant development. Macrophage depletion with clodronate inhibited colitis development, while absence of IL-10 on macroages sensitized mice to colitis, indicating IL-10 regulation of macroage function during the postnatal period is crucial for preventing murine colitis. Time-series experiments using IL-10 deficient mice evaluated histology, inflammatory gene expression, cellular composition, and luminal bacterial communities from birth to 14 weeks. Clodronate depletion investigated the role of colonic macrophages in colonic inflammation in IL-10 deficient mice, suggesting a direct effect of IL-10 signaling on microbiome is unlikely to be responsible for colitis. Data demonstrated a requirement for macroage-intrinsic IL-10 signaling during a critical developmental transition, which has implications for understanding colitis initiation in infants with IL-10 signaling deficiencies. The IL-10/IL pathway is essential for intestinal mucosal homeostasis and prevention of inflammation in infancy. Modeling infant-onset colitis in mice lacking functional IL-10 signaling could lead to advances in understanding etiopathogenesis of these diseases, as IL-10 deficient and wild-type mice exhibit differences in microbial diversity and composition. The study highlights the importance of IL-10 in regulating macrophage function during early development to prevent colitis.
The Tudor domain protein SIM-1 plays a crucial role in promoting siRNA production at piRNA-targeted mRNAs in Caenorhabditis elegans, acting downstream of piRNA production and upstream of mutator complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis. SIM1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, two phase-separated condensates that are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator-dependent siRNA amplification. This suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation by the mutator complex. SIM1 is required at a step between the piRNA pathway to the mutator, functioning to bridge the gap between primary and secondary phases of the C eleg piRNA silencing pathway. The protein localizes to cytoplasmic foci near Pules, granules, and Mutator foci, implicating a series of distinct perinuclear condates in the regulation of mAs by the piRNA and mutator. SIM1 acts downstream of PRG-1 to mediate the production of secondary siAs by the mutator, suggesting a role for multiple perinuclear condates to promote mRNA regulation by the piRNA and mutator. In C elegans, a small RNA amplification pathway dependent on the mutator synthesizes secondary siAs from pi-targeted mRNAs to trigger heritable silencing. Several proteins localize at or near P granules, including GLH-1-2-3-4, DDX19, LAF1, MUT14, and VBH1, potentially serving a similar function to RDE12 in shuttling pi-targeted mAs into SIM1 foci and to Mut foci. Numerous proteins have been identified in C elegans required for piRNA transcription, trimming, and modification. The mutator complex, which includes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, synthesizes high levels of siAs through the activity of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, regulating transposons and other germline genes in C elegans. The steps between mRNA recognition by piRNA and si amplification by the mut complex were unknown, but the identification of SIM1 provides insight into the regulation of pi-target genes mediated by the mut complex. Overall, SIM1 is a factor that acts downstream of PRG1 to mediate the production of secondary siAs by the mutator, and suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates to promote mRNA regulation by the pi and mut complex.
Researchers have investigated the properties of Purkinje neurons in zebrafish larvae, which are central to cerebellar function and exhibit bistability when recorded in vitro or in vivo under anesthesia. By recording intracellularly from Purje neurons in unanesthetized larval zebish, the study demonstrates bistability in these neurons, with tonic firing seen in depolarized regimes and bursting at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Purje neurons can switch from one state to another spontaneously or with current injection. GABA or NMDA receptors are not required for bursting, but activation of AMPA receptors by climbing fibers is sufficient to trigger bursts. The initiation of motor spiking is correlated with increased incidence of EPSPs and depolarization. Developmentally, bistability is observed soon after Purje neuron specification and persists at least until late larval stages. Two kinds of glutamatergic excitation are observed: strong excitation from climbing fibers and weak excitation from parallel fibers, both mediated by AMPA receptors. The study demonstrates bistability in Purje neurons of zebish larvae and shows that state changes are dependent on AMPA-mediated climbing fiber inputs. Purje neurons can be in tonic or bursting mode and toggle between modes. The conservation of structural and functional properties of the cerebellum suggests bistability is a conserved feature of Purje neurons from fish to mammals. The intracellular recordings from zebish Purje neurons confirm narrow spikes are sodium-dependent potentials, broad spikes are calcium-mediated, and large events are EPSPs. The study provides evidence that Purje neurons exhibit bistability in vivo and AMP receptor-mediated synaptic excitation drives state-dependent bursting in Purkin neurons of zebfish larvae.
Researchers have developed a multiscale model to study the principles of self-organization and adaptation of the actin cytoskeleton during clathrin-mediated endocytosis, demonstrating that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endocytic pits against membrane tension. The model shows that around 200 activated Arp2/3 complexes are required for robust internalization, which is consistent with experimental findings that approximately 200 Arp/3 complexes assemble at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human cells. Simulations predict that actin self-organizes into a radial array with growing ends oriented toward the base of the pit, with long actin filaments bending between attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit, storing elastic energy that contributes to endocytic internalization. Elevated membrane tension directs more filaments toward the base of the pit, increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production, allowing spatially constrained actin assembly to utilize an adaptive mechanism enabling endocytosis under varying physical constraints. Cells with low membrane tension can carry out endocytosis with low Arp2/3 complex activity, while actin network self-organization arising from the Hip1 distribution around the pit and filament bending allows the endytic actin network to change organization and force-producing capacity under elevated loads. The integrated model combines membrane mechanics with filament-based actin polymerization to develop a multiscale model of actin in mammalian endocytosis, demonstrating that a minimal actin network composed of actin, Arp2/3 complex, and capping protein can generate force to internalize endocytic pits against mammalian plasma tension. The actin self-organization and bending arise from the distribution of actin-coat attachments around the curved endocytic pit, allowing the actin network to adapt to changing loads, and incorporating the experimentally determined Ar2/3 molecule number into the multiscale model reveals the spatial organization of actin and force capacity of the endytic network.
Macropinocytosis is a cellular mechanism that allows cells to take up extracellular liquid into large vesicles, critically dependent on the formation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, which develops into a macinocytic cup. Research on Dictyostelium shows that macinocytic cups are organized around intense patches of PIP3, active Ras, and active Rac, with these signaling patches associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery. The formation of these patches does not depend on the enclosing F-actin ring and becomes enlarged when RasGAP1 is mutated, indicating Ras plays an instructive role. New macinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones, suggesting cup-shaped plasma structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP, recruiting a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery. 

Macropinos develop from cup-shaped projections of the plasma membrane, driven outwards by actin polymerization, containing a central patch of activated Ras and PIP throughout their life, associated with a ring of active SC at the edge. The ring of active SC is proposed to be recruited by the patch, driving a hollow of F-act to extend the walls of the macinocytic cup. Using lattice light microscopy, spatial and temporal control of actin regulators such as SCAR and WASP with respect to signaling molecules including PIP and Ras were mapped, leading to a new hypothesis for the formation of cups from the plasma. F-act in de novo macinosomes is closely associated with signaling, as illustrated by active Ras, with circular ruffles persisting on the surface before closing or regressing into the cell. Closure can be abrupt, involving the inward collapse of the rim. 

Ras activity stimulates macinocytosis in mammalian and Dictostel cells, with macinocytic cups associated with an intense domain of PIP essential for function. However, recent work shows ForG contributes to the base of the macinocytic cup but not the extending lip, suggesting SC might be moved to the periphery of Ras/PIP patches by myosin-1 motors. Early work showed myos-1 is genetically important for macinocytosis in Dictostel. Overall, macinocytic cups in Dictyostel are organized around intense patches of PIP, active Ras, and Rac, associated with a ring of active SC/WAVE at their periphery, with Ras playing an instructive role and new cups forming by splitting from existing ones.
The cohesin ring plays a crucial role in holding newly replicated sister chromatids together until their separation at anaphase, and its loading onto DNA is dependent on the Scc2/Scc4 complex. Proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division, and defects in this process can lead to chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, resulting in severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms. The structure of Scc in complex with an N-terminal fragment of S2 has been determined, revealing that S4 is a TPR array that envelops an extended S2 peptide. A conserved patch on the surface of S4 is required to recruit S2/4 to centromeres and build pericentromeric cohesion, demonstrating the role of S4 in determining cohes localization. The findings establish a molecular basis for S2/4 recruitment to centromeres and show that S4 targets cohes loading to specific genomic loci, separable from its role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion across the genome. Cohesin, a ring-shaped protein, wraps around sister chromatids and is the molecular agent of sister chromatid cohesion, which persists from DNA replication until anaphase. A distinct complex containing S2 and S4 initiates cohesin linkage with DNA. The structure of S4 bound to a minimal fragment of S2 has been used to derive separation of function alleles that uncouple cohes loading from cohes targeting centrom. Experiments demonstrate cohes targeting in yeast depends on S4, consistent with genetic evidence for an S4-dependent cohes localization pathway. Perturbation of the conserved patch eliminates centrom localization of S2 in mitotic cells and reduces association of cohes subunit with centrom and pericentere, but not chromosome arms. S2 localization is observed in cells progressing through S phase, the stage at which cohes loading is initiated. The pathway targets cohes to centrom requires S4 residues that are in some cases invariant across eukaryotes, suggesting the S4-dependent cohes targeting is a general feature of control of cohes loading, consistent with previous reports.
Being born late in the active season has significant implications for growth, fattening, torpor use, winter survival, and fecundity in hibernators. A study on garden dormice (Eliomys quercinus) investigated differences in growth, fattening, energetic responses, winter survival, and fecundity between early-born (EB) and late-born (LB) juveniles. LB juveniles grew and gained mass twice as fast as EB individuals. Torpor use was low during intensive growth but increased during pre-hibernation fattening. LB juveniles showed higher torpor use, reached similar body sizes, but lower fat content than EB individuals before hibernation. LB individuals showed similar hibernation patterns but a higher proportion of breeders during the following year than EB dormice. The results suggest torpor is incompatible with growth but promotes fattening and consolidates pre-hibern fat deposits. In garden dormice, being late in the reproductive season is associated with a fast life history. The study hypothesized that LB dormice grow and fatten at higher rates due to higher torpor use and reach similar pre-hibern levels of body size but lower body content, leading to differences in hibern patterns and mass overwinter compared to EB. Food availability affected the rate of growth, pre-hibern fattening, tor use of energy, body size, and fat prior hibern, overwinter hibern patterns, and subsequent fecundity in juvenile dormice. The pre-hibern fat reserves of LB were sufficient to fuel their shorter winter duration due to a five-week delay of hibern start. Extensive torpor seemed incompatible with structural growth but supports pre-h fattening and preservation of reserves prior hibern, especially for EB that reached higher fat levels prior to hibern. LB delayed onset of hibern by 5 weeks. LB dormice grow twice as fast as EB, reaching lower fat prior hibern, using short torpor to minimize energetic challenges during certain parts of the day.
Researchers have investigated the role of ADAR enzymes in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, specifically the only A-to-I editing enzyme ADR-2, to understand its impact on neural function and behavior. ADAR enzymes alter gene expression by catalyzing adenosine to inosine RNA editing and binding to regulatory elements in target RNAs, and their loss affects neuronal function in all studied animals. C elegans lacking ADAR exhibit reduced chemotaxis, but the responsible targets for this phenotype remain unknown. An unbiased assessment of ADR2 effects on the neural transcriptome identified 736 A-to-I editing events across the neural transcriptome using publicly available software SOR. Intersecting the neural editome with adr2 associated gene changes revealed an edited mRNA, cle-41, whose expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring cle-41 expression in adr2 deficient neural cells rescued the chemaxis defect, providing evidence that neuronal phenotypes of AD mutants can be caused by altered gene expression. The study indicates aberrant behavioral phenotypes caused by lack of C elegans adr2 are a result of altered gene expression rather than recoding events. This is the first study to link a phenotype associated with loss of C elegans AD enzymes to editing-dependent regulation of a specific gene. Combining neural cell isolation with RNA sequencing and editing site detection with SOR identified over 730 A-to editing sites in the C eleg neural transcriptome, including 104 edited genes. Previous studies have shown worms lacking adr2 exhibit defects in chemotaxis, yet the underlying mechanism has yet to be determined. The neuralome identified was queried for genes involved in chemotaxis or locomotion to elucidate ADR target mRNAs important for neural function. The study provides the first analysis of tissue-specific role of ADR2 in A-to editing and regulating gene expression in C elegans and suggests changes may not observed in whole worm analysis. Restoring cle41 expression in adr2 deficient cells rescued chemotaxis defect, providing first evidence that neuronal phenotypes of AD mutants can be caused by altered gene expression.
Influenza A virus (IAV) employs a strategy known as host shutoff to repress cellular mRNA translation while allowing the efficient translation of viral mRNAs. To explore the mechanisms utilized by IAV to induce host shutoff, RNA sequencing and ribosome profiling were used. The results show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated and the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover of the mRNA pool. Measurements reveal strong variability in the levels of cellular reduction, with short transcripts being less affected by IAV. mRNAs refractory to IAV infection are enriched in maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. The analysis indicates that viral translation efficiencies fall within the range of host translation, suggesting that direct co-opting of translation machinery does not play a dominant role in cellular shutoff. Instead, host shutoff stems from viral dominance of the mRNA pool. At 8 hours post-infection, viral mRNAs take over 53% of translation activity and 57.3% of mRNAs in cells are viral. The reduction in cellular expression is the main cause of host shutoff during infection. Various mechanisms contribute to observed shutoff, including cap-snatching cellular pre-mRNAs, inhibition of pre-mRN polyadenylation, and PA-X endonuclease activity. The findings concur that NS1 is required for shutoff of host protein production and PA-Xonuclease plays a dominant role in host shutoff during IAV infection. The results advance understanding of IAV-induced shutoff, suggesting a mechanism that facilitates translation of genes with housekeeping functions. Viruses utilize host shutoff to eliminate competition from cellular transcripts, achieved by co-opting translation machinery or takeover of mRNA pool. The study demonstrates that IAV takeover of mRNA pool is the primary mechanism for host shutoff, allowing efficient translation of viral mAs while repressing cellular translation.
Gradients of signaling proteins are essential for inducing tissue morphogenesis, but the mechanisms of gradient formation remain poorly understood. Researchers characterized the distribution of fluorescently-tagged signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, expressed at physiological levels from genomic knock-in alleles in Drosophila, and found that FGF produced in the larval wing imaginal disc moves to the air-sac-primordium through FGFR-containing cytonemes that extend from the air-sac-primium to contact the wing disc. The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes extended by air-sac-primium cells decreases gradually with increasing distance from the source, generating a recipient-specific FGF gradient. Acting as a morphogen in the air-sac-primium, FGF activates concentration-dependent gene expression, inducing pointed1 at higher and cut at lower levels. The transcription-factors Pointed1 and Cut antagonize each other and differentially regulate formation of FGFR-containing cyton, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of F-receiving cyton. This study aimed to address how cyton-mediated cell-cell communication creates long-range signals to regulate tissue morphogenesis by characterizing the gradient formation of Drosila F family protein, Branchless. In Drosila, Branchless is the primary signal guiding branching morphogenesis of tracheal epithelial tubes and is traditionally thought to function as a diffusible signal forming a gradient by passive extracellular dispersion. However, findings showed that cyton-dependent signaling provides precision and adaptability in shaping long-range positional gradients and tissue architectures in space and time. The shape of the Branchless gradient dynamically adapts to diverse morphologies through feedback regulation of cyton-mediated transport. In the Drosila larval air-sac-primium, the wing-disc source is spatially separated from the recipient epithelium, and the number of F-receiving cyton extended by air-sac-prim cells decreases with increasing distance from the source. The transcription factors Pointed1 and Cut regulate the formation of FG-containing cyton as a function of the levels of signal received, self-generating gradients adopting recipient-specific shapes. These results reveal a mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific contours through feedback regulation of cyton-mediated dispersion, providing a new understanding of how local cell-cell communication creates long-range signals to regulate tissue morphogenesis.
α-Helical coiled coils are a well-understood protein fold, with a backbone that can be described by parametric equations, allowing for manipulation in detail. However, the insertion of two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel trimer coiled coil leads to the formation of a new type of fiber. These insertions strain the supercoil, causing the formation of short β-strands, which move the path of the chain by 120° around the trimer axis, resulting in an α/β coiled coil retaining one hydrogen bond per unit from the parent coiled coil. α-Helical coiled coils are found in various structural and functional contexts and were the first protein described in atomic detail, with a backbone computable by parametric equations, placing them at the forefront of protein design efforts. Insertions of 2 and 6 residues cause strain on α-helical geometry, breaking α-helices to form short β-strands, which associate into a triangular supersecondary structure, the β-layer. Removing α-hical residues results in a minimalistic α/β coiled coil built of hexads with three residues in β and three in α region of Ramachran plot. β-Layers are found in natural coiled coils, forming fibers with alternating α and β-structure, a previously undescribed protein fold. The α/β coiled coil is a new class of protein fiber based on a novel supersecondary element with alternating α and β-layers. The first β-layer is part of a 6-residue element, occurring after a position of the preceding heptad, biased towards c position, yielding same g position as T6 and T96. The α/β coiled coil retains only one hydrogen bond per unit from parent coiled coil, showing a novel backbone possible within Ramachran space with minor mutations to a known fold.
Epsin is an evolutionarily conserved endocytic clathrin adaptor whose critical function in clath coat dynamics remains elusive. To elucidate its function, researchers generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional eps triple knockout mice, which displayed a dramatic cell division defect and robust impairment in clath-mediated endocytosis with accumulation of early and U-shaped pits. This correlated with perturbation of coupling between clath coat and actin cytoskeleton, confirmed in cell-free endocytosis assay. Results indicate a key conserved function of eps is generating force for invagination and fission of clath-coated pits, in addition to roles including low affinity interaction with SNAREs. Other endocytic proteins, including clath, have been implicated in organization of mitotic scaffolds. Complete absence of three epsins impacted clath-mediated endytosis. RNAi-mediated knockdown in fibroblastic cells reported global impairment of clath-mediated endytosis due to fission defect. Study aimed to provide conclusive evidence of eps function and sites in endocytosis using gene strategy eliminating all epsins. Eps reported roles in clath-independent endocytosis linked to actin regulation, with weak interaction of ENTH domain with synaptobrevin2/VAMP2. Intracellular vesicles need SNAREs to fuse with target membranes, requiring coupling between vesicle budding and SNARE incorporation. Study suggests eps critical at clath coat maturation stages with accumulation of shallow U-shaped pits in eps TKO cells. Critical function at transition between shallow and invaginated pits. Eps couples endocytic clath coat to actin with Hip1, helping invaginate pit. Impairment of eps stalls actin-dependent invagination of endocytic clath-coated pits.
A case-control study was conducted in urban Uganda to investigate risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren aged 5-17 years. The study included 555 cases and 111 controls, with asthma diagnosed by clinicians. The main risk factors for asthma were found to be tertiary education of fathers and mothers, with adjusted odds ratios of 2.32 and 1.85, respectively. Area of residence at birth also played a significant role, with children born in small towns or cities having increased risk of asthma compared to those born in rural areas, with odds ratios of 2.16 and 2.79, respectively. Additionally, a history of asthma in fathers and mothers, children's own allergic conditions, atopy, and cooking with gas/electricity were also risk factors. Asthma was associated with a strong rural-city gradient, higher socio-economic status, and urbanicity. The risk of asthma was predicted by area of residence in early life, particularly at birth, with the highest risk among children whose early life spent in small towns and cities. This risk increased with other factors such as parental history of allergic disease, children's atopy, higher socio-economic status, and urbanicity. Participants had a mean age of 11 years, with children with asthma being slightly older and more likely to have parents with tertiary education and a history of asthma. Compared to children born in rural Uganda, those born in towns or cities had increased risk of asthma with adjusted odds of 2.16 and 2.79. Rapid urbanization in Africa and low and middle-income countries is likely to increase asthma prevalence. The study provides a basis for investigating environmental and lifestyle factors increasing asthma risk in urban areas. Even without parental history of allergic disease, being born in town or city increased risk of asthma with odds 2.15 and 3.33. Parental history of disease increased risk from 2.78 in rural to 5.16 in towns.
Interactions between three pigment cell types are required to form the stripe pattern in adult zebrafish, but the molecular nature of these interactions is poorly understood. Mutations in the leopard gene, encoding Connexin 41.8, a gap junction subunit, cause a phenotypic series of spotted patterns. A dominant allele, leot3, leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. In a genetic screen, this component was identified as Cx39.4. Loss-of-function alleles demonstrate that Cx39.4 is required for stripe formation in zebish, however, the fins are almost not affected. Double mutants and chimeras show that leopard and Cx39.4 are only required in xanthophores and melanoph, but not iridoph, suggesting both connexins form heteromeric gap junctions. The phenotypes indicate these promote homotyp interactions between melanoph and xanth, and instruct patterning of iridoph. 

Fish homozygous for leot3 show an identical phenotype of completely dissolved pattern, individual melanoph that hardly cluster together are present mostly associated with iridoph. A cartoon of Connin41.8 depicts positions of the mutations, gap junctions composed of two hemi-channels in adjacent cells, each hemi-channel made of six connin subunits, can be identical or different. A hetereric/heteric gap junction is schematically shown, alignment amino acid sequence from zebish C41.8 with human orthologue GJA5, transmem regions shaded, newly identified mutations in Connin41.8 highlighted. The leot3 phenotype is stronger indicating mutant C41.8 has a negative effect some component involved in pigment formation, possibly another connin in hetereric junctions with C41.8. 

Wild zebish show a pattern of dark and light stripes, at higher magnification melanoph in dark regions and xanth in light regions discernible. Mutants homozy for le1 and heter for le3 stripes dissolved into spots, clusters of melanoph visible. Expansion of iridoph is indirect possibly caused by xanth covering irid. Data suggest C41.8 and C39.4 interact to form hetereric gap junctions responsible for interactions among chromatoph while pattern is established. These channels are essential for color pattern formation in zebrafish.
Insects detect volatile molecules using olfactory receptors (OR) or ionotropic receptors (IR) and in some cases gustatory receptors (GR), with IRs expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia, while ORs are hypothesized to be an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle. The olfactory system of the primary wingless bristletail Lepismilis yata, the firebrat Thermobia domestica, and the neoptan leaf Phyllium sifium was investigated, revealing OR and olfactory coreceptor Orco are likely lacking in Lepismilis, three Orco candidates in Thermobia, and a fully developed OR/Orco system in Phyll. This suggests ORs did not arise as an adaptation to terrestrial lifestyle but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco present before ORs. Data on insect olfactory receptors are based on neopteran insects, while the identity of receptors in evolutionarily ancient apterygote and paleopter insects is unknown. The evolution of coreceptor Orco occurred after bristails split from the common ancestor with remaining insects, and an olfactory system relying on ORs and Orco evolved after wing emergence. Insect olfactory function as heteromultimers composed of at least one ligand-specific OR and coreceptor Orco. Insects provide an opportunity to study ancestral characteristics and building blocks of olfaction, with selected species at crucial positions of the phylogenetic tree having a functional olfactory system adapted to terrestrial conditions. This collection provides a model to study the early evolution of the olfactory system, addressing which receptors are involved in odor detection in basal insects. Neopter insects recognize most volatile stimuli by ORs, multitransmembrane proteins unrelated to nematode vertebrate olfactory, displaying distinct topology.
The global burden of malaria has decreased over the last decade, and many nations are attempting elimination, but asymptomatic infections pose a major hurdle for these efforts. Mass drug administration (MDA) is a potential solution, with success depending on adequate population participation. A study in Myanmar analyzed malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections in four villages undergoing MDA, finding that individuals from neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had 2.85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-MDA compared to those from high adherence neighborhoods, regardless of individual participation, suggesting a herd effect. High mosquito biting rates, living with someone with malaria, or having asymptomatic infection were also predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA, even in villages with high participation, may frustrate elimination efforts. The aim of antimalarial MDA is to interrupt transmission, and the notion of a herd providing additional population protection is plausible but has not been empirically examined. Drawing from micro-epidemiological and spatial data from an MDA trial in Kayin, Myanmar, the study describes geographic and epidemiological patterns of clinical and subclinical P. falcum malaria in villages undergoing MDA, investigating associations between individual and group participation, subclinical infections, and episodes post-MDA. The primary objective was to look for potential herd effect and impact of nonadherence to MDA for P. fum malaria, finding an apparent group effect from M adherence, suggesting protection from decreased clinical episodes among groups for longer than prophylactic effect of administered antimalials. The study site consisted of four villages along the Myanmar-Thailand border in Kayin State, selected based on P fum malaria prevalence using ultrasensitive quantitative PCR and part of MDA pilot. Episodes after MDA corresponded to increase village HBR, documenting herd effect by MDA for P fum malaria.
The conservation of transcription factor binding specificities across 600 million years of bilateria evolution has been investigated, revealing a striking level of conservation between Drosophila and mammals. The binding specificities of 242 Drosophila transcription factors were determined and compared to human and mouse data, showing that transcription factor binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosila and mammals. For orthologous transcription factors, the similarity extends to the level of subtle dinucleotide binding preferences, indicating that transcription factor specificities are not subject to substantial evolutionary drift. Fruit flies have almost as complex a repertoire of transcription factor binding motifs as humans, with conservation extending to secondary modes of binding and subtle dinucleotide preferences. The evolution of transcription factor specificities contributes to the emergence of novel types of differentiated cells, as human transcription factors with divergent functions are found in cell types not present in flies. High-throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment was used to determine transcription factor specificities in Drosila melanogaster, providing 122 novel high-resolution motifs and shedding light on new features of Drosila DNA-binding characteristics. Transcription factors belonging to the same structural family generally bind similar sites, with ortholog transcription factors having identical core binding profiles, flanking sequences, and secondary modes of binding despite diverging over 600 million years ago. Divergence and drift in transcription factor DNA binding contribute to animal diversity, with subtle DNA preferences potentially changing faster and independently of the core recognition motif, allowing specificity to slowly drift in evolution. Transcription factors with divergent functions are found in cell types not present in flies, indicating that evolution of transcription factor specificities contributes to emergence of novel cell types, with some transcription factors having multiple roles, such as bZIP and HOX proteins and nuclear receptors.
Researchers have developed a novel strategy for simultaneously differentiating human-induced pluripotent stem cells into both mesoderm-derived cardiac and endoderm-derived lung epithelial lineages, allowing for the study of cardio-pulmonary interaction during human embryogenesis. This was achieved through temporal tuning of WNT and nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors, resulting in the formation of concentric cardio-pulmonary microtissues in 3D suspension culture. Upon withdrawal of WNT agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary components segregated with concurrent initiation of cardiac contraction. This multilineage differentiation model offers an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue formation during embryogenesis. In 3D suspension culture, cardio-pulmonary microtissues effectively segregated into separate cardiac and pulmonary tissues, which was partially inhibited by WNT activation, providing an in vitro model for studying mechanistic interplay between developing heart and lung. Following WNT agonist withdrawal, concentric cardio-pulmonary microtissues reorganized into cardiac-only and pulmonary-only tissues, offering a human-induced pluripotent stem cell-based model for cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue segregation. Using small molecule cocktails modulating WNT, nodal, and TGFβ signaling, researchers engineered pulmonary-centered cardio-pulmonary microtissues with accompanying cardiac lineage promoting alveolar maturation. Co-induction of meserm and enderm drove simultaneous cardiac and pulmonary specification from respective germ-layer progenitors. Transitioning co-induced progenitors to 3D culture expedited alveolar maturation within 3 days, supported by the cardiac lineage. Further investigation is required for morphological and functional maturation of both lineages and crosstalk. This work provides a model for investigating molecular and cellular mechanisms of human cardio-pulmonary co-development and boundary formation.
Researchers have demonstrated that Escherichia coli exhibits an unexpected flexibility in cellular mutation rates in response to changes in selective pressure, allowing the organism to adapt to stressful environments. While most changes in an organism's DNA negatively impact fitness, specific mutations enable adaptation, and the mutation rate is strictly regulated and often considered a slowly-evolving parameter. However, the study shows that hypermutation independently evolves when different Esichia coli cultures adapt to high ethanol stress, with hypermutator states being transitory and repeatedly alternating with decreases in mutation rates. Population mutation rates rise when cells experience higher stress and decline once cells are adapted. Cellular mortality is identified as the major driving force behind the quick evolution of mutation rates. 

The study aimed to understand the dynamics of hypermutation under near-lethal complex stress using E. coli exposed to high ethanol as a model, where multiple mutations epistatically interact and diverse evolutionary trajectories lead to adaptation. Surprisingly, in addition to the increase in mutation rate, hypermutator states are transitory and mutation rates decrease once cells are adapted to the environment. Current knowledge of mechanisms underlying changes in mutation remains largely fragmentary, but the study identified cellular mortality as a major modulator of population rate. Experimental evolution revealed an essential role for hypermutation for de novo adaptation to high stress, using a collection of mutators with distinct rates to identify optimal mutation for rapid growth under ethanol stress.

The findings shed light on the dynamics of mutation rate evolution, explaining why maintaining high rates is limited in time and how organisms balance robustness and evolvability, contributing to the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings such as emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapses upon chemotherapy. Bacteria undergoing antibiotic treatment and cells exposed to chemotherapy are prime examples of cells under stressful conditions where hypermutation quickly and recurrently arises with increases in stress, declining once cells are adapted. Overall, the study demonstrates that mutation rates are not fixed and can change rapidly in response to selective pressure to avoid extinction under near-lethal stress.
Metabolic adjustment to changing environmental conditions, particularly balancing growth and defense responses, is crucial for organisms to survive. The evolutionary conserved AMPK/Snf/SnRK kinases are well-known metabolic regulators of the low-energy response in animals and plants, acting by modulating key metabolic enzymes and transcriptional reprogramming. Researchers identified Arabidopsis transcription factor bZIP63 as a key regulator of the starvation response and direct target of SnRK kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP by SnRK changed its dimer preference, affecting target expression and primary metabolism. A bzip knock-out mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, complemented by wild type bZIP but not by a version with point mutations in SnRK target sites. SnRK kinase AKIN10 is responsible for starvation-induced hyperphosphorylation of bZIP, presenting the first transcription factor acting as a direct target of SnRK in transcriptional energy response. bZIP phosphorylation at SnRK sites is crucial for function, underlined by complementation of bzip mutant with genomic bZIP constructs, with wild type but not S29/S294/S300 mutant complementing metabolic and senescence phenotypes. bZIP is a metabolic regulator under stress conditions, phosphorylated at multiple sites in sugar and energy-dependent manner. SnRK targets conserved serine residues in N and C-terminus of bZIP. Phosphorylation of sites is crucial for b63 dimer and activity, proposing a model for phosphorylation-triggered switch of bZIP dimer partners regulating metabolic reprogramming.
Researchers have identified Ring finger protein 10 (RNF10) as a novel synaptonuclear messenger that enables bidirectional communication between synapses and nuclei, facilitating the transfer of information encoded macromolecules. R10 is activated by calcium signals in the postsynaptic compartment, leading to discrete changes at the transcriptional level, and is enriched at excitatory synapses where it associates with the GluN2 subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMD) receptors. Activation of synaptic Glu2-containing NMDs and induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) leads to the translocation of R10 from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus through import-dependent long-distance transport from synap-dendritic compartments. R10 dissociates from the NMD complex in an activity-dependent manner, sharing the Glu2 binding region with CaM, and contains sequences for downstream signaling and scaffolding molecules. Silencing R10 prevents maintenance of LTP and LTP-dependent modifications of dendritic spines, indicating impaired R10-mediated synapuclear signaling reduces dendritic density. The NMD complex is a rich source of messengers capable of trafficking to the nucleus, with R10 encoding and transducing synaptic and extrasynaptic Gl2 NAR signals to the nucleus, docking an NMD-receptor-derived signalosome to nuclear sites in a stimulus-dependent manner. Activation of synaptic but not extrasynaptic NMDs leads to increased R10 nuclear localization, describing a novel synapse-nucleus pathway linking synaptic Glu2-containing NAR to nuclear expression. R10 is highly expressed in the nucleus and synapses, part of the NMD complex, directly interacting with the cytoplasmic tail of the Glu2 subunit of NARs.
The study investigates the structural basis for recognition and remodeling of the TBP:DNA:NC complex by Mot1, a single-unit remodeler that dissociates TATA-binding protein (TBP):DNA complexes, offering insights into the mechanisms of Swi2/Snf ATPases. The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1 in complex with TBP, DNA, and transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 (NC2) reveals that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC interactions and unbends DNA compared to the TBP:DNA:NC state, suggesting Mot primes TBP:NC displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data show the Sw2/Snf domain of Mot1 associates with upstream DNA and histone of NC, similar to nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a framework for how Swi/Snf ATPase interacts with its DNA:protein complex. Swi/Snf-type ATPases regulate chromatin structure and epigenetic state during transcription, DNA replication, and repair, and Mot1 serves as a model for structural and mechanistic studies. Binding of Mot1 leads to conformational changes between substrate proteins and DNA, priming the complex for ATP-dependent disruption. The interface between Mot1 and NC helps separate NC's main TBP helix from TBP and DNA. The study presents a pseudoatomic structure of Swi/Snf enzyme Mot bound to protein:DNA and a framework for interaction with TBP:DNA:NC. Swi/Snf enzymes remodel protein:DNA by disrupting the interface between nucleic and protein partners. The crystal structure of MotNT in complex with TBP, NC, and TATA DNA at 3.8 resolution, along with biochemical and cross-link studies of full-length Mot, provides the first pseudo view of Swi/Snf ATPase in DNA:protein complex. Association of Mot with TBP:DNA:NC results in conformation changes that may have implications for ATP-dependent dissociation. Mot1 hydrolysis-dependent translocation of Swi/Snf ATPase provides chemical force, but binding of the remodeler induces conformation changes in the target. Overall, the study provides insights into the structural basis for recognition and remodeling of TBP:DNA complex by Mot1.
Researchers have designed synthetic variants of the natural product ternatin, a cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic compound, and found them to be up to 500 times more potent than the original compound in killing cancer cells. Using a photo-affinity probe, they identified the translation elongation factor-1 ternary complex as the specific target of ternatin and demonstrated competitive binding with the unrelated products didemnin and cytotin. Mutations in the domain of elongation factor-1 prevent ternatin binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects, indicating the hydrophobic surface as a functional spot for elongation factor modulation. Ternatin and its variants inhibit protein synthesis with potencies that correlate with their ability to block cell proliferation. Photo-ternatin identified elongation factor-1 as a plausible target and crosslinked to purified elongation factor-1 in the context of its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacylated tRNA. The binding of small molecules to the elongation factor ternary complex has not been previously reported. The study aimed to identify the target of the cytotoxic product ternatin, characterized as a potent adipogenesis inhibitor, and found compounds 3 and 4 to be up to 500 times more potent than ternatin. Ternins may be attractive leads for medicinal chemistry due to their structural simplicity and accessibility. The elongation factor-1 ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA is a common target for evolution of cytotoxic products, including ternatin, didem, and cytot. The mechanism by which binding blocks translation is unknown but may be analogous to the antibiotic kirromycin, suggested by genetic dominance of tern sensitivity. The discovery of two structurally unrelated products competing for elongation factor ternary complex binding is unexpected and awaits further biochemical and structural studies. Elongation factor-1 and its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA are targets for the evolution of cytotoxic products.
Mutations in the inositol 5-phosphatase OCRL cause Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease, and although OCRL, a direct clathrin interactor, is recruited to late-stage clathrin-coated pits, clinical manifestations have primarily been attributed to intracellular sorting defects. Research has shown that OCRL loss in Lowe patient fibroblasts impacts clath-mediated endocytosis and results in an endocytic defect, with cells exhibiting accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clath-coated pits, which may result from sequestration of coat components on uncoated vesicles. Endytic vesicles fail to lose their coat and the majority of the actin comets present in patient cells, with SN9, an adaptor that couples late-stage endocytic pits to actin polymerization, binding directly to OCRL and remaining associated with such vesicles. The absence of OCRL in patient cells impairs endocytic clath coat dynamics and results in an endocytic defect, with cells accumulating clath-coated vesicles that fail to loose their coat. The lack of 5-phosphatase activity of OCRL delays endocytosis, stalling late pits, impairs uncoating, and triggers nucleation of comets from clathrin vesicles that retain PI(4,5)P2 and fail to uncoat. OCRL participates in uncoating and facilitates recycling of endocytic factors, a process required for normal progression of endytosis. Defects in clath-mediated endytosis have not been reported in Lowe syndrome fibroblasts, but analysis of clath-coated dynamics in patient and control cells by time-lapse microscopy revealed numerous actin comets driven by clath-positive vesicles, supporting a close relationship between endytic clath coats and actin. The presence of actin comets in Lowe syndrome cells is driven by clath-positive vesicles, suggesting a link between endytic clath coats and actin. Overall, the findings indicate that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor, and defects in clath-mediated endytosis likely contribute to pathology in patients with OCRL mutations.
Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-caten signaling plays a crucial role in colorectal cancer, but identifying effective Wnt inhibitors for cancer treatment remains a challenge. Researchers have discovered a novel FAK/PYK/GSKβ/Y216/β-caten regulation axis where FAK and PYK, elevated in adenomas in APCmin mice and human colorectal tissues, function redundantly promote the Wnt/β-caten pathway by phosphorylating GSKβ216, leading to β-caten accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis. Phosphorylation of GSKβ216 is a determinant of GSK recruitment of β-TrCP, and Wnt-induced β-caten accumulation requires Wnt-induced GSK/β-TrCP interaction. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/P2 suppressed adenoma formation in APCmin mice, accompanied by reduced intestinal levels of phospho-GSKβ216 and β-caten, indicating the FAK/PYK/GSKβ216 axis is critical for Wnt/β-caten activation in APC-driven tumenesis. The intestinal level of phospho-GSKβ216 is higher in APCmin mice than control mice, and PF-562 treatment suppressed GSKβ216 phosphorylation and GSKβ ubiquination, supporting that FAK/PYK contributes to APC-driven tumenesis by phosphorylating GSKβ216 to promote W/β-caten signaling. Loss of functional APC induces FAK and PY2 expression, and FAK/PYK phosphorylates GSK216 to stabilize β-caten, initiating and supporting tumenesis. Phosphorylation of GSK216 was discovered two decades ago, but the mechanisms remain unclear. Dual FAK/PYK inhibitor PF-271 showed anti-tumorigenic effects in APCmin mice, a model predisposed to intestinal adenoma formation due to aberrant Wnt/β-caten activation. FAK and PY2 redundantly regulate W/β-caten signaling in CRC by phosphorylating GSKα/β279/Y216, raising the possibility they also function redundantly in W-driven tumenesis. Loss of functional APC results in less efficient GSK-mediated phosphorylation of β-caten, leading to reduced β-caten degradation, mimicking Wnt stimulation. APC mutation activates W signaling constitutively, but histological studies show only 50% colon cells display nuclear β-caten staining. Intestine-specific deletion of F alone caused abrogation of adenoma formation in APC-mut mice. The study reveals a novel FAK/PYK/GSKβ216/β-caten regulatory circuit in tumenesis and indicates FAK/PYK/GSK216 axis is critical for W/β-caten activation in APC-driven tumenesis.
Researchers investigated the neural control of transitions between posture and movement, focusing on the regulation of vestibular stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. The study tested the continuity of vestibular control during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two postures in healthy subjects exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli. Time-frequency analyses of the relationship between stimuli and ground forces revealed discontinuities corresponding to null periods preceding movement initiation and termination, indicating humans interrupt vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states. The vestibular system encodes head motion in space and is vital for maintaining stability during standing and locomotion, influencing muscle activation in posture control. To transition between motor states, balance responses are disrupted, and prior to transitions, vestibular influence on whole-body responses is suspended, starting while subjects maintain upright stance before transition. The suppression of vestibular balance mechanisms is not specific to one type of transition, suggesting a general process during standing and motor state transitions. Results demonstrate humans stop balancing before moving and stop moving before balancing, related to different sensory gains controlling whole-body movements by quiet and locomotor policies. The vestibular control during locomotor or posture-posture transitions can be monitored by quantifying vestibular-evoked responses over the transition. This approach has been used to monitor engagement and disengagement of vestibular control between self and externally driven states of balance. The study supports optimal theory suggesting transitions require disengagement of one motor policy before implementation of another, showing discrete change between control policies. The findings indicate a period of suspension of vestibular-evoked responses related to different sensory gains controlling whole-body by quiet and locomotor policies, with quiet standing having small whole-body accelerations and ground reaction force oscillations within base support limits. An adaptive controller adjusts to these changes, and the vestibular control of balance during transitions can be continuously monitored, providing insight into the neural control of posture and movement. Overall, the study provides evidence for the downregulation of vestibular stabilizing mechanisms to enable transitions between motor states, a fundamental aspect of human motor control.
The transcription factor RpaA is the master regulator of circadian transcription in cyanobacteria, driving genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance, and its deletion has no effect on viability in constant light conditions but renders cells inviable in cycling conditions when light and dark periods alternate. The rpa- strain cannot maintain energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes for utilization of carbohydrate stores at night. Reconstruction of carbon pathways combined with provision of an external carbon source restores energy and viability of the rpa strain in light/dark conditions. The circadian pathway controls and temporally coordinates essential pathways in carbon metabolism to maximize fitness of cells facing periodic energy limitations. Both accumulation and utilization of carbon reserves for energy production during darkness are defective in the rpa strain and correction of these defects restores viability. The circadian output enhances fitness of cyanobacteria through coordination of central metabolism with demands by periodic changes in the environment. Functional circadian mediated by Rpa is required for anticipatory accumulation of carbon during the day and metabolic switching to catabolism at dusk, allowing cells to stimulate energy production and sustain viability during darkness. Exposure to darkness restricts energy availability, creating unique demands in cyanobacteria dependent on sunlight for energy through photosynthesis, and the rpa strain exhibits defects in growth and viability in cyclic but not constant environments. The phosphorylated form of Rpa regulated by the circadian clock is critical for coordination of anabolism and catabism and viability in light/dark cycles. Deletion of rpa prevents glycogen accumulation in light, rendering cells unable to utilize glycogen at dusk, leading to alterations in energy charge and severe reduction in fitness. The cyanobacterial circadian system anticipates periodic dark-induced resource limitation through Rpa activity, temporally coordinating metabolism to prepare cells for demands of darkness.
Transition metals, such as zinc, are essential micronutrients in organisms but toxic in excessive amounts, and heavy-metal transporting P-type ATPases are crucial for homeostasis, conferring detoxification and redistribution of these ions across cellular membranes. The PIB-4-ATPases, a subclass with the broadest cargo scope, lacks structural information, and their topology remains elusive. The structure and functional analysis of an archetypal PIB4-ATPase, sCoT from Sulfitacter sp. NAS-1, reveals the architecture devoid of classical heavy-metal binding domains and provides insights into the mechanism and diversity of heavy-metal transport. The data disclose novel P-type ATPase features, including a dual role in heavy-metal release and an internal ion of invariant histidine. The turnover of PIB-ATPases is potassium independent, contrasting many other P-type ATPases. PIB-ATPases are subdivided into groups based on conserved motifs and selectivity towards transition metal ions, with Cu+ and Zn transporting PIB1 and PIB2 ATPases well characterized, but little known regarding PIB4 proteins, comprising the simplest and shortest within the P-type ATPase superfamily. The PIB4 model sCoT was used to shed light on the structure and mechanism of the PIB4-class, with ATP activity assessed in vitro in lipid-detergent solution using the Baginski assay in the presence of different heavy metals. The metal specificity of PIB4-ATPases remains elusive, with some members having cobalt specificity, others broader or altered ion profiles, transporting ions such as Zn2+, Ni2+, Cu+, and Ca2+. The ability to adapt to environmental changes in heavy-metal levels is paramount for cells, as elements essential for cellular processes yet toxic at elevated concentrations. Transition metal transporting P-type P ATP proteins are critical for cellular homeostasis, providing efflux of copper, zinc, and cobalt from the intracellular milieu. The structure of PIB4-type ATPase reveals topology, an eight-helix domain configuration, and no heavy-metal binding domains, at least in members without extended N-termini. The results open efforts for drug discovery, as PIB4ATPases function as virulence factors in pathogens, and development of tools to manipulate heavy-metal accumulation in plants to prevent or enrichment.
Researchers have identified a chromatin signature associated with mitotically stable monoallelic expression (MAE) in human cells, characterized by the simultaneous presence of active (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3K27me) chromatin marks in the gene body. This signature is present in approximately 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. The detection of the MA signature does not rely on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or clonality, making feasible the analysis of MA in primary samples, including comparisons of normal and diseased tissue. The study found that among widely expressed genes, about 20% have a chromatin pattern for MAE in at least one tissue, and taking genes with tissue-specific expression as a group, estimate between 39% and 48 have the MA pattern. Genes with MA chromatin signature share pronounced features as a group. MA identified in clones is reflected by the chromatin signature in polyclonal samples. The study tested the chromatin signature as a predictor of the MA state by identifying novel genes with MA chromatin pattern and assessing allelic bias in monoclonal cell lines. A large fraction of known bivalent genes (>80%) acquire the MA chromatin signature in at least one of the differentiated cell types. Upon activation, these master genes preferentially resolve into a state with characteristic MA chromatin signature. The results open a new approach to the study of MA, independent of polymorphisms, and suggest MA is linked to cell differentiation.
AAA+ chaperones, such as ClpC, exert ATP-fueled substrate unfolding by threading through a central pore, requiring mechanisms for tight repression and substrate-specific activation. ClpC, with peptidase Clp, forms a bacterial protease essential for virulence and stress, and adaptor MecA activates ClC by targeting substrates and stimulating Clp ATP activity. Cryo-EM structures of ClC without MecA reveal large helical assemblies that associate via head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil middle domains, repressing ClC in its ground state. Binding of MecA converts this resting state to an active planar structure by interacting with coiled-coil middle domains. Loss of ClC repression in mutants causes constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity. Coiled-coil domains control ClC activity by sequestering ClC molecules in an inactive state, extending the role of coiled-coil domains as regulatory devices controlling AAA protein activity. In Clp/Hsp disaggregase, a coiled-coil middle domain forms a repressing belt around the AAA ring, reducing ATP activity. ATP repression is relieved by dissociation and binding to Hsp adaptors, preventing reassociation with the ClB/Hsp ring. Activity control and adaptor action require ATP activity to be repressed in the ground state, achieved by regulatory coiled domains inserted into an AAA module. ClC MDs form intermolecular head-head contacts, docking two layers of ClC molecules in helical conformation, restricting substrate binding and ATP hydrolysis. Mutating key MD residues causes cellular toxicity, suggesting a general mechanism controlling bacterial AAA chaper systems. Severe toxicity of ClC and ClE mutants qualifies AAA chaperones as targets for antimicrobials.
Researchers utilized a Drosophila model to investigate the behavior of adult muscle precursors, a type of stem cell found in fruit flies, to understand how they maintain their undifferentiated quiescent state and are reactivated. Adult muscle precursors send out thin filopodia that contact neighboring muscles and maintain this association throughout dormancy and proliferation, suggesting muscles play a role in reactivation. Genetic analysis indicates muscles send inductive insulin-like peptide 6 signals that activate the insulin pathway in associated adult precursors, leading to Notch activation, which regulates proliferation via dMyc. The study reveals Drosila adult precursors display homing behavior to the muscle niche and the niche-driven insulin-Notch-dyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of adult precursors. Adult precursors emerge during mid-embryogenesis, express progenitor markers, and lie dormant during embryonic and most larval life, but once activated, they proliferate to provide myoblasts for muscle growth and regeneration. dMyc acts as a positive regulator of reactivation, providing evidence that muscle cell proliferation is regulated by the same genes in Drosila and vertebrates. Notch acts downstream of the insulin pathway and dyc functions downstream of Notch. The data suggest muscle behaves as an adult precursor niche and plays a driving role in reactivation in larval life, governed by the muscle-induced insulinNot/dyc cascade. Adult precursors maintain filopodia-based association with muscles throughout dormancy and when they start to proliferate, indicating muscles could play a role in reactivation. Muscle appears to be the source of local inductive insulin signals reactivating adult precursors via non-canonical Notch and its target dyc, inducing proliferation in larval stages. dyc is required for adult precursor reactivation and proliferation, with genetic experiments showing Notch acts downstream of insulin and dyc functions downstream Notch, illustrating the muscle-induced insulin/Not/dyc cascade governing reactivation of dormant adult precursors.
Researchers have identified the sodium leak channel NALCN as a crucial component in controlling the tonic firing and glycolytic sensitivity of substantia nigra pars reticata (SNr) neurons, a major output of the basal ganglia. SN neurons fire spontaneously at high rates, providing tonic inhibition to downstream brain areas, supported by a depolarizing leak current, whose molecular basis was previously poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, the transcriptome of individual mouse SN neurons was analyzed, revealing that SN neurons express NAL, and its absence impairs spontaneous firing. NAL is involved in modulating excitability changes by glycolysis and activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Disruption of NAL could impair basal ganglia circuit function, potentially underlining severe motor deficits in humans with NAL mutations. Whole transcriptome sequencing detected several nonselective cation channels (NS) that could generate the tonic depolar current, with NAL standing out as a prime candidate due to its high expression. SN neurons require NAL for tonic firing, suggesting NAL mutations could contribute to basal ganglia-related disorders, such as excessive muscle tension and dystonia. Hyperactivity of SN is observed in Parkinsonian animals. NAL's high expression and interaction with Unc80, Unc79, and Fam155 genes, known to interact with NAL, supports its role in the depolarizing current. The discovery of NAL's role in SN neurons provides insight into basal ganglia circuit function and potential therapeutic targets for motor disorders.
The discovery of antibiotics from culturable microorganisms has saved millions of lives since the 20th century, but the increasing formation of resistance has rendered these compounds ineffective, while the majority of microbial chemical diversity remains inaccessible for exploration. Conventional methods for culturing recalcitrant bacteria are limited by low throughput. To address this, a droplet-based microscale cultivation system was developed, directly coupled with high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity prior to strain isolation. This system allows for highly parallelized cultivation starting from single cells, resulting in the cultivation of yet-uncultured species and higher bacterial diversity than standard agar cultivation. Strains able to inhibit reporter strains were isolated from the system, with a variety of antimicrobial compounds detected for a potent antibiotic producer. The cultivation strategy was verified by culturing a bacterial community from a soil sample and comparing the outcome to classical plate cultivation. Microfluidic droplets provide genotype-phenotype linkage for secreted products, allowing compounds to stay confined with the cell of origin, and can be stored in bulk for incubation under controlled conditions. A high-throughput screening for antimicrobial products was implemented using bacterial reporter strains in droplets. The combination of strain discovery during cultivation with selection for natural product biosynthesis streamlines efforts towards new structures for antibiotic development. A modular droplet-microfluid platform was devised, mimicking environmental conditions in situ, with miniaturized droplet volume facilitating high-density long-term cultivation of compartmentalized single cells. The approach was made practical by combining cultivation with a screening step to detect droplets containing cells producing antibiotic compounds. Axenic cultures of putative species could not be maintained after isolation, but cells could be used for obtaining high-quality genome information.
Tuberculous meningitis is a disease with high mortality rates linked to excessive inflammation, and while adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids reduce mortality by only 30%, suggesting that inflammatory pathophysiology causes a subset of deaths. Research in Vietnam found that the benefit of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids was most pronounced in patients with a C/T promoter variant in the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTAH) gene, which encodes an enzyme regulating inflammatory eicosanoids. Patients with the LTAH TT genotype had increased expression, consistent with corticosteroids benefiting individuals with hyper-inflammatory responses. However, a study in Indonesia did not find an LTAH TT genotype survival benefit. Using Bayesian analysis of both studies, it was found that LTAH TT genotype confers survival benefit that begins early and continues long-term in both populations. This benefit is nullified in the most severe cases with high mortality. LTAH genotyping together with disease assessment may target glucocortic therapy to patients most likely to benefit from it. The findings support the model that mortality from tuberculous meningitis is due to distinct inflammatory states, and LTA genotype may be a determinant of inflammation and response to adjunctive treatment. Personalized genotype-directed glucortic treatment may be warranted, with the drug given to TT patients. The LTA TT effect may be limited to the least severe patients due to underlying association being overridden by severe disease, a strong correlate of mortality. The beneficial effect of dexamethasone to LTA TT may not have time to come into play in severe patients, or corticoids may no longer be beneficial due to dysregulated inflammation not revealed by standard metrics. The Indonesia cohort presented more severe disease and died earlier, suggesting the beneficial effects of dexamasone for LTA TT were nullified in severe disease. The concept of disease being too severe for outcomes to be influenced by intervention has precedent, suggesting LTA genotyping and disease assessment may guide glucortic therapy to patients most likely to benefit.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism by which growth cones navigate axonal projections in response to guidance cues, specifically how they translate local cues into protrusive forces to decide migratory direction. The study focused on the role of Shootin1, a protein involved in axon guidance, and its interaction with Netrin-1, a molecule known axon guidance cue. Mice lacking Shoot1 exhibited abnormal forebrain commissural axon projections, similar to those seen in Netrin-1 deficient mice, indicating a link between Shoot1 and Netrin-1 in axon guidance. Gradients of Netrin-1 induced polarized Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of Shoot1 within growth cones, increasing interaction between Shoot1 and L1-CAM, promoting F-actin adhesion and force generation for growth cone migration. Spatially regulated Shoot1 phosphorylation within growth cones was necessary for axon turning in response to Netrin-1 gradients. The study defines a mechano-effector for Netrin signaling, demonstrating Shoot1 phosphorylation as a critical readout for Net-1 gradients resulting in directional mechanoresponse for ax guidance. Data showed high levels of Shoot1 expression in developing forebrain commissural axons, with small Netrin-1 concentration differences eliciting polarized Shoot1 phosphorylation within growth cones. Netrin-elicited Shoot1 phosphorylation promoted Shoot1 and L1-CAM interaction, generating traction force for cone motility. Disrupting spatially regulated Shoot1 phosphorylation inhibited axon turning, but not outgrowth, induced by Net-1 gradients. Uncoupling F-act adhesion by Shoot1 inhibited Net-1 induced axon growth and turning on laminin. The study indicates Net-1 induced ax guidance, mediated by Shoot1-L1 interaction, is not limited to growth cones on L1. Polarized Shoot1 phosphorylation within cones, elicited by Net-1 gradients, plays a crucial role in ax guidance, with tracing signals from phosphorylated Shoot1 upstream to DCC leading to better understanding of the gradient-reading mechanism in Net-1 regulated ax guidance. Shoot1 is highly expressed in developing forebrain commiss axons, with knockout mice displaying dysgenesis and misprojection of these axons, highlighting the importance of Shoot1 in Net-1 ax guidance. Overall, the study demonstrates the critical role of Shoot1 in translating Net-1 gradients into directional forces for ax guidance.
Researchers investigated the biophysical origin of the hummingbird's hum by studying six freely hovering Anna's hummingbirds using acoustic nearfield holography with a 217 microphone array and directly measuring 3D aerodynamic forces with a new aerodynamic platform. An idealized acoustic model integrating aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics showed the timbre of the hummingbird's hum arises from oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. Comparing birds and insects, the characteristic timbre and radiated power of flapping wings originates from higher harmonics in aerodynamic forces supporting body weight. Analysis across insects and birds revealed allometric makes larger birds quieter and elongated flies louder, clarifying bioacoustic behavior. The aerodynamic platform measured steady and unsteady components of pressure around the bird up to three times wingbeat frequency, associated with net 3D aerodynamic forces. A new aerodynamic platform directly measured net 3D force generated by freely hovering hummingbirds, integrated into an aeroacoust model predicting sound radiated due to oscillating forces from flapping. In vivo 3D aerodynamic and wing kinematics measurements corroborated spatially and temporally through nearfield holography showed hummingbirds generate highly directional hum, broadband pressure oriented downward, and acoustic directivity dependent on harmonic parity. The model assumes rigid airfoils, neglecting effects like wingtip, feather, and turbulent vortex dynamics. Comparison with acoustic recordings for six hummingbirds corroborated the predictive power of the minimal model, pointing to oscillating aerodynamic forces generating hum. Numerical simulation of Fow Williams Hawkings aeroacoustic equation showed farfield of flapping mosquito wings driven by aerodynamic fluctuation, despite lacking in vivo nearfield measurements.
Researchers investigated the roles of chance, contingency, and necessity in the evolution of ancestral proteins by combining ancestral reconstruction and continuous evolution technology to mutate and select proteins in the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family to acquire protein-protein interaction specificities that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary trajectories from multiple ancestral proteins, they found that contingency generated over historical timescales steadily erased necessity and overwhelmed chance as the primary cause of acquired sequence variation. Trajectories launched from phylogenetically distant proteins yielded virtually no common mutations, even under strong and identical selection pressures. Chance arose because many sets of mutations could alter specificity at any point, while contingency arose because historical substitutions changed these sets. The results suggest that patterns of variation in BCL2 sequences, and likely other proteins, are idiosyncratic products of a particular and unpredictable course of historical events. Present-day BCL2 family proteins and potentially others are physical anecdotes of their unpredictable histories, reflecting accumulated events during descent from common ancestors with necessity imposed by physics, chemistry, and natural selection. Contingency generated by sequence change over phylogenetic times plays a profound role in B2 protein evolution under laboratory selection for new functions. Using human BID and NOXA as fixed partners introduced opportunities for chance and contingency to affect B2 sequence evolution, while differences between the design and biological setting may have overestimated chance's historical role. Additional dimensions of B2 function imposed selective constraints on evolution historically, reducing functionally equivalent genotypes available to chance. The paths through sequence space leading to historical protein-protein interactions changed repeatedly during the B2 history, even when binding profiles did not evolve. For chance to influence adaptive evolution, multiple paths to a phenotype must be accessible with similar probabilities of being taken.
A genome-wide haplotype-based analysis of 48 sub-Saharan African groups reveals the structure of genetic diversity and gene-flow, indicating historical connections between populations due to admixture. The study shows that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 700 years, while Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo groups share ancestry with Central Africans as a result of recent expansions. Most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups outside their current geographic region due to gene-flow within the last 400 years. The analysis provides insight into haplotype sharing across ethno-linguistic groups and the movement of alleles into new environments, relevant to genetic epidemiology studies. Admixture has shaped genetic diversity in sub-Saharan Africa, with evidence of Eurasian ancestry movement into the continent over various timescales. Previous studies have described the influence of Eurasian and hunter-gatherer ancestry on population history, but questions remain on the extent and timing of key events and their impact on contemporary populations. The inferred groups reflect broad geographic patterns, while finer analysis reveals smaller groups and differentiates closely related populations consistent with self-reported ancestry. Gene-flow between populations relates to historical movements of people and within sub-Saharan Africa. Admixture occurs when genetically differentiated ancestral groups mix, a common feature of human populations globally. Genome analyses refine models of the continent's history and its impact on genetic diversity, providing a quantitative measure of coancestry between groups and identifying dominant events shaping current diversity. The study's findings are relevant to studying genotype-phenotype associations in Africa, with implications for understanding the movement of alleles and haplotypes into and within the continent.
Researchers investigated the mechanism of mitotic spindle scaling during Xenopus development, focusing on how the spindle adapts to changing cell dimensions during early embryogenesis. An in vitro system using cytoplasmic extracts from embryos was established to study spindle size differences between stage 3 and stage 8. The kinesin-13 kif2 was identified as a driver of developmental scaling, whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by importin α and activated in stage 8 when importin partitions to a membrane. Altering spindle size in embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. Spindle size in Xenopus development is coupled to cell size through a ratiometric mechanism controlling microtubule destabilization. Reconstituting spindle formation in embryo extracts elucidated a mechanism coordinating spindle size with cell size through differential activation of kif2. Hundreds of spindle-associated proteins were considered, but kif2 was identified as the physiological effector operating to scale the spindle during embryogenesis. Modifying spindle size without perturbing function revealed its role in maintaining orientation in large cells, suggesting physical cell features drive intracellular scaling through biochemical partitioning and redistribution. The mechanism is consistent with changes in meiotic to mitotic morphology during mouse development, where cell size impacts biochemical reactions altering spindle architecture. Import α phosphorylation liberates from membrane stores into cytoplasm, promoting its activity, and correcting nonspecific binding showed k2 retrieves import α from stage 3 extracts more than stage 8, indicating sufficient partitioning alters interaction with k2. Identification of the mechanism enabled testing its significance during development, suggesting changes in gradients and assembly accompany cell size, influencing spindle size. An embryo system assembling spind in cytoplasm extracts at any stage of development was created to address how spindle size is determined during vertebrate embryogenesis, up to the midblast transition when divisions become asynchronous.
Researchers have discovered a riboswitch that forms a natural Boolean logic gate to control purine metabolism in bacteria, where gene systems interpret multiple signals to set expression levels of genes they regulate. The riboswitch is composed of tandem arrangements of ligand-binding aptamers that approximate the function of specific two-input logic gates. Specifically, phosphoribyl pyrophosphate (PR) aptamers exist in single or tandem arrangements with guanine aptamers, allowing them to bind target ligands independently or in combination to regulate transcription of messenger RNAs for de novo purine biosynthesis. The guanine-PR aptam functions as an IMPLY logic gate, where terminator and antiterminator stems are stabilized or destabilized depending on concentrations of guanine and PR. This sophisticated all-RNA regulatory system senses ribonucleotide derivatives to control RNA synthesis, supporting the hypothesis that RNA organisms could manage complex metabolic states without protein factors. The guanine-PR system is the first example of tandem aptamers with different ligand specificities sharing an expression platform, implementing new logic functions. These RNA systems demonstrate complex chemical sensing and regulatory functions, reflecting metabolite monitoring and regulation in ancient RNA organisms. The discovery suggests additional variations of two-input logic gates will be represented by riboswitches yet to be discovered in modern cells. The existence of PR riboswitches supports the idea that RNA organisms used PR to generate biopolymer building blocks, with apters selectively binding biosynthetic precursors persisting as riboswitches in modern cells. The discovery of guanine-PR riboswitch demonstrates how complex molecular devices can be formed from RNA, with in vitro data representing the output of a population of RNA transcripts.
The reliability of synaptic transmission is dictated by the number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential, and variability in this property provides diversity of synaptic function across brain regions. The prevailing view is that release of single or multiple vesicles reflects variability in vesicle release probability, which is supported by calcium dependence of release. However, research using mouse brain slices demonstrates that the number of vesicles released is regulated by the size of the readily-releasable pool, upstream of vesicle release probability. Protein kinase A and its vesicle-associated synapsin dynamically control release site occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles released without altering release probability. Diversity in calcium homeostasis and protein kinase A may contribute to variability in regulation of release across synapses. Multivesicular release is widespread in the rodent CNS and appears to be the dominant mode in human cortex, while some synapses are limited to univesicular release and others switch modes in activity-dependent. The number of vesicles released from an active zone is the product of vesicle release probability and the number available for release. The readily-releasable pool is a functional measure of the number of release-competent vesicles per zone under control of synapsins, constraining the number released. High probability synapses display unives release and low probability synapses exhibit multives, illustrating that probability alone is insufficient to dictate vesicle mode, pointing to the contribution of vesicle availability. Vesicles transition between sequential states from loose to tighter with release machinery followed by calcium-triggered fusion, akin to transitions from replacement to docking sites prior to fusion. Understanding mechanisms that determine active zone supports unives or multives release is important for synaptic diversity and unifying presynaptic function models accounting multiple presyn parameters.
Researchers have reconstituted the selective packaging of HIV-1 RNA in vitro using a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag, and giant unilamellar vesicles, to understand how HIV-1 Gag selects and packages dimer unspliced viral RNA in the context of excess cytosolic human RNAs. The study found that as Gag assembles on the plasma membrane, the HIV-1 genome is enriched relative to cellular RNAs by an unknown mechanism. Mutations in the CA-CT domain of Gag, which affect the self-assembly of Gag, abrogated RNA selectivity, indicating that the ability of HIV-1 Gag to selectively package its genome and self-assembly on membranes are interdependent on one another. The results suggest that viral RNA with high-affinity sites for Gag can recruit G molecules to the membrane if one dissociates from membrane-cluding tRNA. The NC domain of G is necessary but not sufficient for the selective packaging of HIV-1 genomic RNA. The majority of plasma-proximal HIV-1 RNAs are monomeric in the absence of HIV-1 Gag, but in cells expressing Gag, monomeric RNAs coalesce to dimers on the membrane. The study underscores the importance of membrane-localized G assembly in HIV-1 genome selection and packaging. Lattice contacts conferring G ability to multimerize on membrane are crucial for selective packaging viral RNA. The 5' untranslated region is recruited to membranes by multimerized Gag without changes to its secondary structure. The association of G with tRNA inhibits genome-less assembly. Gag assembling on membranes packages HIV-1 5 untranslated region at subnanolar concentrations in presence of competitor RNA. Mutations that affect Gag clustering on membrane abolish RNA selectivity. The findings lead to a model for HIV-1 genome selection where Gag multimerization on membrane is necessary for packaging dimeric viral genomes with high probability. The study provides insight into how cytos G binding mainly cellular RNA assembles into particles packaging dimer viral genomes with 90 probability.
