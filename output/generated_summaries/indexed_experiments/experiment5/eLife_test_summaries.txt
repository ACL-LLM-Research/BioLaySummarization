Researchers investigated the structural organization of electrical synapses, a type of neuronal communication mediated by gap junctions, at single synaptic contacts on zebrafish Mauth cells, where gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release. Expansion microscopy revealed a detailed map of the incidence and spatial distribution of proteins pertaining to various synaptic structures, identifying multiple gap junctions of variable size by the presence of molecular components. Most of the synaptic surface was occupied by interleaving gap junction and adherens junction components, suggesting a close association between these structures, while glutamate receptors were confined to small portions of the contact, indicating most of the area functions as an electrical synapse. The results revealed the organization of an electrical synapse that operates with multiple gap junctions in association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions. The relationship between intercell structures will aid in establishing boundaries of electrical synapses and provide insight into structural and functional diversity of electrical synapses. Electrical synapses are modality of neuronal communication mediated by gap junctions, with less known molecular and structural complexity compared to chemical synapses, which have distinct pre and postsynaptic components. The study used expansion microscopy to expose presence and arrangement of synaptic components in CEs of larval zebish, which share morphological and functional properties with adult fish. The bouton marks anatomical limits a synapse, offering the opportunity to examine anatomical structures making an electrical synapse. Labeling with Cx35 and GluR showed most contact area operates as electrical synapse, with transmission mediated multiple gap junctions containing variable channels. Both chemical and immunological synapses share molecular organization combining cell adhesion molecules restricted to periphery with centrally responsible intercell communication. The findings indicate this arrangement applies to electrical synapse, with gap junctions and adherens components closely associated and glutamate receptors confined to periphery. The study provides insight into organization and diversity of electrical synapses throughout animal connectomes.
The pre-Bötzinger complex, a primary generator of inspiratory breathing rhythm, contains neurons that project to the facial nucleus to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. To understand the identity of these neurons, researchers used optogenetic and viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition affects mystacial activity with minimal effects on breathing. The population of neurons consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved in autonomic activity regulation. Modulation of subgroups of preBötz neurons based on axonal projections is a strategy to understand mechanisms that coordinate breathing with motor behaviors. Abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic and orofacial behaviors have been associated with disease development and progression. The facial projecting preBtz neurons are hypothesized to transmit respiratory rhythm rather than generate it. Selective photoinhibition of preBtz neurons to facial nucleus modulates orofacial behavior with minimal impact on respiratory activity due to collaterals. Utilizing a combinatorial viral transgenic approach, selective transduction and photoinhibition of preB facial premotor neurons affects mystacial pad activity while minimally affecting breathing. Selective photoinhibition has small effects on breathing under ketamine/medetomidine anesthesia and recovery phases. A smaller population of transduced neurons with restricted location was observed. Photoinhibition of preB neurons produces apnea, reduces sympathetic vasomotor activity, respiratory modulation of blood pressure and increases parasympathetic nerve activity. Neurons in preBtz modulate orofacial behaviors.
Recent studies have investigated the role of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) in representing aversive information and signaling a general alarm to the forebrain. CGRP neurons are thought to modulate both passive and active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat, but most research has focused on their role in passive responses. To address this, researchers examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical system capable of regulating defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception and ensuring adaptive responses to varying danger. Optogenetic inhibition of CGRP neurons during robot chasing resulted in less freezing and fleeing compared to the control group, suggesting CGRP amplifies perceived threat, promoting defensive behaviors. Using a naturalistic paradigm, researchers recorded neuronal activity and found CGRP encode threat intensities through variations in firing duration and amplitude. Stimulating CGRP without aversive stimuli generates rapid unconditioned freezing, while activation during fear conditioning amplifies conditioned freezing, demonstrating a primary role in driving passive responses. Under heightened conditions, such as enhanced CGRP activation or faster robot speeds, neurons strengthened active behaviors by amplifying threat. Researchers employed a dynamic ecologically relevant unconditioned stimulus using a predator-like robot, incorporating imminent threat, and found CGRP modulate adaptive behaviors depending on threat severity or type. CGRP activity was recorded in response to aversive stimuli to determine if they encode noxious differentially, and results showed CG neurons encode intensity through firing and amplitude. Overall, findings indicate CGRP neurons play a critical role in regulating defensive behaviors, modulating threat perception, and ensuring adaptive responses to varying danger.
Researchers investigated the relationship between obesity and brain structure using diffusion-weighted MRI data from approximately 30,000 UK Biobank participants, focusing on waist-to-hip ratio and its association with micro-structural metrics isotropic volume fraction and intra-cellular volume. Significant associations were found in two distinct brain systems: prefrontal/temporal/striatal with isotropic volume fraction and medial/temporal/occital/striatal with intraular volume. The isotropic volume system co-located with genes enriched for immune functions, decreased glial density, and high opioid receptor density, while the intraular volume system co-located with genes for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased opioid receptor density. Genetic correlations between waist-hip ratio and isotropic volume and intraular volume were estimated as 0.026 and 0.112, respectively. Correlations between waist-hip ratio maps and inflammatory marker C-reactive protein maps for isotropic and intraular volume were significant. These results suggest a mechanistic model where genetically determined neurite density in the temporal system contributes to obesity, while water content in the prefrontal system reflects a consequence of obesity mediated by immune activation. Anatomical patterns were previously activated by fMRI involving episodic memory and navigation. Maps of isotropic and intra volume were negatively correlated, indicating obesity is associated with distinct changes in water and neurite density. Genome association statistics were used to estimate genetic correlations and test the hypothesis that waist-hip ratio has a tighter correlation with intra volume than isotropic. Neurotransmitter receptor distribution data was used to investigate brain systems where obesity is associated with microstructure. Cortical maps of 37 neurotransmitters were tested for co-location with isotropic and intra volume maps, controlling for multiple comparisons. Obesity differences in isotropic and intra volume were coupled but anatomically, transcriptionally, and neurologically differentiated.
Researchers investigated the role of cancer stem cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human tumors, as previous studies in experimental models showed EMT drives metastatic dissemination, but this was not observed in human tumor specimens. The team identified EpCAM and CD24 as cancer stem cell markers, alongside the mesenchymal marker Viment, to identify EMT cells in oral cancer lines. Analyzing 12,000 imaging fields from 74 oral tumors, they found a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD24, and Viment co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumor body in metastatic specimens. Using an artificial neural network, they predicted metastasis with high accuracy, 87-89% cross-validated. The study observed single disseminating EMT cells in oral cancer specimens, highly predictive of metastatic disease. Staining for EpCAM, CD24, and Viment in tumors stratified on metastatic status identified cells that underwent EMT and disseminated into the stromal region surrounding metastatic primary tumors. An image-based machine learning approach showed the presence of these EMT cells in tumor stroma is predictive of metastasis. The presence of disseminating stem cells strongly correlated with tumor metastasis. Immunofluorescent staining for EMT cells retaining epithelial EpCAM, mesym Viment, and plasticity CD24 identified single EMT cells disseminating into stroma, but epithelial keratins were not retained. Retention of EpCAM alone with Viment was insufficient to mark disseminating EMT correlating with metastasis. Analyzing single cells across thousands of fields enabled observation and quantification of tumor cells disseminating into tissue, identifying single EMT and training an artificial neural network to predict metastasis. Combining EpCAM, Viment, and CD24 aimed to identify tumor cells that underwent EMT and disseminated into surrounding stroma. Viment distinguishes EMT from epithelial tumor cells in immunofluores staining, and combining these markers identified tumor cells that underwent EMT and disseminated, predicting metastasis with high accuracy.
Apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells via efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that drive tissue repair, but the mechanisms by which recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells regulate repair are not fully understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing provides a map of the cellular dynamics during inflammation in mouse wounds, revealing that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including Lyve+ macrophages during inflammation. Human diabetic wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6. During inflammation in mouse wounds, Axl is upregulated in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR-independent mechanisms. Inhibition studies in mice reveal Axl signaling is required for wound repair but dispensable for efferocytosis, while inhibition of Tim4 decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair, highlighting distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic detection coordinates tissue repair and potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients. An atlas of dynamic changes in the inflammatory stage of wound in skin at single-cell level shows apoptotic and eferocytosis pathways upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse and human diabetic wounds. Functional studies show efferosis receptors Axl and Tim4 have differential effects on efferosis and repair. mRNAs encoding efferosis receptors and pathways are upregulated in early skin beds and diabetic wounds with confirmed protein upregulation of efferosis Axl and Tim4 in murine wounds. Efficient efferosis clears apoptotic cells during inflammation with upregulation of mRNAs associated apoptosis and relatively low apoptotic cells in wound beds. mRNA levels of efferosis receptors, ligands, and downstream in scRNA data indicate a role for fibroblasts modulating inflammatory milieu through detection of apoptotic cells. Axl and Mer exhibit differential ligand specificity upon activation while macroage eferosis is defective in diabetic wounds. Transcriptional changes in apoptosis and eferosis signaling in foot wounds analyzed in non-diabetic and diabetic patients show upregulation of eferosis pathway and altered signaling.
Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have provided novel insights into the dynamics of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues, enabling the construction of transcriptomic cell atlases. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and identifying cell types corresponding to gene clusters in single-cell sequencing sets remains a challenge. A genetic barcoding approach called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing (Ta-EM) has been developed, utilizing powerful genetic tools in Drosophila to allow in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. This method involves inserting a DNA barcode upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct, allowing the sequence to be read during single-cell sequencing and labeling a population of interest. By creating multiple independently barcoded fly strains, Ta-EM enables identification of cell types in cell atlas projects, identification of multiplets, and barcoding of experimental points, conditions, and replicates. The Ta-EM barcodes can be read using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale measurements, enabling large-scale behavioral screens and improving the ability to multiplex and annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments. 

Ta-EM provides a means to target and label cells in vivo for detection in single sequencing and can be used to multiplex behavioral or phenotypic measurements, offering a flexible system for barcoding cells and organisms. The genetic barcodes can be quantified from mixtures of barcoded lines using next-generation sequencing. However, a limitation is that Ta-EM barcodes are not observed in all cells in single gene expression data, likely due to the strength of the Gal4 driver contributing to labeling density. Despite this, variable recovery of Ta-EM barcodes driven by the same pan-midut Gal driver has been observed. Overall, Ta-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens and improve single-cell transcriptomic experiments.
Understanding the origins of novel phenotypes is a major goal in evolutionary biology, and poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, taxon sampling for alkaloids has been biased towards colorful species, without attention paid to inconspicuous ones that are assumed to be undefended, resulting in an incomplete understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group. New data shows that species from undefended frog clades have measurable amounts of alkaloids, and undefended dendrobatids consume mites and ants, known sources of alkaloids, suggesting diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. The data supports the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration, passive accumulation, which differs from sequestration as it involves no derived forms of transport and storage yet results in low toxin levels of accumulation. This concept of passive accumulation may play a role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. Incorporating ideas from pharmacokinetics, new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model could explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses and provide insight into molecular processes governing ingested toxins.

Evidence shows undefended poison frogs and related family Bufidae contain amounts of alkaloids and consume toxic arthropod prey, proposing passive accumulation of consumed alkaloids as an ancestral state in Drobatidae, possibly in related taxa, with selection acting on toxin elimination and resistance resulting in toxin accumulation and chemical defense. The terms alkaloid and toxin are used interchangeably, although toxicity of each frog alkaloid is not known. Evidence for passive accumulation as an intermediate stage towards toxin sequestration is scarce but may be common in lineages that evolved sequestration, presenting a novel alkaloid dataset for dendrobat frogs and relatives. Assuming many ants and mites contain alkaloids, most dendids and recent ancestors have been exposed to toxins through diet. Few experiments have quantified the relationship between natural toxin exposure and resistance in poison frogs, given the diversity of alkaloid classes and sources of frog alkaloids. Most studies since the 1990s emphasize diet as primary determinant of defense, although Daly proposed an alkaloid uptake system in the ancestor of Drobatidae expressed in aposematic species.

Passive accumulation is proposed as an ancestral state in Dendrobatidae and possibly related taxa, with selection acting on toxin elimination and resistance resulting in toxin accumulation and chemical defense. New data and ideas from pharmacetics are incorporated into an evolutionary model explaining the origins of acquired chemical defenses, providing insight into molecular processes governing ingested toxins. The study presents a novel alkaloid dataset for dendrobat frogs, although limited, and scarce evidence for passive accumulation as an intermediate towards sequestration exists, it may be common in lineages that evolved sequestration. The diversity of alkaloid classes and sources of frog alkaloids are identified, and few experiments have quantified the relationship between natural toxin exposure and resistance in frogs, emphasizing the need for further research into the origins of chemical defenses in poison frogs and toxin-sequestering organisms.
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) significantly contributes to chemotherapy resistance and remains a challenge in treating advanced breast cancer due to the complexity of EMT and its reversal process, mesenchal-to-epithelial transition (MET). Utilizing a Tri-PMT EMT lineage-tracing model and single-cell RNA sequencing, researchers comprehensively analyzed the EMT status of tumor cells, revealing elevated ribosome biogenesis (Ri) during transitioning phases of EMT and MET. R and subsequent nascent protein synthesis mediated by ERK and mTOR signaling are essential for EMT/MET completion. Inhibiting excessive R genetically or pharmacologically impaired E/MET capability of tumor cells. Combining R inhibition with chemotherapy synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchal tumor under chemotherapies. The study suggests targeting the R pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced cancer. Employing the EMT-lineage-tracing model discovered R was transiently elevated during transitioning phases of EMT program, activation diminished as tumor accomplished changes, lower R activity observed in mesenchal cells than epithelial. Consistent with Tri-PMT, BM21 synergized with CT, leading to lower metastatic LM tumor burden. Analyzing scRNA data primary cells breast cancer, upregulation R pathway at transitioning EMT and MET, transient activation during EMT reported previously. Results suggested upregulated R needed mesench tumor undergo MET outgrowth lungs. R recognized crucial cancer pathogenesis, investigating signaling R upulation E/MET probed activations cells. Importantly unwed R activities EMT MET makes R target overcoming chemoresistance metast. Targeting R RN Pol inhibitor impaired E/MET transitioning tumor cells synergized common chemotherapeutics.
Pearl millet is a highly heat and drought-tolerant cereal crop that serves as a vital food source across the sub-Saharan region, and its early root system features a fast-growing primary root, which is hypothesized to be an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Crop modeling demonstrates that early drought stress is a significant constraint in agrosystems in the Sahel where pearl millet was domesticated, with drought observed in 57% of years, affecting crops during the vegetative stage. Phenotyping a diversity panel of pearl millet inbred lines shows that fast primary root growth after germination may be an adaptive to early stress. Seminal roots are absent in pearl millet, and lateral roots only appear 6 days after germination, suggesting the fast primary root is an adaptation to the Sahelian environment. Correlation analysis reveals a strong relationship between primary root growth and stay-green at the vegetative stage, an indicator of drought tolerance. Field experiments support the hypothesis that rapid primary root growth benefits pearl plants in coping with early drought episodes after germination. Differences in root growth are mainly regulated by changes in cell elongation. Genome-wide association and bulk segregant analysis identified a genomic region controlling this trait, and RNA sequencing and re-annotation identified a glutaredin-encoding gene, PgXC9, as a potential regulator. Functional characterization of its Arabidopsis homolog, AtXY19, reveals a novel role for this glutaredin gene in regulating cell elongation. The study suggests a conserved function for GR genes in conferring root elongation and enhancing resilience in pearl millet to the Sahelian environment.
The human brain processes language in complex and dynamic contexts, integrating multiple sources of information such as speech, faces, and objects, to form coherent representations. Research investigated how words and concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing, focusing on the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts during movie watching. The study found that across contexts, concrete and abstract concepts encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions, but these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. The response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning, while the activation pattern of concrete words resembles abstract processing when the visual context is unrelated. This suggests that concepts generally encode habitual experiences, but the neurological organisation is not fixed and depends on contextual information. 

The brain integrates information across sensory modalities to form conceptual representations, critical for navigating real-world experiences, and findings highlight the role of visual context in modulating neural representation of abstract and concrete words. Similar effects may be observed in contexts engaging other modalities, such as when abstract concepts are situated in related contexts, they engage regions involved in concrete concepts and external information processing. Conversely, when concrete concepts are displaced from context, they engage abstract-like regions related to internal, interoceptive, or affective information. The study found brain activation of concrete and abstract processing fundamentally changes as a function of visual context, indicating that conceptual representations reflect contextual information. Regions corresponding to typical experiences activate across contexts, while displaced concepts engage different regions related to internal or affective information. 

The study tested if response profiles change depending on objects in the viewing context, predicting that abstract concepts in related contexts engage regions involved in concrete concepts and external information, while displaced concrete concepts engage abstract-like regions. Results showed that concrete concepts encode different information in separable brain regions, but these differences reduced in multimodal context. Abstract words become concrete-like when processed in related visual scenes, and concrete words resemble abstract when context is unrelated. The findings suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences, the neurological organisation is dynamic and depends on available information, indicating the importance of context in modulating neural representation of abstract and concrete words.
Researchers have made a significant progress in cancer immunotherapy, but its application is limited due to the scarcity of targetable antigens on the tumor surface of cancer cells. Nonsense-mediated decay, an intrinsic cellular pathway, conceals neoantigens through destruction of RNA products from genes with truncating mutations. A high-throughput screen based on ratiometric analysis of transcripts identified critical mediators of nonsense-mediated decay in human cells, implicating disruption of SMG1's phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor. This led to the design of a novel SM1 inhibitor, KVS1, which elevates expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from truncating mutations in human and murine cells in vitro and in vivo. KVS1 increases the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens class I-associated peptides from nonsense-mediated decay downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells, providing opportunities for studying diseases where nonsense-mediated decay plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases. Inhibition at low concentrations led to equal expression of wild-type and mutant transcripts, suggesting near blockade of the nonsense-mediated decay pathway. Western blot showed KVS1 decreases the amount of phosphorylated UP1, the target of SM1 activity, in different cell lines. Studies with non-specific inhibitors have shown an increase in antigens from tumor-specific mutations when nonsense-mediated decay is inhibited. KVS1 alters the surface presentation of proteins from genes harboring truncating mutations in cancer cells. A previously reported SM1-specific molecule, SM1-11, resulted in increases in transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating mutations, but was insoluble. The development of KVS1 improved biophysical properties, making it soluble and easily administered to mice. A cell-based highput assay queried the effects of small molecules on nonsense-mediated decay function, identifying a lead compound capable of inhibiting it, ascertaining its target as SM1, a critical mediator of nonsense decay.
Age is the most significant risk factor for cancer, but aging rates vary across individuals. A new measure of aging, Phenotypic Age (PhenoAge), was explored in the prediction of site-specific and overall cancer. Using Cox regression models, the association of Phenotypic Acceleration (PhenoAccel) with cancer incidence was examined among 374,463 UK Biobank participants. PhenoAge was generated using chronological age and nine biomarkers, PhenoAcc after subtracting the effect of chronological age by regression, and an incidence-weighted cancer polygenic risk score (CPR) based on 20 site-specific polygenic scores. Compared to biologically younger participants, older individuals had a higher risk of cancer, with hazard ratios of 1.22 in men and 1.26 in women. A joint effect of genetic and PhenoAcc was observed on overall risk, with ratios 2.29 for men and 1.94 for women with high genetic and older Pheno. PhenoAcc was negatively associated with healthy lifestyle factors, beta -1.01 in men and -0.98 in women. Older Pheno was related to increased cancer risk within and across genetic groups, adjusted for chronological age, and aging could be slowed by a healthy lifestyle. 

PhenoAcc was calculated to explore the effect of accelerated aging on cancer, demonstrating a positive association between accelerated aging and increased risk, adjusted for age. Older Pheno was associated with increased incident cancer within each genetic group, with high genetic and older Pheno having the greatest risk. Accelerated aging, measured by PhenoAcc, was related to increased site-specific and overall cancer, adjusted for age and across groups. Stratification by genetic category confirmed older Pheno was associated with higher risk, with 5-year incident rates 5.78 and 4.58 for biologically younger men and women versus 6.90 and 5.17 for older. Results provide a cost-effective indicator for biological age as a novel biomarker for cancer prediction. Associations between age and cancer have been investigated, indicating different measures reflect aspects of aging and could be applied in risk assessment. Studies confirmed associations between PhenoAcc and cancer, suggesting joint application in risk evaluation. The study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China and the Excellent Foundation of Jiangsu Province.
Comprehensive biodiversity data is crucial for ecosystem protection, and the Biome app, launched in Japan, efficiently gathers species observations from the public using species identification and gamification elements, amassing over 6 million observations since 2019. Community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases, but species distribution models estimate species distribution while accommodating such bias. The quality of Biome data and its impact on species distribution model performance was investigated, revealing species identification accuracy exceeding 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but below 90% for plants, molluscs, and fishes. Species distribution models for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan showed incorporating Biome data into traditional data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional data required over 200 records for accurate models, while blending the two sources reduced this to 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple sources better estimates species distributions, aiding protected area designation and ecosystem assessment. Establishing a platform for community-sourced distribution contributes to conserving and monitoring ecosystems. Species distribution models are statistical tools for assessing biodiversity, accounting for biases in survey efforts, using occurrence records and environmental conditions to estimate potential ranges and habitats. Incorporating Biome data resulted in improved accuracy, with most accurate predictions when training consisted of 50-70 Biome data, highlighting the necessity of incorporating traditional surveys and citizen observations. Distribution models were built on traditional data and a mixture of traditional and Biome data, comparing performance and modeling distributions of 132 animals and plants in Japan, covering subtropical to boreal areas.
Researchers have investigated the role of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptor 1 (Bmpr1)-mediated signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development and its contribution to congenital pulmonary cysts. Using genetic mouse models, they found that ablation of mesenchal Bmpr1 disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to prenatal cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in cystic airways of mesench B1 knockout lungs. Additionally, ectopic mesenchal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in mes Bmpr1 knockout lungs. However, deletion of Smad1/5, major BMP downstream effectors from lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy cystic abnormalities, suggesting a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal cysts. This study reveals the role of mesenchal BMP signaling in lung development and potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital cysts. Lung mesench deletion of B1 at early developmental stage causes abnormal morphogenesis and cysts at late gestation in mice. Aberrant epithelial growth contributes airway cyst formation as loss of Sox2 or expansion of Sox9 in airway epithelia associated altered epithelial differentiation and cyst pathology in fetal lungs. Bmpr1 is essential for lung development, particularly airway morphogenesis, and its expression in fetal mesench is evident during mid-gestation. Deletion of B1 in fetal mesenchal cells resulted abnormal airway and prenatal cyst malformation. The relationship between B1 deletion and Bmp ligand in fetal mesench progenitor confirmed by comparing Bmp expression isolated mesench cells different B1 genotypes. Alterations other pathways including Fgf, Wnt, and Shh not detected by RNA and RT-PCR. This pathological resembles congenital airway malformation (CP) in pediatric patients. Investigating lung phenotypes by mesench-specific B1 knockout and underlying mechanisms enhances understanding congenital lung diseases. The study provides in vivo evidence B1-mediated signaling lung mesenchal indispensable lung development and potential pathogenic mechanism congenital cysts.
Researchers investigated the role of anionic lipid molecules, specifically phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2, in the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activity in living cells. Using super-resolution single-molecule microscopy, they visualized both EGFR and PI(4,5)P nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. The results showed that EGFR and PI(4,5)P nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI(4,5)P nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipaseγ, the EGFR effector hydrolyzing PI(4,5)P. Artificial reduction in the PI(4,5)P content of the plasma membrane reduced both dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Inhibition of PI(4,5)P hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654, indicating that EGFR activity and the density of PI(4,5P around EG molecules were mutually regulated. The study found that PI(4,5P nanodomains and EG nanoclusters aggregate together before EGF, and after stimulation the degree of coaggregation decreases, which depends on PLCγ but not phosphoinositide 3-kinase. Local PI(4,5P around EG stabilizes EGFR dimers to increase EG autophorylation upon stimulation with EGF, and subsequent hydrolysis of PI(4,5P by PLC plays a crucial role in deactivation of EGFR. The preferential coagregation of EG nanodomains with PI(4,5P rather than PS is due to membrane curvature and specific RAS-lipid interactions. Overall, the results suggest autogenous remodeling of lipid environments regulates EG activity.
Stramenopiles, a clade of diverse eukaryotic organisms including multicellular algae, fish pathogenic oomycetes, and human intestinal protozoan Blastocyst, exhibit a unique glycolytic pathway. Unlike most eukotes, where glycolysis is strictly cytosolic, strameniles have a branched glycolysis with enzymes in both cytosol and mitochondrial matrix. Researchers identified a mitochondrial carrier in Blastocyst that transports glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroacetone phosphate and glyceral-3-phosphate, across the inner membrane, linking cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. Comparative analysis with phylogenetically related human mitochondrial oxoglutar carrier and dicarboxate carrier shows the glycolytic carrier lost its ability to transport canonical substrates malate and oxoglutar. Blastocyst lacks key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for ATP generation, such as complexes III and IV, ATP synthase, and ADP/ATP carriers. The glycolytic pay phase in the matrix generates ATP, powering energy-requiring processes and NAD used by complex I to generate a proton force driving import of proteins and molecules.

The enzyme triosephosphate isomerase marks the end of the cytosolic phase of glycol in Blastocyst. Consequently, dihydroacetone phosphate and glyceral-3-phosphate are transported into the matrix for the pay phase of glycol. A unique Blastyst carrier was characterized, which lost its ability to transport malate and oxoglutar, instead transporting glycolytic intermediates, dihydroacetone phosphate, glyceral-3-phosphate, 3-phosphoglycerate, and phosphoenpyruvate, providing a link between cytos and mitochondrial glycol. The pay phase leads to production of ATP, NAD and pyvate, transported into the matrix by the pyvate carrier. Most eukotes have cytos glycol, except trypanosomes where it is localized in glycosomes. A mitochondrial carrier unique to stramen was discovered, transporting glycolytic dihydroacet phosphate, glyceral-3-phosphate and phosphoenpyvate, providing a missing link. Since mitochondrial glycol is exclusive to stramen, a transporter was searched that is ubiquitous in these species but not eukotes.

Blastocyst has lost cytos pay phase glycol, consistent with absence of pyvate carrier gene, except pyv kinase identified as cytos protein. Blastyst is an anaer with divergent mitochond. The glycolytic carrier represents a specific target against stramen pathogens of economic importance. The presence of glycolytic phase generates ATP and NAD, used by complex I, driving import of proteins and molecules. The carrier for glycolytic identified represents a drug and pesticide target against stramenile pathogens, given its unique specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism.
A new framework for human genetic association studies has been proposed, utilizing a deep learning model to calculate a functional activity score for two haplotypes per individual, referred to as the Haplotype Function Score. This score replaces the original genotype in association studies and has been applied to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank, identifying 361 independent associations with a significance of p < 5 ×10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 269 causal associations, corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism-based analysis. The Haplotype Function Score-based analysis also uncovered 727 pathway-trait and 153 tissue-trait associations with strong interpretability, including 'circadian pathway-chronotype' and 'arachonic-intelligence'. Integrating the Haplotype Function score with polygenic scores using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression showed improvement of 16.1-39.8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction. The Haplotype Function offers unique improvement in biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits compared to classic SNP-based methods, demonstrating value in genetic studies. The framework detected 11-334 more causal signals for each trait compared to functionally aware fine-mapping methods PolyFun and SbayRC. Applying the framework to 14 polygenic traits identified 16,597 significant Haplotype-trait associations at a threshold of p <5 ×10−8, equating to roughly 361 independent associations. The Haplotype Function is a promising strategy for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits, offering improvements in causal loci and gene identification, biological interpretation, and polygenic prediction. Compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism, the Haplotype Function has several compelling features, suggesting its potential for future genetic studies, although progress in algorithm and computation and data are still needed.
The hippocampus plays a crucial role in modulating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, impacting stress regulation of brain structure, function, and behavior. A study assessed the effects of three types of three-month training modules - attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective, and socio-cognitive skills - on hippocampal organization by reducing stress in 332 healthy adults. Longitudinal structural and resting-state fMRI analysis evaluated changes in hippocal subfield volume and intrinsic connectivity, related to changes in diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. Results showed increases in bilateral cornu ammonis volume, specifically CA-3, following socio-affective training targeting socio skills, compared to socio-cognitive training or no intervention. Structural changes were paralleled by relative increases in functional connectivity of CA-3 when socio-affective compared to socio-cognitive training. Training-induced changes in CA-3 structure and function correlated with reductions in cortisol output. Multivariate analysis found other subfields contributed to cortisol level changes despite no group-level changes. The study provides a link between socio-emotional intervention, changes in hippocal subfield structure and function, and cortisol reductions in healthy adults. Only socio-affective training related to increased hippocal CA-3 subfield volume, with alterations in connectivity and reduced diurnal cortisol. Domain-specific changes in hippocal structure, intrinsic connectivity, and relation to training changes in cortisol have not been studied. Module-specific changes in cortisol related to structural and functional changes in hippocal subfields and resting state were examined. Targeting attention, socio-affective or socio-cognitive skills enabled evaluation of training effects on hippocal structure, function, and cortisol associations. Increases in CA3 volumes following socio-affective training were small but consistent in left and right hippocampus subfields. The study investigates differential efficiency of three types of training on inducing structural and functional plasticity of hippocal subfields and reducing cortisol. The hippocampus has high glucocortic receptor density.
Researchers investigated local adaptation in three species of sunflowers, Helianthus annuus, Helianthus argyllus, and Helianthus petiolaris, which harbor large species-specific inversions, to determine the role of inversions and alleles of large effect in adaptive responses. Genome-wide association studies revealed significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, particularly within regions of the genome harboring inversions in one species. This suggests that while inversions facilitate local adaptation, some loci can still harbor mutations contributing to adaptation without recombination suppression in species lacking segregating inversions. The strongest signatures of association tend to be species-specific, indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for adaptation in these species. Non-shared lineages estimated the number of genome-wide regions contributing to adaptation for each variable phenotype, related to genic redundancy. Local adaptation in sunflowers involves strong repeatability at a small number of genes, often associated with inversions, coupled with high redundancy and non-repeated responses across a larger number of loci. The sunflowers harbor large regions of suppressed recombination, most of which are inversions and often associated with adaptive traits. Most sunflower inversions are over 1 million years old, predating current local patterns, but likely not the underlying genes, which appear shared among the studied species. Results suggest a fraction of the genome contributes to adaptation with low redundancy and high repeability, enriched within regions with inversions, while the remainder driven by loci with high redundancy and species-specific contributions. Repeatability associated with inversions supports the local adaptation model for long-term persistence of segregating inversions, rather than mechanisms based on dominance or meiotic drive.
Researchers investigated the effects of aging on the mammary epithelium, a bilayer of two distinct cell lineages: luminal epithelial and myoithelial cells, to understand the increased susceptibility to breast cancer with age. They generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoithelial cells from younger and older women, observing age-dependent directional changes in gene expression and increased transcriptional variance contributing to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia, involving altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers. Epithelial variance of gap protein GJB increased with age, and modulation of GJB expression in co-cultures revealed it provided communication from myoithelial cells driving change in luminal cells. The age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a signal detectable in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was predictive of breast subtype. The findings suggest luminal epithelia integrate variant responses to aging, endowing cells with the ability to become cancer cells-of-origin, representing a biosensor presaging cancer susceptibility. The study demonstrates age-dependent and variant transcriptional responses integrate in breast epithelia, explaining increased susceptibility to cancer initiation. Increased variances in transcriptomic profiles of mammary epithelial lineages across individuals is a significant outcome of aging, likely central to understanding increased susceptibility to breast cancers. Lineage-specific analyses unravel mechanisms of tissue-level molecular changes during normal aging, reflecting cell-intrinsic and microenvironment states. The results show increased molecular noise during aging leads to variances in transcriptomes, underlining differences in susceptibility to breast cancer development, particularly luminal subtypes. Both directional and variant changes led to a decrease in differential expression in older cells, indicating variances drive loss of lineage fidelity in breast epithelia.
Researchers explored the use of non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing as phenotyping proxies to understand the genomic basis of natural variation in plant resistance, using data from whole-genome and epigenome sequencing of 207 lines of field pennycress (Thlaspi arse) grown in a common environment and colonized by aphids, mildew, and microbes. The numbers of non-target reads assigned to pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and glucosinolate contents. Pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats showed higher aphid DNA load, indicating decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide analyses identified genetic variants at defense genes and novel regions associated with aphid and mildew load. Differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads were found, including differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure likely induced by pathogens. The study provides insights into defense mechanisms of Thlaspi arse and demonstrates non-target whole-genome reads can estimate plant biotic interactions. The goals of the study were to contribute to a mechanistic understanding of pest resistance in T. arse and leverage non-target reads as a source of information for quantifying herbivore and pathogen abundance in large collections. Field pennycress, an annual plant in the Brassicaceae, is increasingly studied as a model species and new biofuel winter crop. Studying natural variation in resistance with genetic and epigen variation identifies genes involved in defense and regulators, crucial for breeding pest-resistant crop varieties. A previous study investigated epigen variation in a collection of 207 Thlas lines across Europe prior to whole-genome and epigen sequencing, grown in a common environment colonized by aphids, powdery mildew, and microbes. The study found systematic variation in numbers of aphid and pathogen reads among T. arse lines, providing insights into genomic basis of plant resistance. The approach has broad application in fundamental and applied research with increasing numbers of large sequencing datasets worldwide.
Malaria control and eradication efforts are hindered by drug resistance, necessitating novel therapeutic strategies to combat the disease. Researchers explored collateral sensitivity between compounds targeting Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) to suppress resistance emergence in pathogen populations. The study profiled cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several DHOD mutant lines to a panel of DHOD inhibitors, focusing on TDC-334, active against all mutant lines including DHH C276, which arose in selections with clinical DSM265. Selections with TDC-334 yielded copy number variation of the dhod locus and a mutation DHH I263, conferring resistance to TDC-334 but not DSM265. Selection of DHH C276 with TDC-334 resulted in additional genetic changes in dhod, exhibiting decreased sensitivity to TDC-334 and high resistance to DSM. Exposing wildtype parasites to DSM and TDC-334 simultaneously selected parasites with DHH VA mutation, cross-resistant to both and as fit as wildtype in vitro, highlighting mutational flexibility of DH enzyme. Combining DH inhibitors DSM and TDC-334 based on collateral profiles failed to prevent resistance emergence in P. falciparum in vitro. Mutations exhibited sensitivity to TDC-334, but DHH I263 in selection with TDC-334 was resistant to TDC-334 not DSM. Sequentially selected parasites with mutations in dh were highly resistant DSM, not cross-resistant TDC-334, suggesting sensitivity to therapeutic dose. Treating collaterally sensitive line TDC-334 selected parasites with genetic changes in dh, including DHH227, conferring resistance TDC-334. DHH276/FY double mutant less sensitive DH276 parent, still sensitive TDC-334 compared wildtype.
The establishment and spread of antimalarial drug resistance vary drastically across different biogeographic regions, with most infections occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, while resistant strains often emerge in low-transmission regions. Existing models on resistance evolution lack consensus on the relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance, possibly due to overlooking the feedback between antigenic diversity, host immunity, and selection for resistance. A novel compartmental model was developed to track sensitive and resistant parasite strains, as well as host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity, showing a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency, regardless of resistance or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant data supports this trend. Post-discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while steadily decreasing in high-divity, high-transmission regions. The study underscores the critical role of malaria diversity in biographic patterns of resistance evolution. Antigen diversity of Plasmodium falcum strains differs among biographic zones, driving key differences in epidemiological features, yet has not been explicitly considered in mathematical models of resistance. Including strain diversity in the model provides a mechanistic explanation for why Southeast Asia has persisting resistance to antimal drugs despite lower transmission intensity than Africa. In low-diversity regions, parasites cannot reinfect hosts, and clinically immune hosts do not carry infections often. The model implies control protocols should vary regionally and there is no one-size-fits-all cure for malaria worldwide. Empirical comparisons of equilibrium levels of resistance and prevalence were restricted to studies between 1990 and 2000, estimating prevalence from 2000 as a proxy, excluding studies with host size less than 20.
Cannabis, the most widely consumed illicit psychoactive drug globally, is increasingly used by pregnant women, yet the impact of phytocannabinoids on early embryonic development remains understudied. Researchers utilized an in vitro system to investigate the effects of Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ-9-THC), the most abundant phytocannabinoid, on early embryonic development. Δ-9-TH was found to increase the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells but not their primed counterparts, dependent on CB1 receptor binding with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ-9-TH increased glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities of embryonic stem cells, a metabolic rewiring retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ-Like Cells even without direct exposure, altering transcriptional profiles. Three developmental windows were tested: exposure of embryonic stem cells, epiblast-like cells, and combined exposure. Cells were exposed to vehicle or Δ-9-TH in concentrations of 0.1nM-100μM, corresponding to physiologically-relevant concentrations in cannabis users. Studies revealed a moderate but significant impact of Δ-9-TH on early embryonic processes, highlighting metabolic remodelling as a potential driver of exposure through differentiation stages. The extensive transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming of Primordial Germ Cells during development is sensitive to environmental insults with potential consequences for offspring. This in vitro system investigated Δ-9-TH exposure on early developmental stages, with differential expression of cannabinoid receptors correlating with Δ-9-TH proliferative phenotypes. CB1 expression was required for Δ-9-TH-induced proliferation in embryonic stem cells but did not differ between embryonic and epiblast-like cells. This study sheds light on the impact of Δ9-TH during the first trimester in humans using a well-characterized in vitro model of early embryonic differentiation culminating in Primordial GermLike Cells.
The zebrafish, Danio rerio, has hundreds of NLR immune genes, making it an ideal species for studying copy number variation in large gene families. By sequencing 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations, a total of 151 NLRs were identified, exceeding the previously known 400. Approximately half of these NLRs are present in all populations, but only 4% were found in 80% or more of the individual fish. Wild fish have up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many Ns per population than laboratory strains. In contrast, nucleotide diversity in zebish NLR is very low, with half of the copies monomorphic and the remaining having few polymorphisms, likely a signature of purifying selection. Studies have reported NLR repertoires in the range of 10-50 genes in many fishes, while others have hundreds of Ns, including the zebish. The fact that hundreds of N gene copies are maintained in zebish, together with a signature of purifying selection, suggests the evolution of these genes is far from neutral. Expression of Ns is often induced by pathogen exposure, but the function of most zebish N-C genes remains unclear. A substantial reduction in single-nucle variation in zebish laboratory strains compared to wild populations has been demonstrated, and the copy numbers of NLR and variation are also heavily reduced, likely due to recent population bottleneck. Different individuals have numerous genes not present in others, caused by diversity-generating mechanisms active now. The study laid groundwork for investigating molecular and evolutionary mechanisms contributing to diversity of large vertebrate gene families. Sequences were detected in at least one individual from all populations and some restricted to single population, with variability in distributions of gene copies among fish within populations.
A newly discovered taxon of Famennian ovules, Alamenia gen. et sp. nov., has been reported from Xinhang, Anhui, China, which possesses three integumentary wings extending outwards, folding inwards along the abaxial side, and enclosing most of the nucellus. The ovule is terminally borne on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule, suggesting that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cup evolved for probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. The earliest ovules in the Famennian of the Late Devonian, approximately 372-359 million years ago, rarely played a role in wind dispersal due to the lack of integumentary outgrowths and were usually surrounded by a cupule. Alamenia represents the second acupulate ovule in the Famian and indicates that the seed originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two, or four wings under the same condition. The discovery of Alamen, along with Guia and Waria, suggests that evolutionarily novel wings as integument outgrowths appeared early in spermatophytes and were manifested in younger lineages. Other wind dispersal mechanisms, including plumes, papp, and parachutes of seeds, appeared later in the Permo-Carbonous and Mesozoic. The terminally borne ovules of Alamen are three-winged and aculate, implying additional functions of integument, including photosynthetic and anemorous functions of early ovules, indicating diversity of Famian winged ovules and the evolutionary sequence of ovule wings. Compared to Famian four-winged ovules of Waria and Guia, Alamen with distally outwards extending wings shows advantage in anemory, and mathematical analysis implies three-winged ovules could be efficiently dispersed by wind. The findings suggest that three or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with fewer wings and provide new insights into the evolution of seed dispersal mechanisms in early plants.
Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia is a hematological malignancy where standard treatments with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have achieved success in prolonging patient survival, but intolerance, relapse, and TKI resistance remain serious issues. Researchers have identified a new leukogenic process in which RAPN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph+ leukemia, where RAP mediates the nedlation of BCR-ABL, enhancing its stability by competing c-CBL-mediated degradation. SRC phosphorylates RAPN to activate its NED8 E3 ligase activity, promoting BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. Depletion of RAPN expression or its ligase activity decreased BCR-ABL stability, inhibiting tumor formation and growth. RAPN is highly expressed along with BCR-ABL in patients with Ph+ leukemia, promoting disease progression by stabilizing BCR-ABL via nedlation. The nedlation of BCR-ABL by RAPN competes with ubiquination-dependent degradation, increasing BCR-ABL stability. Balanced protein synthesis and degradation are crucial for maintaining homeostasis and cellular function. The generation of BCR-ABL protein is a characteristic of Ph+ leukemia, with BCR-ABL expression levels correlated with RSN, demonstrating specificity of RSN-mediated nedlation of BCR-ABL. RSN exerts its NED8 ligase activity, neddylating and stabilizing BCR-ABL in Ph+ leukemia pathogenesis, making it a potential therapeutic target for treatment. Knockout of RSN in tumor-bearing mice resulted in prolonged survival compared to controls, indicating RSN is highly expressed with BCR-ABL in Ph+ leukemia and its depletion inhibits disease progression. These findings provide an alternative to targeting tyros kinase activity for oncoprotein leukemic cells, generating a rationale for targeting RSN-mediated BCR-ABL nedlation for Ph+ leukemia treatment, potentially extending to other cancer types and broadening understanding of RSN involvement in hematology and oncology.
Researchers have discovered a new strategy to identify peptidoglycan hydrolases, enzymes that degrade peptidoglycan, from bacterial proteomes using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening, as a potential alternative to conventional antibiotics with low risk of resistance development. This approach was tested using Ply307 lysin-derived peptide as a template to identify five peidoglycan hydases, PH7-PH11, from the Acinetobacter baumannii proteome, with PH10 and PH11 showing potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after heat treatment at 100°C for 1 hour. The crystal structures of PH8, PH10, and PH11 were solved, revealing a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by dimer-monomer transition in hyper-thermostable PH10, while thermosensitive PH8 formed a monomer. Mouse models of bacterial infection demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PH10. This antimicrobial peptide-prim strategy provides new clues for the discovery of antimicrobial drugs. Lysins from Gram-negative bacteria contain antimicrobial-like regions, prompting the use of antimicrobial peptides as templates to mine bactericidal peidlycan hydrolases from proteomes. The antimicrobial peptide P307 derived from Ply307 was used to search for peptidlycan hydrolases in the A baumannii proteome database. Putative peidlycan hydrolases were obtained by BLAST using P307 as input and filtered by sequence length and function. Multiple alignments were performed and visualized, supporting the hypothesis that antimicrobial-prim mining is feasible for discovering peptidcan hydrolases with bacteric activity and desirable properties from proteomes.
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancer types with poor treatment options and better detection of early symptoms and relevant correlations could improve prognosis. A retrospective study utilized symptom and disease codes from the Danish Patient Registry encompassing 6.9 million patients from 1994-2018, of whom 23,592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. The Danish Cancer Registry included 18,523 of these patients. To complement registry codes with clinical data, text mining extracted symptoms from free clinical notes in electronic records of 307 pancreatic patients and 30,780 controls. Both data sources generated symptom trajectories to uncover temporal patterns prior to diagnosis. Text mining captured more symptoms prior to diagnosis, including blood pressure without diagnosis, heartbeat abnormalities, and intestinal obstruction not found in registry analysis. Trajectories identified two patient groups with lower survival, cough-jaundice-intestinal obstruction and pain-jaundice-abnormal function. Results provide comparison of pancreatic symptom trajectories, leveraging health data for detection of early risk factors. Text mining vocabulary included known pancreatic symptoms and generated disease trajectories using registry and clinical notes to characterize temporal ordering. Statistically significant disease trajectories prior to cancer may be assessed as risk factors for screening. Symptoms were abundant in electronic health records opposed to registry. Future applications could leverage knowledge and AI for improved symptom extraction and prediction, serving as a guide for screening and improving patient lives. Deep phenotypical information in registry and text can detect temporal patterns prior diagnosis, revealing increased prevalence of early symptoms, suggesting harnessing potential by incorporating multi-modality trajectories from electronic and registry codes.
Researchers investigated the development of slow oscillation-spindle coupling in children and adolescents aged 5-6, 8-11, and 14-18, and adults aged 20-26, focusing on the synchronization of canonical sleep spindles and slow oscillations during non-rapid eye movement sleep. The study found that while the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific, the slow oscillation-spindle pattern was evident for spindles in the adult-like fast range across all age groups, but less precise in children. Fast spindle maturity was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling and temporal precision across age groups. The results suggest increasing ability to generate adult-like fast spindles actuates precise oscillation-spindle patterns from childhood to adulthood. Individual peak frequencies of spindles were determined between 9-16 Hz during non-rapid eye sleep at frontal and centro-parietal electrodes where slow and fast spindles dominate. Analyses suggested spind in adult-like frequency rather than development-specific spind are coupled to slow oscillations within age groups. Maturation of development-specific spind towards adult-like spind may explain age differences in strength and precision of slow-spindle patterns. With age, differences in amplitude and density between development and adult-like centro-paral spind decreased and became more evident in adolescent and adult groups. Fast centro-paral spind become numerous and adult-like in frequency and amplitude during maturation. Neural rhythms defining coupling undergo substantial changes during child and adolescent development, with spind increasing occurrence and frequency. Canonical spind reported to mature and dominate during early childhood. Fast spindle maturity was captured by computing distance between development and adult-like spind within individuals at each age, calculating differences in frequency, density, and amplitude between adult-like and development spind. The study provides a cross-sectional characterization of age-specific patterns of slow and fast spind, slow oscillations, and their coupling, and how spindle and oscill maturity substantiate age differences in precise orchestration.
Research has shown that despite the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 and the adoption of high-throughput technologies, publications on human genes primarily feature genes that have been previously studied, with understudied genes being systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. Understudied genes remain understudied by studies that cite these -omics experiments, however, they may accrue a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors proposed to affect which genes are studied, 33 are significantly associated with the choice of genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. The abandonment of understied genes could be driven by the concern that focusing on less-investigated genes will yield articles with lower impact. The lack of publications on some genes is not explained by a lack of underlying experimental evidence, but rather understied genes are frequently found as hits in highput experiments but not investigated further by authors. Factors limiting studies of understied genes range from evolutionary to chemical, including whether a gene has homologs in primates. To promote investigation of understied genes, a tool find understied genes was created, allowing scientists to engage with potential bias during selection of hits. The tool identified genes understied in vertebrate aging and is available as a MacOS/Windows app.
Researchers have established a zebrafish model that exhibits excessive angiogenesis induced by high glucose, resembling the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Utilizing this model, they observed that glucose and noncaloric monoscharides could induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels, through the ectopic activation of quiescent endothelial cells into tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of endothelial cells exposed to high glucose revealed an augmented ratio of capillary endothelial cells, proliferating endothelial cells, and a series of upregulated proangiogenic genes. The study found that foxo1 mediates the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides via upregulating the expression of marck1. The effects of monosacides inducing excessive angiogenesis were proved to be mediated by the fox1-marck1 pathway, providing novel insights into the roles of nonoric monaccharides in human health and the underlying mechanisms. Several studies investigated the effects of high glucose on vascular function in zebrafish, but the association between nonoric monaccharides and vascular dysfunctions, such as excessive angiogenesis, has not been elucidated. The findings revealed knockdown of marck1 could mitigate excessive angiogenesis caused by high-glucose, resembling the effect with VFR inhibitor. Results suggested monaccharides induce excessive angiogenesis through the fox1-marck1 pathway in zebraf embryos. Fox1 exerts regulatory function during this process by downregulating its target marck1, whether treated with d-glucose or l-glucose. Both caloric and nonoric monaccharides treatment lead to excessive angiogenesis by promoting differentiation of quiescent endothelial cells into tip cells through the fox1-marck1 pathway. The study provides new evidence showing negative effects of nonoric monaccharides on vascular system and underlying mechanisms.
Daily experiences often involve processing multiple sequences, yet storing them challenges the limited capacity of working memory. To achieve efficient storage, relational structures shared by sequences would be leveraged to reorganize and compress information. Participants memorized a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations and later reproduced the full color and location sequences one after another. The consistency between location and color sequence trajectories was manipulated. Sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrate improved memory performance and a correlation between color and location sequences. Sequences with consistent trajectories show neural reactivation of common trajectories and display spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Neural reactivation correlates with behavior. Findings suggest a common structure is leveraged for storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and replay, facilitating information organization in working memory.

Neurally aligned-color sequences demonstrate reactivation of shared trajectory during encoding and retention, and spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Shared structures enable storage of multiple sequences in working memory through compressed encoding and replay. EEG recordings provide neural evidence for the compressive strategy, reactivation of shared trajectories during encoding, and spontaneous replay of color during recall. Structure reactivation relates to behavior and neural replay, facilitating efficient organization in working memory. When reproducing location sequences, the task-relevant color demonstrates sequential profile, highlighting the bond between color and location when sharing a common trajectory. Color-location correlation in behavior and findings suggest replay-based mechanisms mediate sequence combinations on common structures.

Behaviorally, sequences with color trajectories show enhanced precision and correlation between color and location. Neural replay represents abstract structure, structure-based inference, and generalization. When recalling location, neural replay occurs for color, supporting the spontaneous nature of replay, as color features are not task-relevant. Converging behavioral and neural evidence supports leveraging common structures to facilitate working memory, with consistent trajectories showing improved performance, correlation, and neural reactivation of common trajectories, and spontaneous replay of color sequences. Findings suggest a shared structure for storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and replay, facilitating organization in working memory.
Mutations in the PURA gene cause neurodevelopmental PURA syndrome, with almost all reported mutations resulting in full disease penetrance, unlike other monogenetic disorders. Research observed that patient mutations in PURA impair its co-localization with processing bodies, destroying folding, RNA binding, or dimerization. The crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal domains of human PURA were solved, combined with molecular dynamics and nuclear resonance measurements, revealing high dynamics and structural promiscuity, indicating susceptibility to mutations. This explains why conservative mutations result in full penetrance symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome. Since genetic variations cause PURA syndrome, modest alterations result in functional impairment, supported by structural flexibility and promiscuity of domains found in the K97 variant and molecular simulations indicating high motions of the N-terminal domain. Pathogenic variations in PURA patients are found along the entire protein sequence, unlike hot-spot regions in other disorders. Over 270 pathogenic variants in the PURA gene have been identified in 650 patients with confirmed PURA syndrome. The study aimed to understand how genetic variations affect functional and structural integrity of hsURA, providing the first assessment of effects on folding, nucleic acid binding, unwinding, subcellular localization to stress granules and P-bodies. Selected variants were predicted to have folding defects, and the study experimentally assessed structure and function of human PURA and impact of PURA-causing mutations on protein integrity, offering explanation for underrepresentation of mild phenotypes in patients with PURA syndrome.
Researchers have identified an interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 (AN1) that plays a crucial role in the water efflux of exocrine glands, suggesting its involvement in perspiration. In mouse foot pads, TRPV4 colocalizes with cytokeratin 8, AN1, and aquaporin-5 (AQP5) in secretory cells of sweat glands. TRPV-dependent cytosolic Ca2 increases were observed in mouse sweat glands, which were inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type mice but not in TRPV-deficient mice, and was inhibited by menthol in both wild-type and TRPM8 knockout mice. Basal sweating without acetyl stimulation was inhibited by an AN1 inhibitor. The interaction between TRPV and AN1 is involved in temperature-dependent sweating and increased friction. TRPV expression was higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with idiopathic generalized anhidrosis compared to anhidic skin. TRPV-expressing secretory cells are involved in the secretion of macromolecular components as well as the secretion of water and ions. The functional interaction of TRPV and AN1 was examined in heterologous expression with HEK293 cells and native exocrine acinar cells. TRPV agonist GSK and acetylcholine stimulated sweating in wild-type mouse glands. Temperature-dependent basal sweating without acetyl stimulation was observed in wild-type mice but not TRPV knockout mice. Menthol inhibited TRPV and AN1, suggesting its role in inhibiting sweating. TRPV, AN1, and AQP form a complex that promotes sweat secretion in eccrine glands of mouse pads. Wild-type mice climbed a slippery slope more easily than TRPV-deficient mice, indicating the importance of sweating in maintaining friction forces. TRPV expression was detected in eccrine glands of foot pads along with AN1 and AQP. The secretory coil is located in the deep dermis with a straight duct opening to the skin surface. The study suggests TRPV is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with AN1, and targeting TRPV or the TRPV/AN1 complex could regulate perspiration.
Researchers have presented a universal, multi-scale description of primate cortices, demonstrating that all cortical shapes can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes. As neighboring folds are merged, the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory, which also overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species. The results indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of 2.5. Expressing cortical morphology as a function of scale provides a more detailed and informative characterization of brain morphology and morphological changes, enabling the identification of biological processes acting on specific scales. This suggests a universal blueprint for mammalian brain shape and common mechanisms governing cortical folding. The novel method of deriving multiscale metrics can differentiate morphological changes four times better than metrics used at a single scale, demonstrating a scale-dependent effect of aging on brain morphology with a fourfold increase in size from two to eight standard deviations at a spatial scale of approximately 2mm. This understanding may generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future. Empirically, the main result is the demonstration of universal self-similar scaling for primate and mammalian cortices, with two aspects of universality: each cortex having the same value for all scales and fractal dimension of 2.5. Fractal scaling for cortical morphology has been postulated, with recent papers using MRI data estimating fractal dimension close to 2.5. The study demonstrates representative primate and mammalian brains share key shape properties on top of agreeing fractal dimension, providing a basis for rigorous characterization of brain morphology and morphological changes.
The NF-κB transcription factor RELA is a key regulator of immune and stress responses and is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors. Live-cell imaging of endogenous RELA-GFP in PDAC cell lines revealed that TNFα stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA. Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets showed that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of REL-regulated gene expression in PD cells, including TNα-induced REL upregulation of actin regulators NU2 and ARAP31. siRNA depletion of ARAP31 and NU2 altered TNF-stimulated nuclear REL dynamics in PD cells, establishing a negative feedback loop regulating REL activation by TNα. The NF-κ pathway in PD cells was characterized, identifying interactions between NF-κ/Iκ proteins and REL in the absence or presence of TNα. Computational and experimental evidence supports interdependence between the F-act network and NF-κ pathway with REL translocation dynamics in PD. RNAseq identified genes with distinct expression patterns based on TNα dose and REL activation. Live imaging with knockdown of targets uncovered mechanisms regulating inflammation-associated REL dynamics in PD, including negative loops between REL and actin modulators NU2 and ARAP31, and REL and non-canonical NFκ protein REL. The actin modulators ARAP31/NU2 are REL targets and regulators of nuclear REL with TNα, mediating the relationship between actin and REL. NFK1 and NFK2 showed increased interaction with REL with TNα, forming NFκ heterodimers in PD cells. siRNA knockdown of TN-regulated genes affected TN-stim REL dynamics, suggesting Iκ plays a role in suppressing TN induction of nuclear REL in PD cells. Nuclear REL in control conditions was affected by NF-κ components, indicating REL is highly modulated by NF-κ/I proteins in absence of stress cues. The expression of NFκ transcription factors and Iκ proteins is affected by TN dose and REL inactivation in PD cells, given I proteins are regulators of REL across cell types.
A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition is essential for proper brain function, and disruptions in the GABAergic system, which alter this equilibrium, are a common feature of various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders. Mutations in Phosphatase and Tens Homolog, the main regulator of the phosphidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway, are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorders. Research using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromus system found that daf-18/PT mutations impact GABA but not cholinergic neurodevelopment and function, resulting in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The defects in the GABA system in daf-18/PT mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOX during development. Ketogenic diets have proven effective for disorders with E/I imbalances, and a diet enriched with ketone β-hydrobutyrate during development induces DAF-16/FOX activity, improving GABA neurodevelopment and function in daf-18PT mutants. The study provides insights into the link between PT mutations and neurodevelopment and delves into the mechanisms of therapeutic effects of ketogenic diets. daf18/PT mutations lead to defects in inhibitory GABA neurodevelopment without affecting cholin excitatory signals due to downregulation of DAF16/FOX transcription activity. The FOX family of transcription factors is conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Mutations in daf18PT and d16 result in developmental defects in GABA neurons, altered morphology, and function, while cholin motor neurons remain unaffected. The defects in inhibitory transmission arise from hyperactivation of the PIK pathway and subsequent DAF16FOX inhibition in GABA neurons of daf18PT mutants. The substantial conservation of main components of PIK/Akt pathway in C elegans enhances the model for investigating the role in neurodevelopment. Mutations in daf18, ortholog PTEN, result in developmental defects in GABA neurons, leading to altered morphology, while cholin motor neurons remain unaffected, suggesting hyperactivation of PIK pathway with subsequent DAF16FOX inhibition in GABA neurons of d18PT mutants.
Researchers have discovered that innate immune responses, including proinflammatory cytokines, play a crucial role in containing SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus responsible for COVID-19. Utilizing quantitative and qualitative models, they found that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes inhibit SARSV-2-induced cell fusion in infected cells. Cytokine screening identified interleukin-1β (IL-1β) as a key mediator of inflammation that inhibits syncytia formation by various SARSV2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1β activates Rho/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical pathway, driving actin bundle enrichment at cell junctions, preventing syncytia formation. In vivo experiments in mice confirmed IL-β restricts SARSV2 spread in lung epithelium. The study highlights an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection, revealing the function and mechanism of IL-β in inhibiting SARS2-induced syncyt formation and innate immune factors against coronavir transmission, providing potential therapeutic targets for viral control.

The study explored the function of innate factors against SARS2 infection and found IL-β inhibits various SARS2 variants and beta-coronaviruses-induced cell fusion. Notably, ILβ, a key inflammatory response factor, inhibits SARS2-induced syncyt formation by activating Rho/ROCK pathway, initiating actin formation between infected and neighboring cells. Importantly, ILβ reduces SARS transmission among lung epithelia in experimental mice. Fluorescence staining showed SARS-infected lung cells fuse with neighboring cells, promoting transmission, while ILβ induces actin bundles, restricting syncyt formation and transmission. Mechanistically, ILβ activates Rho, enriching cell junctions via IL-mediated signaling, initiating actin formation, preventing cell fusion and spreading. These findings reveal a critical function for proinflammatory cytokines controlling infection.

ILβ significantly restricts SARS spread in lung epithelium, highlighting its antiviral function during infection. The study demonstrates the function and mechanism of ILβ in inhibiting SARS-induced syncyt formation and innate factors against coronavir transmission, providing potential therapeutic targets. ILβ, a key inflammatory mediator, inhibits SARS-induced syncyt formation by activating Rho/ROCK, driving actin enrichment at cell junctions, preventing syncytia. In vivo experiments confirm ILβ restricts SARS transmission, highlighting its role in controlling viral infection. Overall, the study reveals an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during SARS infection, providing potential therapeutic targets for control.
Insulin plays a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis, and Drosophila insulin-producing cells (IPCs) are functionally analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells, releasing insulin directly into circulation. Researchers investigated the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity by quantifying the effects of nutritional and internal state changes using electrophysiological recordings, finding that nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity, which decreases with increasing periods of starvation. Refeeding flies with glucose or fructose, two nutritive sugars, significantly increased IPC activity, whereas non-nutritive sugars had no effect. In contrast, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, similar to the mammalian incretin effect where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application. Diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis (DH44s) responded to glucose perfusion, but functional connectivity experiments demonstrated these DH44s do not affect IPC, while other DHs inhibit them. Populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. Activating IPCs had a small satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activating DHs strongly increased hyperactivity. The study demonstrates IPC and DHs are integral to a modulatory network orchestrating glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in metabolic state. IPC activity is diminished during starvation and rebounds after glucose feeding, consistent with previous studies demonstrating accumulation of DILPs. Insulin release is modulated by enteroendocrine signals, and Dros IPCs sense glucose in circulating hemolymph to release insulin in response to glucose increases. Previous ex vivo studies suggested IPCs, like pancreatic cells, sense glucose-autonomously. Trehalose perfusion did not affect IPC, strengthening the idea IPCs do not directly sense hemolymph sugar levels. Findings suggest IPC activity, hence insulin release, is not simply modulated by hemolymph concentration in Drosila, similar to mammals. Several pathways could contribute to this. Octopaminergic neurons expressing Dros insulin receptor are necessary for regulation of starvation-induced hyperactivity, implicating IPCs play a role in modulating foraging behavior.
Researchers have developed a method to generate a large-scale endogenous tag library in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) using an engineered split mNeGreen protein, enabling the study of protein function in healthy cells and across differentiated cell types. A human iPS cell line was engineered to express a fragment of the splitNeGreen protein, mNG-10, allowing for efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with a complementary fragment, mNG11. This approach enables live imaging of dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSCs with high temporal resolution. The study demonstrates the potential for creating a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells, providing a basis for studying protein function in human cells and across cell types in vitro. The splitNeGreen system was used for endogenous tagging in human iPSCs, with a human iPS line constitutively expressing the mNG-10 fragment, validated and named'sm2' (splitNeGreen2 parental line). Multiple genes were targeted for endogenous tagging with m11, and clonally isolated tagged iPS lines were generated. The splitNeGreen retains most of the brightness of the original NeGreen, allowing easy and efficient endogenous tagging in cells where m10 is constitutively expressed. The generation of a genome library of tagged proteins in human cells requires higher throughput, and self-complementing fluorescent proteins can be used for large-scale endogenous tagging. This work provides the foundation for a genome-wide endogenous tag in human cells and protocols to efficiently generate endogenous tags in iPSCs, opening the door to studying protein function in human cells across cell types.
Researchers have developed a novel method for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neurophysiology. A custom-built current source provides stable and controlled current for repeatable lesions in awake animals. The technique was validated using histology, in vivo and ex vivo testing, current and voltage traces, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning. This electrolytic lesioning method provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision the location of the injury and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining population after lesioning. It can be used in many areas of the cortex, several species, and theoretically with any multielectrode probe. The low-cost external device can easily be adopted into existing electrophysiology setup. This technique enables causal investigations of recorded population's role in neuronal function while providing insight into local reorganization after neuron loss. A custom-built current source ensures stable delivery throughout the lesion for repeated lesions and across electrode types and animals. Electrolytic lesioning works with linear multicontact probes and no limitations prevent it from working with passive multielectrode probes. The method enables small, permanent inactivation volumes while maintaining reliable neurophysiological recordings. Selection of electrical pattern, amplitude, duration, and electrodes' shape offers combinations for investigations into the causal role of cortical activity. Electrolytic lesioning has been demonstrated across multielectrode probes in rabbits, pigs, sheep, and rhesus macaques, and can be used with smaller species like rats. The approach allows for precise control over lesion location and extent, avoiding disruptive procedures, and enabling electrophysiological recording post-lesion. The device is compatible with electrophysiological recording pre and post-lesion, allowing for a better understanding of the role of recorded population in neuronal function and reorganization after lesion.
Bees are essential pollinators of agricultural crops, but their populations are threatened by pesticide use, particularly through the poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides. Research on bee detection of neonicotinoids has yielded contradictory evidence regarding their ability to taste these pesticides in sucrose solutions and avoid them. This study used an assay for detection of food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of buff-tailed bumblebees detect pesticides in a solution mimicking nectar of oilseed rape. The results showed that bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing imidacloprid, thiametham, clothianin, or sulfofl, even at lethal doses spanning six orders of magnitude. Only extremely high concentrations of pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation. These findings provide strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts, they are at risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in nectar of pesticide-treated crops. Studies have tested whether bees can taste and avoid neotinoid pesticides in nectar, but conclusions are contradictory. A combination of sensitive behavioural assays and electrophysiology was used to test whether bumblebee mouthparts have mechanisms to detect pesticides in nectar. Feeding assays using freely moving foragers assessed if bees detect and avoid potential toxins in food. Quantifying the structure of feeding when mouthparts of freely-moving bumblebees showed they are neither attracted nor deterred from consuming sugar solutions containing neotinoids, consistent with the idea they cannot detect pesticides. Bees have highly specialized mechanisms for encoding sugars different from other insects. However, no evidence was found that neotinoid pesticides elicited spikes in gale GRNs, including nutrient/sugar neurons, suggesting bees cannot taste neotinoids in nectar or water. This conclusion has been challenged by a study in free-flying bumblebees. Neotinoids impair foraging behaviour, homing, orientation, olfactory learning, and memory. Most studies administer pesticides in sugar solutions and record changes in behaviour or performance.
Zoonotic disease dynamics in wildlife, particularly Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria, are rarely quantified at macroecological scales due to the lack of systematic surveys. Non-human primates (NHP) host Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoon malaria of public health concern and main barrier to malaria elimination in Southeast Asia. A meta-analysis of 632 NHP from 148 sites reveals prevalence is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia with low overall and high estimates for Malaysian Borne. Regions exhibiting higher prevalence in NHP overlap human infection hotspots in wildlife and humans, parasite transmission linked to land conversion and fragmentation. By assembling remote sensing and statistical models to prevalence at multiple scales, relationships between P. knowlesi in NHP and forest fragmentation are identified. Higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity explaining geographic variation in parasite burden. Findings address gaps in regional P. knowlesi epidemiology indicating prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key driver of human spillo risk. Associations between landscape and variation simian Plasium spp in primates have not been explored. A georeferenced dataset of P. knowlesi in NHP was assembled, variation in NHP P. knowlesi by region evaluated and environmental and spatial factors assessed. Prevalence of pathogen in reservoir is crucial in zoon spillo events. Prevalence of P. knowlesi in primate species is spatially heterogeneous, higher prevalence driven by forest loss and fragmentation contributing to land use and human P. know risk. This study assesses P. know prevalence in NHP at regional scale and wide habitats. Prediction intervals indicate high heterogeneity within regions, consistent with high variability across sites. Covariate data and P. know prevalence were used to explore relationships between landscape and NHP malaria. The study highlights spatial heterogeneity and role of landscape driving P.lesi rates in NHP. Intersection between human epidemiology and ecology is essential for infection dynamics in reservoirs in public interventions.
The rise of angiosperms to ecological dominance and the breakup of Gondwana during the Mesozoic marked major transitions in the evolutionary history of insect-plant interactions. To elucidate how trophic interactions were influenced by host and palaeogeographical events, researchers integrated molecular data with the fossil record to construct a time tree for ancient phytophagous weevils of the beetle family Belidae. The analyses indicate that crown-group Belidae originated approximately 138 million years ago in Gondana, associated with Pinops conifer host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead or decaying branches. Belids tracked their host plants as major plate movements occurred during Gwana's breakup, surviving on distant disjunct landmasses. Some belids shifted to Angiospermae and Cycadida when conifers declined, evolving new trophic interactions, including brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. Extant radiations of belids in the genera Rhin and Proterus have relatively recent origins. Belidae were reconstructed as having a Gwan origin with two extant subfamilies Belinae and Oxycn originating in the Australian and Neotropical regions. The likely host plants of Belidae were Pinops or Angiospermae. Belinae Pinops were the most likely host plants. Belidae originated during the Jurassic in association with gymnosperms and colonized angiosperms as the latter rose to ecological dominance during Late Cret and Paleogene. The subfamilies Belinae and Oxn originated and diverged during the separation of East and West Gw and have lineages that develop on their host. The Eastw clade Belinae divergence was estimated at 44.7 Ma during the Pale-E separation of South America and Australia. The use of plant organs is plastic and opportunistic in some Belidae. A Gwan origin was recovered for Belidae at 138 Ma when South America and Australia were connected via Antarctica. Angiosperm families did not diversify until Cret. Con lineages were dominant consistent with Pinops the likely host of Belidae.
Researchers have utilized high-resolution genetic data from hepatocellular carcinomas to analyze the early evolution of tumors in vivo, shedding light on the spatiotemporal dynamics of tumor growth. By leveraging spatial metrics of evolution, it was found that tumor cells predominantly grow uniformly within the tumor volume instead of at the surface. The study determined how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumor and how cell death contributes to overall tumor growth. The findings provide insight into the early evolution of tumors in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology. Genetic data from hepatocellular tumors at high resolution was used to analyze the early evolution of tumors, linking spatial tumor sampling with evolution and elucidating the dynamics of metastasis. High-resolution data on the distribution of mutations in solid tumors was used to infer the spatiotemporal principles of tumor evolution, including growth rate and interplay between tissue dynamics and genetic evolution. Whole-exome mutation data from hepatocellular carcinomas was used to infer how tumors grew in earlier stages, developing metrics of intratumor heterogeneity to leverage spatial information from sample positions. This contrasts with surface growth where dispersal mechanisms account for observed mutation distribution. Cell migration between tumor regions affects multi-region sampling, probed by detecting mutations in a limited number of samples. The study builds on previous research using phylogenetic comparison of primary and metastatic tumors to elucidate metastasis dynamics, forming the basis of population-genetic approaches to analyzing tumor data. Spatial metrics of evolution and intratum heterogeneity provide new understanding of tumor growth and evolution.
Seasonal polyphenism enables organisms to adapt to environmental challenges by increasing phenotypic diversity, and Copsa. chinensis exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism in the form of summer-form and winter-form with distinct morphological phenotypes. Previous research has shown that low temperature and the receptor CTR regulate the transition from summer-form to winter in C. chinensis by impacting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underlying neuroendocrine mechanism remains largely unknown. Burs, also known as the tanning hormone, is responsible for hardening and darkening the insect cuticle. This study reports the novel function of Burs and its receptor in the transition from summer to winter in C. chinensis. Two subunits of Burs, Ccursα and Cursβ, were identified in C. chinensis, regulated by low temperature and CTR. Cursα and Curs form a heterodimer that mediates the transition from summer to winter by influencing cuticle chitin and thickness. Curs acts as the Burs receptor, playing a critical role in upstream signaling the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer to winter. miR-601 directly targets Curs, contributing to the regulation of Burs signaling in seasonal polyphen of C chinensis. The expression of Cursα and Curs was higher in the head and cuticle of winter-form compared to summer-form, implying a potential role of Burs in seasonal polyphen. Low temperature and CTR RNAi affected the expression of Cursα and Curs. Temporal and spatial patterns of Curs were similar to Cursα and Curs, with higher expression in winter-form than summer. Data suggest Cursα and Curs are essential for the transition from summer to winter, affecting cuticle contents and thickness. Burs receptor Curs was identified as a leucine-rich-containing G-coupled receptor. Cursα and Curs form a heteric neuropeptide acting on Curs to mediate the transition from summer to winter, affecting cuticle pigment, cuticle chitin, and cuticle thickness. miR601 targets Curs to modulate Burs signaling in seasonal polyphen. Burs genes and receptor play a pivotal role in regulating insect cuticle development. Research indicates Bicon may not be necessary for cuticle tanning in all insects, and further studies are needed to understand how Bicon mediates seasonal polyphen of C chinensis. The findings reveal the novel function of neuroendocrine mechanism underlying polyphenism, providing insights into Bicon and its receptor.
Diffuse midline gliomas (DMs) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. A key driver mutation in DMs is the lysine to methion substitution of residue 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27), which reshapes the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27 gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. To find an effective treatment, researchers examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting histone deacetylases (HDs) and MYC in these tumors. Treatment of H3-K27 patient-derived cells with Sopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HD inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability. Transcriptome and epigen profiling revealed a synergistic effect of this combination downregulating prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. In vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor reduction in mice treated with the combination. These results highlight the combined treatment with HD inhibitors as a promising approach for these aggressive tumors.

H3-K27 gliomas are characterized by deregulation of epigen pathways affecting post-translational modifications of lysine 27 and lys 4 methylation on histone H3. High-level amplification of MYC is recurrently observed in pediatric high-grade gliomas and H-K27 gliomas show high expression of MYC and MY target genes due to epetic alterations. The PIN inhibitor Sop was shown to downregulate MY target genes in vitro and block MYC-driven tumors in murine models. Researchers tested dual targeting histone acetylation and MY activation using Vorin and Sop to address the need for an effective therapy for H27 DMs. The combination resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability, downregulation of oncogenic pathways, and significant tumor reduction in mice. The findings emphasize epigen dependencies of H27-driven gliomas and highlight the potential of combined treatments for this malignancy. HD inhibition in combination with MY inhibitor inhibited oncogenic signatures and reduced growth in vivo, proposing a novel therapeutic strategy targeting epigen and transcription pathways in H27-mut DM tumors.
The white-footed mouse Peromys leucopus, a long-lived rodent, serves as a key reservoir for several zoonotic diseases in North America, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and viral encephalitis, without apparent disability or diminished fitness despite persistent infection. To investigate the inflammatory response elicited by various pathogens, the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide was used to compare genome-wide transcription in blood of P. leucopus, Mus musculus, and Rattus norveicus, adjusted for white cell concentrations. Results showed that deermice were distinguished from mice and rats by LPS response profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. LPS-treated P. leopus, in contrast to mice and rats, displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. This phenomenon was associated with reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasm pattern recognition in the deerm. P. leopus had distinguishing profiles of differentially expressed genes in the blood, spleen, and liver compared to M. musculus. The inflammation phenotype of deice was consistent with an 'alternatively activated' or M2 macrophage polarization instead of the expected 'classically activated' M1 polarization observed in M. musculus. Comparative analysis revealed restrained transcriptional response in deice for M2 and greater fold-changes for Mmp, Slpi, S1009 and Ilb, the gene for interleukin-1 in P. leopus than M musculus. Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio was higher in LPS-treated deice and monocyte percentage increased to 10 in LPS-treated deice. Eosinophil percentages were higher in deice at 3.4 than in mice 1. These results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in P. leopus and perhaps other animal reservoirs for human disease.
Caspases are a family of proteases involved in the cleavage and activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis. Human caspase 3 and caspase 7 recognize the same consensus motif Dxx, present in gasdermin, but human gasdermin is cleaved by casp 3, not casp 7. A study identified pyroptic puffer gasder that was cleaved by both puffer casp 3 and casp 7 and human cas 3 and cas 7. Domain swapping between puffer and human cas and gasder showed the gasder C-terminus and casp 7 p10 subunit determined cleavability of gasder by casp 7. A key residue in casp 10 governs cas 7 substrate discrimination and is highly conserved in vertebrate cas 3 and most vertebrate, except mammalian cas 7. In mammals, the residue is conserved in non-primates but not primates. Mouse cas 7 cleaved human gasder but not mouse gasder. The findings reveal the molecular mechanism of cas 7 substrate discrimination and divergence of cas 3 and 7-mediated gasder activation in vertebrates. Results suggest mutation-mediated alteration of cas enabled divergence and specialization of different cas members in regulation of cellular activities in mammals. Puffer gasder was specifically cleaved by cas 3 and cas 7 at the site to liberate pyptosis-inducing fragment, unlike human gasder, which is only cleaved by cas 3. Teleosts have two gasder orthologs, gasda and gasb. Mutation of the cleavage site inhibited pyroptosis and decreased release and gasder cleavage, indicating cas 3 and 7 cleavage is required to activate gasder-mediated pyptosis. Asn residue in cas 7 was changed to ser in mammals, especially primates, resulting in divergence of cas 7 from 3 in substrate recognition and cleavage. Mammals possess multiple pyptotic gas members, and functional divergence of cas 7 from 3 may have occurred due to specific regulation of programmed death by different molecules.
Ketamine has emerged as a promising therapy for treatment-resistant depression, but individual variability in response to ketamine is not well understood and its molecular mechanisms are unclear. A single-blind study was conducted with 40 healthy participants receiving ketamine, with a bolus of 0.23mg/kg and infusion of 0.58mg/hr. Resting-state functional connectivity was quantified via data-driven brain connectivity and related to ketamine-induced symptom and cortical expression. Results showed that ketamine's neural and behavioral effects are multi-dimensional, reflecting inter-individual variability. Ketamine's data-driven neural effect matched somatostatin and parvalbumin cortical expression in humans, while the mean effect did not. Behavioral variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients resolvable at the single-subject level. The study highlights the importance of considering individual and neural variation in response to ketamine, with implications for developing precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry. Over the last two decades, ketamine has shown promise for treatment-resistant depression with robust differences in response observed in healthy controls and patients. A single infusion results in a 65% response rate in patients, with complex relationships between acute and delayed effects. Ketamine induces a shift from cortical to subcortically-centred brain state, particularly basal ganglia and cerebellum. Studies have shown ketamine increases global brain connectivity in prefrontal cortex in healthy controls and normalizes reduced connectivity in patients. The study hypothesized ketamine would result in multiple neural and behavioral axes of variation and using a multi-dimensional approach would relate effects to molecular mechanisms, specifically SST and PVAL cortical expression. The study also compared ketamine to psilocybin and LSD, which have different pharmacological profiles, to investigate the extent of multi-dimensionality specific to ketamine.
The RNA world hypothesis proposes that the first self-replicating units of life existed as RNA-like polymers, but autonomous and non-enzymatic replication poses a problem due to reduced replication speed caused by hybridization between template and copy strands. Researchers investigated the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies models under constant population and chemostat conditions, finding large population sizes and small replication rate differences favor coexistence of most replicator species, alleviating the error problem relative to exponential amplification. Sequence properties, such as GC content, and resource competition mediated by resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants. Stochastic parabolic growth may have preserved viable sequences generated by abiotic synthesis, providing genetic material for early evolution of functional ribozymes. The study modeled finite populations of unlinked RNA-like replicators with parabolic growth as stochastic dynamics, considering replicator sequences, copying, error, and strand separation constraints, demonstrating diversity-maint mechanisms operate in the parabolic regime. Parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates for template-directed enzyme-free replication, proposing a biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in RNA information systems. A chemostat model validated Darwinian selection by competitive exclusion, showing increased competition induces a switch from coexistence to survival of the fittest. The diversity-maint mechanism can be used to investigate coevolution of molecular replicators, and parabolic growth sustains unlimited competing species in infinite population limit.
Researchers have discovered that Nonstructural protein 5 (Nsp5), the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 (TR1), a host enzyme required for prevalent post-transcription modification in tRNAs. Human cells infected with SARSV2 exhibit a decrease in TR1 protein and TR1-catalzed tRNA modifications, consistent with TR1 cleavage and inactivation by N5. N5 cleaves TR1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS2 protein cleavage sites, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits N5-dependent proteolysis of TR1. The TR1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TR1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type cells, TR1-deficient human cells infected with SARS2 exhibit reduced levels of intracellular RNA. These findings provide evidence that N5-dependent cleavage of TR1 and perturbation tRNA patterns contribute to the pathogenesis of SARS2 infection. SARS2 infection correlates with decreased TR1 levels and reduction in m2,2-modified tAs, and TR1 expression is required for efficient SARS replication in human cells. TR1 is a novel proteolytic cleavage target of N5 during SARS infection, suggesting pathological mechanisms associated with perturbations in TR1-catalzed tRNA modifications. The interaction between N5 and TR1 indicates SARS infection affects TR function with consequent effects on tRNA levels, and TR1 is an endogenous cleavage target of N5 resulting in methyltransfer inactive products. Examination of TR1 structure revealed an amino acid sequence matching the consensus of N5 cleavage sites in SARS polyproteins, including a conserved glutamine residue at the fourth position found in all N5 cleavage sites. Mutating this residue inhibits N5-dependent proteolysis of TR1, demonstrating TR can be recognized and cleaved by N5 in human cells with cleavage requiring a sequence matching N5 sites in SARS polyproins. TR1 catalyzes formation of dimguanosine at position 26 in more than half human tAs, and its cleavage by N5 perturbs tRNA patterns, contributing to SARS pathogenesis.
Many disease-causing microbes are not obligate pathogens, but rather environmental microbes that take advantage of an ecological opportunity. The existence of microbes whose life cycle does not require a host and are normally non-pathogenic, yet well-suited to host exploitation, is an evolutionary puzzle. One hypothesis posits that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host. An example of such a trait is surface adherence. To experimentally test the idea of 'accidental virulence', replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were evolved to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations. Along with plastic adherence, two multicellular phenotypes - biofilm formation and flor formation - increased, another phenotype, pseudohyphal growth responded to nutrient limitation. Thus, experimental selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hypercellular strains. Wax larvae injected with evolved hypercellular strains were significantly more likely to die than those injected with non-cellular strains. Hence, selection on plastic adherence incidentally led to evolution of multicellularity and increased virulence. 

Yeast populations were artificially selected for adherence ability in one context to determine whether it led to an increase in virulence in another. Specifically, yeast were evolved to adhere to plastic then tested against wax larvae to estimate virulence. In replicate populations of genetic backgrounds, yeast increased their ability to express multicellularity numerous forms. To test coincidental selection-accidental virulence, changes had an effect on virulence, interested in unexpected evolution of hypercellular clones. Virulence measured using larvae greater wax moth, invertebrate model to study microbial pathogenesis and virulence, including S cerevisiae. Research presented, altering biotic abiotic environment determining effect on virulence, apply selection specific trait dual-use biomedical yeast Saccharces. Evolutionary changes brought by selection for plastic led incidental evolution increased virulence.

Results demonstrate selection one trait generate correlated response other traits, common organism evolution, correlated traits associated virulence. Favoring ability adhere plastic surface, industrial, medical, domestic led aggregative phenotypes increased virulence. Selection on adherence led incidental evolution multicell and increased virulence support idea selection beneficial environment generate opportunistic 'accidental pathogens'. The study used Saccharomyces as model genetics, cell biology, ecological niches around globe. Wax moth larvae injected hypercell strains significantly die noncell strains. Selection plastic led evolution multicell increased virulence support idea selection environment generate opportunistic pathogens.
Proteins containing prion-like domains (PLDs) are common drivers of the formation of biomolecular condensates and are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations. Researchers used a residue-resolution coarse-grained model, Mpipi, to quantify the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins, including hnRNPA1, TDP, FUS, EWS, RBM, and TIA. Simulations revealed the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in the critical temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid mutations. These rules are consistent with physicochemical properties of the mutations and extend across the entire tested family, suggesting scaling laws can be used to predict changes in stability of PLD condensates. The study demonstrates that for at least for hnRN1, there exist quantitative rules that explain changes in thermodynamic condensates in response to precise-acid sequence mutations and investigates whether scaling laws can predict the critical parameters of a broader set of PLDs in response to amino sequence mutations. The effects of successive mutations can be predicted by the addition of laws as long as the mutation keeps within PL composition and patterning biases. A systematic approach varying the acid sequence of PLDs determines how phase behavior changes with compositional perturbations, analyzing three types of scaling laws for each type of mutation. Changes in critical temperatures of PLDs as a function of number and type of acid mutations can be quantified by laws conserved across the family of PLDs investigated. Interactions involving aromatic residues, π-π and cation-π, are dominant in stabilizing condensates formed by PLDs. The data illustrates the effect of single mutations on critical temperatures of the family of PLDs as a function of PL length. The study offers a lens into emergent behavior of PL solutions in response to physicochemical changes of single PL molecules and provides a framework to describe quantitatively phase behavior of large protein variants via identification of scaling laws, predicting changes in stability condensates based on acid mutations.
Predicting an individual's cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience, typically done by analyzing structural aspects such as connectivity or cortical thickness, or aggregated measures of brain activity over time. However, these approaches miss a crucial aspect of brain function: the unique patterns in which an individual's brain activity unfolds over time. To address this, a new approach is proposed that describes dynamic connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov model and combines it with the Fisher kernel to predict individual traits. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the Hidden Markov model in a mathematically principled manner, preserving the structure of the underlying model. The Hidden Markov model is a probabilistic model of time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity dynamics, capturing within-session changes in functional connectivity and amplitude from fMRI scans during wakeful rest. The approach leverages information about individual time-vary amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction and has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalized medicine. 

The Hidden Markov-Fisher kernel approach accurately and reliably predicts traits from brain dynamics trained on neuroimaging data, preserving the structure of the underlying dynamics, ideal for combining generative and predictive models. This is crucial for studies with small sample sizes and heterogeneous training and test sets, such as fitting a model to healthy controls and testing on patients. The potential of the Hidden Mark-Fisher kernel is shown to leverage patterns of brain dynamics to predict traits in an fMRI dataset and simulated data. The approach is compared to kernels that ignore the structure of brain dynamics, a previously used method based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, and time-averaged functional connectivity methods. The Hidden Mark-Fisher kernel preserves mathematical structure, predicting individual traits from brain dynamics accurately and reliably. The approach focuses on models capturing within-session changes in functional connectivity and amplitude from fMRI scans during wakeful rest, parameters used to predict behavioral variables or traits. The Hidden Markov model is used, a probabilistic model of time-vary amplitude and functional connectivity dynamics, interpreting errors often not considered in predicting traits from neuroimaging features. The Hidden-Fisher kernel shows potential in predicting individual traits from patterns of brain dynamics accurately and reliably.
Leucine-rich kinase 2 (LRR2) variants associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and Crohn's disease lead to increased phosphorylation of its substrates. Recent studies have shown that perturbations in cellular homeostasis, including lysosomal damage, can increase LRR2 activity and localization to lysosomes, but the molecular mechanisms regulating LRR2 activity remain poorly defined. A targeted siRNA screen identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRR2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. Using imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes, it was demonstrated that Rab12 is recruited to damaged lysosomes, leading to local LRR2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation. PD-linked variants, including LRR2 R144G and VPS D620, lead to increased recruitment of LRR2 to the lysosome and elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10.

Enhanced recruitment of LRR2 to lysosomes may promote phosphorylation by increasing local concentration of LRR2 proximity to its substrates. Two PD-linked genetic variants, LRR2 R144G and VPS D620, associated with increased LRR2 kinase activity, had increased levels of LRR2 on lysosomes. Rab12 regulates L2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and the localization and activation of L2 on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress. The PD-linked pathogenic L2 variant R144G and VPS D620 increase L2 activity. There is a need to define how L2 is recruited to lysosomes upon damage and translate to L2 activation. Rab12 is identified as a regulator of L2 activity, regulating L2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 and mediating L2 activation in response to lysosomal damage.

Increased L2 kinase activity is observed in pathogenic-linked variants and sporadic PD patients, but mechanisms regulating L2 activation remain unclear. Rab12 is identified as a regulator of L2 activation, demonstrating a critical role in mediating L2-dependent phosphorylation in response to lysosomal damage. Rab12 promotes phosphorylation by recruiting L2 to lysosomes following lysosomal rupture. Pathogenic variants VPS D620 and L2 R1 result in increased levels of L2 and p73 Rab10 on lysosomes. The data delineate a conserved mechanism by which L2 activity is regulated basally and in response to lysosomal and genetic variants associated disease. The findings suggest a mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD variants, facilitates recruitment of L2 and phosphorylation of its substrates at the lysosome.
Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is crucial for cellular biology and cancer research. Current methods using fluorescent markers have improved the study of adherent cells, but non-adherent cells remain challenging. This study addressed this gap by combining a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI (CA)2 sensor, an automated image pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach enabled precise measurement of cell phase durations in non-adherent cells. The method was validated in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell characteristics, and tested the impact of cell-modulating drugs on NB4 cells. The cell analysis system is compatible with adherent cells, fully automated, and freely available, providing insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions.

Advanced imaging methods, such as time-lapse microscopy coupled with fluorescently tagged reporters, have shown promise detailing cell dynamics at single-cell level. The Fluorescent Ubiquination-based Cell Indicator (FUCCI) has been employed for this, demarcating cell phases through color-coding. Original time-lapse images composed of red and green channels detect mCherry and mVenus markers of the FUCCI indicator, qualitatively confirming the impact of CD inhibitors. Difference in cell progression of NB4 vs Kasumi1 cells was evident. Complete workflow explained in Box 1 and illustrated in Figure 5 allows researchers to follow single cells and manual annotation of cycle phases according to color of red and green images.

Image and data pipelines automatically perform processing, cell tracking, filtering incorrect tracks, cell phases identification, and characterization. Workflows rely on Fiji and R software widely used by imaging community. Scripts publicly available enable customization to specific requirements, streamlining cell analysis of cells expressing FUCCI indicator and accessible to researchers with basic programming knowledge. This presents valuable tool for advancing cancer research and development, enabling comprehensive automated cell analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells, analyzing thousands of cells per experimental condition.
The diversity of cognitive skills across primates remains a fascinating and controversial issue, with recent studies providing conflicting results regarding the contribution of social versus ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition. An interdisciplinary approach combining comparative neurosciences and behavioral ecology was used to investigate this issue. Brain imaging data from 16 primate species measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, involved in metacognition and working memory, and examined their relation to socio-ecological variables. The size of these prefront regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by three variables: body mass, daily distance traveled, and population density. Ecological constraints strongly influenced frontal pole and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex volumes, suggesting metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Frontal pole volume was more sensitive to social constraints than dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, in line with laboratory studies showing implication in complex social interactions. Data highlights the relative weight of social versus ecological constraints on evolution of prefront brain regions and associated cognitive operations in primates. The size of frontal pole and development of metacognitive skills is related to population density and daily distance, compatible with the ecological hypothesis. Working memory and planning are critical foraging in primates, especially when traveling long distances and dealing with complex navigation, in line with the global idea of ecological hypothesis. The dorso-lateral prefront cortex, used as a proxy for working memory and planning, showed a relation with daily distance and population, suggesting cognitive functions at play in this region are involved in foraging and social complexity.
An increase in mechanical loading, such as occurs during resistance exercise, induces radial growth of muscle fibers, which is an increase in cross-sectional area. Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils, but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of myofibrils, known as myofibril hypertrophy, and/or the number of myofibrils, known as myofillogenesis, is not known. To address this, a novel method for visualizing myofils with standard fluorescence microscope, fluorescence imaging of myofils with deconvolution, F-ID, was developed. Images from F-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, enabling pipelines for automated measurements of myofil size and number to be developed. After validating automated measurements, mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading were used to discover radial growth of muscle is largely mediated by myillogenesis. The automated measurements of myil CSA and number with F-ID were indistinguishable from manually obtained EM measurements. Validation of F-ID measurements determined radial growth of muscle in response to increased mechanical loading is mediated by myil hypertrophy and/or myilogenesis. Results established the automated program accurately measures myil size identified with F-ID. EM has been used to assess ultrastructural characteristics of skeletal muscle and numerous EM-based studies reported myil size measurements. F-ID images have high resolution and contrast, enabling pipelines for automated measurements of myil size and number to be developed. The development of the method provided insight into radial growth of muscle in response to increased mechanical loading, mediated by myil hypertrophy and/or myilogenesis, a fundamentally important question in the field of skeletal growth, addressed with two models. Vastus lateralis muscle biopsies from humans were examined before and after 7 weeks of progressive resistance exercise to address whether radial growth is mediated myil hypertrophy and/or myilogenesis. Collectively, outcomes offer insight into muscle growth and provide a time and cost-effective means to study it.
Researchers investigated the effects of three mutations in the SNAP25 protein, a key component of the neuronal SNARE complex, on synaptic vesicle exocytosis in the context of epileptic encephalopathy. The V48 and D166 mutations, located at the synaptotagmin-1 binding interface, and the I67 mutation, which destabilizes the SNARE complex, reduced synaptotagmin-dependent vesicle docking to SNARE-carrying liposomes and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and in mouse hippocampal neurons. The V48 and D166 mutations led to reduced readily releasable pool size due to increased spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic current release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased release probability, exhibiting gain-of-function features not seen in synaptagmin knockout neurons. The D166 mutation had a greater potency than V48 in increasing spontaneous association to partner SNAREs, resulting in unregulated membrane fusion. In contrast, the I67 mutant decreased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency and evoked excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes due to increased energy barrier height for fusion, while the readily releasable pool size remained unaffected. Overall, pathogenic SNAP25 mutations alter the energy landscape for priming and fusion. The preserved charge of evoked release in V48 and mild reduction in D166 may indicate compensatory gain-function aspects in addition to impaired synaptmin interaction. Missense mutations in the SNARE bundle increase the energy barrier for fusion and display inefficient rescue of neuronal survival. SNAP25 encephalopathy caused by single point mutations presents interdependent functional deficits that must be addressed for successful treatment. In vitro analysis confirmed increased spontaneous release and decreased evoked release by V48 and D166 and lowered synaptmin association to SNARE-protein liposomes. The findings highlight the role of the primary SNARE: synaptmin interface in vesicle priming and release clamping and demonstrate challenges in mechanism-based treatments due to multiple effects from single-point mutations. Synaptmin interaction may play a catalytic role in lowering energy levels during priming, affecting rates by transiently binding and structuring SNAP25 to assist SNARE complex formation, whereas SNAP mutants may prestructure the protein, bypassing the need for synaptmin.
A study analyzing data from 30 countries found a correlation between the proportion of women in a discipline and lower research quality evaluations and funding rates, affecting both men and women. The research utilized independent datasets spanning thousands of researchers, examining funding success rates and holistic quality scores. The findings indicate a strong correlation between the evaluated quality of a researcher's work and the gender balance of their discipline, with male and female researchers in female-dominated disciplines receiving lower evaluations. This correlation is robust across bibliometric differences and holds when accounting for researcher characteristics such as age, institution, and publishing patterns. Researchers in male-dominated disciplines have higher funding rates and quality scores than those in female-dominated disciplines, affecting both men and women. The study suggests that research from female-dominated disciplines is evaluated as lower quality than male-dominated, impacting everyone but affecting women more. Previous findings indicate that as a workforce feminizes, salaries decrease, and it is possible that feminization over time leads to lower evaluation of research quality in female-dominated disciplines.
Researchers have developed a strategy called P3 editing, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual guide RNA, enabling the design of molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs within living cells. This approach bridges the properties of electronic and natural circuits, processing information in a predictable manner, and has the potential to enhance the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing. By engineering the crRNA:trRNA interaction, various protein-protein interactions, as well as chemically induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate or inhibit editing in human cells. The P3 editing strategy is based on the dual-component gRNA of the native CRPR-Cas9 system but with the crRNA:trRNA dimerization domain replaced with protein-binding aptamers such MS2 and BoxB. This design mimics the functional molecules within the native CRPR-Cas system and allows for the conversion of molecular interactions into a genome output. The experiments demonstrate that P3 editing can be used to control genome editing via specific interactions between a pair of tagged domains and can be coupled with ADAR-based sensors to control editing based on RNA expression. This expands the range of inputs that can be used to drive-specific editing in synthetic circuits and facilitates the design of control structures, particularly as the range of cellular activities that can be programmed by genome editing is expanding. P3 editing incorporates outputs from ADAR sensors, allowing specific RNAs to induce genome edits within a larger circuit. The efficiency and specificity of P3 editing can be improved by engineering the crRNA-MS/Box-pacrRNA design. Genome editing is a powerful component of synthetic circuits for modulating gene expression or stably recording information to DNA, but programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions remains challenging. The P3 editing strategy addresses this challenge, enabling the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs, and has the potential to facilitate the use of CRPR-based genome editing in synthetic circuits in living cells.
The KCNQ1/KC1 channel complex in cardiomyocytes mediates the slow-rectifier current, which is crucial for the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. Mutations in this channel cause long QT syndrome, characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are potent activators of KCN1 channels and increase the slow-rectifier current by binding to two sites, one in the voltage sensor and one in the pore, shifting voltage dependence and increasing maximal conductance. However, the mechanism by which polyunsaturated fatty acids increase maximal conductance is poorly understood. Research suggests the selectivity filter in KCN1 is unstable, contributing to low open probability, and polyunsaturated fatty acids increase maximal conductance by stabilizing the selectivity filter in an open state. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly omega-3, have a protective effect on sudden death and increase slow-rectifier currents through a dual mechanism, shifting voltage dependence and increasing conductance. Loss-of-function mutations in KCN1/KC1 are associated with long QT syndrome, reducing channel current and prolonging ventricular action potential. Increasing KCN1/K1 activity could restore physiological QT duration. KCN1 has a tetrameric structure of four α-subunits, and polyunsaturated acids favor the conductive conformation of the selectivity filter, promoting interactions between residues and stabilizing the pore.
Vitamin B6 deficiency has been linked to cognitive impairment in human brain disorders for decades, yet the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood and whether vitamin B supplementation improves cognition is unclear. Pyridoxal 5-phosphate phosphatase (PDX), an enzyme controlling levels of pyridal 5-phosphate (PL), the co-enzymatically active form of vitamin B6, may represent an alternative therapeutic point into vitamin B-associated pathologies. Researchers identified a PDX and age-dependent decline of PL levels in the murine hippocampus, providing a rationale for the development of PDX inhibitors. Using small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, 7,8-dihydroflavone (7,8-DHF) was discovered as a direct and potent PDX inhibitor. 7,8HF binds and reversibly inhibits PDX with low micromolar affinity and submicromolar potency. In hippocampal neurons, 7,8HF increases PL in a PDX-dependent manner, validating PDX as a druggable target. The expression of PDX is substantially upregulated in hippocampi of middle-aged mice, suggesting vitamin B supplementation alone may not suffice to elevate intracellular PL levels under conditions where PL-degrading phosphatase is hyperactive. The discovery of 7,8HF as a direct PDX inhibitor indicates flavone modulates vitamin B-dependent processes, suggesting PDX could be explored as pharmacological entry into brain disorders. PL deficiency has been associated with brain disorders, yet causal links remain unclear, aside from vitamin B administration, pharmacological strategies to elevate intracellular PL are lacking. The identification of 7,8HF as a PDX inhibitor offers mechanistic insights into controversy surrounding 7,8HF effects in the brain. Vitamin B is essential micronutrient playing a role in the nervous system, vitamin B status affecting cognitive function at any age. The molecular mechanisms linking B to pathologies are insufficiently understood and whether B supplementation improves cognition is unclear. Researchers found 7,8HF increases PL levels in hippocal neurons, validating PDX as a target to control intracellular PL levels in the brain, providing novel insights into the controversy surrounding 7,8HF effects in the brain.
Organogenesis requires the proper production and positioning of diverse cell types, but the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip cells (DTCs), which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGPs; Z1 and Z4). The polarity of Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins (WN-1, WN-2, and EGL-20) with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, WN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while WN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4 respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with polarity of Z, Ds from Z1 frequently migrate to the posterior side. The mis-positioning of Ds in the gonad due to the reversal of Z leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was observed in cki-1 (RNAi) animals producing ectopic Ds. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of Ds to establish a mirror-symmetric organ. The SGP polarity is not affected in quintuple Wnt mutants, suggesting that Wnts may not be required for SGP. Ds function as niche cells for germline cells, inhibiting entry into meiosis by expressing Notch ligand LAG-2. In lin-17; egl20 cwn2 animals, both Z1 and Z show HL polarity disrupting mirror symmetry, with Ds from Z frequently migrating posteriorly. The ectopic positions of Ds in the center of the gonad cause mis-migration. WN1 induces HL polarity for Z1 and Z, while WN2 induces the opposite, LH for Z and HL for Z. EGL20 inhibits polarization of both Z and Z. The distinct responses of Z and Z to WN2 are key for their opposite orientation and mirror-symmetric gonadogenesis. The development of C. elegans involves cells polarized in the anterior-posterior orientation and divide asymmetrically producing distinct cells. In the gonad, at L1 stage, somatic gonadal precursor cells Z and Z have LH and HL polarity, creating mirror-symmetric lineages producing Ds from distal daughters. The mirror-symmetric polarity is established by the redundant functions of LIN17 and Wnt proteins.
Researchers have been exploring the concept of multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance, where resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. A key question remains about the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable, specifically whether mutants that provide resistance to a given drug suffer similar tradeoffs. To address this, experiments were performed utilizing lineage-tracking to capture a spectrum of mutations that give yeast a fitness advantage in fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. The study quantified fitness tradeoffs for 774 evolved mutants across 12 environments, grouping them into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs, implying each affects fitness through different mechanisms. Some mutants resist single drugs but not their combination, while others to the same gene have different tradeoffs, demonstrating the difficulty in relying on consistent tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. The findings suggest hundreds of adaptive mutations can be reduced to a few groups with characteristic tradeoffs, empowering multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. By grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar mechanisms, the work guides efforts to map phenotypic effects of mutation. A collection of 774 yeast lineages discovered at least 6 distinct groups with characteristic fitness tradeoffs across 12 environments. The goal was to count different types of adaptive mutation, each defined by unique tradeoffs, in a population of drug-resistant yeast. Mutations providing strongest advantage often dominate evolution, but the primary goal was to explore high-throughput evolutionary approach to enumerate classes of resistant mutants and tradeoffs. Laboratory evolutions were performed in FLU concentrations, sometimes with a second drug, enhancing diversity of resistant mutants. Lineages have no fitness in conditions without drugs, underrepresented in experiments lacking FLU. Most mutations provide resistance not beneficial in environments without drugs, shown in 100 independent lineages. Grouping mutants with similar tradeoffs reduces unique drug-resistant from 774 to a manageable panel for investigating molecular mechanisms. Multiple classes with tradeoffs suggest implementing multidrug regimens may not be straightforward, requiring large collection of barcoded mutants and ability to measure fitness relative to reference in multiple environments.
The central tendency, or contraction bias, is a phenomenon where judgment of the magnitude of items in working memory appears to be biased toward the average of past observations. This is assumed to be an optimal strategy by the brain and thought of as an expression of the brain's ability to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. Recent results from an auditory comparison task in rats suggest both central and recency biases may be more related than previously thought. When the posterior parietal cortex was silenced, both short-term and contraction biases were reduced. A proposed model of the circuit involved in generating behavior shows volatile working memory susceptible to shifting past experience, producing short-term history biases, naturally leading to contraction. Errors at the level of individual trials are sampled from the full distribution of stimuli, not due to a gradual shift of memory toward the sensory distribution's mean. These results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings, providing predictions across different distributions, timings, and delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative memory areas. Validation of the model was performed through a set of human psychophysics experiments on an auditory parametric working memory task.

Repeatedly observed across species and modalities, central tendency or contraction bias reflects a shift of working memory toward the mean of sensory history. A key feature emerging from studies is contraction, where averaged performance is as memory of the first stimulus progressively shifts toward the center of a prior distribution built from past history. Additionally, biases toward most recent stimuli have been documented. Contraction emerges as a statistical effect of errors in working memory due to persisting stimuli in preceding trials. Integration of persisting memory competes with the current stimulus, giving rise to short-term effects. Recent findings in auditory comparison tasks in rats and humans show performance depends on stimuli in preceding trials, similar to previous findings in human paradigms. Recent evidence challenges this picture, discovering posterior pariet cortex plays a key role modulating contraction, when optogenetically inactivated, contraction is attenuated. The study of parametric working memory task found rat posterior pariet cortex plays key role in modulating bias, when region silenced, contraction is reduced. The proposed model shows volatile memory susceptible to shifting past experience, producing short-term history, naturally leading contraction, consistent with broad set of findings, providing predictions, and neuronal dynamics in putative memory areas, validated through human psychophysics experiments on auditory parametric memory task.
Researchers have identified the PDZIM domain-containing protein 2 (PDL2) as a tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer, contributing to chemotherapy and immunotherapy resistance, suggesting a potential target for lung cancer therapy improvement. This study investigated PDL2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer using human samples and an endogenous mouse cancer model. The therapeutic efficacy, mechanism, and safety of systemically administered PDL2 expression plasmids encapsulated in nanoparticles (nanoPIM) and its combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs were examined. Analysis revealed PDL2 repression in lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigen alteration. NanoPIM showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and improved efficacy of anti-PD and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete remission in most mice and substantial reduction in the remaining by triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoIM increased major histocompatibility complex I expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance induction and survival genes, enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning cold tumors hot and sensitive to IC and vulnerable to chemotherapeutic and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

Systemic administration of nanoIM reversed phenotypes caused by P2 repression, inducing complete remission in most mice without increasing toxicity when combined with antiD and chemother drugs. These findings provide a basis to combine IC and chemother drugs with P2-targeted therapy for lung and other cancers. Preclinical data established a novel treatment of nanoIM, antiD, and chemother drugs inducing complete remission in most animals with a high safety profile. P2 repression has been linked to numerous human cancers, suggesting applicability to other cancers. P2 inhibits expression of cell survival and proliferation genes in tumor cells, contributing to chemoresistance, and nanoIM increased chemotherapy efficacy in the mouse model. Treatment with carboplatin and paclitaxel led to significant decrease in tumor number and burden. NanoIM-based therapies could be applicable to all tumors with P2 repression, regardless of mechanisms, and epigen therapy may treat about 26 of tumors with P2 epigen repression. About 58 of tumors harboring P2 LOH are not suitable to epigen therapies, although most have epigen alterations of the pdlim gene. The combination of nanoIM, antiD, and chemother drugs showed low toxicity, high specificity, antitumor activity, greatly improving the efficacy of antiD and chemother drugs with complete remission in most mice and substantial reduction in the remaining. These studies established a clinically applicable P2-based therapy with great efficacy for lung and possibly other cancers.
Animals have developed systems to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior to survive in challenging environments, but the mechanisms regulating this physiological evaluation are not fully understood. Researchers established a low-quality food assay and found that heat-killed E. coli, a low-sugar food, triggers the unfolded protein response (UPR) and immune response, encouraging animals to avoid low-quality food. The system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPR (IRE1/XBP1)-innate immunity (PMK1/p38 MAPK) axis, particularly its neuronal function, regulating feeding behaviors. Animals can adapt to low-quality environments through sugar supplementation, inhibiting the UPR-PM1 regulated response by increasing vitamin biosynthesis. The study reveals the role of the cellular stress pathway as a physiological evaluation system assessing nutritional deficiencies, enhancing survival. Using the low-quality assay, researchers elucidated the mechanism by which the stress pathway operates, assessing D-glucose deficiency and vitamin content through UPR-innate immunity axis. The study identified a physiological mechanism recognizing food quality through UPR-IRE1/XBP1-innate PM1/p38 MAPK regulated stress in neurons dictating avoidance behaviors. This slow evaluation is an adaptation detecting nutrition deficiencies not detected by the sensory system. The innate pathway, mediated by PM1/p38 MAPK, plays a role evaluating unfavorable sources, helping animals avoid environments. Researchers investigated nutrients/metabolites sensed through XBP1-PM1 axis for quality evaluation, implying animals assess quality through UPR and immune pathways. Activation of UPR by HK-E. coli was examined, dependent on UPR branches including IRE1, PERK/ATF4, and ATF6. The study found UPR and innate pathways play a role in evaluating low-quality food, with supplementation inhibiting UPR-PM response by increasing biosynthesis, allowing adaptation to low environments.
Carbohydrates play crucial roles in various biological processes, but their direct modulation of important targets, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), remains largely unknown. Researchers employed P2Y purinoceptor 14 (P2Y14), a target for inflammation and immune responses, to uncover sugar nucleotide activation of GPCs. Integrating molecular dynamics with functional studies identified the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugar site on P2Y14, revealing UDP-glucose activates the receptor by bridging transmembrane helices 2 and 7. A conserved salt-bridging chain (K2.60-D2.64-K7.35-E7.36) distinguishes UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-acetylglucosamine. This chain is a conserved motif for sugar binding in both P2Y14 and P2 purinoceptor 12 (P2Y12). Three sugar nucleotides were designed as agonists for P2Y12, expanding understanding of purinergic receptors and providing insights for carbohydrate drug development for GPCs.

P2Y14 represents a model for carbohydrate modulation of GPCs, responding to nucleotides, including adenosine diphosphate and UDP. It is potently activated by UDP and UDP-sars, distinct from other purinoceptors. The UDP-sugar site arrangements between PY14 and sugar transferases determine sugar selectivity. A conserved carbohydrate motif in P2Y12 and PY14 extends understanding of how carbohydrates regulate GPCs. Interactions between sugar moieties of agonists with TM7 (E7.36) determine UDP-sugar potencies. The carbohydrate site is not fully characterized for GPCs, except P2, and no other P2-like family members are directly activated by carbohydrates.

Molecular models of sugar nucleides provide details for activation and recognition, inspiring carbohydrate development for Gs. Other carbohydrate motifs in Gs are unknown, and further investigations will add concepts and physiological understanding to the field. The ligand models of UDP-sars were quantitatively characterized to identify the sugar site on P2, unveiling a conserved sugar motif in P2 and P2. Multiple carbohydrates were designed and validated as agonists targeting the motif. P2 and P2 employed a conserved sugar-binding motif, expanding understanding activation of purin receptors and providing insights for G development.
Researchers investigated the role of the glial niche in regulating the behavior of neural stem cells, known as Drosophila neural stem cells or neuroblasts (NBs), and found that ferritin produced by glial cells cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for energy production, essential for self-renewal and proliferation. The knockdown of glial ferritin genes causes energy shortage in NBs via downregulating aconase activity and NAD+ level, leading to low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei. Glial ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression, and its production is affected by the status of NBs, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. The study demonstrates that glial cells are indispensable to maintain self-renew of NBs, unveiling a novel role of the glial niche during brain development. To investigate the role of iron homeostasis in Drosila CNS, genes involved in iron transport, storage, and regulation in NB, neurons, and glial cells were knocked down, and only glial knockdown of ferritin-related genes led to NB loss and defective brain development. In a proliferative state, NBs receive iron from glial cells via ferritin to fulfill energy requirements for proliferation and self-renew. The bicellular iron homeost mechanism makes glial cells the main pool for ferritin production, relieving NB from the need to produce ferritin and transferring potential iron-induced oxidative stress to glial cells. Glial cells clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets ensuring normal NB function during development. When normal NBs are converted into immortal, highly proliferative tumor NBs, they need more nutrients including iron. The size of tumors was decreased in larval brains lacking glial ferritin, suggesting glial ferritin is required for tumor development, highlighting a potential target for treatment. Decreasing iron levels by adding iron chelator B in Drosila food verified iron involvement in tumor suppression by blocking glial ferritin. Iron is vital for living organisms participating in biological processes including mitochondrial transport and respiration supporting ATP production for cellular activities. Glial cells regulate self-renew and differentiation of NBs through bicellular iron homeostasis, essential for brain development and tumor suppression.
Researchers investigated the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US, analyzing pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple cause death data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Nationally in 2020, cancer mortality rose only 3% over pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to ~13,600 excess deaths. Mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers, such as breast, colorectal and hematological, at 2-7%, than cancers with poor survival rates, such as lung and pancreatic, at 0-1%. In comparison, substantial elevation in deaths from diabetes was 37% and Alzheimer's 19%. Simulated expected mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates, life expectancy, population size, and mean age of individuals with condition found observed differences primarily explained by differences in life expectancy, with risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting risk of death from COVID-19. Detailed mortality study considered six cancer types and found modest elevation in cancer mortality during COVID-19 pandemic in US. Results demonstrate importance of considering multiple-cause death records to reflect changes in coding practices associated with emergence of new pathogen. Diabetes and Alzheimer's used as controls, as they are COVID-19 risk factors, illustrating associations between chronic conditions and COVID-19 in population-level mortality, with diabetes providing useful comparator for cancer due to similar mean age-at-death and few living in nursing homes. Two main factors drive cancer patterns during COVID-19, population size and age with cancer, and life expectancy under diagnosis, operating irrespective of true relationship between COVID19 severity and cancer, also applying to mortality from chronic conditions like diabetes or Alzheimer's.
Researchers have investigated the role of the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loops, which are RNA-DNA duplexes joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA, from eukaryotic genomes. The Smc5/6 complex, a regulator of chromosome architecture, plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loop structures formed during transcription. Yeast mutants defective in Sm5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show strong interactions and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA structures in chromosomes. The Sm5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA structures in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by RNase H2 enzyme. Results reveal a crucial role for Sm/Smc6 in removal of toxic R-loops at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. The Sm5/6 complex binds to RNA-DNA structures during active transcription and telere regulation and promotes removal via RNase2 activity. The Sm5/6 is involved in repair of unscheduled R-loops generated by diverse genomic transactions and binds to R-loops during transcription, promoting RNase2 degradation. Defects in RNase and Sm5/6 lead to accumulation of R-loops at highly transcribed genes, telomeres, and DNA forks. RNase1 and RN2 remove R-loops, but RN2 acts throughout the cell cycle. Sm5/6 contributes to RNase-dependent removal of RNA-DNA hybrids, substantial but not as extensive as RNase enzymes. The Sm5/6 acts at two levels, within and between pathways, in response to R-loop formation, contributing to RNase-dependent removal of RNA-DNA hybrids. The Sm5/6 complex plays a direct and active role in removal of R-loops from eukotic chromosomes, binding to RNA-DNA and promoting RNase2 degradation. Accumulation of R-loops in yeast defective Sm5/6 and RNase can be linked to severe growth defects. R-loops are observed at highly transcribed genes, telomeres, and DNA forks, with Sm5/6 and RN2 involved in their removal. The Sm5/6 complex has a crucial role in maintaining genome stability by removing toxic R-loops.
Preserved communication abilities promote healthy ageing, and age-typical loss of sensory acuity might be compensated by an individual's preserved attentional neural filtering. A study of 105 ageing individuals, aged 39-82, investigated whether this compensatory brain-behaviour link is longitudinally stable and can predict individual change in listening behaviour. Despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity, listening-task performance proved stable over two years. Neural filtering and behaviour were correlated within each separate time point, but longitudinally, results raise caution on attention-guided neural metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour. Neither neural filtering at the first time point nor its two-year change could predict individual two-year behavioural change under a combination of modelling strategies.

The study aimed to replicate key results and test whether the observed between-subject brain-behaviour relationship would hold across time, expecting an individual's neural ability to impact listening performance independently of age or hearing status. However, no evidence was found for a predictive role of neural filtering despite brain-behaviour links within each time point. Analysis characterised hearing acuity, neural, filtering, and listening change across the middle to older lifespan, and longitudinal change from timepoint one to timepoint two. Linear mixed models tested cross-sectional effects of age and longitudinal changes with time, and each measure's test-retest reliability was quantified as T1-T2 Pearson correlation.

Since interindividual differences in neural filtering were independent of age and hearing, no systematic change was expected. The study tested longitudinal stability of the observed age and hearing-independent effect on accuracy and speed. Behavioural outcome involves orchestration of perceptual and cognitive processes, focusing on one neurobiological implementation of auditory filter to explain interindividual differences in listening and lifespan. Results showed individual listening behaviour and neural ability follow independent developmental trajectories, electroencephalographic and behavioural data. Expected decline in hearing-derived acuity occurred, but listening performance remained stable over two years. Neural and behaviour correlated within timepoints but not longitudinally, cautioning against using attention-guided metrics to predict listening trajectories. Neither initial nor change in neural predicted two-year change in listening, suggesting a complex relationship between brain and behaviour in ageing individuals.
The perception of taste and flavor, a combination of taste, smell, and chemesthesis, referred to as chemosensation, enables animals to find high-value foods and avoid toxins. Humans have learned to use unpalatable and toxic substances as medicines, yet the importance of chemensation in this process is poorly understood. Researchers generated tasting-panel data for botanical drugs and applied phylogenetic generalized mixed models to test whether intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities, as well as particular tastes and flavors, can predict ancient Graeco-Roman drug use. Chemosensation was found to be strongly predictive of therapeutic use, with botanicals having high therapeutic versatility having simple yet intense tastes and 21 of 22 chemosensory qualities predicting at least one therapeutic use. In addition to bitter-tasting medicines, starchy, musky, sweet, and soapy drugs were associated with versatility. Ancient Greece and Rome believed illness arose from imbalance in bodily fluids or humors, yet the study suggests uses of drugs were based on observed effects consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste pharmacology. Researchers hypothesize chemensation and physiological effects mediated by chemesthesis and taste pharmacology explain the diversity of therapeutic uses of botanicals in ancient times. If tastes and flavors, as determined by a modern-day panel, predict uses recorded in ancient texts, this provides insight into chemensation guiding behavior in prehistoric times and conditioned expectations in humoral theory. The theory of humors was the principal concept of Western medicine until the Industrial Age, but despite being discredited, practices may have a basis in taste and flavor perception of botanicals linking humoral to modern medicine. The study demonstrates the power of phylogenetic methods applied to human behavior and assessment of plant properties, showing chemosensory perception connects ancient knowledge with modern science despite fundamentally different aetiologies in GraecoRoman times. Researchers tested perceived taste and flavor qualities, intensity, and complexity to predict recorded uses accounting for confounding effects of shared uses and chemosensory stimuli from closely related species. The study found that chemosensation is strongly predictive of therapeutic use, with botanicals having high versatility having simple yet intense tastes and flavors.
Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae, including non-typhoidal Salmonella, Escheria coli, and Citrobacter, are associated with gastrointestinal bleeding and bacteremia, and are a leading cause of death from sepsis in individuals with inflammatory diseases. These bacteria are prone to entering the bloodstream, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Research has found that clinical isolates of these bacteria are rapidly attracted to human serum, with femtoliter volumes sufficient to induce attraction through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum recognized by the chemoreceptor Tsr. The crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine reveal a conserved amino acid recognition motif shared among Tsr orthologs. Tsr is widely conserved among Enterobacteraceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. Enterobacteriaceae use serum as a source of nutrients for growth, with chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr providing a competitive advantage for migration into hemorrhagic lesions. The bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization, and consumption of serum is termed 'bacterial vampirism', which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteraceae for bloodstream infections. Chemotaxis experiments show that while Tsr is not the only chemoreceptor involved in taxis to serum, it plays an important role through chemoaction to the high concentration of L-ser within serum. Attraction to serum is conserved across diverse Salmonella serovars, suggesting serum and L-ser present could be a source of nutrients during infection. L-ser functions as a molecular cue directing Salmonella toward serum, but other nutrients provide major growth advantages. Structural studies reveal specific recognition of L-ser by Tsr, with all strains sharing behavior of rapid taxis toward serum from different animals, including human, horse, and pig. An enterohorrhagic model shows chemaxis and Tsr can mediate bloodstream entry, with serum taxis occurring through cooperative action of multiple chemoreceptors perceiving chemoattract stimuli, including Tsr recognition of L. The bacterial response to serum is robust, with the motile population reorganizing within 1-2 minutes to be biased toward the serum source.
Researchers have identified a conserved male germ cell expression program that spans over 600 million years of evolution, providing insight into the molecular basis of human infertility. The average metazo male germ cell requires the expression of approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes, with a third defining a scaffold of deeply conserved genes retained throughout evolution. This scaffold contains 79 functional associations between 104 gene regulators representing a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazo spermatogenesis. By interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male cell identity, 161 unknown spermatogenesis genes and three potential causes of human infertility were uncovered. The study analyzed the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species, revealing the conserved origin of metazo male cells at the molecular level. Despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ, deeply conserved genes remain central in the male cell transcriptome of evolutionarily distant species. The male cell transcriptome has an evolutionary origin tempered by the expression of younger genes at later stages, with a core program spanning over 600 million years of evolution. This expands previous observations in the mammalian lineage, suggesting the functional basis of metazo male cell relies on an evolutionarily conserved genetic program providing insight into spermatogenesis and infertility. An interdisciplinary platform combining four approaches was devised to test this hypothesis, leading to the identification of previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and potential causes of human infertility. The findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on reproductive disease, establishing a cross-species analytical pipeline for other cell types and pathologies. The study proposes the transcriptional identity of metan male cells is built around a small network of deeply conserved interactions with overarching impact, with the majority of protein-coding genes being deeply conserved. The results provide insight into the conserved molecular basis of metan spermatogenesis and human infertility, highlighting the significance of evolutionary history in reproductive disease.
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model organism for studying flagellate motility, employs synchronous breast-like flagellar beating to swim and modulates beating amplitudes differentially to steer, which hinges on inherent flagellar asymmetries and coordinated synchronous beating. The synchrony of beating is supported by a mechanical connection between flagella, but how flagellar asymmetries persist in synchrony remains elusive. To elucidate the roles of each flagellum in synchronous beating, experiments, computations, and modeling were combined. A non-invasive technique was used to selectively load each flagell, showing that coordinated beating responds to load on the cis flagell and asymmetry derives from unilateral coupling between flagella. Results highlight distinct roles for each flagell in coordination, with implications for biflagellates' behaviors. Dynamic modulation of flagellar during synchronous beating is the basis of C. reinhardt's tacticity, with calcium speculated to facilitate modulation, involved in switching beating modes. The synchronization of flagellar beating with external flow is referred to as 'flow entrainment', which occurs for both flagella simultaneously. Observations prove flagella have differential roles, implying flagella coupled to external flow through cis. A reduced stochastic model represents selective hydrodynamic and flagellar dominance in coordinated beating, illustrating flagellar dominance and selective loading effects. Monte-Carlo simulations clarify interplay between flows and flagella, reproducing experimental observations. Flagella adopt kinematics of cis flag when connected and beating synchronously, leading to the assumption of differential roles. Testing this hypothesis, oscillatory flows applied from an angle exert loads on one flag, illustrating flag dominance and loading effects on coordinated beating. The model expresses experimental measurements as a function of flagellar parameters, illustrating flag dominance and loading effects. Overall, findings elucidate mechanisms of flagellar coordination and implications for motility.
Intermittent fasting has been shown to have metabolic benefits, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Research has found that intermittent fasting promotes the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22) by type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and subsequent beiging of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3 increased beiging of white adipose tissue in diet-induced obese mice, while exogenous IL22 significantly increased beig of subcutaneous adipose tissue. Deficiency of IL22 receptor (IL-22R) attenuated beig induced by intermittent fasting. Single-cell sequencing of intestinal immune cells revealed that intermittent increased aryl hydrocarbon signaling in ILCs and analysis of cell-ligand interactions indicated that intermittent may stimulate the interaction of ILCs with dendritic cells and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILCs in beig of white adipose tissue, suggesting ILC/IL22/IL-22 axis contributes to the metabolic benefits of intermittent fasting. Alternate day fasting promoted secretion of IL22 by ILCs and adoptive transfer of intestinal ILCs increased thermogenesis in diet-induced obesity mice. Exogenous IL22 induced beig of white adipose tissue. Intermittent fasting promotes adipose beig through intestinal ILC-IL22-IL-22 axis. Deficiency of IL22 receptor attenuated beig of adipose tissue induced by fasting. IntestinalLC-IL-22-IL-22 axis is actively involved in regulation of adipose beig, revealing a novel pathway in dialog between gut and adipose tissue. IntestinalLCs are critical for beig white adipose induced by fasting. Intermitt fasting stimulates IL22 secretion by intestinal ILC in lean mice, obese mice, and mice with metabolic dysfunction. Observations indicate IL22 mediates effect of ILC on beig white adipocytes. Single-cell sequencing isolated from siLP of mice fed NCD, HFD, or HFD were subjected to explore mechanism by which fasting promotes IL22 secretion by ILC.
Researchers investigated defensive behaviors in male and female C57/6J mice using a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm, pairing footshock with a compound stimulus consisting of tone and white noise to examine associative and non-associative mechanisms. The paired group exhibited robust freezing during tone and explosive jumping during white noise, whereas unpaired and reverse groups showed less freezing and minimal jumping. Following conditioning, tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group, shifting to a combination of freezing and darting, while unpaired groups displayed defensive rattling and minimal freezing. The reverse group did not jump to white noise and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction, indicating non-associative factors promote responsiveness but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity expression. The study used a modified Pavian conditioning paradigm to elicit both freezing and flight behaviors in response to conditioned stimuli, addressing the need to elucidate associative and non-associative elements of Pavian fear conditioning that influence defensive behavior. Freezing to tone and activity to white noise were higher in the paired group compared to unpaired, highlighting the impact of stimulus-shock contingency on defensive responses. Sensitization and salience are known to intensify freezing responses to auditory stimuli and mice show increased reactivity after stress. The findings demonstrate that associative and non-associative factors combine to produce distinct transitions between freezing and flight during conditioning. The study observed distinct ethograms for paired and unpaired groups in response to the compound stimulus, with freezing and activity significantly higher in the paired group, indicating the importance of associative factors in threat imminence. Other defensive responses like escape and darting are less often measured within conditioning, limiting insight into response dynamics. The modified paradigm allows for a continuum of consistent defensive responses during stimulus presentation, with behaviors like darting and rattling occurring due to non-associative properties, and transitions between freezing and jumping present when associative factors signal threat.
Insects navigate their environment by tracking their orientation, which is encoded as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding is an evolutionary coincidence or offers a functional advantage. To address this, researchers established the basic requirements for direction encoding and found it can be performed by many circuits with different activity patterns. The sinusoidal pattern is the most noise-resilient, but only when coupled with sinusoidal connectivity between neurons. This predicted pattern was compared with anatomical data from locust and fruit fly head circuits, showing agreement with experimental evidence. The circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the insect's genetic program but can develop during development. The eight-column organisation of head circuits across multiple species is not a chance but explained by evolutionary principles. Electrophysiological and calcium studies have shown neural encoding of head direction in insects has a sinus-shaped activation pattern. Heading circuits have been studied with models ranging from simplified networks to sophisticated models constrained by biological data. Previous work argued sinusoidal encoding facilitates vector addition, but this is not the only reason as other circuits enable easy addition. The predicted circuit was compared with locust and fruit fly data using network analysis, showing strong agreement. A Heian learning rule is sufficient for developing the circuit.
Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain, with familial cases often caused by mutations in PTEN-induced kinase 1 and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CISD, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulf-binding protein, is a target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination and has been found to have a heightened propensity to form dimers in Pink1 mutant and dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers covalently linked by a disulf bridge, which prevents CISD from coordinating the iron-sulf cofactor. Overexpressing Cisd, the Drosophila ortholog of CISD, and a mutant cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulf cluster in Drosila, resulted in reduced climbing ability and lifespan, which was more pronounced with mutant cisd and aggravated in Pink1 flies. Complete loss of cisd, however, rescued detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. The results suggest cisd, probably iron-depleted cisd, operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology, implicating CIS1 as a potential therapeutic target. 

Mitochondrial iron-sulf cluster protein cisd is downstream of pathophysiological cascade initiated by Pink and Prkn loss of function in flies and humans, shedding light on PD pathiology and implicating CIS1 as therapeutic protein. Investigation revealed dopaminergic neurons from familial PD patients with P1 mutations and Pink mutant flies exhibit increased levels of slower-migrating CISD/cisd on immunoblots. Based on CISD involvement in mitochondrial bioenerics, quality control, iron metabolism, and defense against oxidative distress, all hallmarks of PD, CISD role in PD was investigated using fly and mammalian systems. CISD particularly iron-depleted form was identified as mediator of pathology induced by loss of Pink and Prkn function. Immunoblot revealed increased dimer formation and CIS1 multimer under conditions, concluding increased dimer in P1 mutant represents apoCIS1, devoid of iron-sulf cluster caused by changes in homeostasis. Cisd overexpression was neurotoxic, disrupted morphology, led accumulation phospho-ubiqu blocking mitagy, defective mitochondria. Study suggests role in redox imbalance, iron dysregulation implicating iron-depleted CIS1, proposing distinct mechanisms toxic effects in PD.
Researchers investigated the role of the virulence protein SAP54, produced by parasitic phytoplasmas, in attracting leafhopper vectors and found that it induces leaf-like flowers in phytopma-infected plants. However, they discovered that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction, suggesting a response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, phytopma effector alongside leafhopper females discourages further colonization. SAP54 suppresses biotic stress pathways in leaves exposed to males, and the host MADS transcription factor vegetative phase (VP) emerges as key in female preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP promoting degradation of VP. This preference extends to colonization of male-exposed svp mutant plants over those not exposed to males. The study underscores the dual role of phytopma effector SAP54 in host alteration and vector attraction, integral to phytopma life cycle, and clarifies how SAP targets VP to heighten vulnerability to leafhopper males, facilitating female attraction and plant colonization. SAP acts as a molecular'matchmaker', helping male leafhoppers locate mates by degrading VP-containing leaves, providing insights into the reach of single genes in phenotypes and avenues for understanding transcription factors regulating plant processes intersecting with plant-insect interactions.

The study expands understanding of insect-specific factors targeted by parasites, uncovering a mechanism where phytopma effector SAP targets conserved regulator VP to attract female vectors to produce progeny on plants exposed to leafhopper males. Female leafoppers prefer SAP and svp mutant plants in the presence of males, underscoring a sophisticated regulatory effect of VP on plant responses to herbivores. Plants can modify volatile production and SAP promotes fecity of the AYB phytopma leafhopper vector. Females feed and lay eggs, while males only feed, and plants induce different defense responses to feeding and laying. SAP plants exposed to males display downregulation of biotic responses, identifying MADS transcription factor SVP essential for female preference to male-exposed SAP plants. Leafopper females exhibit preference for reproducing on svp mutant plants, contingent on the presence of males, aligning with SAP mediating degradation of VP in leaves.

Phytoplas rely on leafoppers for acquisition and transmission, and SAP likely promotes abundance of phytopma-carrying vectors, facilitating transmission. This illustrates a bacterial gene extending influence beyond primary host to modulate vector choice and behavior. The study provides insights into the long reach of single genes in phenotypes and avenues for understanding transcription factors regulating plant developmental processes intersecting plant-insect interactions, highlighting the dual role of phytopma effector SAP in host alteration and vector attraction, integral to phytop life cycle, and clarifying how SAP targets VP to heighten vulnerability to leafopper males, facilitating attraction and colonization.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic human pathogen, poses a significant threat to human health and is associated with a substantial socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments often fail, at least in part, because C. albicans can initiate a strong drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration. To better characterize this cytoprotective program at the molecular level, researchers used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage with distinct metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure, surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: one characterized by upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, rRNA machinery, and mitochondrial respiration, termed the Ribo-dominant state, and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses, termed Stress-domin. This bifcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment. The ribosome stress response is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival. Researchers used the DROP-seq system to explore phenotypic heterogeneity in the C. albicans response to antifungal, profiling transcriptomes of thousands of cells from populations that were untreated or exposed to antifungal compounds with a focus on FCZ across days. Studies of thousands of individual cells enriched understanding of community structure and population heterogeneity align with previous reports associating cell phase with expression of stress and metabolism genes. C. albicans response to antifungal compounds was investigated using fungistatic FCZ and fungicidal CSP. The mechanisms and implications of antifungal tolerance differ from bacterial resistance. The focus is on antifungal tolerance to FCZ, a well-known fungistatic drug. Previous studies characterized key aspects of drug tolerance in C. albicans. The nanoliter droplet-based assay enabled a detailed analysis of C. albicans in the absence and presence of antifungal over a period and was cost-effective with minimal issues. Results provide evidence the ribosome assembly stress response is activated in subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival.
The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits variation among species in the effectiveness of selection. In an ideal model, the population size determines both the minimum magnitude of the selection required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged and the amount of neutral diversity. Empirically, an effective population size is often estimated from the amount of putatively genetic diversity and assumed to capture a species effectiveness of selection. A potentially direct measure of the effectiveness of selection is the degree to which selection maintains preferred codons. However, past metrics comparing codon across species are confounded by among-species variation in GC content and amino acid composition. A new Codon Adaptation Index of Species, CA, based on Kullback-Leibler divergence, corrects both confounders and demonstrates the use of CA correlations as well the Effective Number of Codons to show the protein domains of highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher structural disorder. 

The Codon Adaptation Index, using information-theory-based Kull-Leib divergence, corrects for GC and amino acid composition to create a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species. Complete genome allows metrics to be calculated without data on polymorphism or mutation, selecting genes, and demographic history. Codon bias varies within a small range, a promising approach to measure proportion of sites at which codon adaptation is effective. Highly adapted species have a higher proportion of genes subject to selection on codon bias. Cod adaptation metrics directly quantify species in exquisess of adaptation than estimates of effective size based on polymorphism. CA and ENC estimated for more species without polymorphism or mutation data, tRNA copy numbers, only a complete genome. CA has the advantage of not being confounded with amino frequencies.

A new metric of species adaptedness at the codon level, capable of quantifying degrees of codon adaptation among vertebrates, was developed. Vertebrates chosen due to abundance of data and as a stringent case given past findings of limited evidence for codon adaptation. The degree of bias in synonymous codon usage driven by selective preference offers a direct way to assess effective selection at the molecular level. Conveniently, estimated from a single genome without polymorphism or mutation data. Codon Adaptation Index commonly used, estimated from single genome without polymorphism or mutation for species. The new Codon Adaptation Index of Species based on Kull-Leib divergence corrects for confounding factors and provides a direct measure of the effectiveness of selection at the molecular level in a given species.
Sepsis is a global health priority declared by the World Health Organization, causing millions of deaths worldwide, primarily due to dysregulated immune responses, highlighting the need for strategies to target inflammation. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate, ATP, released by inflamed host cells and bacteria in a strain and growth-dependent manner, is an important mediator of inflammation. Research investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP using Escheria coli, demonstrating that ATP release is dependent on ATPase within the bacterial inner membrane. Impaired integrity of the outer membrane contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of seps, local effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using transformed E. coli with arabin-inducible periplasmic apyrase, showing that abrogating bacterial release suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutroph counts and impaired survival. Bacterial ATP has systemic effects via transport in outer membrane vesicles, distributed throughout the body, upregulating genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially exacerbating seps severity.

E. coli, a frequent pathogen in abdominal seps, released the highest amount of ATP in a mouse model. ATP release is dependent on bacterial given no differences in counts were observed. Released ATP suppresses abdominal inflammatory responses and worsens survival in seps. ATP is metabolized in extracellular space, limiting action to immediate cellular vicinity. The role of ATP in non-colonized compartments remains to be determined. Seps-associated bacteria release ATP in growth and strain-specific manner, with E. coli releasing more cumulative ATP compared to E faecalis and aureus. Bacteria release ATP into extracellular space as a mechanism of protection from host defense, preceding host responses, shown in various bacteria including seps-associated E. coli, Klebsella pneumonia, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus.

The study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in seps pathogenesis. Bacterial ATP release is strain-specific and growth-dependent, with impaired membrane integrity contributing to release and death. Local effects of ATP analyzed in a mouse model show suppression of immune responses, reduced neutroph counts, and impaired survival. Systemic effects via outer membrane vesicles upregulate degranulation in neutils, exacerbating seps severity. The findings highlight the importance of targeting bacterial ATP in seps, as a potential therapeutic strategy to modulate inflammation and improve outcomes. Overall, the research demonstrates the critical role of bacterial ATP in seps pathogenesis, emphasizing the need for further investigation into its mechanisms and potential therapeutic applications.
Researchers investigated the relationship between psychotic experiences in children and the risk of psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders, considering the influence of genetic and environmental factors on cognitive functioning. A large-scale longitudinal study of 6,602 children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study was conducted, using linear models and structural equation modeling to estimate the effects of cognitive polygenic scores, familial socioeconomic status, and supportive environment on intelligence and psychotic experiences. The results showed that lower cognitive intelligence and higher psychotic experiences were associated with lower polygenic scores, lower socioeconomic status, and less supportive environments. Cognitive intelligence was found to mediate the effects of these factors on psychotic experiences, with supportive parenting and school environments having the strongest impact. The study highlights the influence of genetic and environmental factors on psychotic experiences through their effects on intelligence, suggesting policy implications for improving school and family environments and promoting economic development to enhance cognitive and mental health in children.

The study assessed the associations of cognitive polygenic scores, family socioeconomic status, and environment with children's intelligence and longitudinally measured psychotic experiences, employing statistical approaches to consider potential confounding. The mediating effect of intelligence on the relationship between genetic and environmental factors and psychotic experiences was tested. Linear models and structural equation modeling examined the longitudinal trajectories of genetic and environmental influences on psychotic experiences mediated by intelligence, investigating the role of cognitive within impacts of polygenic scores, socioeconomic status, neighborhood, and family environments. The results showed that higher polygenic scores of cognitive capacity correlated with higher intelligence and lower psychotic experiences were associated with lower polygenic scores and socioeconomic status. Gene-environment interactions on intelligence and psychotic experiences were also tested, adjusting for schizophrenia polygenic scores given the association with cognitive deficit in psychosis patients.

The study found that cognitive deficit may be a precursor to the onset of psychotic disorders, demonstrating the integrated effects of genetic and environmental factors on psychotic experiences through intelligence in 9-11-year-old children. The results indicate that lower cognitive intelligence and higher psychotic experiences are associated with lower polygenic scores for cognitive phenotypes, lower socioeconomic status, and less supportive environments. Specifically, cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on psychotic experiences, with supportive parenting and school showing the strongest impact. The study underscores the influence of genetic and environmental factors on psychotic through effects on intelligence, suggesting policy implications for improving environments to enhance cognitive and mental health in children. The findings have implications for improving school and family environments and promoting economic development to enhance cognitive and mental health, highlighting the importance of considering genetic and environmental factors in the development of psychotic experiences in children.
Researchers investigated the role of fibroblast growth factor 8 (F8) signaling in human cerebral organoids derived from induced pluripotent stem cells to understand its impact on neural identity and differentiation during early telencephalic development. F8 treatment increased cellular heterogeneity, resulting in distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic domains co-developing in multi-regional organoids. Within telencealic regions, F8 affected anteroposterior and dorsovent identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, impacting spontaneous neuronal activity. F8 modulated key regulators associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Transcriptomic analysis revealed F8-mediated induction of ventral telencephalic genes and upregulation of ventral genes, such as ASCL1, DLX2, and PBX, and downregulation of dorsal genes like EMX, NEU2, SOX, and LHX. F8 treatment led to altered regional identities in 3D organoids, developing multi-regional organoids with distinct brain domains. F8 modulated NR2 and other genes associated with brain disorders in FOX1+ telphalic cells, underscoring its role in fine-tuning neurodevelopment and pathogenic pathways. Findings highlighted F8-dependent regional identity and modulation of neurodevelopment disorder targets, including F8-NR1 axis. F8 guides developmental trajectories of brain cells along dorsoventral and anteroposterior telencephalic axes. The ability of F8 to modulate genes varied based on regional identity of exposed cells, resulting in co-presence of various domains in F8-treated organoids, including dorsal and ventral telencephalon and diencephalic mesphalic regions. Overall, F8 signaling is directly involved in regional patterning and cellular diversity in cerebral organoids, modulating genes associated with normal and pathological development.
Research on Drosophila larvae has shown that sleep and feeding patterns lack daily rhythms early in life, but as the animals mature, feeding becomes consolidated to the day and sleep to the night. The formation of a circuit connecting the central clock to arousal neurons, specifically the DN1-Dh44 circuit, initiates circadian sleep patterns and enables long-term memory. However, the cues that trigger the development of this circuit were unknown. This study identifies a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in Drosila larvae, finding that in the 2nd instar larval period, sleep and feeding are spread across the day, becoming organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar larval stage. Forcing mature animals to adopt immature feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit long-term memory. The development of the DN1-Dh circuit itself is influenced by the larval environment, with Dh44 neurons acting through glucose genes to drive the onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. Changes in energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circ circuits and behaviors. In adult Drosila, Dh44 neurons act as nutrient sensors to regulate food consumption and starvation-induced sleep suppression through glucose and amino acid sensing. The emergence of daily-wake patterns is regulated by developmental changes in energetic capacity, with Dh44 necessary for sensing larval environments. The DN1 clock connects to Dh arousal neurons driving consolidation of sleep in L3, promoting deeper sleep and long-term memory capabilities. The emergence of circadian-wake rhythms in Dila larvae is advantageous, enabling long memory at the L3 stage, but not before. Less mature larvae do not exhibit consolidated patterns, prompting the question of why rhythmic behaviors do not emerge earlier. The study demonstrates that larval Dh44 neurons act through metabolic genes to drive sleep-wake rhythms, indicating nutritional status drives sleep-wake development in Dila larvae. Overall, the findings suggest that changes in energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circ circuits and behaviors, with Dh44 neurons necessary for sensing larval environments and driving sleep-wake rhythms.
Researchers investigated the energetic benefits of collective movement in schools of giant danio fish, measuring both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic contributions to determine the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated movements. The results showed a concave upward metabolism-speed curve with a minimum metabolic cost at approximately 1 body length per second, indicating that fish in schools reduce total energy expenditure per tail beat by up to 56% compared to solitary fish. When swimming at maximum sustained speed, fish in schools had 44% higher aerobic performance and used 65% less anaerobic energy, lowering total energy expenditure and cost by up to 53, near the lowest recorded for aquatic organisms. Additionally, fish in schools recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. The anaerobic savings during high-speed swimming can improve peak and repeated performance, likely beneficial for evading predators, and underlie the prevalence of coordinated locomotion in fish. 

The study aimed to understand how group movement in high-drag aquatic medium can be more energy-efficient than individual movement, hypothesizing that fish in schools reduce the cost of high-speed locomotion relative to solitary movement, leading to reduced anaerobic costs and recovery time. Measuring aerobic and anaer energy used by schooling fish over 0.3-8 body lengths per second showed both solitary and schools have a concave upward metabolic rate-speed curve, with no difference at lower speeds. However, at 1 body length per second, schools consumed less energy than at slower speeds. The total energy expenditure curve of fish from minimum to critical speed has not been measured due to lack of accounting for substantial anaobic costs in high-speed locomotion. The findings demonstrate that fish schools reduce energy expenditure, increase aerobic performance, and lower recovery time, likely contributing to the prevalence of coordinated locomotion in fish.
Airway macrophages (AM) are the predominant immune cells in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection, making them a target for host-directed therapy. Macrophage effector functions are associated with cellular metabolism, but a knowledge gap remains in understanding metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct macrophage subpopulations, especially lung resident AM. Researchers examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) as a model of blood-derived macrophages in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL4 to model Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. Human macroages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFNγ upon stimulation. IFNγ significantly enhanced energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon stimulation, AM did not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM, which shifted to 'Warburg-like metabolism. IFNγ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. Directly comparing macroages, AM were more responsive to IFN priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. TN production was under the control of glycol in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycol-dependent upregulation of HLA and CD40, whereas IFN upregulated HLA and CD40 on AM independently of glycol. These data indicate human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN in a distinct manner from MDM, providing evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases. Plasticity of macrophage function requires metabolic reprogramming and since AM play a key role in directing and propagating immune responses and inflammation in the lung. Using primary AM and MDM, researchers modelled Th1 and Th2 microenvironments with the addition of IFN or IL4. These data indicate priming alters the metabolic baseline of human resident macrophages and their ability to respond to bacterial stimuli. Human MDM were left unprimed or primed with IFN or IL and metabolic flux monitored by recording ECAR and OCR. Having established IF and IL alter metabolism in human macroages, researchers examined the ability of AM and MDM to secrete cytokines when primed with IF or IL. Human AM and MDM were left unprimed or primed with IF or IL for 24 hours, then stimulated with iH37v or LPS. There is a paucity of data on the role of metabolism in response to Th or Th microenvironments in human macroages, especially tissue macroages such as AM. A knowledge gap remains whether tissue AM is metabolically and functionally plastic, capable of mounting pro-inflammatory responses despite homeostatic regulatory tissue phenotype.
Researchers have demonstrated for the first time in any animal that nocturnal ants use the exceedingly dim polarization pattern produced by the moon for overnight navigation. The sun and moon can provide directional information via their position, but can be obstructed by clouds, canopy, or the horizon, yet still providing compass information through polarized light. Sunlight produces polarized patterns across the sky as it enters the atmosphere, a known cue for navigating animals, while moonlight produces an analogous pattern, albeit a million times dimmer. Nocturnal ants leave their nest at twilight, relying heavily on overhead polarization to navigate, yet return home when the sun cannot guide them. The study shows these ants use polarized moonlight to navigate during the night by rotating the overhead polarization above homing ants, altering their headings in response. This ability occurs throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons when polarized light levels are lowest. Polarized moonlight is incorporated into the ants' path integration system throughout the night for homing, similar to polarized sunlight during the day.

The ability to detect dim polarization by the moon may be present in nocturnal insects, including nocturnal bees and crickets, but there is no behavioral evidence for its use in goal-directed navigation. Nocturnal ants, specifically Myrmia midas, make an interesting species to characterize lunar and solar polarized detection. Similarities occur when comparing solar and moonlight navigation in homing to the nest. Large-eyed Myrmia ants restrict navigation to evening and morning, using overhead polarized light during twilight to derive compass information. Myrmia pyriform and Myrmia midas use polarized light, visible during twilight, to navigate. Heading changes due to polarized moon align with responses to polarized sunlight as part of the path during solar twilight, indicating polarized moon is detected and integrated into the ant's path for inbound. 

Polarized moon is likely integrated into the forager's path throughout the night, processed through the same visual pathways as polarized sunlight, using the same neural architecture for polar solar and moon cues. The study shows nocturnal ants use polarized moon precisely the same way as solarization, meaning polar moonlight is integrated into the forager's path throughout the night. This occurs across lunar phases, suggesting polarized moon is a detectable throughout the month. Polar moonlight is incorporated into the ants' path system for homing, similar to polar sunlight during the day, demonstrating long-term use of this cue for navigation.
Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, with early pterosaurs having long, stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane would have been crucial in early pterosaur flight. Researchers used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs, which supported a sophisticated tensioning system to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure. The first pterosaurs, non-pterodactyids, had long, stiff tails with mobile bases similar to some dinosaurs like Velociraptor. Many of these tails end in a soft tissue 'vane' which may have contributed to passive stability in flight. The length and stiffening of the tails suggest they might have been important in early pterosaurs for control based on mass shifting or inertial control as purported for terrestrial theropods with convergent tails. Over 100 Solnhofen pter fossils were examined for well-preserved vanes using ultraviolet torch and four exceptional specimens were imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence. Three specimens exhibited vanes under white light but one vane was only visible under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence. The study aimed to investigate the vane's structural properties, explore its usage, evolutionary origins, and context for disappearance in later pterodactyids, representing pterosaur inventories from various museums. The discovery of the cross-link lattice within the vanes provides insight into early pterosaur flight capabilities, suggesting the vane played a crucial role in maintaining stiffness and control during flight.
Adolescence is characterized by significant changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making, which are necessary for the transition into adulthood but also increase vulnerability to psychiatric disorders. The major reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence underlies these changes and increased vulnerability. This study utilized fast scan voltammetry and microdialysis to examine dopamine release and mechanisms in the nucleus accumbens core of adolescent and adult male rats. Results show baseline differences between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor on modulating release. The α-selective blocker α-conotoxin increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats but decreased release in rats in middle adolescence and adulthood. Blockade of GABA and GAB receptors revealed α6-mediated increase in adolescent release requires GABA signaling to occur. Microdialysis confirmed the role of α6 nACh and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo, suggesting a multisynaptic mechanism unique to adolescence involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nACh to inhibitory GABA tone on release. The dopamine system undergoes reorganization during adolescence and multisyn regulation of release in adolescent rats through acetylcholine and GABA tone. Antagonizing GAB receptors increased release when β-containing nCh were antagonized, indicating GABA and nCh have complex reciprocal regulation of release age-dependent. Stimulated release decreased in the NAc of early adolescent male rats and microdialysis confirmed age differences in dopamine release mediated by GABA involving α-containingACh in vivo. The goal was to identify variations in NAc stimulated release and pinpoint mechanisms for changes in adolescent and adult rats, consistent with previous findings showing the NAc has the largest difference in stimulated release between adult and adolescent male rats. Transitional changes in dopamine release are implicated in psychiatric disorders, but mechanisms driving age differences are unknown. This study found α6 nA and GABA mediate age-dependent release and multisynaptic regulation unique to adolescence.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by common behavioral characteristics, suggesting shared pathogenic mechanisms, despite vast clinical and etiological heterogeneity. A study using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from individuals with two distinct ASD subtypes, idiopathic and 16p11.2 deletion, found common reductions in neural precursor cell neurite outgrowth and migration, despite no genetic overlap in whole genome sequencing. To identify signaling differences contributing to developmental defects, an unbiased phospho-proteome screen was performed, revealing hundreds of shared peptides between subtypes, including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling alterations were confirmed in neural precursor cells across both subtypes, and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism-associated phenotypes in control cells. The study demonstrates genetically distinct ASD subtypes have common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration driven by shared pathogenic mTOR dysregulation. Phospho-proteome analysis also showed enrichment of ERK/MAP and PKA pathways, indicating altered cellular signaling plays a role in ASD pathogenesis. mTOR dysregulation drives autism-associated phenotypes in neural precursor cells. Early neurite development and cell migration were studied using iPSC-derived neural precursor cells from idiopathic and 16p11.2 deletion cohorts, showing convergence in neurite and migration phenotypes despite genetic differences. Gain and loss of function studies showed increasing mTOR activity rescues defects in low-mTOR patients, while reducing mTOR reproduces autism phenotypes. Increasing p6 in lowTOR led to rescue of ASD phenotypes, and decreasing p6 in highTOR also rescued phenotypes. Altered mTOR signaling is a point of convergence for shared neurite and migration phenotypes, suggesting early developmental dysregulation is a common feature among multiple ASD forms.
Research has shown that neural diversity can expand the encoding capacity of circuitry, with a striking example being the afferent synapses between inner hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons in the cochlea. The presynaptic zones at the pillar side of inner hair cells activate at lower potentials than those on the modiolar side, which have more presynaptic calcium channels. Postsynaptic spiral ganglion neurons differ in spontaneous rates, sound thresholds, and operating ranges, suggesting a causal relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response. However, experimental evidence linking synaptic and ganglion physiology has been difficult to obtain. To bridge this gap, paired recordings of murine inner hair cells and postsynaptic boutons were conducted with stimuli mimicking in vivo conditions. Synapses with high spontaneous release rates were predominantly found on the pillar side of inner hair cells and had larger, more temporally compact excitatory postsynaptic currents, lower thresholds, tighter coupling of calcium channels and vesicular release sites, shorter latencies, and higher release rates. This indicates synaptic heterogeneity in inner hair cells contributes to diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of ganglion neurons. Recordings were performed in acutely explanted organs of Corti from hearing mice, controlling calcium influx and postsynaptic response to glutamate release at single afferent synapse. Heterogeneity exists among synapses formed by individual presynaptic inner hair cell with postsynaptic ganglion neurons and is candidate for how cochlea decomposes acoustic information. Comparison of afferent synapses with high and low spontaneous rates used stimulation protocols for in vivo characterization of sound encoding by ganglion neurons. Step depolarizations emulated physiological potentials given mature inner hair cells of high-frequency cochlea have graded potentials representing rectified acoustic stimulus envelope. Synaptic heterogeneity found at tonotopic positions of cochlea is mechanism for decomposing acoustic information. Results support presynaptic hypothesis of functional ganglion diversity, highlighting challenges in bridging gap between presynaptic hair function and sound encoding.
The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum faces various environmental challenges throughout its lifecycle, necessitating effective and highly regulated chromatin transcription. Microridia (MORC) proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing across plant and animal kingdoms. Recent studies have shed light on the role of MORC protein as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites. Using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing and molecular genomics approaches, researchers demonstrate PfMOR modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle and is essential for parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing experiments show PfMOR binds to subtelomeric regions and genes involved in antigen variation, playing a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown and chromatin conformation capture studies indicate downregulation of PfOR impairs histone marks and collapses heterochromatin structure, leading to parasite death. These findings confirm PfOR plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating it as a candidate for antimalarial strategies.

The genome-wide distribution and function of PfOR throughout the parasite cycle remained elusive, but CRPR/Cas9 editing determined its function, distribution, and indispensability. Immunrecipitation validates PfOR's role in heterochatin maintenance. Preliminary studies identified PfOR as one of the most abundant chromatin-bound proteins. The multifunctional role of MOR proteins led to exploration of PfOR's association with chromatin accessibility and stage-specific regulation using chromatin immunrecitation and sequencing at ring, trophite, and schizont stages. Conflicting results on PfOR's essentiality using KD or KO strategies were resolved using CRISPR/C9, determining nuclear localization, genome distribution, and regulatory impacts on chromatin, transcriptome, and cell development.

PfOR is critical for parasite cycle progression, survival, and heterochatin formation, regulating immune evasion through antigen variation. Disparities in essentiality observed in previous studies were resolved, demonstrating PfOR's role in chromatin structure, gene regulation, and survival, validating it as a candidate for antimalarial strategies. The study used CRISPR/Cas genome editing, molecular and genomics approaches, chromatin immunrecitation and sequencing, protein knockdown, and chromatin conformation capture to demonstrate PfOR's function. The results show PfOR binds subtelomeric regions, modulates stage transition, and impairs histone marks, collapsing heterochatin, leading to parasite death, confirming its crucial role in chromatin and gene regulation. Overall, PfOR is essential for parasite survival and a potential target for novel antimalarial strategies.
Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Research using a mouse model of head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing shows that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas, altering behaviors such as decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat, and reduced running. Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened activity, and brain regions receiving neural projections showed elevated Fos and increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor counterparts. Genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated behavioral alterations induced by the tumor, while analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie behaviors but not voluntary running, indicating pain is not the exclusive driver of such shifts. Tumor-infiltrating nerves communicate signals to the brain, leading to cancer-associated changes independently of pain. Elimination of TRPV1-expressing nocicept neurons reduces tumor growth, enhances survival, and is a potential target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients. Absence of nocpt neurons in tumor-bearing animals decreased cF and ΔFos in the PBN and ΔFos in Spc, suggesting disrupted tumor-brain communication. Tumor-infiltrating nerves are integrated into a pre-established circuit extending from the tumor bed to the TGM ganglion, connects the Spc, and projects into the brain, influencing behavior in pain-dependent and independent ways. Cancer patients experience poor mental health, and the neural connection between tumor and brain, with TR1-expressing nociceptor neurons, contributes to these changes. Findings demonstrate the importance of unraveling interactions between tumor-infiltrating nerves and brain for developing targeted interventions to alleviate mental health burdens associated with cancer.
Genetic diversity is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success, with the SARS-CoV-2 genome providing a uniquely large database to examine the impact of mutations on the biophysical phenotypes of the highly expressed and multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. The study finds variation in physicochemical parameters of its intrinsically disordered regions sufficient to allow plasticity, but also observes functional constraints similarly in related coronaviruses. Biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants reveal that point mutations in intrinsically disordered regions can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. The Omicron variant shows distant mutations in different intrically disordered regions have compensatory effects, shifting the balance of interactions controlling protein properties, including creation of a new protein-protein interface in the N-terminal through the P13 mutation. Genetic diversity is accompanied by significant variation in biophysical characteristics of functional-protein species, particularly in intrically disordered regions. The charge, phosphorylation, polarity, and hydrophobicity of equivalent subregions are functional biophysical constraints maintained across coronaviruses despite sequence conservation. Computational evaluation of biophysical traits from diversity in SARSV-2 N-protein folded domains and intrically disordered regions, as well as related coronaviruses, reveals an extensive range of biophysical properties impacted by sequence diversity. Focusing on SARS-2 N-protein, the study examines diversity of biophysical phenotypes to understand mechanisms of protein functions and the biophysical landscape underlying evolution. Biophysical experiments with representative N-protein mutants from SARS2 variants characterize variation in thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, energetics of NA binding, assembly, and LLPS, finding a large biophysical space available for viable-protein with potential for nonlocal effects modulating overall properties. Mutations in intrically disordered regions endow viral proteins with another level of biophysical variation impacting evolutionary fitness, presenting a challenge and opportunity to explore the biophysical spectrum and uncover functional principles of RNA-virus proteins.
Hibernation is a period of metabolic suppression utilized by many small and large mammal species to survive during winter periods. The underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization. Muscle fibers were isolated from small hibernators, Ictomys tride lineatus and Eliomys querc, and larger hibernators, Ursus arct and Ursus american. Loaded-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction measured myosin dynamics and ATP demand. Multiple proteomics analyses were performed. Results showed preservation of myos structure in U arct and american during hibern, while changes in my metabolic states during torpor led to higher energy expenditure of type II fast-twitch fibers at ambient temperatures. Loaded-AT chase experiments at 8C, near body temperature of torpid animals, found myos ATP in type II fibers reduced 77-107 during torpor compared to active periods. Myh2 phosphorylation during torpor in I tride was predicted to stabilize myos. Altogether demonstrate resting myos altered hibern mammals contributing to changes in ATP skeletal consumption, further altered in response to cold, and myos potentially skeletal non-shivering thermogenesis. 

To investigate myos DRX and SR states, loaded-AT chase in permeabilized fibers from U arct during summer and hibern utilized. Total 104 myofibers tested at 20C. Higher ATP during torpor could indicate myos adaptation during hibern. Investigated changes at lower temperature, critical difference large hibern U american. Representative Mant-AT fluorescence in single fibers showed similar U arct type I and II, no changes myos conformation or ATP. Data indicate my metabolic states unchanged hibern U arct and U american. Smaller hibern utilized E samples. Study hypothesized myos proportions within muscles major suppress ATP demand hibern.

Chondrocyte columns, a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a central role in bone elongation, and are formed by clonal expansion following rotation of the division plane, resulting in a stack of cells oriented parallel to the growth direction. However, analysis of hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis showed that embryonic clones were elongated but formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. In contrast, growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks and small disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. The correlation between temporal dynamics of ratios of clusters and columns and bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. The study analyzed 3D architecture of confetti-labeled clones in embryonic and postnatal growth plates of mice and found that chondcytes in embryonic growth are rarely arranged in columns due to successive incomplete rotations during cell division resulting in non-stereotypic stacking that gives rise to elongated clusters orthogonally to the bone axis. Uniclonal and multiclon columns are rare in the embryonic plate and the core mechanism of chondcy column formation is a complete rotation of division plane during proliferation which is rare in embryonic growth. The 3D analysis reveals temporal dynamics of division rotations and their effect on formation of columns and clusters in pre and post growth as well as correlation with morphogenetic processes. The presence of clusters and columns correlated temporally with rates of growth elongation and expansion, suggesting these support different strategies during bone development, highlighting the role of 3D analysis in complex cellular arrangements. Morphological entities correlate with temporal growth elongation and expansion, suggesting clusters and columns support different strategies during bone development, and column formation is viewed as key morphogen process during elongation. The findings support the idea that modulation of division rotation determines formation of clusters or columns, multifunctional design regulating morphogenesis pre and post bone growth, providing new understanding of cellular mechanisms of growth activity and elongation during development.
Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are of significant interest due to their promiscuous substrate binding site, which has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs. Members of the POT family are conserved across phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the electrochemical gradient. Recent cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have provided new insights into conformation states of mammalian POTs, SLC15A1 and SLC15A2. However, these studies leave questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling, providing an opportunity to investigate these processes using molecular dynamics simulations. This study employs extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling to map the full SLCA2 conformation cycle and thermodynamic forces, computing conformation free landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide, identifying a sequence of protonation steps driving inward-directed alternating access. Key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs were validated experimentally in cell-based assays. Constant-pH MD and absolute free energy calculations establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing details underpinning secondary transport in POTs. The study provides understanding of proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals, integrating solute carrier biology with enhanced drug design for target and bioavailability.

The study utilizes recent bacterial and mammalian transporter structures to construct a model of alternating mechanism, explaining proton movement and conformation changes coupled to substrate presence. The presence of substrate affects ligand binding, protein conformation, and protonation of E56 and E622 residues. A model of plausible steps for substrate and proton-coupled access in mammalian POTs is established. Simulations with bound Ala-Phe molecule calculated affinity using absolute free energy in different protein states, showing similar affinity in OF and IF states, indicating substrate alone does not drive the transporter from OF to IF. Enhanced simulations generated conformation energy landscapes in dependence on proton state and substrate conditions, assuming 2:1 stoichiometry for dipeptides, indicating distinct roles of protons in the conformation cycle. POT family transporters belong to major facilitator superfamily, sharing a conserved topology of six-helix bundles forming the transport domain. The results provide a mechanistic link between proton and peptide recognition, underpinning secondary transport in POTs and pave the way for integrating knowledge of solute carrier biology with enhanced drug design for target and tissue bioavailability.
Research has shown that across the animal kingdom, neural responses in the auditory cortex are suppressed during vocalization, and humans are no exception. A common hypothesis is that suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback, enabling the detection of vocalization errors. This hypothesis has been confirmed in non-human primates, however a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech remains elusive. To address this, intracranial electroencephalography recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production were obtained. The topography of auditory suppression varied across the superior temporal gyrus, and a delayed auditory feedback task was performed to determine if suppressed sites were sensitive to auditory alterations. Overlapping sites showed enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity, with a strong correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback. When participants produced speech with simultaneous feedback, posterior superior temporal gyrus was activated if engaged in a delayed auditory feedback paradigm, suggesting attentional load modulates auditory sensitivity. 

The study aimed to test the hypothesis that speech-induced suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback in neurophysiological recordings. Results revealed overlapping sites in superior temporal gyrus exhibited both speech-induced auditory suppression and sensitivity to feedback with a correlation between the two, supporting the hypothesis that auditory suppression predicts sensitivity to speech errors. Delaying feedback during production enhanced responses in superior temporal gyrus with variable sensitivity across recording sites. A correlation between speech-induced suppression and feedback provided evidence for a shared mechanism between auditory and speech monitoring. Intracranial electroencephalography in neurosurgical participants identified sites showing auditory suppression during production and employed a delayed auditory feedback paradigm to test sensitivity to perturbed feedback. 

The findings suggest that speech-induced suppression enables detection and correction of speech errors and suppressed sites sensitive to auditory feedback exhibit neural responses to perturbations. Increased attention to feedback under adverse conditions increased sensitivity and elicited larger responses in the auditory cortex compared to normal production. The results support the hypothesis that speech-induced suppression increases sensitivity to auditory feedback in human neurophysiological recordings. Overlapping sites in superior temporal gyrus showed both suppression and sensitivity to feedback with a strong correlation between the measures. Delaying feedback during production enhanced responses in superior temporal gyrus with variable sensitivity across recording sites. The study provides evidence for a shared mechanism between auditory suppression and speech monitoring, supporting the hypothesis that suppression is key to speech monitoring.
A comprehensive census of McrBC systems, a common form of prokaryotic Type IV restriction systems, reveals their enormous abundance in diverse prokaryotes and a plethora of genomic associations. A previously uncharacterized branch, denoted coiled-coil nuclease tandems (CoNuTs), is characterized by the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases, showing extraordinary variety with three distinct types and multiple subtypes. All CoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation components, such as OB-folds, YTH domains, and RNA-binding H70 chaperone homologs, along with RNases, suggesting they target RNA. Many CoNu might target DNA via Mcr nuclease homologs. Additional restriction systems, such as Type I, BREX, and Druia Type III, are frequently encoded in the same superoperons, with CoNu likely regulated by cyclic nucleides, possibly RNA fragments with cyclic termini that bind CARF domains. The CoNu, with ancillary factors, employ an echoned defense strategy analogous to Type III CRISPR-Cas systems, eliminating DNA and/or RNA, then abortive infection leading to PCD/dormancy via RNA cleavage. CoNu contain domains capable of interacting with translation components, such as Smp-like OB, H70 homs or YTH, along RNases, suggesting one activity targets RNA. Three distinct types and multiple subtypes of CoNu differ by domain compositions and genomic associations. RNA targeting of Types-B and C can be inferred from similarity to Type-A encoding Cnu H70-like proteins. Higher-order associations of Type II and III CoNu systems with DNA restriction suggest two-pronged DNA and RNA strategy. RNA targeting is an ancestral feature of CoNu systems. Type II and III CoNu likely target RNA, given operons encoding HN RNases. Conserved association of CDC-like ATPases with Type-III CoNu, encoding tmRNA SPB domain, supports tmRNA interaction. Bacterin-like protein in these loci adopts inactivated PD (D/E) x-type restriction endonuclease fold, potentially nucleic acid-binding.
Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase with diverse functions, and its inhibition is known to enhance the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through multiple signaling pathways. Research aimed at studying the role of calcinein in regulating innate immunity found that calcinein is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program in C. elegans. Inhibition of calcine leads to defects in the defecation motor program, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. Intestinal bloating caused by calcine inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The transcription factor, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcine inhibition. The nuclear receptor NHR-8, upregulated by calcine inhibition, is necessary for increased lifespan. Calcine regulates thermotaxis, body size, fertility, and lifespan in nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Knockdown of the catalytic subunit of calcine, tax-6, enhances C. elegans lifespan via pathways including autophagy and CRE-regulated transcriptional coactivators. Calcine activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels, with increased calcium ions activating phosphatase activity via calmodulin binding. The rhythmic defecation cycle in C. elegans is regulated by rhythmic calcium waves. The relationship between lifespan and immunity is complex and not fully understood. Calcine, a conserved from yeast to humans, is involved in diverse cellular processes and signal transduction pathways. Inhibition of calcine in C. elegans results in susceptibility to bacterial infection despite enhanced lifespan, with tax-6 required for the rhythmic defation program. The TF ortholog HL-30 and nuclear receptor NHR8 are necessary for calcine inhibition-mediated lifespan extension. Overall, calcine plays a role in C. elegans defec motor program and provides a mechanism for calcine inhibition-mediated longevity, shedding light on the interplay between lifespan and immunity.
Cognitive control is essential for resolving conflicts between task-relevant and task-irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior, and these conflicts can arise from various sources such as sensory input and internal representations. A major challenge is how a limited set of cognitive processes can effectively address diverse conflicts. According to cognitive theory, conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a low-dimensional cognitive space, which can then be resolved by a limited set of cognitive processes working along the dimensions. This leads to the hypothesis that similar conflicts in their sources are represented similarly in the cognitive space. Researchers designed a task with five types of conflicts that could conceptually be parameterized and found both human performance and fMRI activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex support that different types of conflicts are organized based on similarity, suggesting cognitive space as a principle for representing conflicts. 

The study aimed to test the geometry of cognitive space in conflict representation, hypothesizing different types of conflicts are represented as points in a space where distance between points reflects the geometry of the space, scaling with the difference in sources of conflicts represented by points. Dimensions in the space of conflicts can be domains where domain-specific cognitive processes are defined, and a type of conflict's location in space can be parameterized using a limited number of coordinates reflecting control needed for each domain-specific process. The space can represent different conflicts with low dimensionality, and different domains can be conjunctively represented in a single space to achieve domain-general control as conflicts from different sources can be resolved using the same set of control processes. The space representing different types of conflicts is hypothesized to be located in the frontoparietal network due to its role in conflict resolution. Two solutions to resolving conflict are proposed, differing on whether same mechanisms are applied across domains, with domain-general control positing the frontari cortex adaptively encodes task information and implements strategies for different conflicts, supported by generalizable adjustment.
Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide, with most cases occurring spontaneously due to preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes. The prediction of spontaneous preterm birth remains underpowered due to its syndromic nature and the dearth of analyses of the vaginal immune response. A longitudinal investigation was conducted targeting vaginal immune mediators, referred to as the immunoproteome, in a population at high risk for spontaneous preterm birth. Vaginal swabs were collected across gestation from pregnant women who ultimately underwent term birth, spontaneous preterm labor, or preterm premature rupture of membranes. Cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides in the samples were quantified via specific and sensitive immunoassays. Predictive models constructed from immune concentrations showed that throughout uncomplicated gestation, the vaginal immunoprome harbors a cytokine network with homeostatic profile. However, the vaginal immunoprome is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory in pregnant women who experience spontaneous preterm labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes. This inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte chemoattractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides. The vaginaloprome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics for identifying women at risk for early preterm birth and undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation. Deviations from this shift are associated with spontaneous preterm birth. The vaginaloprome can be leveraged as a potential biomarker for early preterm birth, a subset associated with adverse neonatal outcomes. The study represents the largest and most comprehensive profiling of the soluble response in vaginal fluid throughout characterized pregnancies culminating in delivery of a neonate or preterm birth. Immune mediator data were quantified in vaginal swabs collected longitudinally from early to late gestation from women who delivered term or preterm. Profiling 31 mediators established gestational-dependent changes in vaginaloprome during normal gestation. Alterations in vaginaloprome are observed in women destined to undergo preterm birth, with immune changes in preterm attributable to factors other than maternal characteristics. Determinations were performed in vaginal samples during three trimesters, considering preterm subsets and timing of delivery. The vaginaloprome has predictive value over maternal alone for a subset of early preterm, highlighting immune changes in preterm are not solely due to maternal characteristics.
The function of smooth muscle cells lining the walls of mammalian arteries and arterioles is to regulate the diameter of vessels to control blood flow and blood pressure. Researchers have developed an in silico model, the Hernandez-Hernandez model, of electrical and Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes based on new data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from murine arteries. The model describes the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2 signaling during the development of myogenic tone in blood vessels. Experimental data show KV1.5 channel currents have similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes, but simulations suggest KV5 current is dominant in regulating membrane potential in male myocytes. Female myocytes have larger KV2.1 channel expression and longer time constants for activation, with KV2 playing a primary role in controlling membrane potential. The model predicts sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca and excitability due to voltage-gated K channels and L-type Ca channels over physiological membrane potentials. An idealized computational model of a vessel shows female arterial muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to Ca channel blockers compared to male. 

The Hernandez-Hernandez model predicts KV2.1 channels play a critical role in controlling membrane potential in female myocytes compared to male. Clinically used antihypertensive Ca1.2 channel blockers cause larger reductions in Ca1.2 currents in female than male myocytes. A one-dimensional representation of electrotonically coupled myocytes suggests Ca channel blockers are more potent in females, resulting in substantial Ca reduction in female smooth muscle. The model demonstrates the importance of sex differences in Ca1.2 and KV2 channels. The Hernandez-Hernandez incorporates electrophysiological and Ca signaling data suggesting sex differences in male and female arterial myocytes, simulating membrane currents, membrane potential, and local and global Ca signaling. Limitations include reliance on murine data, although mouse arteries present parallels human arteries, including intravascular-myogenic tone, resting potentials, and ionic channels like Ca1.2, BK, and Ry. The Hernandez-Hernandez model presents a framework to investigate the potential-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs.
Researchers investigated the relationship between litter decomposition and precipitation, considering the varying moisture dependencies of decomposers of different sizes. They hypothesized that the higher tolerance of macro-decomposers to aridity may counterbalance the effect of smaller decomposers, leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients. To test this, plant litter baskets of different mesh sizes were placed in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient, and macrocomposer assemblages were characterized using pitfall trapping. Decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on size, with microbial decomposition increasing with precipitation in winter and macrocomposition peaking in arid sites during summer, resulting in similar decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyper-arid sites. Macrocomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments. The findings highlight the importance of macrocomposition in aridlands, resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum and emphasizing the need to consider decomposer size when investigating biogeochemical processes. Macrocomposition contributed minimally to decomposition during winter but dominated in arid sites during summer. Using pitfall trapping, macrocomposer richness, abundance, and biomass followed a hump-shaped response to precipitation, peaking in arid environments. Opposing climatic dependencies of macrofauna and microorganisms and mesofauna led to similar decomposition rates across the gradient except hyper-arid sites. Sampling macrodecomers across aridity and seasons revealed a hump-shaped response to precipitation in arid ecosystems. The study tested the climate dependency of plant decomposition by microorganisms, mesodecomers, and macrocomers along a sharp aridity gradient from 22-526 mm mean annual precipitation. Results supported the hypothesis that macrocomposition governs plant decomposition in deserts, with opposing climatic dependencies leading to similar or higher annual rates in arid sites compared to mesic sites.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma carries a dismal prognosis with high rates of metastasis and few treatment options due to hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all tumours, which drives RAC activation, conferring enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropinocytosis. Researchers investigated the role of CYRI, highly expressed in pancreatic tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven cancer, and found that deletion of Cyrib, the gene encoding CYRI protein, accelerates tumourigenesis, leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancer lesions, indicating a potential role as a buffer of RAC hyperactivation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CYRI inhibits metastasis. CYRI depleted tumour cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread, due to impaired macropocytic uptake of the lysosphatidic acid receptor. The study implicates CYRI as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis.

Deletion of Cyrib in the pancreas, in concert with expression of KRAS G12 and p53 R172, led to acceleration of PanIN formation and increase in the area of pancreas showing high phospho-ER and phosph-JNK, crucial targets of KRAS and RAC that drive proliferation and expansion. CYRI was highly expressed in human cancers and correlated with poorer survival. Increased expression of CY-B in mice with PDAC suggested this model could reveal the role of CY-B in human PD. Loss of Cyrib in the KPC model accelerates PanIN formation and progression, likely due to loss of CYRI’s capacity to buffer RAC activation downstream of active KRAS, leading to abnormal architecture, combined with hyperactivation ERK and JNK to drive proliferation.

CYRI localises on macinos in pancreatic cell lines, suggesting a mechanism how CYRI loss could affect tumour progression. Rab5, present on vesicles move from the periphery of cells towards perinuclear region, is one of the first proteins recruited to macinos once internalised. The KPC model is characterised by high metastatic rates to clinically organs such as liver, diaphragm, and bowel. In this model, PanIN develops around 10 weeks, progresses to later stages towards 15, with full-blown PD appearing at this stage, and mice reaching end-point with a half of median 150-200 days. The study assessed expression of CYRI in the KPC model of metastatic PD and found that CYRI plays a role in tumourigenesis and metastasis given its central regulator of motility. Overall, the study provides new insights into pathways controlling metastasis, implicating CYRI as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer.
Researchers have identified 145 HML2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhes-specific insertions, with age estimates, open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism consistent with recent or ongoing activity. A clade of 106 proviruses is characterized by a 750 base pair sequence between env and the 3' long terminal repeat derived from an ancient recombination with HERV-K HML8-related virus, found in Old World monkeys but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/Old World split. Similar provuses were identified in white-cheeked gibbons, with gibbon insertions clustering within the Old World recombinant clade, indicating interspecies transmission from Old World to gibbons. The long terminal repeats of the youngest provuses have deletions in U3, disrupting the Response Element required for nuclear export of unspliced RNA. The HML8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element, indicating the ancestral Rec-RRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism. A clade of HERV-K HML-related endogenous retroviruses in rhes macques and other Old World monkeys includes a noncoding region between env and 3' LTR from recombination with HERV-K HML8 retrovirus, indicating SERV1 is relatively young and rhes macques could harbor active HML-like retroviruses. This clade may serve as a model for investigating viral evolution and HERV HML2 virology and pathogenesis. Previous studies identified 19 HML2 provuses in rhes macques, including three with identical LTRs, implying recent integration, and detected env mRNA expression and one macaque with Env-specific immune response. In-depth characterization of HML2 proviral sequences in rhes genome assemblies shows SERV1 is part of a large clade with signs of recent activity.
Wound infections are a significant concern as they can lead to delayed or failed healing, resulting in considerable morbidity and economic impacts, and occur in various contexts such as diabetic ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. Enterococcus faecalis is often found in non-healing wounds, but its contribution to chronic wounds remains understudied. To address this, researchers employed single-cell RNA sequencing on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model, examining over 23,000 cells to create a comprehensive single-cell atlas that captures the cellular and transcriptomic landscape of these wounds. The analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal healing process. Dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection contribute to an anti-inflammatory environment, with E. faecalis prompting premature, incomplete epithelial-mesymal transition in keratinocytes. E. faalis modulates M2 macrophage polarization, inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in the scRNA atlas. Macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils regulates chemine pathways, promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. The findings offer insights into the immunosuppressive role of E faalis in wound infections. Uninfected wounds undergo reparative angiogenesis, while E faalis evokes pathological vascularization, with M2 macrophage-EC interactions as targets of altered cell signaling during bacteria-infected healing. E faalis induces immunospression in keratinocytes and fibblasts, delaying the immune response. The study provides a comparison of transcriptomic and communication profiles between uninfected and E faalis-infected full-thickness mouse wounds at 4 post-infection. Immune cells play a crucial role in healing by eliminating pathogens, promoting kerocyte and fibblast activity, resolving inflammation, and tissue repair. The study lacks a dataset of uninfected unwounded skin transcriptome to investigate changes induced by wounding alone. E faalis infection reaffirms fibblast functions during uninfected healing, consistent with predicted ligand-receptor interactions. The comprehensive single-cell atlas provides a foundation for future studies investigating bacterial factors contributing to pathogenesis and understanding delayed healing mechanisms.
Researchers investigated the temporal dynamics of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants using a custom-built high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry system. They found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The burst occurs independent of day-night transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender dynamics, instead, it is the result of stress from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary to bioactive volatiles on the second. Prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response integrating priming and direct induction into a distinct temporal pattern. Plants respond strongly to volatile cues on the second day, possibly to avoid unnecessary energy expenditure. Volatile-mediated priming on the first day yields a clocked response to volatiles perceived the next. Plants respond to herbore-induced volatiles by increasing defenses, activation can happen directly with increased hormone and volatile release. Exposing receiver plants to volatiles from control or herbivory plants for 1.25 hours then clean air for 17 hours until the next day, half were exposed to HAC as secondary trigger. HAC was selected as inducer showing strongest correlation with measured terpenes. The delayed volatile burst may be due to interaction of an initial burst that primes plants for higher release the second day and secondary bioactive volatiles from sender. Maize plants exposed to voliles from herbore-attacked neighbors release terpenes, conducting a time-course analysis of terpene release by plants exposed to voliles from sender under Spodoptera exigua caterpillars. The study reveals prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in response integrating priming and direct induction into distinct temporal pattern, providing an answer to whether stress volatiles induce or prime plant defenses, revealing they can do both in sequence.
Researchers have discovered that wild flanged male orangutan calls feature rhythmically isochronous sequences nested within isochous sequences, consistent with two hierarchical strata, suggesting a form of recursive vocal combinatorics. The temporally and acoustically distinct rhythms in the lower stratum were not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by low multiples, indicating that these structures are not the result of parallel-hierarchical procedures or anatomical artifacts. This finding represents a case of temporally recursive homin vocal combinator in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music. The study suggests that second-order combinatorics, sequences within sequences involving hierarchically organized and cyclically structured sounds in ancient hominids, may have preluded the evolution of recursion in modern language-able humans. The discovery opens the possibility that recursive combinatorics were first a feature of proto-musical expression in human ancestors, later recruited for linguistic combinator generation. Future studies on primate combinator, particularly a structural approach in the wild, could test this idea and assess precursors and proto-states for the evolution of recursion within the homid family. A novel approach to vocal combics in primates can help infer patterns that were recursive in the past and molded into structures observed in humans. The study provides evidence for self-embedded patterning in a non-human great ape, the long calls of flanged orangutan males, through precise rhythm analyses. This finding opens a new charter for possible incipient and transitional states of recursion among homids and suggests a re-evaluation of previous studies with further taxa and experimental tests within a richer panorama of observations on combinator in great apes.
The incessant arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous innovations that shape life's evolution, with interactions between viral receptors and viruses garnering significant interest as viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection. A study on the interaction between the MDA5 receptor and 5'pp-RNA virus in the lower vertebrate fish Miichthys mii sheds light on this evolutionary process. The frequent and independent loss of RIG in vertebrates prompted a search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic response being the main pathway. Analysis suggested that MDA of Miichys mii and Gallus gallus, a homolog of RIG, can replace RIG in recognizing 5'pp-RNA, potentially leading to redundancy and loss of RIG from the genome during evolution. As an adversarial strategy, 5'pp-RNA SCRV utilizes the m6 methylation mechanism to degrade MDA, weakening its antiviral ability and promoting replication and immune evasion. The study provides a snapshot into the interaction and co-evolution between vertebrates and viruses, offering perspectives on ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to the diversity of the immune system.

The study investigated MDA, structurally similar to RIG, substituting for RIG in recognizing 5'pp-RNA in vertebrates without RIG. The MDA-mediated pathway in response to SCRV and double-stranded poly I:C-HM infection was analyzed, proposing an explanation for the evolutionary event where MDA gradually acquired new functionalities to detect viruses initially recognized by RIG. The teleost fish Miichys mii and bird Gallus, vertebrates lacking RIG, and 5'pp-RNA viruses SCRV and VSV were used to investigate evolutionary strategies between 5pp-RNA and host. Results demonstrated MDA of Miys and Gallus lacking RIG evolved to recognize 5pp-RNA. The SCRV virus mainly affects Siniperca, a fish lacking RIG like Miys. Data suggested vertebrates evolved MDA with alternative functions to recognize and resist 5pp-RNA in the absence of RIG. SCRV utilizes the m6 strategy to degrade MDA of Miys for immune evasion, shedding light on functional diversity of innate antiviral activity and unveiling the complex arms between virus replication and innate immunity in vertebrates. The loss of RIG in vertebrates is widespread, providing a new perspective for vertebrate groups that lost RIG. The study offers valuable insights into the evolutionary and ecological factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system.
Follicle-stimulating hormone has effects on body composition and metabolism, and and androgen deprivation therapy impacts circulating follicle-stimulating hormone concentrations, potentially influencing changes in fat mass, lean mass, and bone fragility. A study correlated serum follic-stimulating hormone levels with body composition, bone density, and turnover at baseline and after 12 months of androgen deprivation in 29 non-metatic prostate cancer patients. Patients received luteinizing hormone-releasing antagonist degarelix and underwent dual-energy x-ray absoriometry at baseline and after 12 months. Follic-stimulating hormone, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminalopeptide of collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. At baseline, a weak relationship was found between follic-stimulating levels and fat mass, but a stronger correlation was observed between follic-stimulating and total fat mass after 12 months. An inverse relationship was observed between follic-stimulating and appendicular lean mass ratio. The study suggests follic-stimulating levels after androgen deprivation impact body composition, particularly fat mass, and could be a marker for sarcopenic obesity and guide clinicians in evaluating body composition in patients undergoing androgen deprivation. The research was funded by Ferring Pharmaceuticals with no role in study design, data collection, analysis, or manuscript preparation. The study has limitations as an ancillary of prospective trial and results should be considered hypothesis-generating and not generalized. Large epidemiologic data show reductions in bone density and resorption prior menopause when follic-stimulating levels increase, associated with increased weight and adiposity. Circulating follic-stim levels at 6 and 12 months correlated with bone turnover, density, and body parameters after 12 months, showing a direct relationship with total fat mass and fat at arms and trunk. The study is the first to show an association between follic-stim levels and body composition in patients undergoing androgen deprivation.
Sudden cardiac death from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite research on sarcolemmal ion channels, none have proven effective for preventing sudden cardiac death. Recent evidence implicates reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of sarcoplasmic ryanine receptor 2 in the pathophysiology of sudden cardiac death. Researchers tested the hypothesis that Ry2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcasmic Ca+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SC, and improves contractile function. A guinea pig model replicating clinical aspects of human nonisic heart failure was used, with animals randomized to receive dantene or placebo in early or chronic heart failure. Dantene treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolar and ventricular arrhythmias, lowered heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency, and improved heart variability and function. Inhibition of Ry2 hyperactivity with dantene mitigates the cycle of sarcasm Ca+ leak, increases diolic Ca and ROS-mediated Ry2 oxidation, reducing repolar lability and protecting against VT/SC. The consequent increase in sarcasm Ca load improves contractile function. The effects of Ry2 inhibition on ventricular arrhythm and nonischemic heart failure have been unexplored. Researchers hypothesized Ry2 inhibition reduces sarcasm Ca leak, repolar lability, mitigates VT/SC, and improves contract function. A pressure overload guinea pig model of heart failure with spontaneous arrhythm was used, with high incidence of premature ventricular contractions and VT leading to sudden death in two-thirds of animals within weeks. Notably, sudden death occurs early, before heart dilates into failure. Researchers noted heart failure changes in expression, phosph-proteome of ion channels, transporters, and excitation-coupling proteins, with hyperphosphlation of Ry2 in failing hearts. Targeted antioxidant prevented modifications, pointing to oxidative damage as primary cause. Inhibition of Ca leak via Ry2 pauses transition to heart failure, reducing fibrosis, repolar lability, QT heterogeneity, improving competency, LV contractility, mitigating lethal VT. There is a need to identify antiarrmic targets, develop therapies for sudden death, with evidence indicating sympathetic-induced hyperactivity Ry2 causes SR Ca leak contributing VT/SC pathogenesis.
Researchers investigated the transcriptional responses of cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) family, including the conserved bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, in C. elegans. They identified functional sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcription partner SMA-9/Schnri based on ChIP-seq peaks and expression of nearby genes from RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mutants. SMA-3 and SMA-9 have overlapping and unique target genes, with SMA-3 acting as a transcriptional activator and SMA9 targeting both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sma-9 partially suppress the small size phenotype of sma-3, suggesting antagonism between the factors. Functional analysis revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and the endoplasmic retic (ER) secretory pathway, including disulfide reductase dpy-11. Smads and SMA9/Schnri have complex genetic and regulatory interactions regulating secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body regulation. Genome-wide RNA-seq and ChIP integrated analysis showed SMA-3Sm and SMA9 target genes co-regulated by both factors, as well as separate genes they independently regulate. ChIP-seq demonstrated 73.7% of SMA3 binding overlap with SMA9 sites, while half of SMA9 sites did not overlap SMA3. SMA3 targets were identified by comparing differentially expressed genes from RNAseq of wild-type versus sma3 and SMA3 peaks from ChIP analysis. SMA9-exclusive genes imply Smad-independent roles for SMA9 in functions, including immunity, consistent with vertebrate Schnri homologs in immunity. The findings indicate complex interactions between Smads and SMA9/Schnri in regulating body size and extracellular components.
Researchers have identified the embryonic transcription factor DUX4 as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation that is aberrantly expressed in a subset of primary tumors, contributing to cancer immune evasion and immunotherapy failure in patients with metastatic cancers. DUX expression is found in approximately 10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, and skin cancers, and is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased response to PD-1 blockade in urothelial carcinoma patients. The expression of DUX is a predictor of survival, even when accounting for tumor mutational burden and molecular features, with DUX associated with a reduction in median survival of over one year. DUX expression in uroelial tumors is linked to an immune-excluded or immune-desert phenotype, with higher proportion of DUX+ tumors exhibiting this compared to malignancies where DUX is silent. The correlation between DUX expression and PD-1 levels in tumor and immune compartments was examined via immunohistochemistry. DUX expression in metastatic context is associated with reduced anti-tumor immunity, mirroring observations in primary cancers and cell models, and correlated with decreased patient survival under immunotherapy treatment. The expression of DUX induces immunosuppressive gene program, concordant with its function inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling, and generates transcriptomic signals consistent with CD8 T cell exclusion from tumor. Uroelial cancers exhibit one of the highest frequencies of DUX expression, suggesting its importance in this tumor type. The high rates of DUX expression in metastatic cohorts reflect true expression rather than technical biases, consistent with polyadenated DUX transcript in primary and metastatic cancers. The downstream consequences of DUX expression in metastatic cancers were assessed, focusing on uroelial cancers due to its high frequency and potential importance. These findings motivate the development of DUX as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance.
A study was conducted in Tanzania to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in pastoral, agropastoral, and smallholder systems, as current data on the aetiology of livestock diseases is limited, constraining effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security, and public health. Between 2017-2019, 215 abortion events in cattle, sheep, and goats were investigated, with samples and questionnaire data collected to determine attribution, patterns, and reporting. Attribution was achieved for 19.5% of cases, significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples, while vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. The study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system through engagement of community-based field officers and practical sample collection and application of molecular platforms. Livestock abortion surveillance can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks and reproductive losses, identifying pathogens not easily captured through other forms of surveillance. The study showed an effective reporting and investigation system could be operationalized across settings in Tanzania, including rural areas. Aetiological attribution of livestock abortion rarely exceeds 35% even in well-resourced systems and data are sparse in African systems. Non-infectious conditions, nutritional, metabolic, and toxic conditions are likely causes of livestock abortions in Tanzania. Stressful events, including drought and wild predator attacks were reported in approximately a third of unattributed cases. The study suggests the utility, acceptability, and feasibility of livestock abortion as a target for syndromic event-based surveillance, supporting evidence-based interventions to improve livestock development, livelihoods, and human health in Africa.
Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor inducing the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine (NIC) is the major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, knowledge of the mechanism the NIC-regulated cell functions is limited. This study demonstrates that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. Moreover, NIC induces Yes-associated protein (YAP)/Transcription coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISCs via α7-nicotinic accholine receptor (nAch) and protein C (PK) activation; this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzepine (DB) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs. NIC enhances tumor formation from IS after the loss of tumor suppressor gene Apc, DB inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. This study identifies a NIC-triggered pathway regulating stemness and tumorigenicity of IS and suggests the use of DB as a potential strategy for treating intestinal tumors. The findings reveal the pivotal role of NIC as stimulant of cancer cell proliferation in intestinal tumors, explaining colon development in cigarette smokers. Development of drugs blocking α7Ach, Hipp-YAP/TA and Notch signaling may provide a therapeutic strategy for colon cancer. Extrinsic factors like NIC increase cancer risk by promoting cell division. Data indicates NIC increases IS abundance and proliferation, explaining the rate of intestinal tumors in smokers. The study demonstrates NIC enhances IS population via α7Ach and Hippo-YAP/TA and Notch signaling. DB suppresses Hippo-Y/TA and Notch signaling in NIC-treated mice. NIC expands IS population through α7Ach and YAP/TA-Notch loop, suggesting therapeutic targets for NIC-induced colon cancer. In the intestine, Y activation enhances β-caten and Wnt signaling. The study contributes knowledge on pathways by which stem cells respond to NIC and suggests a strategy for treating smoking-related cancer. Analysis validates NIC affects IS rather than Pan cells via Hippo-Y/TA and Notch activated nAch7. Crosstalk between Hippo, Notch, and Wnt regulates mammalian homeostasis.
Hsp70 is a key cellular protein that counteracts misfolding and aggregation associated with stress and disease by solubilising aggregates and aiding protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones, including J-domain proteins and nucleotide exchange factors. The collaborative impact of Hsp110 and different J-domain proteins on H70-dependent aggregate processing has been elucidated, showing that Hsp plays a major role in the initial stages of disaggregation, determining its efficacy. The nucleotide exchange factor catalyses recruitment of H70 assemblies onto the aggregate surface, modifying it into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones. Stimulation of H70 by H110 is stronger with class B J-domain proteins than class A and requires interaction between class B J-domain and the H70 EE motif. H110 disrupts the J-domain H70 interaction, potentially improving disaggregation but also leading to inhibition above-stoichiometric H110 optimum. Balanced interplay between co-chaperones and H70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential. Recent studies showed H70 exhibits different mechanisms with class A and B J-domain coaperones during recovery of aggregated proteins. H110 affects H70 members of different J-domain classes, with substrate activity necessary to increase S1-S1 binding to aggregates and effective concentration negatively correlated with affinity for H70. Larger H70-J assemblies at the surface, dependent on S1 and EE interaction, modify misfolded protein species amenable to disaggregation. H110 stimulation is limited to initial stages, chaper recruitment and disassembly, not final folding, with H110-dependent loading of H70 onto aggregates correlating remodelling into smaller species improving recognition by H104. H110 causes release of H70 and J from aggregate unless tethered via another interaction. Positive effect of H110 is pronounced when H70 comprises class J-domain, with stimulation potentially occurring at stages of disaggregation from association to final folding.
Gait impairment is a common in musculoskeletal conditions such as knee arthropathy and gait analysis is used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and monitor disease progression or response. However, clinical gait analysis relies on subjective observation as objective analysis has not been possible due to expensive equipment and highly trained staff required. Relatively low-cost digital insoles may offer a solution to these challenges. Researchers demonstrated a digital insole measuring osteoarthritis-specific gait yields similar results to the clinical gait lab standard by constructing a machine learning model trained on force plate data from participants with knee arthrop and controls. The model was highly predictive of force data from a validation set with area under receiver operating characteristics of 0.86 and area under precision recall of 0.90 and a separate independent digital insole dataset with 0.83 and 0.86. Digital-derived gait characteristics are comparable to traditional measurements and a single stride of raw sensor data could accurately assign each subject. This work provides a framework for alternative clinical gait analysis and supports development of at-home assessments with potential to improve ease and frequency of patient monitoring. 

The study aimed to quantify force data to identify disease using gait and if a wearable insole could detect similar characterizations by training a support vector machine model to predict classes. The model performed well on digital insole data as on hold-out force test data with area under receiver of 0.93 and precision of 0.94. A benefit of digital insole is many variables can be derived enabling comprehensive assessment of gait. The model was applied to a separate dataset from digital insole studies on individuals with OA and controls showing generalizability and ability to measure similarly to force plate. Knee and injury are represented by vF curves as shown earlier. Digital insoles may offer a solution to challenges in clinical gait analysis due to low cost and ease of use and provide a framework for alternative to traditional methods. The study supports development of at-home assessments with potential to improve patient monitoring and adds to the body of knowledge regarding wearable technology pipelines. Digital insoles can identify individuals by gait characteristics and provide a comprehensive assessment of gait with many variables derived. The study demonstrates the potential of digital insoles in clinical gait analysis and supports further research in this area to improve patient care.
Researchers have identified a potential non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain using a human amniotic membrane product called Clarix Flo, which attenuates post-surgical hypersensitivity in mice without exhibiting opioid-like side effects. The effect is achieved through inhibition of nociceptive dorsal root ganglion neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. The major component responsible for this effect, heavy-hyaluronic acid/paxin 3, has been purified from human amniotic membrane with greater purity and solubility than Clarix Flo. Heavy-hyalonic acid/pax 3 replicates Clarix-induced pain inhibition by inducing cytoskeleton rearrangements and inhibiting sodium and high-voltage calcium currents in nociceptive neurons. The findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human tissues as an effective non-opoid treatment for post-surgical pain and unravel the underlying mechanisms of pain inhibition by Clarix and heavy-hyalonic/pax 3. Human tissue products may be deployed as viable biologics to treat post-surgical pain, with heavy-hyalonic/pax 3 identified as the primary bioactive component responsible for pain inhibition. Heavy-honic/pax 3 induces cytoskeleton rearrangement and inhibition of sodium and calcium currents in a CD44-dependent manner, making it a promising non-opoid treatment for post-surgical pain. Intra-paw injection of Clarix reduces activation of small-diameter nociceptive neurons to noxious stimulation and heavy-honic/p 3 purified from human amni membrane bioically and functionally characterized. Heavy-h/p 3 may attenuate activation of key receptors in pain control and decreases nocptor excitability by inducing hyperpolarization and altering membrane properties. CD44 is a multifunctional transmembrane glycoprotein regulating physiologic and pathologic processes.
Researchers investigated the correlation between the color appearance and function of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, specifically human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE (iPSC-RPE) cells, by analyzing their color intensity and gene expression at the single-cell level. Utilizing the Automated Live imaging and Picking System (ALPS), they photographed each cell before RNA sequencing to profile gene expression. The results showed that while iPSC-RPE cells were categorized into four clusters by gene expression, the color intensity did not project specific gene profiles, indicating a lack of correlation between color and gene expressions that define the level of pigmentation. This led to the hypothesis that the color of RPE cells may be a temporal condition not strongly indicating functional characteristics of RPE. 

The study analyzed the transcriptome of iPSC-RPE cells and calculated the weighted sum of RGB channels as a proxy for pigmentation level. Gene set enrichment analysis showed the degree of pigmentation is dynamically regulated in each cell with a time lag between mRNA production of enzymes and melanin synthesis. Results suggested the color of iPSC-RPE may not be an indicator of expression of RPE markers. Gene related to retinoid recycling, important for photoreceptor retinal supply, showed weak correlation with color intensity of iPSC-RPE, with correlation coefficients of RDH11, BCO, RD10, DHRS, and RD5 at 0.25, 0.20, 0.16, 0.12, and 0.11 respectively. Evidence implies in vitro pigmentation of stem-derived RPE cells may not reflect functional maturation, such as poorly pigmented bone marrow-derived RPE becoming highly pigmented when transplanted, and non-pigmented iPSC-RPE becoming heavily pigmented after engraft. These findings suggest the color of RPE cells may not be a reliable indicator of their functional characteristics.
The field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain insights into ethologically relevant processes and neural mechanisms, with the common marmoset emerging as a pivotal model due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans. However, traditional methodologies often fail to capture nuances of marmet social interactions and cooperative behaviors, prompting the development of the Marmet Apparatus for Automated Pulling, a novel apparatus for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmets. This apparatus addresses limitations by enabling high-throughput, detailed outputs integrated with video and audio recordings for nuanced analyses in naturalistic settings and accommodates a range of behaviors and individual capabilities. MarmAAP provides a platform for investigations of neural activity underlying naturalistic behaviors and is a versatile tool for advancing understanding primate behavior and cognitive processes, bridging the gap between ethologically relevant animal studies and neural investigations. The combination of modular design, high-resolution data, and integration with neural recordings positions the paradigm as a robust tool for unraveling complexities of primate behavior. MarmAAP captures cooperative behaviors and allows high-resolution data collection, making it suitable for investigating neural mechanisms in primates. The apparatus and paradigm represent an advancement, bridging the gap between traditional animal studies and precise investigations of neural activity. Incorporating behavioral metrics from video and audio recordings with timing of marmets' behaviors and reward delivery provides understanding of interplay between behavior, vocal communication, and interactions. MAAP offers flexibility for various tasks and creates an avenue for simultaneous neural recordings while mets are engaged, increasing trials available for analysis and ensuring statistical power investigating relationship between neural activity and behaviors. The Marmet Apparatus Automated Pulling makes a significant contribution to the study of marm social behaviors, providing rich data, flexibility, and a platform for neural investigations, paving the way for research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmets as a model.
Researchers investigated the effects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing fetus, employing a murine model that mimics common human consumption patterns. The study found early moderate prenatal alcohol exposure affected site-specific DNA methylation in newborns without altering behavioral outcomes in adults. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation, mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. Methylation differences were enriched in non-coding regions, indicating broad effects on genome regulation. Replication in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder suggested effects were metastable at genes linked to traits, including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. A maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some effects of moderate prenatal exposure on methylation. The study demonstrated early exposure affects fetal regulation even without overt phenotypic changes, highlighting preventative dietary interventions. Regions sensitive to gestational exposure were replicated in human cohorts. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing assessed CpG methylation in brain and liver, exploring tissue specificity and effects prior to germ layer separation in gastrulation. Candidate gene testing identified regions sensitive to moderate prenatal exposure were also conducted. The exposure period covered conception to first trimester, reflecting typical situations where women consume alcohol until pregnancy recognition. Primary outcomes were differences in offspring methylation and secondary behavioral deficits in neurodevelopment relevant to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Validation used methylation data from newborn buccal swabs from the Asking About Alcohol in Pregnancy cohort, comparing never exposed to any exposure, found no differential methylation at corresponding CpG sites. Alcohol effects on methylation were predominantly tissue-specific, only two regions and four genes similarly affected in liver and brain. Perturbations may have been established stochastically due to prenatal exposure, maintained in differentiating tissue, requiring further analysis in germ tissues to confirm.
Researchers have found that the loss of certain regulators of RNA interference (RNAi) in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can selectively impair the silencing of some genes, despite double-stranded RNA being effective for silencing a wide variety of genes. This selective requirement can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in RNA metabolism. The Mael domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE3 work together such that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene. The requirement for NRDE3 can be overcome by enhanced dsRNA processing. Quantitative models and exploratory simulations revealed that changing cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce dependence on NRDE3, animals can recover silencing in non-dividing cells, and cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with U dinucleotides makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs are enriched within 'UG' zones matching dsRNA. Similar crosstalk between pathways and restricted amplification could result in selective silencing by endogenous RNAs. The RNAi pathway required for gene silencing in response to the addition of dsRNA has been worked out in C. elegans. The requirement for NRDE but not MUT16 or RDE10 can be bypassed by enhancing the processing of dsRNA, suggesting loss of NRDE has the least impact on efficiency of silencing. A dynamic model of RNA during silencing by ds reveals several criteria for efficient RNA silencing. Any two of MUT16, NRDE3, and RDE10 are required for unc22 silencing, suggesting each protein contributes to silencing of any RNA target. Similar mechanisms could generate other 22 RNAs independent of RDE. The influence of gene-specific factors on the outcome of RNAi and exploration of a detailed model is needed. A qualitative mechanism for RNAi in C.elegans has been deduced based on studies, but cellular, subcellular, and kinetic details remain obscure. RNAi is widely applied for gene silencing in plants, insects, and humans, like C.elegans, plants, and some insects, hinting at influence of gene-specific factors on functional outcome of RNAi.
Mortality and morbidity from tuberculous meningitis (TBM) are common due to the inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. A study was conducted to uncover genes and pathways associated with TBM pathogenesis and mortality, utilizing whole-blood sequencing from 281 adults with TBM, 295 pulmonary tuberculosis (PT), and 30 healthy controls. Weighted gene-expression analysis identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. Multivariate elastic-net regression selected candidate predictors of death, and logistic regression and bootstrap validation chose the best predictors. Increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell pathways were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality was associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative exhibited TN signaling and impaired extracellular organization. Four genes, MMP1, NELL2, ZNF354, and CD4, were identified as strong predictors of TBM mortality. These findings indicate TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PT, highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death, offering potential therapeutic targets and a four-gene biomarker for outcomes.

The study found differences in pathways involved in TBM mortality between HIV-positive and negative individuals, with death associated with increased expression of angiogenesis in HIV-positive and TN signaling in HIV-negative. A four-gene signature was identified as a potential biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status. Variable selection using multivariate Cox regression identified predictors for HIV-negative and positive TBM prognosis, consisting of hub genes and clinical biomarkers, age, TBM severity, and CSF lymphocyte count. The study aimed to identify baseline signatures predicting death or survival from TBM, selecting predictors from 26 and 10 hub genes representing dominant modules associated with mortality. Three clinical factors, age, MRC, and CSF lymphocyte, were used for candidate selection. The investigation characterized global dysregulation in immune responses, inflammation, and pathways in TBM, revealing mechanisms leading to death. Transcription profiles associated with TBM, stratified by HIV, showed 786 genes differentially expressed in HIV-negative and 162 in HIV-positive individuals. Host transcription signatures with TBM differ according to HIV status. The study provides insights into TBM pathogenesis, identifying pretreatment transcription modules associated with disease severity and mortality, offering potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for predicting outcomes.
Antibodies are crucial reagents for detecting and characterizing proteins, but many commercial antibodies fail to recognize their intended targets, with the scope of the problem remaining largely anecdotal. To assess the performance of commercial antibodies for human proteins, a standardized approach was developed using parental knockout cell lines to evaluate 614 antibodies for 65 neuroscience-related proteins. Side-by-side comparisons demonstrated that over 50% of antibodies failed in one or more applications, yet 50-75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, suggesting significant coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies. Recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. Hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified were found in published articles, raising concerns, but many were reassessed by manufacturers and altered or removed from the market. This study demonstrates the scale of the antibody specificity problem and suggests an efficient strategy towards achieving coverage of the human proteome by mining the existing repertoire and focusing new generation efforts.

The study developed optimized protocols to assess antibody specificity in Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence, testing antibodies against neuroscience targets chosen to predict requirements for coverage of the mammalian proteome. Results provide an unbiased framework for representation and comparison of performance, estimating coverage of human proteins with renewable antibodies and assessing common characterization methods. Approximately two-thirds of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody and half by one renewable, indicating significant coverage of human proteins by high-performing antibodies.

The analysis presents a dataset of commercial antibodies assessing performance and a step towards a comprehensive ecosystem to validate antibodies, evaluating 614 against 65 human proteins side-side in Western blot, immunopipitation, and immunofluores. All data are openly available. Antibodies are critical reagents in biomedical research enabling identification, quantification, and localization of proteins, with significant spending on 1.6 million commercially available targeting 96% of human proteins. The study informs a strategy to identify renewable antibodies for all proteins, addressing the issue of specificity, and coverage of the human proteome.
Researchers have developed a resource to facilitate the combined use of the GAL4/UAS and a second binary system, such as the LexA or Q system, in Drosophila tissues, enabling independent control of gene expression in different tissues within the same animal. A set of over 40 LexA-GAD and Q2 insertions were generated by CRISPR knock-in, focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL4 expression patterns, and verified for tissue specificity in larvae. Constructs encoding Q2 and Lex-GAD transcription factors in a single vector were built, allowing for successful integration into the fly genome, followed by FLP recombination to isolate lines expressing Q2 or Lex-GAD. Compatible shRNA vectors were used to evaluate LexA and Q systems in vivo for gene knockdown, generating a library of RNAi lines as a community resource. The LexA and Q system vectors and fly lines will provide tools for researchers to activate or repress different genes orthogonally in the same animal. Following integration into the genome, the vector generates a driver expressing Q2 and Lex-GAD, allowing one coding region to be excised with Flp, resulting in flies expressing Q2 or Lex-GAD. Q2 and Lex-GAD systems were evaluated for gene knockdown, generating a library of transgenic shRNA lines in custom QUAS and LexA vectors. A plasmid was synthesized containing features for CRPR plus a cloning site for ligation of T2-Lex-GAD, T2-Q, or T2-Lex-GAD-TA-Q fragments to produce the donor plasmid. Genes with tissue-specific patterns encompassing major fly organs were selected, with most inducing fluorescent reporter genes rather than shRNAs for RNAi. Donors were cloned and injected into Cas9-expressing embryos to induce CRPR-based HDR of T2-Lex-GAD or T2-Q2. The generated stocks, vectors, and protocols will expand the ability of Drosila researchers to modulate gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously when combined with GAL4 lines.
The transcription factor Bcl11 has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. B11 is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. Research has shown that the synaptic organizer molecule C1q12 is a direct target of B11 that regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA synapses in vivo and vitro. Furthermore, Cq12 exerts its functions through interaction with a specific variant of neurexin-3, Nrx3(25+). Interruption of Cq12-Nrx(25+ interaction by expression of non-binding C12 mutant or deletion of Nrx3 in dentate granule neurons recapitulates major parts of B11 and C12 mutant phenotypes. This study identifies a novel C12-Nrx(25-dependent pathway through which B11 controls moss fiberCA synapse function, contributing to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopment disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction. B11 plays a crucial role in the development of hippocampal moss fiber system, adult hippocamp neurogenesis, and hippocal learning and memory. In the mature hippocampus, B11 is critical for structural and functional integrity of moss fiber synapses between dentate granule neurons and CA3 pyramidal neurons. Conditional ablation of B11 leads to structural and functional changes characterized by reduction in synapse numbers, loss of bouton complexity, misdistribution of synaptic vesicles, and loss of mossy fiber long-term potentiation. Reintroduction of synaptic organizer C12, a direct transcriptional target of B11, is downregulated in B11 mutant dentate granule neurons. The B11C12Nrx-dependent pathway is essential for control of moss fiber synapse function, with components associated with neurodevelopment and neuropsych disorders characterized by synaptic dysfunction. Analysis of this pathway may provide insights into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopment and neuropsych disorders.
Researchers investigated the zinc-finger protein Sfp1, known to regulate transcription of proliferation-related genes, and found it can regulate transcription by binding to promoters or transcribed gene bodies via RNA polymerase II. Following promoter binding, S1 binds gene bodies and affects Pol II configuration, causing dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking. S1 also binds a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them, with interaction controlled by respective promoters and coinciding with S1 dissociation from chromatin. S1 dissociation from chromatin correlates with the extent of backtracked Pol II, suggesting S1 accompanies Pol and regulates backtracking. Backtracked Pol is compatible with S1 relocation to nascent transcripts, where S1 accompanies mRNAs to cytoplasm and regulates stability. S1 co-transcription binding imprints mRNA fate, serving as a paradigm for cross-talk between synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs and dual-role of zinc-finger proteins. S1 possesses classical zinc fingers and impacts mRNA life cycle from transcription to degradation, with effect on elongation linked to function on stabilization. Binding of S1 to gene bodies correlates Pol occupancy and activity, particularly CR+ genes, extending function beyond initiation and encompassing elongation. Interaction with chromatin affects Pol elongation and mRNAs, suggesting mechanistic linkage. Rpb subunit enhances Pol polymer activity and promotes mRNA instability due co-transcription imprinting. Backtracking is associated co-transcription binding S1 to nascent RNA, with Ri genes exhibiting S1-dependent backtracking imprinting S1. S1 binds subpopulation mRNAs stimulated by S1, CR+ mRNAs, indicating widespread effect on transcription.
Programmed cell death during development (PCD) is a fundamental process integral for plant growth and reproduction. Researchers investigated the connection between developmentally controlled PCD and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thalian roots, focusing on the root-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBR (SMB) and senescence-associated nuclease BFN. Mutations of both PCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendita indica primarily in the differentiation zone, with smb-3 mutants exhibiting hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and delay of S. indica-induced root growth promotion. This demonstrates that root PCD and post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Reporter and transcription analysis revealed B1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature epidermal cells, suggesting transcriptional control facilitates accommodation of beneficial microbes in roots.

Impaired PCD in Arabidopsis smb-3 and bfn1 mutants increased colonization by the beneficial endophyte S. Indica, with smb-3 displaying hypercolonization along the primary root, providing easily accessible nutrients for fungal colonization. While PCD protects the meristem from microbial colonization, some microbes manipulate host PCD by affecting B1 transcription to facilitate accommodation. The mechanism of B1 downregulation by S. Indica remains to be investigated. Transcriptome analysis tracked developmental death-marker expression during S. Indica colonization, showing a decrease in B1 expression after 6 days post-inoculation. Inoculation of pBF1 reporter lines with S. Indica observed reduction in promoter activity in epidermal cells in contact with the fungus. B1 expression in the root xylem was unaffected, indicating transcriptional control of B1 during epidermal aging/senescence. Results emphasize beneficial microbes modify PCD to enhance host colonization, proposing tight regulation of PCD and clearance play roles in restricting fungal colonization at the apical meristem.
Research has shown that large vesicle extrusion from neurons may contribute to the spreading of pathogenic protein aggregates and inflammatory responses, leading to neurodegenerative disease. The factors that regulate the extrusion of large vesicles, such as exophers produced by proteostressed C. elegans neurons, are poorly understood. A recent study found that mechanical force can significantly potentiate exopher extrusion from proteressed neurons. Exopher production from the C. elegans ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak. Genetic disruption of C. elegans germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at late reproductive phase through mating or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can increase ALMR exopher production. Interventions that promote ALMR exopher production are associated with expanded uterus lengths, while those that suppress AL exopher production are associated with shorter lengths. Filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or fluid can also enhance ALMR exopher production, suggesting that distention rather than fertilized eggs constitutes the exopher-inducing stimulus. The study concludes that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteressed maternal neurons, highlighting the importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and aggregate mechanisms in neurodegenerative disease. The requirement of sperm and oocytes for neuronal exopher production led to investigation of fertilized eggs/embryos role in AL exogenesis. Analysis of physical relationships between neurons, eggs, and uterine shape showed eggs can distort tissue structure in young C. elegans. AL neurons in germl-less mutants produced fewer exophers, and RNAi knockdown of embryonic genes impacted neuronal exopher levels. Inducing egg retention via lin-39 RNAi resulted in 60% exogenesis, regardless of exogenous protein expression. Neurotransmitters octopamine and serotonin have opposing roles in C. elegans egg-laying behavior. Overall, the study suggests mechanical force plays a significant role in exopher extrusion from proteressed neurons and draws attention to the importance of mechanobiology in neurogenerative disease.
Research has increasingly supported a role for deficient Wnt signaling in Alzheimer's disease, with studies revealing that the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) colocalizes to amyloid plaques in patients. DK3 expression is upregulated in the brains of Alzheimer's disease subjects and DK3 protein levels increase at early in the disease. In hAPP-J20 and hAPP-NL-G-F-NL-F mouse models, extracellular DK3 levels are increased and DK3 accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques. DK3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling with a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. In contrast, DK3 knockdown restores synapse number and memory in hAPP20 mice. DK3 regulates the stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the adult hippocampus through different pathways. Functional studies in the J20 model of Alzheimer's demonstrate that knocking down DK3 in J20 mice ameliorates the changes in excitatory and inhibitory synapse number in the hippocampus before and after plaque deposition. DK3 loss-function ameliorates synaptic defects in J20 mice, supporting the hypothesis that DK3 is a key contributor to synaptic changes in this mouse model. Loss of synapses around amyloid plaques is a key feature of Alzheimer's brains, and DK3 affects synapse number around plaques in 9-month-old J20 mice. DK3 impacts synapses and cognitive function, which are affected by deficient Wnt signaling in Alzheimer's disease. Silencing DK3 is unlikely to be due to the formation of plaques as similar synaptic changes are observed when plaques are absent. Knockdown of DK3 does not affect the number or size of amyloid plaques in the J20 hippocampus. Gain-of-function studies demonstrate DK3 directly affects the integrity of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Synapse loss is the strongest correlate with cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease, but the mechanisms that trigger synaptic changes remain poorly understood. DK3 has been identified as a novel driver of synaptic defects and memory impairment in Alzheimer's disease, contributing to the understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to synapse vulnerability in Alzheimer's disease.
Researchers have discovered that iron-chelating pyoverdines, a type of siderophore produced by Pseudomonas spp, exhibit strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. A screen of 320 Pseudomonas isolates against 12 human pathogens identified several pyoverines with high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverine effectively reduced growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Staphylococcus aureus in a concentration and iron-dependent manner. Pyoverine treatment increased survival of infected Galleria mellonella larvae and showed low toxicity to mammalian cell lines and erythrocytes. Experimental evolution of pathogens with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance compared to antibiotics. Pydines from environmental strains have potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against human pathogens. Pyoverines produced by Pseudas have high affinity for iron and can withhold this element from pathogens, intensifying competition and reducing growth of opportunistic human pathogens. Screening of 320 environmental Pseudas isolates and 12 pathogen strains revealed five pydine candidates with broad-spectrum activity. The chemical structure of promising pyd candidates was elucidated to assess diversity and understand properties important for iron competition. Siderophore-mediated iron competition observed in natural communities was applied to human pathogens, investigating whether siderores from non-pathogenic bacteria induce iron starvation and growth arrest. Pydines, a class of siderores with high iron affinity produced by fluorescent Pseudas, were investigated for antibacterial activity against human pathogens. Administered to infected G mellonella larvae, pydine increased host survival rates in infections with A baumann and pneumonia, demonstrating antibacterial activity in hosts. Low toxicity of pydines at effective concentrations and low resistance evolution potential were observed. Overall, results reveal pydines from non-pathogenic Pseudas as potential agents to reduce growth of opportunistic human pathogens by intensifying iron competition.
Schizophrenia is believed to result from a failure of prefrontal networks, but the understanding of how disruptions at the synaptic level cause failures at the network level is lacking, preventing the discovery of how genetic and environmental risks alter synaptic function prefront network in schizophrenia. To address this, a recurrent spiking model of prefront local circuits was developed to explain the link between NMD synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefront network in schizophrenia. The model analyzes the balance between AMPA and NMD components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influence oscillatory synchrony to inform biological data, showing that reducing NMD synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs. The findings parallel dynamic modulation of 0-l spike synchrony observed between neurons in monkey prefront cortex during behavior and suppression of 0-l spiking by administration of NMD antagonists, providing a mechanism explaining the link between NMD synaptic and 0-l spike synchrony deficits. The study establishes a theoretical basis and circuit explaining reduction of NMD synaptic function implicated in schizophrenia leading to desynchronization of neural activity in prefront recurrent circuits, providing evidence that spiking networks close to a boundary in synaptic space can explain biological observations. Reducing NMD synaptic currents prevents networks transitioning into oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs, preventing emergence of 0-l spike synchrony. Prior studies addressed relationship between NMD function and oscillatory prefront networks but did not the topic of how NMD recurrent excitation and external input influence spike dynamics at neuron and population level in presence of AMPA. The current study developed a spiking network model to understand mechanisms mediating link NMD synaptic malfunction and neural dynamics observed in biological data, including emergence of 0 synchronous spiking between prefront neurons when external inputs push network across boundary and failure synchronous spiking when NMD currents reduced as observed in primate prefront cortex.
Angiogenesis is a morphogenic process resulting in the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, usually in hypoxic microenvironments. The initial steps of angiogenesis depend on the differentiation of oligopotent endothelial cells into Tip and Stalk phenotypic cell fates, controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell-cell communication. Researchers combined an experimental angiogenesis model with mathematical and computational analyses and found that regular Tip-Stalk cell patterning can undergo an order-disorder transition at high levels of pro-angiogenic factor VEG. The resulting differentiation is robust but temporally unstable for most cells, with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading to sprouts. Sprouts form in a manner that maximizes their distance, consistent with a Turing-like model that depends on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin. NOT signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation but does not instruct subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis, which may require additional cues and self-organization mechanisms.

In the context of angiogenesis, this challenge relates to enabling vascular morphogenesis through environmentally responsive differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and Stalk states, guided by multiple pro-angiogenic cues such as VEG and local tissue organization mediated by paracrine Delta-NOTCH signaling. Recent models of this process need to be tested to ascertain causality of proposed mechanisms, although Turing mechanisms appear to be the best candidates to explain experimental results. Analysis supports a dynamic view of angiogenic induction where VEG input induces NOT signaling and formation of Tip cells that behave as mini-sprouts. Inputs specifying cell fate can be contradictory, with pro-angiogenic factors promoting Tip fate and NOT signaling activated by neighboring cells promoting Stalk fate, suppressing Tip identity in the same cell.

VEG input of 100 ng matched experimentally observed Tip/Stalk fractions at the same VEG input. Spatial patterning characteristics of inferred positions of Tip cells in the angiogenesis model were quantified to compare modeling and experimental observations. Endothelial induction contrasts with other multicellular processes, including epithelial migration, where NOT signaling modulates fine-grained patterns of leader and follower cells, underscoring the need to develop refined models integrating biochemical and mechanical regulation of Tip-Stalk fate. The study provides insights into cell plasticity underlying angiogenesis and complex morphogenic processes, suggesting NOT signaling enables cell differentiation but subsequent steps require additional cues and self-organization. Overall, the findings contribute to understanding vascular morphogenesis through environmentally responsive differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and Stalk states.
The locus coeruleus (LC) projections to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory, but the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are unknown. The LC is typically modulates neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, but recent studies suggest it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other regions. Research indicates that dopamine release from LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepine. The LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory. LC activity increases both norepine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and the timing of hippocal dopamine release during fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Hippocampal dopamine is important for trace memory formation while norepine is not. LC projections to hippocampus are activated by salient learning events and this activation can enhance long-term memory. The LC is the primary source of norepine in the forebrain but release of dopamine into hippocampus is at least partially responsible for observed effects. LC activity increases dopamine and norepine content in hippocampus and dopamine release is important for fear memory but norepine is not. The release of dopamine from LC enhances learning-related plasticity in regions supporting fear conditioning. The locus coerule and interaction with hippocampus are critical for hippocampus-dependent memory formation but the temporal dynamics of learning-related LC and LC-hippocampus activity remain poorly understood due to the use of spatial tasks where information is experienced diffusely in time.
