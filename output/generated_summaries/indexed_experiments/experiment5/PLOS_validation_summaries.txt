Researchers conducted a genomic survey of transcript ends in lymphoblast cells from genetically distinct human individuals to investigate the role of RNA 3'-end processing in regulatory variation. The analysis mapped the cis-regulatory architecture of 3' gene ends, finding that transcript positions did not fall randomly in untranslated regions but preferentially flanked locations of 3' regulatory elements, including miRNA sites. The usage of transcript forms and motifs varied across individuals, and polymorphisms in polyadenylation signals and 3' motifs were significant predictors of expression levels of the genes in which they lay. Single-gene experiments confirmed the effects of polyadenylation variants on steady-state expression and validated regulatory function of 3 cis-regulatory elements. Focusing on the immune regulator IRF5, the study established the effect of natural variation in RNA 3-end processing on response to antigen stimulation. The results underscore the importance of two mechanisms in genetics of 3-end variation: usage of distinct 3-end signals and effects of 3 sequence that determine transcript fate. The findings suggest integrating 3-end positions with inferred 3 motifs will be critical in interpreting human variation. Genetic variants with biologically relevant effects by RNA 3-end remain to be discovered, and polymorphisms in 3 motifs can serve as predictors of steady-state levels of genes.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms underlying the remarkable efficacy of the live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus vaccine SIVΔf in inducing protection against wild-type lentiviral challenge. Using deep sequencing and comprehensive CD8 T cell epitope mapping, they found the initial CD8 cell response in acute SIVΔf infection targets variable epitopes, followed by sequence evolution and viral escape. Epitope escape expands the CD8 cell repertoire, generating de novo responses to escaped variants and targeting conserved epitopes, defined as anentropic specificity. SIVΔf-induced protection correlates with expanded anentropic specificity and increased response depth. Next-generation sequencing assessed viral variation in 12 SIVΔf-infected animals, demonstrating rapid escape of variable epitopes and maintenance of CD8 cell responses with anentropic specificity. Escaped SIV-specific CD8 cell responses are maintained as central memory cells, contributing to increased breadth at week 20 post-vaccination. Epitope escape deepens the CD8 repertoire. Longitudinal study showed coevolution of virus and CD8 specificity, resulting in increased anentropic, wider breadth, rearranged immunodinance, and depth. The findings highlight the significance of anentropic specificity and repertoire in vaccine design, rendering SΔf a proof-of-concept vaccine in HIV/SIV research.
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor signaling plays a critical role in controlling fungal infections caused by Candida albicans in the oral mucosa through its impact on neutrophils. Research using a mouse model of oropharyngeal candidias shows that IL-1 regulates the recruitment of circulating neutils to the site of infection and the mobilization of newly generated neutils from the bone marrow. IL-1 deficient mice display impaired chemokine production and defective granulocyte-stimulating factor (G-CS) secretion in response to C. albicans. Endothelial cells are identified as the primary source of G-CSF during oropharyngeal candidias, responding to IL-1 released from keratinocytes in infected tissue. The study establishes a link between IL-1 and granulopoies in the context of fungal infection. Two mechanisms coordinate the neutil response in the oralosa: regulating production of neutil-otactic factors by epithelial cells for recruitment and IL-1 dependent crosstalk between cellular subsets of nonhematietic compartment. IL-1 signaling is essential for antifungal immunity in murine mucosa, regulating neutil response against C albicans to prevent growth and dissemination. Without IL-1 signaling, mice are unable to control fungus and display increased fungal load, indicating its critical role in neutroph response during oropharyngeal candidias.
The Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis delivered over 1.9 billion treatments to nearly 600 million individuals via mass drug administration from 2000-2007, resulting in significant economic benefits. An estimated $21.8 billion in economic benefits will be gained over the lifetime of 31.4 million treated individuals, with $2.3 billion from protecting 3 million newborns and others from acquiring lymphatic filariasis and $19.5 billion from halting disease progression in 28 million infected individuals. Additionally, $2.2 billion will be saved by health systems due to reduced morbidity. Mass drug administration offers economic benefits with a high rate of return due to donated pharmaceutical commitments, proving the program an excellent investment in global health. The program delivered nearly 2 billion treatments to 570 million individuals in 48 countries, averting direct and indirect costs and lost labor costs for 31 million individuals. Lymphatic filariasis imposes severe physical and socioeconomic burdens on 1.3 billion at-risk persons in 83 countries, and the program's economic analysis provides valuable data for policymakers and funders, estimating $21.8 billion in benefits for infected and non-infected individuals and $2 billion in health system savings.
Researchers have developed a viable neuronopathic Gaucher disease model in medaka (Oryias latipes) that displays axonal accumulation of alpha-synuclein. Homozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene result in Gaucher disease, the most common lysosomal storage disease, and confer a strong risk for sporadic Parkinson's disease. The GBA mutant medaka, completely deficient in glucocerebrosidase activity, survived for months, enabling analysis of pathological progression. The model displayed phenotypes resembling human neuronopathic Gaucher disease, including infiltration of Gaucher-like cells, progressive neuronal loss, and microgliosis, with lysosomal abnormalities and alpha-synuclein accumulation in axonal swellings containing autophagosomes. Disruption of alpha-syn did not improve life span, formation of axonal swellings, neuronal loss, or neuroinflammation in GBA medaka. The study reveals GBA medaka as a novel neuronopathic model, pathological mechanisms of alpha-syn accumulation caused by glucocerebrosidase deficiency, and minimal contribution of alpha-syn to pathogenesis of neuronopathic Gaucher disease. The findings suggest axonal transport of alpha-syn plays a role in GBA mutations leading to Parkinson's disease and may be a therapeutic target. Patients with Gaucher disease have increased lifetime risk of developing Parkinson's, and GBA mutations show intraneuronal accumulation of alpha-syn, indicating an association between GBA and alpha-syn accumulation, highlighting the need for elucidation of pathological mechanisms and novel therapies for neurological manifestations.
Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen that induces a robust cell-mediated immune response to sub-lethal infection. The bacteria's ability to escape from the phagosome and enter the host cytosol is crucial for inducing long-lived CD8 T cell-mediated protective immunity. However, when confined to the phagosome, L. monocogenes suppresses the adaptive immune response, limiting not only the response to vacuole-confined bacteria but also negating the response to bacteria within the cytos. Co-infection with phagosome-confined and cytosolic L. monocogenes prevents the generation of acquired immunity and expansion of antigen-specific T cells. Bacteria confined to phagosomes suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to MyD88-dependent production of IL-10. Blocking the IL-10 receptor or absence of MyD88 during primary infection restores protective immunity. The presence of microbes within phagosomes directly impacts the innate and adaptive immune response by antagonizing signaling pathways necessary for inflammation and CD8 cell generation. The innate immune response plays a critical role in shaping the adaptive response, with phag-confined L monocogen altering the inflammatory cytokine response to cytos Act-Lm and protective immunity. MyD88 and IL-10-dependent mechanisms impact the potency of the adaptive response, discriminating between pathogens in distinct subcell locations.
Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, affecting approximately 60 million people, characterized by progressive death of retinal ganglion cells, optic atrophy, and vision loss. Genome-wide studies previously identified a significant association between POAG and the SIX6 locus. Researchers sequenced SIX6 coding and regulatory regions in 262 POAG cases and 256 controls, identifying six nonsynonymous coding variants, including a common variant Asn141His associated with POAG. These variants were tested in zebrafish, showing five were hypomorphic or null, primarily in PO cases, and one benign in controls. An enhancer variant increased SIX6 expression and disrupted regulation. Patients homozygous for the SIX risk allele had a thinner retinal nerve layer than those homozyous for the non-risk allele. The results suggest SIX6 variants disrupt retinal development, reducing retinal ganglion cells, increasing glcoma risk. SIX6 plays a role in ocular development, associated with optic nerve morphology. Variants in the SIX1/SIX locus were associated with optic parameters, including vertical-disc ratio, used to diagnose POAG progression. The study concludes SIX6 is a candidate gene in POAG, contributing to disease burden.
Researchers have identified a genetic switch that controls the production of flagella and toxins in Clostridium difficile, a human pathogen that causes diarrheal disease. The flagellar switch is a 154 bp invertible sequence located upstream of the flg operon, containing early flagellar genes, flanked by 21 bp inverted repeats. Bacteria with the sequence in one orientation express flagellum and toxin genes, produce flagella, and secrete toxins, while those with the inverse orientation are attenuated for flagellar and toxin expression, aflagate, and show decreased toxin secretion. The flag switch's orientation is reversible during growth in vitro. Gene regulation occurs post-transcription, requiring a C difficile-specific factor to destabilize early flagellar mRNA when the switch is in the OFF orientation. Tyrosine recombinase RecV catalyzes inversion at the flagellar switch in both directions. Flag phase variable motility and toxin production suggests these virulence factors have both advantageous and detrimental effects during infection. The flag switch affects transcription of toxin genes via σD, impacting glucyl toxin production and cytotoxicity. Mutants locked in the ON orientation display peritrichous flagella, engage swimming, and produce glucyl toxins, while OFF mutants are attenuated for transcription, aflagate, non-motile, and toxin production. The flag switch controls toxin production and flagellum biosynthesis, indicating major virulence factors are coordinately variable in C difficile.
Researchers investigated the sporulation pathway in the intestinal pathogen Clostridium difficile, an obligate anaerobe where endospores are central to the infectious cycle. The study focused on the function and regulation of sporulation sigma factors σF, σE, σG, and σK, which control gene expression during spore differentiation. Results showed deviations from the Bacillus subtilis paradigm, where σE activity is partially independent of σF, σG is not dependent on σE, and σK does not require σG. Additionally, σK is not strictly required for heat-resistant spore formation, indicating reduced temporal segregation between early and late sigma factors and reduced requirement for cell-cell signaling pathways. Despite these differences, the top level of the endosporulation network is conserved with sigma factors acting as key regulators, established 2.5 billion years ago at the base of the Firmicutes Phylum. The conservation of sporulation sigma factors and operon structure suggests their role is maintained across species, but recent studies revealed differences in roles and time of activity during spore morphogenesis in Clostridial species. Mutations in sigG reduced σK activity at late stages of spore morphogenesis, but the relationship between toxinogenesis and spore formation in C. difficile remains unclear. Overall, the study provides insights into the function and regulation of sporulation sigma factors in C. difficile, an important for understanding the infectious cycle of this pathogen.
Researchers have developed a framework to model the dose response of allosteric multisite phosphorylation proteins using a single variable, which can replicate the steady-state behavior of detailed multisite systems. Optimal ultrasensitivity is obtained when activation of the allosteric protein by individual sites is concerted and redundant. This framework is useful for modeling biochemical systems where multiple proteins interact. The framework was applied to a newly discovered signaling pathway in yeast, proposed to measure cell growth by monitoring signals at the plasma membrane. The pathway's components form a robust hysteretic switch, incorporating a signal proportional to bud size, a mechanism to read the signal, and an all-or response when the signal reaches a threshold. The protein is activated by phosphorylation of several but not all sites, with precision increasing as the number of sites increases. Multisite phosphorylation can give rise to ultrasensitive responses, bistability, hysteresis, or cycles, requiring nonlinear interactions and feedback. The framework can be extended to ligand binding, transcription regulation, methylation, acetylation, and ubiquination. A mechanistic model of a cell checkpoint was described, assuming nonsequential multisite phosphorylation by a kinase and dephosphorylation by phosphatase with multiple phosphoforms.
Researchers employed a combination of experimental and mathematical models to decipher network connectivity and signal transduction in the autoinducer-2 quorum sensing system of E. coli, examining negative and positive feedback mechanisms by separating the network into sub-networks. A new unreported negative interaction was hypothesized and tested via a mathematical model, revealing the importance of the Lsr regulator and its role in the E. coli quorum sensing switch. The study utilized a bottom-up approach, analyzing regulatory motifs in isolation by constructing mutant strains and then combining them to represent the system as a complete network. The AI2 uptake mechanism was taken apart and sub-systems analyzed, leading to speculation of new regulatory interactions within the network. A model was built based on experimental results, capturing predictions and simulating the intact network and sub-systems, revealing the mechanistic basis for the Lsr-mediated genetic switch. The study shed light on regulatory pathways within metabolic networks and may guide phenotypes in new ways as quorum sensing is incorporated into biotechnological applications. The approach demonstrated isolating regulatory elements is effective to analyze biological networks with positive and negative regulations, allowing construction of hypothetical models and prediction of new mechanisms.
A study investigated the effect of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths on Plasmodium falciparum infection in school-age children in rural Gabon. The prevalence of Schistosoma haematium, P. falciparum, and co-infection was 30%, 23%, and 9% respectively. Results showed schosomiasis increased the risk of plasium infection, with a combined effect of Trichuris trichi or hookworm infection increasing the risk. The incidence of malaria was 0.51 per person-year, higher in the Schosoma-infected group compared to the non-infected group. Time-to-first malaria event was delayed in children aged 6-10 years with Schosoma haematium. The study suggests that soil-transmitted helminths enhance the risk of P. falcipar infection in schosomias-positive children and schosomias enhances susceptibility to malaria in young children. The findings indicate that schosomias and soil-transmitted helminth co-infections impact malaria outcome in school children and should be considered when designing malaria control programs. In areas of co-endemicity, controlling soil-transmitted helminths and schosomias may be an additional tool for malaria control. The study reveals up to 11% of school children could be co-infected with P. falcipar and S. haematium, highlighting the need to account for co-infections in malaria control strategies.
Inflammation induced by the transcription factor IRF5 limits CD8 T cell expansion and induces HIF1α in dendritic cells during Leishmania infection. IRF5 activates genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL6 and TNF, and its inflammatory response inhibits CD8 T cell expansion and development of short-lived effector cells by inducing HIF1α in dendritic cells. Ablation of HIFα in CD11 cells results in higher frequency of short-lived effector cells, enhanced CD8 T cell expansion, and increased IL12 expression by splenic DCs. Mice with targeted depletion of HIFα in CD11 cells have lower splenic parasite burden, suggesting HIFα induction is an immune evasive mechanism adopted by Leish parasites to establish persistent infections. IR5-mediated inflammation plays a detrimental role in development of protective CD8 T responses and is involved in transcriptional activation of Type I IF genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines. HIFα induction in DC represents an immune-evasive mechanism by Leish to establish chronic infection. IR5 participates in limiting antigen-specific CD8 T expansion at early stages of infection by inducing HIFα expression in DCs. Upregulation of HIFα in DCs results in decreased IL12 and increased IL10 expression. Ablation of HIFα in CD11 cells leads to higher frequency of short-lived effector CD8 cells, enhanced CD8 cell expansion, and reduced parasite burden.
American visceral leishmaniasis is a serious public health problem in endemic regions, associated with high fatality rates and limited effective treatments. A systematic review of 14 studies in Latin America identified prognostic factors for adverse outcomes and death, including jaundice, thrombocytopenia, hemorrhage, HIV coinfection, diarrhea, age under 5 and over 40 years, severe neutropenia, dyspnea, bacterial infections, edema, and low hemoglobin. Leishmania-HIV coinfection was a significant prognostic factor, with coinfected individuals at higher risk of poor prognosis. Platelet transfusion is recommended for patients with platelet counts under 10,000/mm3. The lack of reduction in fatality rates in Brazil is attributed to limitations in therapy, delay in diagnosis, and inadequate management of high-risk individuals. Identification of prognostic factors may aid clinical practice. Undernutrition appears to be a consequence of the disease rather than a risk factor for severity. The strongest predictors were grouped by strength of evidence, summary measures, and heterogeneity of effect sizes, and multivariate analyses results. Development of externally validated prognostic models is prioritized for future investigations to recognize and handle patients at risk of unfavorable outcomes.
Researchers investigated antimony susceptibility of Leishmania isolates collected over a 30-year period in Algeria, where treatment of visceral and cutaneous leishmanias has been based on antimony-containing drugs. A total of 106 isolates, including 88 from Algeria and 18 from France, were analyzed to determine their susceptibility to antimony. The 50% inhibitory concentrations of potassium antimony tartrate and sodium stibogluconate were determined in promastigotes and intramacrophage amastotes. Results showed a trend of increasing antimony susceptibility in visceral leishmanias isolates during the 30-year period, while an increase in frequency of insusceptible phenotypes in cutaneous leishias isolates was observed. Emergence of insuscept phenotypes correlates with inclusion of L. kilicki isolates that cause cutaneous leishias and emerged in Algeria during the last decade. Study provides insight into spatiotemporal dynamics of Leishmania antimony susceptibility and highlights the need for implementation of effective methodology to determine antimony status to detect and prevent dissemination of drug-resistant strains. Epidemiological cutoff values were computed to differentiate Leish species causing cutaneous or visceral leishias susceptible or insuscept to trivalent antimony, with IC50 cutoff values of 23.83 μg/mL and 15.91 μ/mL for visceral and cutaneous leishias respectively.
Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition with a complex etiology, and exposure to foodborne pathogens causing acute gastroenteritis increases the long-term risk of developing the disease. Researchers developed two models to study the comorbidity of acute gastroenteritis caused by Salmonella Typhimurium or Citrobacter rodium in mice colonized with adherent-invasive Escheria coli, a bacterial pathobion linked to Crohn's disease. The study found that disease activity in the post-infectious period after gastroenteritis is driven by tissue-associated expansion of the resident pathobt, with increased immunopathology defects and delays in mucosal restitution following pathogen clearance. These features required resistance to host peptides and a fulant inflammatory response to the enteric pathogen. The results suggest individuals colonized by the pathobt at the time of acute gastroenteritis may be at greater risk for Crohn's disease onset. The data identify the pathob as a tractable disease modifier, which could be exploited in the development of therapeutic interventions following infectious gastroenteritis in at-risk individuals. The study used a co-infection model with a chronic colonization of wild-type mice with the pathob to investigate the link between infectious gastroenteritis and susceptibility to Crohn's disease, showing worsened outcomes in path-colonized mice compared to naive animals exposed to the same infection.
In flowering plants, the egg and sperm cells form within haploid gametophytes, with the female gametophyte of Arabidopsis consisting of two gametic cells, the egg and central cell, flanked by five accessory cells. Researchers isolated the lachesis (lis) mutant, which forms supernumerary egg cells, indicating LIS is involved in a mechanism preventing accessory cells from adopting gametic fate. The temporal and spatial pattern of LIS expression suggests this mechanism is generated in gametic cells. LIS is homologous to yeast splicing factor PRP4, indicating components of the splice apparatus participate in cell decisions. Observations suggest all cells in the female gamophyte are competent to differentiate gametic fate and LIS represses gametic fate in accessory cells. The lis-1 mutant reveals two levels of cell regulation, between gametic and accessory, and between egg and central, with distinct cell fates only manifested after cellularization. Ectopic expression of egg marker in synergids indicates lis-1 synergids differentiate egg attributes at the expense of sygid fate, showing not all aspects of accessory and gametic fate are mutually exclusive. The lis-1 mutation maps to At2g415, encoding a protein with seven WD repeats.
A qualitative study in rural Ethiopia explored barriers to footwear use, crucial for preventing Neglected Tropical Diseases. The PRECEDE-PROCEED model assessed social, behavioral, environmental, and ecological factors influencing shoe-wearing in a podoconiosis-endemic community. Results showed changing norms, with barefoot being seen as shameful and shoes conferring dignity and protection. However, financial constraints limited shoe purchase and quality, leading to preservation for special occasions and delayed provision for children. Structural barriers, including price, unsuitability, and low risk perception, hindered consistent use. Key findings included financial constraints influencing possession, type, age of first use, and frequency of replacement. Additional barriers for podoiosis patients were difficulty finding large sizes and fear of stigma. Despite aspirations to wear shoes, reality differed, with irregular use due to financial constraints, poor access and low risk perception. The study identified barriers amenable to intervention, benefiting Neglected Tropical Disease prevention through shoe distribution, highlighting the importance of targeting individual beliefs and attitudes towards shoe-wearing to reduce disease risk.
The pseudorabies virus (PRV) Us9 protein plays a crucial role in targeting viral capsids and glycoproteins to axons of dissociated sympathetic neurons, with Us9 null mutants defective in anterograde transmission in vivo. The Us9 protein associates with lipid rafts, which is critical for Us-mediated sorting of viral proteins, including glycoproteins gB, gC, and gD, and gE. In infected non-polarized and polarized PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line, Us9 is highly enriched in detergent-resistant membranes. Reducing affinity of Us9 for lipid rafts inhibits antograde transmission from sympathetic neurons to epithelial cells. Association of Us9 with lipid rafts is key for efficient targeting structural proteins to axons and directional spread of PRV from pre-synaptic to post-synaptic neurons in the mammalian nervous system. The Us9 gene product, a small tail-anchored type II membrane protein, directs viral proteins and capsids to axons of infected neurons, essential for anterograde neuron-to-neuron spread. Differentiated PC12 cells recapitulate the Us sorting phenotypes observed in primary neurons, providing an efficacious cell line to study Us biology, specifically Us and lipid rafts. The findings demonstrate that Us9 enrichment in detergent-resistant membranes is cholesterol-dependent and essential for Us-mediated anterograde spread in primary neurons, responsible for axonal sorting of viral capsids and glycoproteins.
Genetically identical cells of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae exhibit phenotypic variation in growth rate and susceptibility to stress, a phenomenon known as nongenetic heterogeneity. Research using genetic and chemical perturbations combined with high-throughput single-cell assays shows that heterogeneity in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels, acting through the conserved Ras/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway and its target factors Msn2 and Msn, underlies this nenetic heterogeneity. Lower cAMP levels correspond to slower growth, and an endogenous reporter of this pathway's activity correlates with growth in individual cells. The paralogs Msn and Msn differ in their roles, with Msn required for heterogeneity in expression of Tsl, a unit of trehalose synthase that contributes to acute-stress tolerance. Perturbing nongenetic heterogeneity by mutating genes or culturing cells with cell-permeable cAMP or PKA inhibitor impacts survival of acute stress, with increased cAMP reducing slower-growing populations and increasing susceptibility, while PKA inhibition slows growth and decreases susceptibility. Loss of Msn reduces the correlation between growth rate and acute-stress survival, suggesting a major role for Msn in nongenetic heterogeneity but residual benefit of slow growth. The study sheds light on genetic control of nenetic heterogeneity, suggesting a means of defeating pathogens or tumor cells by making them uniformly susceptible to treatment. The Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway, acting through Msn and Msn, underlies nongetic heterogeneity in yeast growth and stress tolerance, with variability in cAMP levels leading to heterogeneity in activities of transcription factors and cellular heterogeneity in growth and stress.
Chikungunya virus, an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, causes severe febrile disease in humans and emerged in the Americas in 2013, spreading rapidly throughout the New World. To understand its evolution, researchers studied viral diversity in infected individuals from Guadeloupe and Martinique using deep-sequencing and bioinformatics. Changes in consensus sequence and diverse minority variants were observed, with reduced diversity after passages in cell lines. An infectious clone was constructed, revealing a novel 3' untranslated region structure not found in nature, increasing replication in insect cells. Intra-host analysis identified variants and a new 3'UTR structure, indicating rapid evolution in a short time in a naïve population. Whole-genome analysis from high viremia samples provided an in-depth look at minority variants during the epidemic, identifying novel elements and constructing an infectious clone for studying pathogenesis and adaptation. Results agreed with previous studies placing viruses in the Asian Lineage CHV, clustering with the St Martin CNR36 strain. Deep-sequencing identified high-frequency minority variants, synonymous differences, and a 3' UTR duplication unique among circulating strains worldwide. The study highlights the need for continued surveillance as the epidemic evolves to understand CHV's evolutionary potential.
Researchers have identified UBT, a previously unannotated gene, as a functional regulator of cell growth and mTOR signaling. Reduction of UBT function in cultured hippocampal neurons and PC12 cells promotes neurite outgrowth, while UBT depletion activates mTOR signaling and cell growth. Conversely, UBT overexpression suppresses colony formation in cancer cell lines. Studies in cells and zebrafish models demonstrate UBT inhibits mTOR signaling by stabilizing the mTOR component DEPT. Disruption of the UBT gene results in higher mTOR activity and aggravates HRAS G12-induced neoplasia in zebrafish. UBT depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in xenograft mouse models. Mechanistic studies reveal UBT stabilizes DEPT and regulates DEPT's ubiquination, and UBT disruption increases mTOR activity and aggravates HRAS G12-induced neoplas in zebraf. UBT depletion promotes tumor growth and mTOR signaling in xenograft mice, supporting UBT's involvement in neoplas. NGF treatment in PC12 cells upregulates UBT expression, potentially keeping mTOR activity in check. Overall, findings demonstrate UBT regulates cell growth and neoplas via mTOR signaling.
Researchers have created a comprehensive protein map of Trypanosoma brucei, a protozoan parasite responsible for African trypanosomiasis, by systematically interrogating co-complex interactions of over 335 protein groups in its procyclic life stage. This led to the identification of 128 high-confidence complexes encompassing 716 proteins, including 635 previously unannotated proteins. The complexes correlate with known pathways and co-expressed proteins across the T. bruce life cycle, providing potential functions for uncharacterized proteins. Validation of novel proteins associated with RNA-editing machinery revealed a candidate involved in mitochondrial post-transcription regulation. The study presents the largest proteomics-based interaction map of tryosomat parasites to date, offering a resource for formulating new hypotheses and experimental leads. Tryosomat parasites are highly diverged from well-studied eukotes, resulting in a lack of sequence similarity and inapplicability of homology-based approaches for function identification. Protein maps offer invaluable resource for functional annotation. The study used biochemical fractionation approaches to assign previously uncharacterized proteins to complexes, recapitulating previous findings and indicating essential complexes in life stages of the parasite, such as cytoplasmic ribosomal complex and proteome. The results are available at www.TrypNet.org, serving as a reliable resource for characterization of tryosomat proteins.
Lymph nodes are sites of prolonged bacterial persistence during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in macaques. Tuberculosis is commonly considered a chronic lung disease, however extrapulmonary infection can occur in any organ. Lymph nodes are among the most common sites of extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and thoracic LNs are frequently infected in humans. Researchers surveyed thoracic LNs from Mtb-infected cynomolgus and rhesus macques analyzing PET scans, bacterial burden, LN structure, and immune function. FDG avidity correlated with the presence of live bacteria in LNs at necropsy. Lymph nodes have different trajectories even within the same animal. Rhes macques are more susceptible to Mtb infection than cynomolg macaques due to extensive LN pathology. Mtb grows to the same level in cynolg and rhes LNs, however cynolg macaques control Mtb at later points post-infection while rhes do not. Notably, compared to lung granulomas, LNs are poor at killing Mtb even with treatment. Granomas in LNs lack B cell-rich lymphoid structures, disrupt LN, introduce macrophages serving as Mtb niches and destroy vasculature. Data support LNs serve as sites of antigen presentation, immune activation, and persistence of significant Mtb bacilli. PET-detected FD uptake is associated with bacterial infection in LNs. Rus maca have increased Mtb-infected LNs, higher burden, and pathology than cynolg maca. Extensive disease leads to LN enlargement, impinging airway and lung collapse. Cynomolg LNs control infection, rhes do not. Thoracic LNs have limited ability to kill Mtb, granomas disrupt LN structure, destruction associated with higher Mtb burden.
Researchers have isolated and characterized 47 nematode-infecting microsporidia from wild nematodes, including Caenorhabditis elegans, and related species. Nematida parisii was found to be the most common microsporidia infecting C. elegans in the wild. Six new species in the Nematida genus were identified, and two subclades, Enteropsect and Pancypora, were discovered, which are genetically distinct from Nematida and belong to the main clade of microidia that includes human pathogens. These microidia are horizontally transmitted and primarily infect intestinal cells, except Pancypora epiphaga, which replicates in the epidermis. Host specificity varies, with some microidia infecting Oscheius tipula but not its sister species Osche sp.3, and others infecting Osche sp.3 but not O tipula. N. auseli fails to induce transcription of genes in C. elegans that are induced by other Nematida, suggesting it has mechanisms to prevent host response. The newly isolated species illustrate the diversity and ubiquity of microidian infections in nemodes, providing a resource to investigate host-parasite coevolution in tractable nemode hosts. The dominant microidia in the collection are Nematida parisii and Nematida auseli, with 17 and 10 strains respectively, found in Eleg group Caenorid nemodes.
Chemokine receptors, a subclass of G protein-coupled receptors, play essential roles in the human immune system, involved in cancer metastasis and HIV-infection. Studies show homo- and heterodimers of chemine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 modulate receptor function, and membrane cholesterol affects chemine activity. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal homodimer configurations of CX4, C5 and CCR2 at atomic detail. Homodimer patterns are similar for closely related CC chemine receptors but differ from CX4. Cholesterol modulates homod interfaces in subtype-specific manner. Heterodimers display distinct patterns for CX4/CCR5 and CX4/CCR2. Associations between CX4 and C5 show increased cholesterol sensitivity compared to CX4/CCR2. The study provides a comprehensive overview of interactions between chemine receptors, indicating heterimerization and environment interaction diversify function of closely related G-protein coupled receptors. Closely related CC chemine C5 and C2 share dimerization and cholesterol interactions differing from CX4. Cholesterol plays a role in regulating chemine function and dimerization. TM1 of chemine serves as homodimer hotspot. Cholesterol binds to homolog regions on chemine differing from CX4 sites. Cholesterol increases dynamic range of associations of closely related transmembrane receptors. Heterimerization studied in cholesterol-free and rich membranes shows distinct patterns for CX4/CCR and CX/CCR2.
Systemic leishmaniasis, also known as Kala-Azar, typically presents with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and wasting, but a subclinical form has been identified with one or two of these symptoms missing and other findings such as lymphadenopathy and anemia. A third form, referred to as atypical, has been discovered in patients with depressed immunity and normal laboratory profiles, exhibiting dysfunctional macrophages with Leishmania parasites. 19.4% of 160 patients with depressed immunity were found to have this atypical form, presenting with symptoms masquerading as a condition with functional immune system, predisposing to recurrent infections. Systemic leishiasis has a wider spectrum of signs and symptoms than previously suspected and is more common than diagnosed, affecting not only pediatric but also adult patients. The diagnosis should be considered in patients with unexplained depressed immunity and no obvious immunologic defect. Over 13 years, 160 patients with depressed immunity underwent laboratory investigations and 31 were found to have atypical systemic leishias. The disease is characterized by fever, cachexia, organomegaly, severe wasting and pancytopenia due to parasite dissemination and is fatal if untreated. Two types of systemic leishias exist, classical and subclinical, but the atypical form presents a novel picture of visceral leishmanias.
A genome-wide analysis of human disease alleles reveals that their locations are correlated in paralogous proteins, providing a potential means of identifying polymorphisms with phenotypic consequences. Millions of mutations and polymorphisms in human populations predict disease, reactions to drugs, predisposition to infections, and age-related conditions. Computational approaches have found perturbation of conserved amino acids to be a useful criterion for identifying variants with phenic consequences. This study assembled a collection of known disease-causing variants from OMIM and Human Genome Mutation Database and identified pairs of sequence variants at homologous positions within paralog human proteins. The locations of variants are correlated in paralog proteins and if one member of a variant-pair is disease-causing, its partner is likely to be disease-causing as well. Information about variant-pairs can be used to identify potentially disease-causing variants, extend procedures for polymorphism prioritization, and provide candidates for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Sequence variants co-occur at aligned amino pairs more frequently than expected, suggesting functional constraints on paralog sequences result in coordinated distributions of disease and non-disease-causing variants. Paralog genes and variant-pairs can be used for hypothesis generation and clinical research, identifying new gene candidates and uncharacterized variants likely to have phenic consequences.
Plasmodium falciparum parasites causing severe malaria exhibit altered gene expression of important processes, including surface-encoding var genes. RNA sequencing analysis of 44 parasite isolates from Papuan patients with severe and uncomplicated malaria revealed decreased glycolysis, altered chromatin structure, and transcriptional regulation, reduced surface expression of PfEMP1, and down-regulated chaper proteins in severe malaria parasites. The study identified novel associations between disease severity, Pf1 transcripts, domains, and sequence segments, confirming previously reported associations between expressed Pf1 sequences and severe disease. Contrary to previous findings, genes encoding proteins involved in Pf1 surface expression were downregulated in severe malaria, including skeleton-binding protein. Severe malaria patients had lower antibodies to Pf1 and recognized fewer Pf1s than uncomplicated patients, consistent with circulating parasites being older in uncomplicated patients. The expression of a conserved subset of Pf1s by severe parasites may explain why immunity to severe malaria is acquired more rapidly than uncomplicated. Specific Pf1 domains binding host receptors and expressed in severe malaria were identified. The findings will inform vaccine targets for severe malaria and parasite adaptation to the host environment.
Researchers used adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors to deliver anti-SIV monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in IgG form to rhesus monkeys, achieving persisting levels as high as 270 μg/ml. However, host responses to the delivered antibody were observed in 9 of 12 monkeys, limiting the concentration that could be achieved. Despite the absence of detectable neutralizing activity, the AAV-delivered antibody showed protective effects against SIV239 challenge, including lowering viral load peak and set point, and delaying time to peak viral load. These effects were statistically significant. One monkey with the highest level of delivered antibody completely resisted successive SIV challenges. The study demonstrates the promise of this approach for HIV-1 prevention, but highlights the need to overcome anti-antibody responses. AAV vectors can deliver proteins at stable levels for years and have proven safe in human therapy trials. Potent neutralizing anti-HIV monoclon antibodies have been characterized, effectively neutralizing over 90% of circulating HIV-1 strains, representing various specificities. The study used AAV-mediated delivery of full-length immunoglobulins to rhes macaques, measuring humoral responses to A-delivered mAb by antibody capture ELISA, coating plates with purified 5L Ig1 and 4 Ig1, and incubating with antisera from A-immunized monkeys.
Researchers investigated the conformational relaxation properties of two motor proteins, myosin V and kines K1, using a coarse-grained elastic network approximation and found that the linearity assumption is deficient for ligand-induced conformation motions and can be violated for thermal fluctuations. The normal mode description fails to describe functional mechanochemical motions in K1, indicating that assumptions of protein dynamics theory may need reconsideration. Nonlinearity is characteristic for both macromolecules and normal mode description is not applicable. Conformation relaxation in myos can be qualitatively characterized by normal modes, but breaks down for K1. Despite breakdown, ordered and robust mechanochemical motions are observed, following energetic activation and conformation processes. Large-scale conformation changes occur due to ligand binding, often considered in linear theory and normal approximation. Numerical investigations revealed nonlinearities play essential role in both proteins, dominating functional mechchemical motions in K1, which differ from normal predictions. Well-defined conformation paths, robust against perturbations, are found in both motors, indicating nonlinearity does not imply irregular motions. Results suggest reconsideration of protein dynamics theory assumptions, as single or superposition of modes does not approximate strongly nonlinear dynamics.
Research has shown that caveolins and cavins, components of caveolae, regulate clathrin-independent endocytosis. Cavin-1 and Cavin-3, but not Cavin-2 or Cavin-4, inhibit the clathrin-independent/GPI-AP enriched endosomal compartment (CL/GC) endocytic pathway independently of caveola formation. Caveolin-1 also inhibits the CL/GC pathway upon over-expression, leading to reduced formation of early CL/GC carriers. The CL/GC pathway is upregulated in cells lacking Caveolin-1 or with reduced Cavin-1 and Cavin-3 expression. Inhibition by caveolins can be mimicked by isolated caveolin scaffolding domain and is associated with perturbed lipid diffusion. In the absence of cavins and caveae, Caveolin-1 is endocosed preferentially through the CL/GC pathway, losing polarization and sorting attributes. Non-caveolar Cavin-1 acts as a modulator for the key regulator of the CL/GC pathway, Cdc42. Caveolar proteins, independent of caveae, inhibit CL endocytosis, and when incorporated into caveae, also inhibit CL endocyt. The inhibitory roles of caveae, caveins, and cavins suggest an important role in regulating the CL/GC pathway, affecting spatial organization and physiological consequences in migrating cells and muscle tissue.
Two-component systems in bacteria, archaea, and plants play crucial roles in sensing and responding to environmental stimuli, typically employing a histidine kinase that phosphorylates a Receiver (REC) domain on a conserved aspartate (Asp) residue. However, some REC domains lack this residue, known as Aspartate-Less Receiver (AL) domains. AL domains are surprisingly common, enriched when attached to rare effector outputs, and have reorganized active pockets to take on a constitutive regulatory role or accommodate signals other than phosphorylation, retaining post-phosphorylation mechanisms and dimer interface. The most common substitutions at the conserved phospho-As site are Ser, Thr, and Tyr, which hold potential for phospho-regulation by bacterial Ser/Thr kinases. Some atypical REC domains have diversified to accommodate signaling inputs, including small molecules and Ser/Thr phosphorylation through eukaryotic-like kinases, regulating cell envelope functions and virulence. Approximately 4% of REC domains lack the conserved phosphorylatable residue, with 2,976 unique REC-containing proteins identified as ALRs. AL sequences comprise ~4% of REC domains in bacteria, with Arg and Cys also found at the phosphoAs position, having potential for phospho-regulation and sensing environmental changes. The study defines ALRs as an atypical REC subclass, providing insights into shared activation mechanisms between AL and REC domains.
Researchers developed a fully-virulent oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) retargeted to tumor cells expressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and armed with IL-12, which showed high safety and efficacy in immunocompetent mice. The virus inhibited growth of primary HER2-expressing tumors and protected against contralateral untreated tumors, providing evidence of an abscopal immunotherapeutic effect. Analysis revealed the virus unleashed an immunosuppressive tumor environment, inducing immunomodulatory cytokines and promoting Th1 polarization. Tumor-infiltrating cells, including CD4 and CD335, increased in all responders, while CD8, Fox3, and CD141 increased and CD11 decreased in IL-12-armed virus-treated mice. The response included a break of tolerance towards HER2 and tumor cells, underscoring a systemic immunotherapeutic vaccine effect. The study demonstrated the potential of fully-virulent retargeted oncolytic HSVs as a novel anticancer agent with low toxicity and low impact on quality of life, meeting the need for innovative treatments. The results highlighted the virus's ability to elicit a local immune response, lymphocyte migration, and activation, and distant immunotherapeutic efficacy, differing from deleted or attenuated oncolytic viruses in clinical use.
Researchers investigated the susceptibility of vector-specific CD4 T cells induced by different HIV vaccine vectors to HIV infection, comparing Ad5 and ALVAC vectors. Ad5-specific CD4 cells were readily susceptible to HIV, while ALAC-specific CD4 cells were substantially less susceptible to both R5 and X4 HIV in vitro. The lower susceptibility of ALAC-specific CD4 cells was associated with reduced surface expression of HIV entry co-receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. Phenotypic analysis showed ALAC-specific CD4 cells displayed a strong Th1 phenotype, producing higher levels of IFN-γ and CCL. ALV and Ad vectors induced distinct profiles of vector-specific CD8 vs CD4 T-cell proliferative responses, with ALV inducing CD8-cell proliferation and Ad5 inducing CD4-cell proliferation. Depletion of ALV-induced CD8 cells led to increased HIV infection of ALV-specific CD4 cells, suggesting a protective role of ALV-specific CD8 cells. Data show vector-specific CD4 cells induced by different HIV vectors manifest differences in susceptibility to HIV infection, with ALAC-specific CD4 being less susceptible than Ad-specific CD4. The findings highlight the importance of evaluating anti-vector responses in HIV vaccination and suggest Ad5 vectors may be dampened by high susceptibility of CD4 cells it induces.
X-chromosome inactivation, the transcriptional silencing of one X copy per female somatic cell, is universal among therian mammals, yet the choice of X to silence varies among species. X-inactivation strategies range from paternal X-inactivation, rendering females haploid for maternally inherited alleles, to random X-inactivation, equalizing expression of maternally and paternally inherited alleles in each tissue. A theoretical genetic analysis of X-inactivation evolution considers conditions of dominance, linkage, recombination, and sex-differential selection, indicating a critical interaction between allelic and sex-differential selection selects for a range of X-inactivation strategies. Random X-inactivation is favored over paternal X-inactivation when alleles deleterious to female fitness are recessive. Evolutionary transitions from paternal to random X-inactivation increase relative female fitness at the expense of male fitness. Sex-differential selection influences the diversification of X-inactivation, with stronger selection against deleterious alleles in males decreasing the proportion of deleious alleles on paternally derived X. Conditions for evolving biased inactivation patterns are permissive, with sex-differential favoring evolution of unequal expression of matern and patern X. The study provides a framework for predicting chromosome-wide expression of X-linked genes, leading to predictions for future studies of allele-specific expression variation.
Researchers investigated the antiviral potential of human zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP) against three flaviviruses: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZV). ZAP overexpression blocked JEV infection, but not DENV or ZV, and depletion of endogenous ZAP enhanced JEV replication. ZAP hampered JEV translation and targeted viral RNA for 3′-5 RNA exosome-mediated degradation. The zincfinger motifs of ZAP were essential for RNA targeting and anti-JEV activity. JEV 3-UTR, especially the region with dumbbell structures and high content of CG dinucle, was mapped to bind ZAP and confer sensitivity to Z. The study identified JEV as the first ZAP-sensitive flavivirus, suggesting ZAP acts as an intrinsic antiviral factor through specific RNA binding to fight JEV infection. ZAP precipitated JEV RNA, indicating association between ZAP and JEV, and zincfinger domains were essential for antiviral activity. The antiviral mechanism involves 3-5 RNA degradation by the exosome complex. The study provides insight into the antiviral mechanism of ZAP against viral RNA without 3-poly tail and suggests ZAP may boost innate responses during JEV infection by regulating type I IF and proinflammatory cytokines.
Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a highly pathogenic virus that causes severe disease, including hemorrhagic fever and encephalitis, and is endemic to parts of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. A study in C57/BL6 mice compared the host response to infection with wild-type strain ZH501 and vaccine strain MP-12, showing that animals infected with MP-12 survived with minimal clinical disease and cytokine response, while Z501 infection was lethal, causing lymphocyte and platelet depletion and a strong cytokine response. RVV is hepatotropic, with significant histological data supporting liver necrosis and hepatitis, and a chemokine response indicating infiltration of immunoreactive cells, such as neutrophils. In brains of Z501 infected mice, a chemine and pro-inflammatory cytokine response was evident, with little pathology indicating meningoencephalis. Data suggest RVV pathogenesis in mice is associated with loss of liver function due to necrosis and hepatitis, and long-term disease is neurologic in nature, supported by observations in humans and the BALB mouse model. Microscopic examination revealed hepatic necrosis, loss of sinusoidal integrity, hemorrhage, and viral antigen. The study characterized the relationship between host response and viral pathogenicity, evaluating cytokines, chemines, and clinical parameters, demonstrating MP12 infects and replicates without acute disease, while Z501 is highly pathogenic, with significant immune response, despite only 11 amino acid differences between MP12 and Z548 and high homology between Z501 and Z548.
Chemotherapy-induced CCL20 hinders the therapeutic efficacy of breast cancer treatment, particularly in triple-negative breast cancer, by promoting chemoresistance. CCL20 is significantly elevated during taxane chemotherapy in patients with non-pathologic complete response and promotes self-renewal and maintenance of breast cancer stem cells through PKCζ and p38 MAP-mediated activation of NF-κB pathway, increasing taxane resistance. NF-κB activation also increases ABC1 expression, leading to extracellular efflux of taxane. A positive feedback loop between NF-κB and C20 sustains chemoresistance in cancer cells. C20 can be a predictive marker for taxane response, and blocking C20 or its pathway may reverse taxane resistance. Taxane-induced C20 promotes self-renew of breast cancer stem cells through NF-κB activation, mediated by PKC and p38 activity. Combination of taxane and adjuvant inhibition of ABC1 may improve chemotherapeutic efficacy. C20 activates NF-κ through PKC/p38, promoting ABC1 expression and chemoresistance. Activated NF-κ regulates C20, enhancing its effect on chemoresistance. C20 promotes proliferation, invasion, and tumor growth in TNBC and exhibits resistance to taxane, playing a pivotal role in breast malignancy. C20 enhances self-renew and stem characteristics of cancer stem cells, promoting chemoresistance.
Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite that infects virtually all nucleated cells in warm-blooded animals, relying on its ability to transport GRA proteins from secretory organelles into the host cell to manipulate and co-opt crucial cell functions. Researchers identified a novel protein complex essential for effector translocation across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane, including MYR2 and MYR, which play a crucial role in translocation of a subset of GRAs into the host. These proteins are secreted into the parasitophorous vacole space, co-localize with PV membranes, and are membrane-associated, with MY3 stably associating with MY1. A translocon-based model of effector transport is proposed, where fusing intrinsically disordered effectors to a structured domain blocks transport of other effectors. The study reveals a complex at the parasitophorous vacole membrane essential for effector translocation into the host. Toxlasma's ability to infect and manipulate the host is dependent on its ability to transport GRA proteins, including GRA16 and GRA24, which are secreted into the parasophorous vacole and transported across the membrane into the host. The machinery for translocation across the parasophorous vacole membrane is not well understood but appears to differ from that of Plasmodium, with MYR proteins having no homologs in Plmod and the PTEX machinery not functionally conserved in Toxlasma. The discovery of MY2 and MYR provides insight into the requirements for translocation across Toxlasma's parasophorous vacuole membrane and parasite virulence.
The origin recognition complex (ORC) plays a crucial role in initiating DNA replication, and the papillomavirus (PV) genome, resembling a mini-chromosome, relies on the E2 protein to recruit the E1 helicase for replication. The PV replication program consists of three stages: initial amplification, cell cycle maintenance, and differentiation. Researchers found that human and bovine PV E2 proteins bind to ORC2, but OR2 is not detected at the viral origin. Depleting OR2 enhanced PV replication in transient models and keratinocytes with episomes, but had no effect on integrated genomes. E1 and E2 occupancy increased at the origin after OR2 silencing, suggesting OR2 suppresses E2 replicative function. Overexpressing HPV2 decreased OR2 at mammalian replication origins, indicating E2 restricts pre-RC assembly competing for host replication complexes. OR2 restricts viral replication during the maintenance phase, while elevated E2 levels during differentiation subvert OR loading and DNA synthesis at cellular origins. Experiments showed OR2 co-immunoprecipitates with BPV and HPV E2, with the N-terminal transactivation domain sufficient for OR2 association. OR2 depletion increased viral copy number in transient assays and keratinocytes with episomal genomes, but had no effect on integrated genomes. Repeated ChIP assays failed to detect endogenous OR2 near PV origins, while OR2 was detectable near mammalian replication origins.
A study investigated the presence of Brucella DNA in bovine milk in urban and peri-urban areas of Dushan, Tajikistan, where brucellosis is a common zoonotic disease. Brella DNA was detected in 10.3% of 564 cow milk samples using IS711-based real-time PCR, with 100% of seropositive cows and 8.3% of seronegative cows testing positive. Sequence analysis of the rpoB gene identified B. abortus in one cow and likely B. melitensis in another. Discrepancies between serology and real-time PCR results highlight the need for complementary diagnostic strategies to detect false seronegative individuals. Vaccination of cattle with S19 and small ruminants with Rev1 may be needed to control Brucella infections, but further research is required to understand circulating Bruc spp among livestock in the region. None of the cattle had been vaccinated against bruclosis due to lack of a national control program in Tajistan. The study analyzed 564 milk extracts from 326 herds in 21 villages, with GPS coordinates recorded for all but two herds. The results show widespread occurrence of Brella DNA in bovine milk, emphasizing the need for further investigation and control measures to prevent transmission of this zoonotic disease.
Chromosome and genome stability are crucial for normal cell function, and instability often correlates with disease and dysfunction of DNA repair mechanisms. The pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici has accessory chromosomes that are highly unstable during meiosis and mitosis, transcriptionally repressed, and show enrichment of repetitive elements and heterochromatic histone methylation marks. To elucidate the role of heterochromatin on genome stability, the genes encoding methyltransferases for H3K9me and HK27 were deleted, and a double mutant was generated. Whole genome sequencing, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq were used to compare changes in genome and chromatin structure and differences in gene expression between mutant and wildtype strains. Loss of H3K9me resulted in dramatic chromatin reorganization, genome rearrangements, and activation of transposable elements, while loss of H3K27 increased stability of accessory chromosomes without large changes in gene activity. H3K9me is important for genome stability as it disallows H3K27 in constitutive heterochromatin, whereas H27 reduces stability generating a "metable" state for quasi-essential regions of the genome. The findings provide a basis for studies on the influence of heterochromatin on structural rearrangements using Z trici as a model and suggest TE-mediated rearrangements may be involved in genetic variability in Z trici isolates and drivers of evolution in various species.
Evaluation of cost-effective strategies for rabies post-exposure prophylaxis in low-income countries reveals that post-exposure prophylaxis is a cost-effective intervention, with costs ranging from $200 to less than $60 per death averted. Switching from intramuscular administration to intradermal regimens results in significant savings in vaccine volume required, mitigating shortages and reducing costs. Financing mechanisms can make post-exposure prophylaxis more affordable, subsidizing costs for those in need and supporting existing rabies control programs. A universal switch to intradermal delivery improves affordability and accessibility, reducing human deaths and being economical for healthcare providers. Research into preserving vaccines and preventing contamination enables more economical use, including larger vials. Intradermal delivery is more cost-effective than intramuscular in averting rabies cases and saving lives, with clinic capacity affecting vial sharing and cost-effectiveness. Rabies post-exposure vaccination is essential but often out of reach due to financial constraints, with shortages common in developing countries and substantial costs for patients. Changes in post-exposure costs improve affordability, providing incentives without compromising budgets, reducing the burden by increasing vaccine availability for the poor. Incremental cost-effect ratios are calculated in dollars per rabies averted, considering direct medical costs from the provider's perspective.
Toxoplasma gondii, an obligate intracellular parasite, replicates within mammalian cells in a parasitophorous vacuole that does not fuse with host organelles. The parasite exploits host lipid droplets, ubiquitous fat storage organelles, for nutrient acquisition. Toxlas replication is reduced in host cells depleted of lipid droplets or impaired in TAG lipolysis and fatty acid catabolism. Infected cells show increased lipid droplet numbers and expression of associated genes until parasite replication onset. The parasitophorous vacuole is surrounded by host lipid droplets and Toxlas accesses stored lipids, incorporating them into its own membranes. Exogenous oleic acid stimulates host lipid biogenesis, resulting in overaccumulation of neutral lipids in the parasite. To access lipids, Toxlas internalizes host lipid droplets within the vacuole, some associated with Rab7, becoming wrapped in an intravacuolar network. Mutant parasites impaired in network formation display diminished lipid uptake capacity. Parasites lacking phospholipase are less proficient in salvaging lipids, indicating the network's role in lipid release. The study highlights Toxoplas reliance on host lipid droplets and its capability to scavenge neutral lipids. Toxoplas takes advantage of host lipolytic activity and fatty acid β-oxidation, redistributing lipid droplets to the parasitophorous vacole membrane. Exogenous oleic acid stimulates Tox to salvage lipids from host compartments, including lipid droplets, resulting in overaccumulation of various lipid species.
Fasciolosis, a disease caused by liver flukes Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica, is considered an emerging zoonotic disease with increased human infections. Chemotherapy is the main control measure and triclabazole is the preferred drug, but resistance has been reported in several countries. Researchers searched a library of flavonoid derivatives for inhibitors of key Fasciola hepatica cystine proteases Fh3 and Fh1, identifying chalcones with phenyl and naphtyl groups as good catheps L inhibitors. One compound, C34, tightly bounds to juvenile Fh3 with an IC50 of 5.6 μM and is a slow-reversible inhibitor interacting with the Cys-His catalytic dyad and key residues. C34 induces reduction in NE ability to migrate through gut and loss of motility leading to death in vitro without being cytotoxic to bovine cells. This study identified chalcon as novel inhibitors of the main catheps secreted by juvenile and adult liver flukes, opening avenues for development of novel agents to control fluke infection. Flavonoids have shown catps L cystine protease inhibitory activity and some natural flavoids have fasciolic activity, but no in vitro screening of non-peptid inhibitors of Fasciola catps has been reported. The findings contribute to the design of novel drugs to control fluke infection.
Researchers investigated how bipolar cells in the retina transmit fast and slow changes in light intensity through separate neural pathways using in vivo imaging. The study found that the volume of the synaptic terminal is an intrinsic property that contributes to different temporal filters, with individual cells transmitting multiple signals through terminals of varying sizes. Smaller terminals generate faster and larger calcium transients to trigger vesicle release with higher gain, followed by more profound adaptation, and transmit higher frequencies more effectively. Modeling calcium dynamics indicated that variations in presynaptic compartment volume contribute to differences in response dynamics. The results show that one neuron can transmit different temporal components of the visual signal through synaptic terminals with varying geometries and adaptational properties. The presynaptic signal is a strongly rectifying function of light intensity, causing a steady increase in calcium graded with contrast. Voltage-dependent channels in the synaptic terminals are responsible for the major non-linear transformation of the visual signal. Smaller terminals respond to light with higher release rates, and measurements demonstrated rectification in synaptic output due to increased variance in stimulus. An adaptation index quantified time-dependent changes in synaptic gain, predicting rate of vesicle release depression in smaller terminals.
A novel probabilistic method for detecting synapses from multiplex fluorescence microscopy data has been developed and tested using conjugate array tomography datasets, which provide voxel-conjugate fluorescence and electron microscopy images of individual synapses. The method accepts molecular-morphological synapse models as queries and delivers a volumetric map of probability that each voxel represents a synapse. Evaluation against electron microscopy-annotated data shows the algorithm detects synapses from fluorescence data as successfully as human annotators and reproduces known features of cortical synapse distributions. This approach enables data-driven discovery of new synapse types and density. The probabilistic synapse detector may be useful for analysis of standard confocal and super-resolution fluorescence images where electron microscopy validation is impractical. Reliable high-throughput methods for large-scale synapse detection will help analyze images containing neural arbors and discern relationships between synapses and parent neurons. Electron microscopy remains the gold standard for synapse detection due to nanometer resolution necessary for unambiguous identification of synaptic features. The probabilistic algorithm has precedent in detectors for Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscope images and addresses challenges in single-synapse profiling of diverse populations.
Zinc is a vital element essential for the function of approximately 3,000 cellular proteins and plays a crucial role in various physiological processes including nucleic acid metabolism, gene expression, signal transduction, cell division, immune and nervous system function, wound healing, and apoptosis. Impairment of zinc homeostasis disrupts key cellular functions resulting in various pathologies. Mammalian zinc transport proceeds via two families, ZnT and ZIP, with ZnT2 responsible for vesicular accumulation and zinc secretion into milk during lactation. The mechanism of Zn2 has been unknown, however it has been suggested that zinc transport is coupled to the proton gradient in acidic vesicles. This study demonstrates computationally and experimentally that Zn2 is a proton-coupled zinc antiporter with a stoichiometry of two protons per zinc ion. Using Bafilomycin A, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar proton ATPase, abolished Zn2-dependent transport into intracellular vesicles, while LysoTracker and LysoHporin showed vesicular pH alkalization upon Zn2 overexpression and exogenous zinc addition. Computational calculations propose Zn2 functions as electroneutral vesicular exchanger concentrating zinc in acidic vesicles at the expense of proton extrusion to cytoplasm. The findings indicate Zn2 is a proton force-driven electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger with a 2H+/Zn+ ion stoichiometry.
Researchers have identified 14-3-3 proteins as interaction partners of Exonuclease 1 (Ex1) in yeast and mammalian cells, playing a crucial role in regulating Ex1-dependent processing of stalled replication forks. Yeast 14-3-deficient cells fail to induce Mec1-dependent Ex1 hyperphosphorylation and accumulate Ex1-dependent single-stranded DNA gaps at stalled forks, leading to persistent checkpoint activation and recovery defects. 14-3 proteins promote fork progression under limiting nucleotide concentrations and assist in controlling the phosphorylation status of Ex1 and unknown targets, promoting fork stability and restart in response to DNA stress. Phosphorylation restrains yeast Ex1 activity and 14-3 proteins may act as a platform for Ex1 phosphorylation control. The study proposes 14-3 proteins as central integrators of signals regulating fork stability and processing. Accumulation of single-stranded DNA gaps in 14-3-deficient cells is completely suppressed by Ex1 deletion but does not reflect suppression of hydroxyurea sensitivity or defective fork progression. This suggests 14-3 proteins regulate additional targets during replication through phosphorylation modulation. The data indicate 14-3 proteins prevent unscheduled Ex1 activity behind stalled forks in a checkpoint-proficient background. Overall, the findings shed light on processes at stalled replication forks and propose 14-3 proteins as key regulators of fork stability and processing.
Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) play opposing roles in HIV-1 infection, suppressing replication and promoting immunopathogenesis. In humanized mice, HIV-1 infection leads to persistent infection, type I interferon (IF-I) induction, immune activation, and depletion of leukocytes, including CD4 T cells. Depletion of pDC prior to HIV-1 infection abolishes IF-I induction and interferon-stimulated genes during acute infection, resulting in increased HIV-1 replication. However, cell death induced by highly pathogenic HIV-1 is reduced in pDC-depleted mice. During chronic infection, pDC depletion reduces IF-I induction, associated with elevated HIV-1 replication, but decreases immune cell depletion in lymphoid organs, not blood. Increased cell numbers in lymphoid organs correlate with reduced HIV-induced death in leukocytes, including CD4 cells. pDC produce IF-I to inhibit HIV-1 replication but enhance pathogenesis by promoting cell death of human leukocytes, including CD4 and CD8 T cells. These findings suggest pDC depletion and IF-I blockade may provide novel strategies for treating HIV-1 patients with persistent immune activation despite antiretroviral treatment. The study used a monoclonal antibody to deplete human pDC in lymphoid organs in humanized mice, demonstrating the critical role of pDC as IF-I producers in suppressing HIV-1 replication during early infection.
Sulforaphane inhibits HIV infection of macrophages through Nrf2. Marburg virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, and Dengue virus activate and benefit from the expression of the transcription regulator nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2. Sulforane, produced in cruciferous vegetables, mobilizes Nrf2 to reprogram cellular expression, blocking HIV infection in primary macrophages but not T cells. siRNA depletion of N2 boosted HIV infectivity in macroages, reducing the antiviral effects of Sulane treatment. Sulane blocks infection after entry but before 2-LTR circle formation, similar to type I interferon-induced proteins SAMHD1 and MX2, without upregulating them. Silencing Nrf with siRNA increased antiviral responses, contrasting with boosting Nrf countering infection in macroages. Sulane triggers a block against HIV in myeloid-derived cells, including macroages, through Nrf2. Depletion of N2 increased lucase activity, indicating N2 is detrimental to HIV in macroages, with basal N2 sufficient for antiviral activity. Sulane stops infection in macroages by blocking after transcription before 2-LTR formation, relying on N2, a transcription regulator of antioxidant genes. Macrophages express N2 to maintain partial restriction without Sulane. The lack of antiviral action in numerous cell types and dependence on N2 indicates Sulane is not inhibiting directly modifying viral or cellular components.
A cross-sectional study in rural Kenya found 76.2% of 390 pregnant women were infected with at least one geohminth, with 52.3% infected with Ascaris lumbricoid, 39.5% with hookworm, and 29% with Trichuris trichi. Infection was associated with use of unprotected water and lack of drinking water treatment. Hookworm infection was linked to lower mid arm circumference and lower hemoglobin in women with high egg counts. Ascaris lumbric infection reduced malaria risk in gravidae 2 and 3 women. Despite high prevalence, few detrimental effects were observed, suggesting routine antihminth treatment during antenatal visits may be beneficial, with further evaluation needed on pregnancy and birth outcomes.
Mycolone, a macrolide produced by the pathogen Mycobacterium ulcerans, has cytotoxic, analgesic, and immunomodulatory properties. It blocks Sec61-dependent production of pro-inflammatory mediators by immune cells. Research investigated mycolone's effects on inflammatory responses of nervous cell subsets involved in pain transmission and maintenance, and neuroinflammation associated with chronic pain. Sensory neurons, Schwann cells, and microglia isolated from mice were assessed for mycolone cytotoxicity and immunomodulatory activity. Prolonged exposure to mycolone induced cell death, while nanomolar concentrations suppressed production of pro-inflammatory mediators without affecting viability. Mycolone prevented pro-inflammatory polarization of microglia, contributing to neuroinflammation. A rat model of neuropathic pain induced by sciatic nerve constriction was used to test mycolone's impact. Daily spinal injection decreased local inflammatory cytokine production without detectable cytotoxicity. The study provides in vitro and in vivo evidence that mycol suppresses inflammatory responses of sensory neurons, Schwann and microgl, without affecting viability. Mycolone-mediated analia may be explained by anti-inflammatory properties. Mycol blocks Sec61 in immune cells, contributing to analgesia by suppressing inflammation. Systemically-delivered mycolone protected mice against chemical-induced inflammation and acute pain. Mycol suppresses pro-inflammatory mediators by microgl, limiting neuroinflamm associated with neuropic pain.
Human African trypanosomiasis, a lethal disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambi, exhibits varying clinical outcomes in its human hosts in West Africa, including acute progression to second stage, spontaneous cure, and regulation of parasitemia at low levels. A study in Guinea investigated the association between candidate gene polymorphisms and disease outcome in 425 individuals, comprising 232 cases, 79 with long-lasting positive serology but negative parasitology, and 114 controls. Analysis of 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms in eight genes revealed IL6 rs1819 allele associated with lower risk of progressing from latent to active disease, while MIF rs36071 and rs12459 alleles were associated with increased risk but not significant after Bonferroni correction. APOL1 G2 allele was associated with higher risk and APOL1 polymorphism with lower risk of developing the disease. No associations were found with other genes. The results show host genetics modulate Tryosoma brucei gambense infection, with IL6 rs1819 associated with lower risk of progressing to active disease, enhancing understanding of host-parasite interactions and potentially leading to new control tools. The study was part of the TryoGEN consortium to investigate host genetics in disease susceptibility across African populations.
The Singapore Sequencing Indian Project has produced a publicly available genomic resource by sequencing the genomes of 38 South Asian Indians from Singapore at a target coverage of 30X. The genetic structure and diversity of these samples were compared against samples from the Singapore Sequencing Malay Project and populations in Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes Project. The results showed that the Singapore Indian samples exhibited greater intra-population genetic diversity and possessed higher heterozygous-homozygous genotype ratio than other Asian populations. When compared against a panel of well-defined Indians, the genetic makeup of the samples was closely related to South Indians. However, eight samples were assigned to mitochondrial haplogroups predominantly present in Europeans and possessed higher European admixture than the remaining samples. An analysis of the relatedness between the samples with archaic hominins identified higher ancient admixture in East Asian populations. Principal component analysis revealed greater genetic heterogeneity in Asian Indians from northern parts of India, while those from the south were more homogeneous. The majority of Singapore Indians descended from immigrants from south India who settled after Singapore became a trading center in the 19th century. The data serves as a valuable complement to South Asian samples in Phase 3 of 100 Genomes.
Burkholderia pseudomallei is inherently resistant to aminoglycosides and macrolides, primarily due to the AmrAB-Opr efflux pump. Researchers investigated the molecular basis of aminoglycoside susceptibility in Thai strains 708, 218a, and 379a. qRT-PCR revealed the absence of amrB transcripts in 708 and reduced levels in 218a and 379. Serial passage on gentamicin yielded 218 and 379 mutants resistant to aminlycosides and macrol, whereas 708 mutants could not be obtained. The resistance in 218 and 379 was due to upregulation of amAB-opr expression by an unknown mechanism. A PCR strategy revealed the amAB-opr operon was missing in 708, associated with a 70kb genetic deletion, including malleobactin, cobalamin synthesis, anaerobic arginine deimin pathway, and type fimbria genes. Whole genome sequencing confirmed the absence of these genes in 708. Despite missing putative virulence genes, 708 was fully virulent in a murine melioidosis model. Strain 708 may be a candidate for genetic experiments using select agent-compliant antibiotics, validating laboratory-constructed amAB-opr mutants. Deletion of amAB-opA resulted in loss of amincoside and macrol resistance, which could be complemented back to wild-type levels by chromosomally integrated mini-Tn expressing amA+B opr. The amAB-op operon is absent in 708 and insufficiently expressed in 218 and 379 to confer resistance.
Researchers investigated the early differentiation of naive CD4 T helper cells into Th1 and Th2 states by analyzing single-cell transcripts and quantifying immunofluorescence. Contrary to the expected mutually exclusive expression of antagonistic transcription factors, they observed ubiquitous co-expression of these factors in individual cells at high levels distinct from basal co-expression during lineage priming. Cytokines were expressed in a small subpopulation of cells, independent of transcription factor expression. Cell-to-cell variation in cokine expression during early T cell differentiation was larger than in the fully differentiated state. Upon inhibition of cokine signaling, mutual exclusion of antagonistic transcription factors was observed, revealing an intracellular network overruled by extracellular cines. The results suggest CD4 cells acquire a mixed Th1/Th2 state during early differentiation, instructed by extracellular cines. The interplay between extracellular and intracellular components in Th1/2 differentiation may be a strategy to buffer against noisy cok expression. Transcription factor may be responsible for decondensing the cok locus during CD4 activation. Mixed Th1Th phenotypes were also observed by other groups using different approaches. Lack of mutual exclusivity applies to Tbet, Gata3, Foxp3, and RORt. Ubiquitous Tbx21 and Gata coexpression is associated with Th1 and Th2 cok production. Ifng and Il4 are transcribed in rare populations independently of Tbx21 and Gata levels. Induction of Ifng by Tbet and repression by Gata can be neglected during early CD4 cell differentiation.
Researchers have identified PAQR-2 as a crucial regulator of fatty acid desaturation during cold adaptation in C. elegans, an organism that typically thrives at temperatures above 15°C. PAQR-2 is homologous to insulin-sensitizing adiponectin receptors in mammals and is essential for growth at low temperatures. Screening for PAQR-2 suppressors revealed mutations in genes involved in phosphatidylcholine synthesis and fatty acid metabolism, including ce-1, pt-1, sams-1, ech-7, hac-1, mdt-15, nhr-49, and sbp-1. The study shows that PAQR2, phosphatidylcholines, SBP-1, and Δ9-desaturases form a cold adaptation pathway regulating unsaturated acids to maintain membrane fluidity at low temperatures. PAQR2 suppressors normalize saturated acid levels, and detergents increasing membrane fluidity can rescue PAQR2 mutants. PAQR2 increases unsaturation is essential for adaptation to 15°C in C.elegans. Mechanistically, PAQR2 is a transmembrane receptor regulating fatty acid metabolism and tail maintenance during cold adaptation. The study suggests PAQR2 modulates Δ9 desaturases via phosphidylcholine levels and SBP1. Low concentrations of detergents correcting PA2 cold and tail phenotypes mimic effects of fatty acid desaturation on membrane fluidity. PAQR2 is a transmembrane protein essential for Δ desaturation regulation during cold adaptation.
Herpes viruses are prevalent human pathogens with complex double-stranded DNA, but the structure of their genome packaging and release machinery remains poorly understood. Tailed bacteriophages, which share a common evolutionary origin with herpesviruses, have well-characterized machinery for genome release through a portal and transfer into host cells via a tail-like apparatus at the vertex. Electron cryotography of human simplex type-1 (HSV-1) virions reveals a previously unsuspected feature at the portal, extending across the tegument to connect the capsid and viral membrane, suggesting a role in genome release into the nucleus and virion architecture. Evolutionary links between tailed bacteriophages and herpesviruses imply equivalent machinery may be present in herpesvirus particles. The HSV-1 portal has a similar position and subunit organization to tailed bacteriophages, supporting this assumption. A previously unrecognized feature within the tegument of HSV-1 virions may mediate interactions between the portal and cellular components, analogous to tailed bacteriophages. HSV-1 is a well-characterized virus with a 200 MDa T=16 icosahedral capsid containing dsDNA, surrounded by a proteinaceous tegument and glycoprotein envelope. The infectious HSV-1 particle varies in size, but the capsid has a constant diameter of 125 Å with main features including pentons, hexons, and triplexes. The newly identified feature may play a role in genome release into the nucleus and is important for virion architecture.
Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA) and recombinant Omega-1 modulate CD4+ T-lymphocyte responses and HIV-1 infection in vitro. Parasitic helminths evade and dampen human immune responses, affecting HIV-1 transmission and disease progression. SEA specifically binds to DC-SIGN, blocking DC-SIGN-mediated HIV-1 transfection, but not cis-infection. DCs exposed to SEA under Th2 conditions induce T-cells less susceptible to HIV-1 R5 infection, but not X4. T-cells induced by SEA-exposed DCs show reduced IFNγ and MIP1β production. Recombinant omega1 (r-1) demonstrates similar functions, inducing T-cells less sensitive to HIV-1 R5, with reduced IFNγ, MIP1, and CCR5 expression. SEA and r-1 modulate HIV-1 infectivity, potentially influencing disease course in co-infected individuals. Helminthic parasites possess immunomodulatory properties, skewing responses towards Th2. SEA blocks DC-SIGN-mediated HIV-1 transfection through kappa-5 binding. SEA-exposed DCs induce T-cells less susceptible to R5 HIV-1, suggesting helminthic infections may be beneficial for HIV-1. Deciphering mechanisms may provide means to modulate immune responses, limiting transmission, or reducing viral loads. SEA influences mechanisms associated with HIV-1 transmission and pathogenesis.
Neuronal stimulation causes approximately 30% shrinkage of the extracellular space between neurons and surrounding astrocytes in grey and white matter. A dynamic model has been developed to account for this phenomenon, incorporating neuronal release and uptake of potassium and sodium, astrocyte uptake of potassium and sodium and chloride, passive channels, the Na/KATP pump, and osmotically driven water transport through astrocyte membrane. The Na+/K+/Cl− and Na+/HCO− cotransporters are critical for achieving observed levels of shrinkage. Modelling identifies the need for measuring extracellular space shrinkage, membrane potential, and astrocy ion concentrations in wild-type and knockout individuals. The model assumes shrinkage is due to redistribution of water and ions within neuronal and astrocy compartments, disregarding effects such as spatial buffering. Active transport of sodium and potassium by the Na/KATP pump, ion transport between astrocy and extracellular space, and water through aquaporin channels contribute to shrinkage. Even without NBC and NK1, potassium pulse and sodium removal, astrocy uptake and channels, Na/KP pump, and AQP channels seem sufficient for generating shrinkage. The model appears detailed and constrained to guide future experiments and pave the way for astroglia-neuron interaction models for normal and pathophysiological situations.
Eukaryotic genomes contain significant amounts of transposons and repetitive elements that can be detrimental if transcribed. In Arabidopsis thalian, these elements are silenced by the siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing pathway where non-coding RNAs produced by RNA Polymerase V guide ARGONAUTE4 to chromatin, attracting enzymes that establish repressive chromatin modifications. SPTL/K1, a silencing factor and homolog of SPT elongation factors, binds chromatin at loci subject to transcriptional silencing downstream of RNAase V but independently of 24nt siRNA. SPTL/K1 and ARG4 are recruited to chromatin in parallel and independently of each other. Binding of both ARG4 and SPTL/K1 is required for DNA methylation and repressive histone modifications. Coordinate binding of SPTL and ARG4 creates a platform for recruitment of chrom modifying enzymes. SPTL contributes to siRNA-mediated transcriptional silencing in a highly-specific manner and enhances ARG4 chromatin binding but is not required for ARG4 recruitment to chromatin. Most loci may be occupied by two pools of ARG4, one SPTL-dependent and other recruited independently. SPTL works downstream of RNA Polymer V and does not require 24nt siRNA, physically interacting with chromatin to recruit modifying enzymes to target loci in chromatin, resolving the mechanism of siRNA recruitment and function of SPTL in this process.
Borrelia burgdorferi requires the alternative sigma factor RpoS for dissemination within the vector during tick-to-mammal transmission. RpoS-dependent gene expression is prerequisite for transmission of spirochetes by nymphs, as Rpo-deficient organisms are confined to the midgut lumen and transform into an unusual morphotype, round bodies, during the later stages of the blood meal. Round body formation is reversible and attributed to reduced levels of Coenzyme A disulfide reductase, which provides NAD for glycolysis. Spirochetes default to an Rpo-independent program for round body formation upon sensing unfavorable energetics for transmission. RpoS is induced during the nymphal blood meal but not expressed by spirochetes in replete larvae or unfed nymphs, delineating the Rpo ON and OFF states during the tick phase. Expression patterns of Rpo-dependent genes in the tick reflect more than a simple ON/OFF bipart regulation. Findings reveal a role for RSB in adaptations for tick-mamm transmission and existence of a proposed survival mode triggered when spirochet are unable to produce energy for dissemination within the nymph. Rpo-deficient spirochet replicate at wild-type levels during the nymphal meal but display aberrant morphology as feeding progresses. The Rpo regulon is important during the tick-phase of the enzic cycle and Rpo-dependent genes are required to traverse the midgut while Osp functions within the mamm.
Precise coordination between stamen and pistil development is essential for fertile flower formation, and mutations impairing stamen elongation, pollen maturation, or anther dehiscence can cause male sterility. Gibberellin (GA) and jasmonate (JA) deficiencies both lead to male sterility, but the relationship between GA and JA in controlling stamen development is not well understood. Research shows MYB21, MYB24, and MY57 are GA-dependent stamen-enriched genes, and loss-of-function of DELLAs RGA and RGL2 restores their expression, along with stamen growth in GA-deficient plants. The myb21-t1 my24-t1 my57 triple mutant confers a short stamen phenotype leading to male sterility. GA suppresses DELL to mobilize the expression of key JA biosynthesis gene D1, consistent with lower JA content in young flower buds of GA-deficient quadruple mutant ga1-3 gai6 rga2 rgl1 compared to wild type. GA promotes JA biosynthesis to control MY21, MY24 and MY57 expression, establishing a hierarchical relationship between GA and JA in modulating stamen development in Arabidopsis. Exogenous JA application to ga1-3 gai6 rgl1 r2 quadruple mutant flower buds restores MYB expression, while exogenous GA to opr3 mutant buds does not, indicating modulation of the JA pathway is one branch of GA's function in regulating stamen development. Other GA-regulated, JA-independent factors are also necessary for normal stamen development.
Dietary restriction extends lifespan in various species and slows the onset of age-related diseases, with the target of rapamycin pathway essential for longevity phenotypes resulting from dietary restriction. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 is a target of the TOR pathway in mammalian cells, playing roles in oxygen homeostasis, tumor formation, glucose metabolism, cell survival, and inflammatory response. In Caenorhabditis elegans, HIF-1 deficiency results in extended lifespan overlapping with inhibition of RSK-1/S6 kinase, a component of the TOR pathway. HIF-1 modulates longevity in a nutrient-dependent manner, with loss-of-function extending lifespan under rich conditions but failing under dietary restriction. Conversely, mutation in egl-9, increasing HIF1 activity, diminishes lifespan extension under dietary restriction, rescued by tissue-specific expression in neurons and muscles. Increased lifespan by HIF or dietary restriction is dependent on endoplasmic retic regulator inos-requiring protein and associated with lower stress. Results demonstrate a tissue-specific role for HIF in lifespan extension involving the IRE1 stress pathway. HIF acts downstream of nutrient-responsive TOR-S6 pathway to modulate lifespan, with overexpression diminishing extension under dietary restriction. Evidence suggests lifespan extension by inhibition of RSK and HIF takes place through overlapping mechanisms, with HIF determining lifespan in Caenorhabdit elegans.
Researchers investigated chromatin changes in human keratinocytes as they transition between differentiation and migration states, finding unique enhancers and super-enhancers for each state that link to gene expression conferring associated functions. GRHL, a transcription factor promoting both differentiation and migration, binds preferentially to super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes and to promoters during migration, repressing expression of migration inhibitors. Key epidermal differentiation genes, including GRHL, are within super-enhancers and regulate them. GRHL represses formation of non-keratinocyte super-enhancers in differentiating keratinocytes. Chromatin and GRHL binding regulate keratinocyte commitment to differentiation and reversible migration. GRHL regulates divergent gene programs in differentiating and migrating keratinocytes by switching chromatin binding in distinct enhancer landscapes. The study characterized gene-regulatory landscape in migration, demonstrating rearrangements of super-enhancers as keratinocytes differentiate or migrate, and a novel role for GR3 in regulating enhancer formation, particularly suppressing non-keratin super-enhancers. Data highlights the reciprocal relationship between GR3 and chromatin, applying to cell specification and migration. GR3 promotes keratin migration during eyelid closure and wound healing, modulating gene programs for movement and suppressing progenitor states. In transitioning keratinocytes, GR3 associates with promoters, repressing genes inhibitory migration with REST.
Endogenous retroviruses, remnants of ancient retroviral infections, are transmitted vertically from generation to generation and can be used by the host as restriction factors to block pathogenic retroviruses. A study on sheep, which coexist with two exogenous oncogenic retroviruses and related endogenous retroviruses, isolated and characterized 27 endogenous retrovirus proviruses that integrated into the host genome over 5-7 million years ago. Two proviruses acquired a defective Gag protein, resulting in a dominant phenotype blocking late replication of exogenous retroviruses, and became fixed in the genome before domestication. Recently, a provirus emerged that escapes the dominant phenotype, indicating continuous evolutionary antagonism between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses. The findings suggest endogenization of retroviruses as restriction factors is a host mechanism to fight retroviral infections. Sequential genetic changes favored the host or virus, with eight proviruses present in a proportion of sheep and insertionally polymorphic loci found in few, indicating recent integration. Phylogenetic analysis divided retroviruses into two clades, enRV-A and enRV-B. Transdominant proviruses may defend against colonizing endogenous retroviruses or pathogenic viruses, increasing host fitness and providing an adaptive advantage.
The diagnosis of schistosomiasis currently relies on microscopic detection of schistosome eggs in stool or urine samples and serological assays, but these methods have poor sensitivity. A study evaluated two in-house real-time Schistoma PCRs targeting S. mansoni and S. haematium in excreta, biopsies, and sera to diagnose active infections and monitor treatment efficacy. The PCRs were performed on 412 samples from patients with suspected schistosomias before anti-parasitic treatment and compared to microscopic examination and serological assays. Results showed PCRs increased sensitivity from 4% to 10.5% and 33.7% to 48.8% for S. haematium in urine and S. mansoni in stools, respectively. Serum PCR sensitivity was 72.7% and 94.1% in patients with positive excreta microscopy, with specificity of 98.9%. After treatment, serum PCR positivity declined from 93.8% at day 30 to 8.3% day 360, while antibody detection remained positive after 1 year. The study found Schosoma PCRs outperform standard microscopy on stools and could be used with serology for diagnosis. Serum PCRs provide species information when serological assays are positive and microscopy is negative. Biomarkers like DNA and antibodies are limited for early treatment monitoring, but PCR could be useful 1 year after treatment to confirm cured infection.
Researchers have successfully applied machine learning to estimate potential energy surfaces for molecular simulations of structurally complex molecules, using the natural product Archazolid A as an example. This approach exploits information from previous calculations via Gaussian process regression to predict energies of new conformations, allowing a trade-off between accuracy and computational speed. The model achieved mean absolute errors of less than 1 kcal/mol for energies of relaxed conformations at the density functional theory level. The study demonstrates that predictive learning models can be developed for complex, pharmaceutically relevant compounds, enabling speed-ups in simulations of larger structures. Gaussian process regression, a non-parametric method, is suited for modeling relationships between molecular structure and quantum mechanics properties, even for complex compounds. A simple molecular representation enabled correlations between simulated conformations and computed energy values at the DFT level. Machine learning has been used in diverse quantum mechanics contexts, including prediction of atomization energies and transition theory, and estimators of potential surfaces have been pursued since the 1990s. Trained models captured the relationship between Archazolid conformations and DFT energies using a matrix representation based on nuclear charges and inter-atomic distances.
Researchers have developed a non-invasive method to detect Ebola virus antibodies in wild ape feces, allowing for surveillance and insight into Ebola infections in great ape populations. The study found a 10% prevalence of Ebola antibodies in gorillas, indicating exposure is not always lethal. Evidence of antibodies was found in gorillas thought to be unexposed, suggesting wider distribution than expected. This approach enables early detection of exposure, identification of at-risk populations for vaccination, and tracking vaccine efficacy. Human Ebola outbreaks are linked to contact with infected wildlife, making ape surveillance crucial for public health. The method detects multiple Ebola species with minimal false positives and can screen large populations. In the DCO region, 5 of 35 fecal samples tested positive for antibodies. Two of 20 samples were positive, indicating 10% prevalence. This is the first detection of Ebola antibodies in wild ape feces and has implications for primate management and survival. Intervention strategies, including vaccination, are being explored as Ebola vaccines have protected laboratory monkeys. The new approach contributes to protecting apes from future infections and has a potential impact on public health in areas with high Ebola case-fatality rates.
Researchers have identified a novel type III effector, Xop, from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria, which exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and in planta, inducing plant cell death and subverting plant immunity. The E3 ligase activity is associated with the C-terminal region of Xop, specifically interacting with plant E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and forming predominantly K11-linked polyubiquitin chains. The crystal structure of the Xop C-terminal domain revealed a single domain with a novel fold, termed XL-box, not present in previously characterized E3 ligases. Mutation of amino acids in the XL-box disrupts E3 ligase activity and prevents Xop-induced plant death. The structure of the N-terminal region of Xop confirmed a leucine-rich repeat domain, potentially serving as a protein-protein interaction module for ubiquination recognition. The E3 ligase activity is required to provoke plant death, while suppression of PAMP responses depends on the N-terminal LRR domain. Xop represents a new class of E3 ubiquitin ligases with a unique fold, highlighting variation in bacterial pathogen effectors mimicking eukaryote-specific activity. Xop is part of a suite of type III effectors injected into host cells, including transcription activators and SUMO proteases. Characterization of Xop uncovers a novel E3 ubiquitin ligase that subverts host biology, underlining the variety of E3 ligases evolved in pathogenic bacteria to manipulate host processes.
Researchers studied T helper cell responses in acute HIV infection and the impact of antiretroiral treatment on T and B cell function using the RV254 cohort of HIV-infected individuals. Impaired circulating follicular helper cell function was observed in stage 3 individuals compared to stage 1 and 2, with lower B cell survival and IgG secretion, and increased inflammation. Elevated viral load correlated with decreased follicular helper-mediated B cell Ig production. Phenotypic perturbations were evident in the mature B compartment, with decreased resting memory cells in stage 3. Coculture assays suggested intrinsic memory cell defects contributed to impaired responses. Follicular helper and B cell interactions were altered in stage 3, coinciding with inflammation and reduced memory cells. Early antiretroviral treatment could prevent immune dysregulation and preserve follicular function and B memory. Stage 1 individuals had lower viral load and less plasma-specific IgG and terminally differentiated cells than stage 3. Follicular cells from treated individuals displayed a T1 inflammatory phenotype incapable of providing B help. Early impairment occurred as stage 3, approximately 18 days post-infection. Identifying individuals early preserves follic-dependent B responses. The HIV microenvironment affects follic cell differentiation and phenotype, with cells from chronic individuals dysfunctional in providing B help.
Schistosomiasis, a tropical disease affecting 200 million people worldwide, relies on a single drug, praziquantel, with several shortcomings, underscoring the need for next-generation anthelmintics. Researchers have pharmacologically profiled a schistosome serotonergic G-protein-coupled receptor, Sm5TR, implicated in modulating praziquantel efficacy, using a miniaturized screening assay with a luciferase-based biosensor. Data shows divergent pharmacological signature between Sm5TR and human homolog H5TR, supporting parasitic-selective pharmacophores. New ligands and series with potency and selectivity for Sm5TR over HTR were identified in vitro and validated in vivo against schistosomules and adult worms. Sm5TR displayed irreversible inactivation, a phenomenon also discovered in HTR, enhancing its appeal as a target for anthelmic ligand design. The study demonstrates the feasibility of profiling flatworm GPCRs in high-throughput format and Sm5TR as a chemotherapeutically vulnerable node for next-generation anthelmics. The abundant expression of Sm5TR in adult worms and conservation of receptor properties provide a targetable weakness for anthelmic development. The findings support the design of antiparasitic drugs aimed at schosomal GPCRs and highlight the importance of unbiased profiling flatworm targets, revealing divergence in ligand specificities between Sm5TR and HTR.
The establishment of germ layers during gastrulation is crucial for the organization of the metazoan body, and adhesion differences between ectoderm, mesoderm, and enderm cells could maintain layer integrity and prevent intermixing. However, the ecterm-meserm boundary not only separates these layers but also serves as a substratum for meserm migration, requiring compatibility with repeated cell attachment and detachment. Localized detachment resulting from contact-induced signals at the boundary is key to ecterm-meserm segregation, with cells alternating between adhesion and detachment requiring ephrin/Eph signaling. Multiple ephB ligands and Eph receptors are expressed on each side of the boundary, and tissue separation depends on forward signaling across the boundary in both directions, involving redundant ligands and receptors and activation of Rac and Rho. This mechanism differs from simple differential adhesion of germ formation, involving localized responses to signals exchanged at the tissue boundary and attachment/detachment cycles allowing cell migration across a substratum. Signaling across the ecterm-merm boundary regulates cell detachment and tissue separation, with transient contact-dependent reactions rather than permanent adhesion differences between cells. Ephrin/Eph signaling modulates cytoskeletal dynamics through Rho and Rac, with Rho activity implicated in meserm separation and potential roles for Rac in both tissues.
Researchers analyzed blood samples from 83 children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and 76 neurotypical peers to identify biochemical markers for diagnosis. Using Fisher Discriminant Analysis, 96.1% of neurotypical and 97.6% of ASD participants were correctly classified based on metabolite concentrations of folate-dependent one-carbon metabolism and transulfuration pathways. Kernel partial least squares predicted adaptive behavior measured by Vineland Adaptive Composite score with R2 of 0.45 after cross-validation using 5 metabolites. This classification and prediction accuracy exceeds other approaches, indicating metabolites are strongly correlated with ASD diagnosis. Children aged 3-10 were enrolled, with ASD defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, Autism Observation Schedule, and Childhood Autism Rating Scales. 55 ASD participants had Vineland scores recorded for regression analysis, evaluating adaptive skills in communication, socialization, daily living, and motor skills. Multivariate analysis provided quantitative results separating ASD and neurotypical cohorts based on biochemical data, outperforming existing strategies that report mean metabolite level differences. Incorporating multiple measurements increased separability and predicted autism severity, demonstrating potential for extracting information from biochemical data for earlier and accurate diagnosis.
Bayesian geostatistical modeling was applied to analyze the incidence of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil from 2001-2010, focusing on spatial and temporal patterns. The models identified precipitation and socioeconomic factors as important predictors for both types of leishiasis. The predicted number of cases in 2010 were 30,189 for cutaneous leishiasis and 4,889 for visceral leishias. High-resolution maps predicted the highest numbers of infected people in the states of Minas Gerais and Pará for visceral and cutaneous leishiasis, respectively. The study used Bayesian geostatistical negative binomial models fitted via integrated nested Laplace approximations to predict incidence using climatic, environmental, and socioeconomic covariates. Countrywide high-resolution maps estimated the number of infected people at the unit of the state. The results provide a deeper understanding of the determinants of the two diseases, identifying priority areas where leishias control efforts should be targeted to reduce incidence.
A study of 647 adults and 881 children with confirmed dengue in southern Vietnam found distinct differences in clinical features between the two age groups. Signs of vascular leakage and shock were more frequent and severe in children, while bleeding manifestations and organ involvement were more common in adults. Adults experienced more severe thrombocytopenia, with secondary infection and serotype associated with greater thrombocytopenia, although age had a smaller effect. The effect of age on platelet count persisted after recovery, indicating adults have intrinsically lower counts than children. Complications in deng infection differ between adults and children, partly due to age-dependent physiological differences. Thrombocytopenia was almost universal in adults with deng. Prophylactic platelet transfusions were given to 4 patients with profound thrombocytia requiring invasive procedures and 17 with severe bleeding. The findings highlight the need for age-specific management guidelines and further research on the use of blood products in deng treatment, given the risks and costs of prophylactic transfusions. Overall, the study demonstrates age-related differences in deng clinical features, emphasizing the importance of considering age in disease pathogenesis and management.
Researchers have identified a novel CCR5 mutation in sooty mangabeys, a natural host of SIV, which results in a truncated molecule that is not expressed on the cell surface and does not support SIV entry. The mutation is present in 26% of a large colony, with 8% of animals being homozygous for defective CCR alleles and 41% heterozygous. Despite lacking functional CCR, these animals are susceptible to SIVm infection with robust viral loads, only modestly lower than wild-type animals. SIVm primary isolates infect homozygous mutant and wild-type cells in a CCR-independent manner and use alternative coreceptors CXCR6, GPR15, and GPR1 in addition to CCR. The findings indicate SIVm relies on C5-independent pathways in sooty mangabeys homozygous for defective CCR alleles, suggesting SIV tropism and cell targeting in vivo is defined by distribution and use of entry pathways in addition to CCR. This raises the possibility of novel CCR-negative cells being expendable and enabling the virus to replicate efficiently without causing disease in the face of restricted CCR expression in natural hosts.
The transcription factor MEF2 plays a dual role in tumorigenesis, supporting both pro-oncogenic and tumor suppressive activities depending on interactions with co-activators or co-repressors, influencing histone modifications such as H3K4 methylation and H3K27 acetylation. Class II HDACs, overexpressed in 22% of leiomyosarcomas, are critical for generating a M2 repressive environment, with high levels of MEF, HD4, and HD9 inversely correlating with overall survival. HD9 knockdown suppresses the transformed phenotype of leiomyosarcoma cells by restoring transcriptional proficiency of M2-target loci and coordinates demethylation of H3K4me at M2-target gene promoters. Class II HDACs do not bind all regulative elements bound by M2, allowing coexistence of actively transcribed and repressed M2-targets with poised chromatin signature. Leiomyarcomas can be clustered into two groups based on M2 dysfunctions, with high M2 and class II HDACs detrimental to patient survival. M2 ablation reduces expression of M2-target genes and enhances transformed phenotype in SK-LMS-1 cells, while in SK-UT-1 cells, M2 is required for tumenesis and represses M2-target genes. Overall, class II HDACs, particularly HD9, are candidate druggable targets for therapeutic intervention in leiomyosarcoma.
Hydrophobins are a group of proteins that play a crucial role in the growth of filamentous fungi and have various applications in nanotechnology. Researchers used protein docking, molecular dynamics, and cryo-microscopy to study the structure of hydrophobin films composed of HFBI and HFB produced by Trichoderma reesei. The results suggest a unit cell composed of six proteins with P6 symmetry computationally and P3 symmetry experimentally with a unit size of 56 Å. An alternate ordering with three protein unit and P3 symmetry is possible, which may increase the rate of surface coverage of hydrophin films. Cryo-EM, protein docking, and molecular simulation provided a detailed picture of the assembled structure of hydroobin films at the air-water interface. The unique properties of hydrophobin films arise from cooperative effects of protein interactions in the surface network. Hydrophobins have industrial applications due to their interfacial assemblies. A Monte Carlo simulation modeled the hydroobin film to study the role of P3 metastable symmetry in its formation. The first high-resolution structure of hydroobin was obtained through x-ray crystallography for HFB of Trichoder rei, showing a diameter of 2 nm and amphiphilic structure with hydrophobic face.
Researchers have characterized the threonyl-tRNA synthetase (LdThrS) of Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite causing visceral leishmaniasis, as a potential therapeutic target. Recombinant LdRS expressed in E. coli showed aminoacylation activity and localized to both cytosol and mitochondria. Heterozygous mutants of LdRS in Leishmania promastigotes displayed restrictive growth and attenuated infectivity, increased susceptibility to the ThrRS inhibitor borrelin. Attempts to obtain homozygous null mutants were unsuccessful, indicating LRS essentiality for parasite survival. Boridin showed strong affinity for LdRS, inhibiting aminoacylation activity and promastote stage parasites. The 3D model of LdRS compared to human ThrRS displayed similarity. LdRS is essential for Leishmania donani and binds small molecules with strong affinity, making it a potential target for antileishial drug discovery. Kinetic analysis revealed catalytic efficiency similar to T.brucei. Subcellular localization by immunofluorescence and bioinformatic analysis indicated dual-purpose ThrRS in cytosol and mitochondria. The study demonstrates the potential of ThrRS as a new class of targets in antileishial drug discovery, providing an opportunity to disrupt protein synthesis in two compartments simultaneously.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA is recognized as non-self by the immune receptor RIG-I through the presence of a 5'-triphosphate and a 3' poly-UUC tract. The poly-uridine core of this sequence is essential for RIG activation, and interspersed ribocytosine nucleotides between poly-U sequences are required for optimal RIG signal induction. 5'-pp poly-UUC RNA variants stimulate RIG activation and bind RIG protein in vitro, requiring interaction with both repressor and helicase domains for signaling. The poly-U core confers non-self recognition and innate signaling when appended to 5'-pp RNA lacking PAMP activity. HCV poly-U RNA variants strongly activate RIG signaling, triggering anti-HCV responses in vitro and hepatic immune responses in vivo. A multi-motif PAMP signature of non-recognition by R-I incorporates 5'-p with poly-uridine composition and length, driving RIG signaling to induce the immune response. The poly-ur core and interspersed ribocytine nucleotides are necessary for RIG binding and signaling, with long poly-uridine sequences (>17) driving optimal RIG binding and signaling. RIG recognizes long-uridine regions as non-self within 5'-p RNA, with affinity and contacts between PAMP and RIG helicase defining HCV recognition. The 5'-p and 34nt poly core are required for non-self recognition of HCV RNA by RIG, offering insights into antiviral therapeutic potential of targeted RIG signaling.
Eosinophils and IL-4 support nematode growth coincident with an innate response to tissue injury, extending their functions beyond host defense and allergy to metabolism and tissue regeneration. The study investigated the mechanism by which eosinophils promote growth of Trichella spiralis larvae in skeletal muscle, finding that IL-4 and eosinils are necessary for normal larval growth. Eosinils from IL-4 competent mice are sufficient to support growth, operating in the absence of adaptive immunity, and suppressing local inflammation while influencing nutrient homeostasis in muscle. Gene expression in skeletal muscle indicates a regenerative response and shift in energy source, with redistribution of glucose transporter 4 and phosphorylation of Akt, enhancing glucose uptake and glycogen storage by larvae. The data suggests a mechanism where eosinils promote larval growth by an IL-4 dependent mechanism limiting interferon-driven responses that alter nutrient metabolism. Whole genome transcriptional profiling identified genes altered early in muscle infection, coinciding with eosin requirement. Eosils contribute to IL-4 dependent muscle regeneration in innate response to injury, supporting larval growth when restored to ablated mice by transfer from IL-4 competent mice. Eosils express functional IL-4 receptor, developing in presence of IL-4 to produce mediators supporting larval growth, independent of ILC2. Transfer of IL-/- eosils failed to improve growth, showing eosils regulate larval growth in an innate context independent of I2.
Genome-wide replication studies in human cells have revealed that replication origins are spaced at 40 kilobase intervals and fire in small clusters, with synchrony increasing during S phase, and replication velocity remaining constant at 0.7 kilobases per minute. Analysis of replication timing profiles shows a broad distribution of replication gradients with no regions larger than 100 kilobases replicating at less than 2 kilobases per minute, indicating lack of large unidirectional fork progression. Temporal regions are replicated by sequential activation of origins at an increasing rate during S phase, with timing set by delay and spacing between successive firings rather than velocity of single forks. DNA combing of the IGH locus in HeLa cells demonstrates activation of internal origins in specific temporal regions. Published origin maps and replication data in other cell types corroborate these findings, except in embryonic stem cells where unidirectional progression is more abundant. Results suggest origins fire independently under long-range chromatin control or replication forks stimulate initiation in nearby unreplicated DNA. Replication kinetics in HeLa cells show origins spaced at 40 kilob intervals, adjacent origins firing within 20 minutes, and replication velocity of 0.68 kilob per minute, with global fork density increasing during S phase as more replicons and origins become active. Apparent replication speed depends on single fork velocity and proportion of moving forks, reflecting origin firings along timing gradients rather than unidirectional progression.
Researchers investigated how the nervous system's ability to recognize objects despite changes in contextual variables can be implemented in biologically realistic spike-based learning rules. They showed that slow feature analysis can be implemented in linear neurons using a modified Hebbian rule, linking it to the trace rule, another implementation of slown learning. For Poisson neurons, spike-timing-dependent plasticity with a specific window implements slown learning. The learning window's convolution with postsynaptic potential, not the window alone, is relevant for functional interpretations. Derived STDP windows implement slow feature analysis and the trace rule, compatible with physiological data in shape and timescale. The window can be split into components sensitive to reversible and irreversible input statistics, with irreversible statistics favoring oscillatory weight dynamics. The study suggests STDP outcome is governed by the convolution of the learning window with EPSP, and the window realizing SFA can be calculated analytically. Physiologically plausible parameters lead to a learning window shape and width in agreement with experimental findings, proposing a new interpretation of STDP as an implementation of slown compensating neuronal low-pass filters like EP, potentially establishing invariant representations in early sensory processing, such as visual fields invariant to microsaccades.
Researchers have discovered a previously unrecognized behavior in heterogeneous tumors called cooperative adaptation to therapy (CAT), where cancer cells induce resistant phenotypes in neighboring cells when exposed to therapy, contributing to chemotherapy resistance. Using CRISPR/Cas9, they engineered phenotypically diverse non-small cell lung cancer cells with mutations in Dicer, a type III cytoplasmic endoribonuclease involved in small-coding RNA genesis, and monitored growth dynamics of mutant and wild-type cells in co-culture. Mathematical modeling and flow cytometry revealed that co-cultures allowed beneficial growth in previously sensitive cells under drug pressure via cell transitions described by cooperative game-theoretic changes in fitness. An ex vivo human tumor model showed that cellular and morphologic heterogeneity correlates with prognostic failure of clinically-approved drugs in NSC patient samples. The findings suggest non-genetic cooperation among tumor cells thwarts drug pressure, indicating profiling for druggable targets alone may be insufficient for effective therapy. Phenotypic switching occurs within heterogeneous tumors through a three-dimensional nanoculture in vitro growth and Dicer mutants from CRISPR/C9 gene editing. Cooperative adaptation to therapy enables intrinsically-sensitive, phenically distinct NSC subclones to support each other to evolve a therapy-resistant phenotype via drug-induced cell transitions. The study highlights the importance of understanding interactions between phenically distinct cells within the same tumor to promote resistance and the role of phenic plasticity and adaptive drug-induced cell transitions in acquired resistance.
A cross-sectional seroprevalence study was conducted in the Mbeya Region, Southwestern Tanzania, to estimate the seropvalence of IgG antibodies against Spotted Fever Group Rickettsiae and assess socioeconomic and environmental risk factors. The study found a seropreval of 67.9% among 1228 participants, with multivariable analysis revealing associations with age, warmer temperatures, male gender, and low population density. At higher elevations, higher cattle density was associated with higher serrevalence. The study suggests SFG ricketial infection is common in the rural population, with spread limited by temperature and elevation. Examination of the contribution of SFG to febrile illnesses is warranted to estimate the disease burden and determine causative pathogens. The findings are compatible with previous descriptions, adding information on risk factors for S ricketioses in southwestern Tanzania. Future studies should aim to detect pathogens in acute infection and describe the local transmission cycle to validate identified risk factors. Comparison with typhus group ricketial antibodies shows different geographical patterns, with higher prevalence in areas of sparse vegetation or dense population. All Ricketia species are pathogenic to humans, with SFG transmitted by the brown tick Rh sanguus.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the monounsaturated fatty acid oleate in the innate immune response of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. An RNA screen for regulators of innate defense genes revealed two stearoyl-CoA desaturases that synthesize oleate, which is necessary for pathogen-mediated induction of immune genes. C. elegans deficient in oleate production are hypersusceptible to infection with diverse pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, E. faecalis, and S. marcesens, but can be rescued by exogenous oleate addition. However, oleate alone is insufficient to drive immune activation. The study distinguishes the effects of oleate from polyunsaturated fatty acids, γ-linolenic acid and stearonic acid, previously shown to be required for basal expression of innate effectors. Supplementation experiments demonstrated that exogenous oleate rescues immune defects in a dose-dependent manner. Data indicate oleate affects effector expression and pathogen resistance by mechanisms distinct from polyunsaturated fatty acids. Loss-of-function mutations in enzymes catalyzing polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis do not impact innate effector gene induction or susceptibility to P. aerugin pathogenesis. Overall, findings suggest an ancient link between nutrient stores, metabolism, and host susceptibility to bacterial infection, adding to known health-promoting effects of monounsaturated acids.
Researchers have identified a novel riboswitch ligand analog as a selective inhibitor of guanine-related metabolic pathways, exhibiting antimicrobial properties by binding to the guanine riboswitch domain. Guanine riboswitches regulate the transport and biosynthesis of purine metabolites, crucial for the cellular nucleotide pool, and upon guanine binding, stabilize a 5'-translated mRNA structure causing transcription attenuation of the downstream open reading frame. A pyrimidine compound, PC1, was found to bind guanine riboswitches, showing bactericidal activity against a subgroup of bacterial species, including well-known nosocomial pathogens. The selective killing is achieved when gua, a gene for GMP synthase, is under the control of the riboswitch. Clinical strains exhibiting multiple drug resistance were inhibited, suggesting PC1 targets a different metabolic pathway. In a mouse model, administration of PC1 correlated with reduction of Staphylococcus aureus infection in mammary glands, establishing the possibility of using structural knowledge to design guanine riboswitch-targeting antibiotics as antimicrobial compounds. Guanine riboswitch controls a four-gene operon consisting of xpt, pbu, gua, and guaB, placing gua and gua under control in S. aureus. PC1 and similar molecules exhibited antibiotic activities by targeting guanine riboswitch in S. aureus. Guanine-sensing riboswitches regulate transcription at high guanine concentration, and the guanine aptamer is organized around a three-way junction connecting helices with a nucleotide involved in Watson-Crick base interaction with the bound ligand. The discovery of this guanine riboswitch target is crucial as community-acquired bacterial infections have started to emerge.
Researchers investigated how gaze informs the construction of mental space during navigation in primates by examining navigation behavior, visual exploration, and hippocampal activity in macaque monkeys searching a virtual maze for a reward. Hippocampal cells sensitive to place responded to variables like head direction, point of gaze, or context, and many fired at the sight and anticipation of a landmark in a viewpoint-dependent manner, encoding the animal's situation within a set of actions leading to the goal. Overall, hippocal activity was best fit by a fine-grained space comprising current position, view, and action contexts. The findings indicate that counterparts of rodent place cells in primates embody multidimensional, task-situated knowledge pertaining to the target of gaze, supporting self-awareness in the construction of space. The study probed the nature of hippocal coding in a goal-oriented task, separating goal and visual landmarks, and examined how cells code position, direction, and target of gaze. Results showed hippocal cells display fine-grained tuning that preferentially codes one of landmarks viewed by the animal and its self-position relative to the landmark. The data suggest the counterpart of place cells in primates is expressed as activity related to point of gaze in conjunction with variables such as position and identity of visual elements at key instants of trajectory, bridging the gap between studies in rodents and primates in real and virtual environments.
The development of the midbrain and hindbrain in vertebrates is characterized by a specific pattern of gene expression around the mid-hindbrain boundary, established by a network of transcription and secreted factors. A Boolean analysis of spatial expression patterns at the murine mid-hindbrain boundary reveals key regulatory interactions in this network, predicting a maintaining effect of Fgf8 on Wnt expression. Experimental evidence from mouse neural tube explants confirms F8 maintains but does not induce ectopic Wnt expression. This finding, combined with validated interactions, constructs a regulatory network of transcription and secreted factors at the mid-hindbrain boundary. Analyses of Boolean, differential, and reaction-diffusion models confirm the network explains the stable maintenance of the mid-hindbrain boundary and expression patterns under wild-type and knock-out conditions. Spatial expression patterns around the mid-hindbrain help understand the maintenance of this boundary on a systems level. The isthmic organizer, located at the mid-hindbrain boundary, controls development and is characterized by localized expression of transcription and secreted factors, including Otx2, Gbx, F8, Wnt, and Pax. F8 plays a role in patterning activity and Wnt regulates midbrain development and maintains the mid-hind boundary. The minimal network shows mutual inhibition of Otx and Gbx and antagonistic effects on F8 and Wnt expression. Time-course analysis of Wnt expression after F8 implantation clarifies epistatic relationships, especially between F8 and Wnt, at the mid-hind boundary.
The apicomplexan parasite Theileria annata infects host cells, inducing uncontrolled proliferation and clonal expansion of the parasitized population. After sporozoite entry, the host cell membrane is dissolved and an array of host microtubules surrounds the parasite, developing into the schizont. The schizont remains tethered to host microtubules during mitosis and cytokinesis, engaging cell's astral and central microtubules to secure distribution between daughter cells. Researchers investigated the molecular mechanism of schizont recruitment and stabilization of host microtubules, focusing on end-binding protein 1, a regulator of microtubule dynamics. The study found T. annata104, a polymorphic antigen on the schizont surface, functions as a genuine EB1-binding protein, recruiting EB1 in the absence of other parasite proteins through a consensus Sx motif. The interaction between parasite and host EB1 is cell cycle regulated. This is the first description of a pathogen-encoded protein interacting with EB via a bona-fide Sx motif. The findings provide insight into the interaction between Theiler and host cytoskeleton. Preliminary observations suggest host CLASP could contribute to microtubule stabilization at the parasite surface. The distribution of schizont between daughter cells during cytokinesis is dependent on association with astral and central microtubules. The parasite secures equal distribution by associating with the mitotic apparatus during mitosis and cytokinesis, involving recruitment of de novo synthesized microtules with the surface.
Research in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has shown that mild insufficiency in replicase Cdc9 leads to persistent DNA damage, likely due to broken replication forks, constitutive activation of the DNA checkpoint, and longer telomeres. Telom lengthening requires telomerase, the DNA signaling cascade Mec1-Rad9-Rad53, and components of the break-induced replication pathway, including Rad51, Rad52, Pol32, and Pif1. The Mec1-Rad53 induced phosphorylation of P1 is crucial for Pif's role in break-induced replication and telom elongation. Similar telom phenotypes were observed in cdc-1, c44-5, and rrmΔ mutants, where P1 phosphorylation is necessary for telom lengthening. A proposed model suggests that break-induced replication through telomeres promotes telomerase activity, leading to tel lengthening. DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of P1 promotes telom-stabilizing extension, repressing deleterious de novo telom addition at breaks, and funnels DNA into genome-preserving pathways. Activation of break-induced replication in damaged cells leads to tel lengthening, providing an additional layer of protection against DNA repair machinery. Cells lacking P1 possess longer teleres and elevated frequencies of de novo telom addition to double-strand breaks. Phosphorylation of P1 by DNA signaling inhibits telomerase at breaks, but modulation of telom synthesis in response to damage remains unknown, indicating a complex relationship between DNA damage response and telomere maintenance.
Onchocerciasis, an infection caused by the filarial nematode Onchocerca volulus, is a major public health concern due to its debilitating symptoms and potential recrudescence in areas under control. Researchers investigated the use of luciferase immunoprecipitation systems (LIPS) as a rapid and standardized diagnostic assay for Oncherca volulus infection. Four recombinant Oncherca volulus antigens (OvAR-1, API-1, Ov-MS-1, and Ov-CPI-1) were tested on a large cohort of sera from uninfected controls and patients with parasitic infections, including Oncherca volulus, Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Strongloides stercoralis. Antibody responses to the four antigens allowed differentiation between Oncherca infected and uninfected sera with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity. A mixture of the four antigens tested simultaneously showed 100% sensitivity and 100 specificity in distinguishing infected from uninfected sera. The quick 15-minute LIPS format had 100 sensitivity and specificity values of 76, 84 and 93 for distinguishing Onch from Wb, L and S infected sera. The multi-antigen LIPS can be used as a rapid, high-throughput and specific tool for diagnosing Onch infections and detecting recrudescent infections in areas under control and mapping new areas of transmission.
A 54-month iron-folic acid and deworming program in rural Vietnam significantly reduced anemia, iron deficiency, and soil-transmitted helminth infections in women of reproductive age. Weekly iron-folic supplementation and regular deworming increased mean hemoglobin from 122g/L to 131g/L and decreased anemia prevalence from 38% to 18%. Iron deficiency fell from 23% to 8% and iron deficiency anemia to 4%. Hookworm infection decreased from 76% to 11% and moderate or heavy infestation of soil-transmitted helmin to less than 1%. Compliance with deworm and iron-folic supplements remained high, with 76% taking supplements and 95% receiving deworm treatment. Population-based interventions effectively reduced anemia, iron deficiency, and soil-transmitted helmin infections to below public health concern levels. Hematological and parasitological outcomes improved, with significant reductions in anemia, iron deficiency, and iron deficiency anemia. The program demonstrated long-term effectiveness in a resource-constrained setting, providing evidence for population-based interventions to eliminate iron deficiency anemia and soil-transmitted helmin infections in women of reproductive age.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encodes a novel immunoevasin, gp150, expressed during the late phase of replication, which inhibits antigen presentation by HLA class I, HLA II, and non-classical lipid-presenting CD1 molecules. The mechanism of gp150-mediated T-cell escape does not depend on degradation of antigen-presenting molecules nor requires gp150 cytoplasmic tail. Through abundant glycosylation, gp150 creates a shield that impedes surface presentation of antigen, an unprecedented immune evasion mechanism for herpesviruses. EBV gp150 prolongs the timespan for producing viral offspring at the most vulnerable stage of the viral cycle. Infected cells with gp-null EBV displayed rescued levels of surface presentation by HLA I, HLA II, and CD1, indicating an important role for iNKT cells next to classical T cells in fighting EB infection. EBV gp150 interferes with immune recognition of HLA I, II and CD1 Ag complexes at cell surface, providing evidence that gp150 shields recognition in a glycan-dependent manner. EBV gp150 is non-essential for viral entry, assembly or egress and its function remained enigmatic until now, with evidence supporting a model where gp150 shields HLA molecules through abundantly sialated glycans to escape T activation.
The translocated actin recruiting protein (Tarp) is conserved among all pathogenic chlamydia species and plays a crucial role in bacterial invasion of host cells through actin nucleation. Sequence analysis revealed multiple putative actin binding sites in Tarp orthologs from various chlamydia species and serovars. GST-Tarp fusions from multiple chlamydia species demonstrated the ability to bind and nucleate actin, with variable numbers of actin binding sites promoting actin nucleation in vitro. A peptide antiserum specific to the actin binding domain inhibited actin polymerization in vitro and reduced host susceptibility to chlamydia infection in vivo. Chydia species harbor at least one to four functional actin binding domains, with purified Tarp capable of nucleating actin filament formation. Tarp mediated actin nucleation is a conserved feature among diverse chydia species and essential for bacterial entry. The actin binding domain is present in all examined strains, despite overall sequence divergence of Tarp orthologs between species. Tarp is tyrosine phosphorylated upon translocation to the host cytosol and implicated in actin recruitment at the site of chydia attachment. The mechanism of Tarp actin nucleation is distinct from known eukaryotic actin nucleators, potentially involving a hybrid mechanism of actin nucleation with multiple actin monomers binding to a single polypeptide and synergistic oligomerization by the proline-rich domain. Overall, Tarp mediated actin polymerization is critical for chlamydia invasion, with the actin binding domain playing a key role in bacterial pathogenesis.
A novel procedure, the formalin-ethyl acetate sedimentation-digestion (F-SD) technique, has been developed for precise quantification of Schistosoma japonicum eggs in bovine feces. Schistosomiasis japonica is a zoonosis with mammalian species acting as reservoirs, including water buffaloes contributing up to 75% of human transmission in China. The F-SD technique involves filtration, sedimentation, potassium hydroxide digestion, and centrifugation steps prior to microscopy, removing nearly 70% of debris and rendering the remaining translucent, allowing improved visualization of S. japonicum eggs. This method provides an accurate estimation of infection in bovines and ruminant hosts. The F-SD technique is comparable to real-time PCR in determining schosome prevalence but less costly and can be applied as surveillance tool in areas with low to high infection or suspected elimination of schosomiasis japonica. Direct microscopic identification of schosome eggs is the gold standard for diagnosis of zoonotic schosomiasis, current methods are limited in sensitivity. The F-SD technique is effective for identifying S. japonicum eggs in fecal samples from naturally infected Chinese water buffaloes and carabao water buffalo in Philippines, providing improved tool for calculating transmission rates and determining environmental contamination.
Researchers investigated the effects of collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation on skeletal tissues, specifically the role of prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H) and cartilage-associated protein (CRT) in osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Mutations in genes encoding these proteins cause recessive OI, characterized by brittle bones and skeletal deformities. A complex of PH, CRT, and cyclophilin B 3-hydroxylates a proline residue on the α1(I) chain and has cis/trans isomerase activity essential for collagen folding. To distinguish between 3-hydroxylation and chaperone functions, a knock-in mouse model was generated with a PH catalytic site substitution, abolishing 3-hydroxylase activity but retaining complex formation with CRT. Results showed absence of prol 3-hydroxylation at Pro986 on α(I) and α(II) collagen chains, normal appearance, no growth defects, and cartilage histology, but decreased trabecular bone mass. This model recapitulates elements of OI bone phenotype but not cartilage growth phenotypes. Observations suggest differential tissue consequences due to selective inactivation of PH hydroxyl activity versus ablation of proly 3-hydroxy complex. Findings highlight the importance of this complex in collagen modification and bone mass maintenance. Null mutations in LEP1 or CRT result in recessive OI with identical features, suggesting PH and CRT stabilize each other. The study provides insights into the role of proly 3-hydroxylation complex in bone and cartilage development and its implications for understanding OI.
Researchers have discovered a hybrid dysgenesis-like phenotype in Drosophila simulans, a syndrome characterized by abnormal phenotypes including sterility, associated with the invasion of the P-element, a selfish genetic element previously found in Drosila melanogaster. A survey of 181 D. simulans strains revealed 20% induce hybrid dysgenesis, linked to the presence of the P-element through genomic and transcriptomic data. Temporal and geographical analysis of 631 strains from three continents over 27 years showed the P-element invasion occurred rapidly and nearly simultaneously, with strains containing P-elements being rare in 2006 and common by 2014. Strains from the latter phase of the invasion have adapted to suppress the worst effects of the P-element, as evidenced by resistance to the hybrid dysgenesis phenotype. The spread of the P-element in D. simulans is surprisingly fast compared to D. melanaster, with both species evolving to suppress dysgenesis by the end of the invasion. D. simul has lower rates of P-element induced gonadal dysgenesis than D. melanaster, with high sterility expected to hamper the spread of the P-element by reducing fitness of its carriers. The study suggests strong selection to ameliorate the P-element's effects, underscoring the evolutionary challenge posed by selfish elements.
Researchers have adapted a technique using rhodamine B, a thiol-reactive fluorescent dye, to mark the body and seminal fluid of male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes for mark-release-recapture experiments and estimating the efficacy of sterile male releases. The method involves feeding males a sugar solution containing 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8% rhodamine B, resulting in >95% transfer to females and successful body marking after 4 days, with 0.4 and 0.8% solutions producing the longest-lasting marking. Rhodamine marking had no effect on male competitiveness and proof-of-principle field releases demonstrated successful transfer of marked seminal fluid to females under field conditions and recapture of marked males. The results show rhodamine to be a potentially useful evaluation method for male-based SIT/I control strategies and a viable marking technique for male-release experiments without negative side effects. Rhodamine marking is less expensive than PCR and stable isotope labelling methods and less time-consuming than female fertility assays to assess competitiveness of sterilized males. The study found 96% of males exposed to 0.4% rhodamine were marked 96 hours later and 83-90% of females mated with stained males displayed seminal marking. Transfer of marked fluid occurred at >95% post-feeding with no impact on male competitiveness or survivorship. No significant effect of rhod B on male competitiveness was observed under semi-field conditions with 51.9±12% and 54.1±9% of females mated by rhod marked wild type and wMel Ae aegpt males competing against unmarked controls.
Bacterial superantigens induce an inflammatory cytokine storm that can lead to lethal shock by binding to the CD28 homodimer interface on T cells. This binding is essential for the induction of cytokine genes that mediate lethal shock. Preventing access of superantigen to CD28 suffices to block its lethality. Mice were protected from lethal superant challenge by short peptide mimetics of the CD28 dimer interface and peptides that compete with superant for its binding site on CD28. Superantigens use a conserved β-strand/helix domain to engage CD28, and mutation of this domain abolishes inflammatory cytokine induction and lethality. Structural analysis shows CD28 can be accommodated as a third receptor in a quaternary complex with the CD28 dimer oriented towards the β-strand/helix domain in superigen. The findings identify CD28 homodimer as a critical target for superantens. Blocking access of superant to CD28 is sufficient to block toxic shock. Peptide mimetics of the CD28 dimer inhibited Th1 cytokine induction and protected mice from lethal exposure. The role of CD28 as a receptor for superant toxins broadens the scope of pathogen recognition mechanisms. Independent evidence supports direct binding of superant to CD28. CD mimetic peptides inhibited Th1 cytokine induction and protected mice from lethal challenge by competing with cell-surface CD for superant. The CD28 dimer is a target for superant toxins and reveals a novel role in pathogen recognition. Superant must co-opt CD28 for Th1 cytokine induction in addition to costim signaling through B7-CD28, making unconventional use of MHC and TCR and CD28.
The Wnt/β-catenin pathway plays a crucial role in regulating embryonic stem cell proliferation and pluripotency. In mouse embryonic stem cells, the Wnt-effector Tcf1 is recruited to the Ink4/Ar tumor suppressor locus, leading to activation of the Wnt pathway, which restores the G1 phase and reduces cell proliferation without perturbing pluripency. Tcf1, but not Tcf3, is recruited to palindromic motifs in the promoter of cell repressor genes such as p15k4, p16, and p19, mediating the Wnt-dependent anti-proliferative effect. Ablation of β-caten or T1 expression impairs Wnt-dependent cell regulation. Activation of the Wnt pathway results in downregulation of cell differentiation genes while expression of pluripotency remains unperturbed. The cell effects are dependent on β-caten and T1, independent of T3, indicating non-overlapping functions of Tcf/L factors. T1 recruitment is enriched at promoters of cell cycle genes such as the Ink4Ar locus. Decreased T1 expression does not impair expression of pluripotent markers. Activation of Wnt induces negative regulators of cell cycle such as tumour suppressors p16 and p19. The W/β-caten pathway triggers anti-proliferative effect in embryonic stem cells via T1 activity, contrasting its mitogenic effect in somatic cells.
Dengue virus infection activates membrane TRAIL relocalization and IFN-α production by human plasmacytoid dendritic cells in vitro and in vivo. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells exhibit higher frequencies of membrane TRAIL in mild dengue patients compared to severe cases or healthy controls. Plasma levels of IF-α and soluble TRAIL are increased in mild deng patients, correlating with pDC activation. In vitro exposure to DENV-2 induces TRAIL expression on pDC and relocalizes TRAIL from intracellular compartment to plasma membrane. Chloroquine inhibits DENV-induced TRAIL relocalization and IFα production by pDC. Endosomal degradation by chloroquine allows viral antigens detection inside pDC, indicating endocytosis pathway activation by DENV2 in pDC. Coculture of pDC/DENV-infected monocytes reveals antigen reduction by FCA, which is also observed after exogenous IFα treatment, suggesting pDC effect on viral load is dependent on IFα production. The study characterizes pDC activation during DENV2 infection and antiviral role in vitro, proposing TRAIL-expressing pDC have an important role in disease outcome. PDC activation during deng fever, elevated IFα and TRAIL is associated with mild deng fever. PDC may contribute to control viral clearance and diminish disease severity.
The immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is complex, with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) playing a major role in host defense against the bacteria in both active and latent phases. TN-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory disorders have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis. A computational approach was taken to characterize the role of TN in protection against tuberculosis, extending previous models to investigate soluble and transmembrane TNF production. The effects of anti-TNF therapy were analyzed in virtual trials, simulating two commonly used therapies, predicting differences in reactivation rates. Bioavailability of TN following anti-T therapy is the primary factor for reactivation of latent infection and soluble TN is essential for control, even at low levels. A mathematical model distinguishes mechanisms of anti-T treatments, providing insights into TN's role in control and pathology. The study suggests a TN-modulating agent could balance inflammation reduction with maintaining resistance to infection, or dose and timing of anti-T therapy could be modified. Anti-TNF therapy may lead to incidents of primary TB if used in areas of likely exposure. TN action increases phagocytosis, enhances mycobacterial killing, recruits inflammatory cells, and stimulates chemokine production, crucial for antibacterial protection and immune response.
Researchers investigated interpopulation differences in retrogene loss and expression in humans, analyzing 4,927 retrocopies from RetroDB and genomic data from the 1000 Genomes Project. They identified 214 indels affecting 190 retrocopies and detected 193 retroduplication variations, mostly resulting from retrocopy deletion, with 11 ancestral retrogenes undergoing deletion in certain individuals. The frequency of deletion was low, except for one retrogene, and expression conservation and low deletion rates suggest functionality. Nine retrogenes showed statistically differential expression between populations. The study used RNA-Seq data from the Ilumina BodyMap and lymphoblast cell lines from the Geuvad Consortium to examine retrocopy levels. A new approach detected novel retrocopies absent from the reference genome, experimentally confirmed in 17 populations. Most retroduplication variations resulted from recent retroduplications, but this study focused on those from retrocopy deletion, complementing previous studies on recent retrop events. The findings provide insight into evolutionary processes and population history, establishing retrocopy polymorphisms as markers for human history, with potential implications for understanding genetic variation between individuals and populations.
Neurocysticercosis, an infection of the central nervous system by Taenia solium cysticerci, is a pleomorphic disease where inflammation around cysticerci is the major cause but variably present. The location and characteristics of brain tissue adjacent to cysterci may modulate inflammatory responses. A study analyzed inflammatory responses to cysterci in the parenchyma, meninges, and corticomene, using histological brain specimens from 11 pigs naturally infected with Taenia solium cysterci. Four pigs were sacrificed after 2 and 5 days of praziquantel treatment and 3 did not receive treatment. The degree of inflammation was estimated using a histological score based on the extent of inflammation in pericyst areas. Parenchymal cysterci provoked a greater level of pericyst inflammation after antiparasitic treatment compared to meninge and corticomene. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier was associated with treatment in parenchym tissue. Inflammatory response to cysti in meninges was decreased compared to parenchym. The suboptimal inflammatory response to cystidal may be the reason subarachoid neurocysticercosis is refractory to treatment compared to parenchym neurocystercosis. The study used a naturally infected pig disease model to quantify inflammatory response following cystidal treatment to cysti in brain parenchym, meninges, or both. Tissue-specific characteristics could explain differences in inflammation around cysti experimental models and be involved in the severity of reaction when the parasite degenerates naturally or after anthelm therapy.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in thirty communities in two districts of Ghana where mass drug administration for trachoma had previously been undertaken to investigate ongoing reports of yaws. Children aged 5-17 with ulcerative lesions were enrolled and samples were collected for treponemal serology and PCR. All 90 children with 98 lesions had negative syphilis serology and PCR for T. pallidum pertenue, but Haemophilus ducreyi DNA was detected in 9 lesions. No evidence of ongoing transmission of yaws was found in these communities previously treated for trachoma. H. ducreyi was associated with a proportion of skin lesions, but the majority remain unexplained. Integration of diagnostic testing into pre and post-MDA surveillance systems is required to inform yaws control. Ghana undertook azithromycin mass administration for trachoma control between 2000 and 2008, yet continues to report yaws cases, raising the possibility of resistance in T. pallid ssp perten or alternative infections. The study found no evidence of active or latent yaws, with negative treponal and non-treponal serology in all patients, indicating no previous yaws infection. Urgent data on yaws epidemiology is needed to guide eradication efforts.
Researchers investigated the use of Janus kinase (Jak) inhibitors, tofacitinib and ruxitin, to block HIV reservoir seeding and maintenance. The Jak-STAT pathway, triggered by cytokines regulating T cell homeostasis, is a major driver of HIV persistence. The study demonstrated the involvement of the Jak-STAT pathway in HIV persistence in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro, with pSTAT5 correlating with increased levels of integrated viral DNA. Jak inhibitors reduced the frequency of CD4+ cells harboring HIV DNA and blocked viral production from infected cells, inhibiting γ receptor cytokine-induced reactivation from latent stores. The results show dysregulation of the Jak-STAT pathway is associated with viral persistence, and Jak inhibitors target downstream events of γ cytokine ligation, impacting the magnitude of the HIV reservoir in memory CD4 cell subsets. The inhibitors impede T cell activation and proliferation, critical for HIV replication and seeding, without impeding effector CD4 and CD8 responses. The study found that Jak inhibitors confer STAT-mediated block in homeostatic proliferation and inflammation-driven reservoir expansion. The effects of Jak inhibitors may be advantageous as an alternative therapeutic intervention in future curative strategies. The study confirmed the inhibitory impact of ruxitin and tofacitib on the activation of the Jak-STAT pathway in CD4+ memory cell subsets, providing a potential therapeutic modality to prevent key events regulating HIV persistence.
Researchers used microarray analysis to study gene expression in Spodoptera exigua cells infected with species-specific baculovirus SeMNV and generalist baculirus AcMNV, finding a balanced number of up- and down-regulated genes in the first 36 hours post-infection, contrary to expected host transcriptional shut-off. Many immune-related genes, including recognition proteins and signaling pathways, were down-regulated after infection. This downregulation was confirmed in larval gut, where immune gene expression affects gut microorganism status. An increase in gut bacterial load was observed, hypothesized to be a consequence of viral infection. Experiments showed gut bacteria enhanced baculovirus virulence, pathogenicity, and dispersion. Gene analysis revealed immune genes downregulation after baculirus infection in S. exigua cells and gut tissue. Transcriptional and proteomic studies indicate these genes are involved in bacovirus response. Baculiruses ingested by insects reach the gut, a main barrier to systemic infection. Decreased immune transcripts and increased microbial loads impact bacovirus pathogenesis. The role of gut microbiota in virus infection cannot be ignored. Bacoviruses may manipulate host responses through encoded microRNAs targeting viral and host genes. The study extends previous lepidopteran species research on host gene expression after bacovirus infection, showing downregulation of pattern recognition and immune responses.
Researchers have made a significant breakthrough in understanding apomixis, a form of asexual reproduction through seeds, by identifying a novel gene controlling entry into the second meiotic division and creating a genotype called MiMe where meiosis is replaced by mitosis. The MiMe genotype combines mutations affecting key meiotic processes, resulting in plants producing functional diploid gametes genetically identical to the mother. Apomis can be separated into three components: absence or alteration of meiosis, fertilization-independent embryo development, and endosperm initiation without fertilization. The MiMe genotype induces fully penetrant apomeiosis, replacing meiosis with mitotic division. Tripled os1/At8/Atrec8/At11 mutants expressed the apome phenotype, generating dyads and fertile plants with quasi-wild levels of viable ovules and pollen. In contrast to previous cases, Mi plants produce high levels of viable gametes, making them suitable for apomis engineering. All gametes tested retained the mother's heterozygosity for genetic markers and were genetically identical to the mother, confirming mitotic division instead of meiotic division without affecting subsequent processes. The creation of the MiMe genotype and apome phenotype is crucial for understanding and engineering apomis, potentially revolutionizing agriculture.
Researchers have developed a method to enhance the prioritization of disease-causing genes through tissue-specific protein interaction networks, improving upon current methods that use static protein-protein interaction networks. By integrating tissue-specific gene expression data with protein interaction information, they constructed tissue-specific networks for 60 tissues and found that these networks improve prioritization results compared to generic networks. Focusing on disease-related genes expressed in associated tissues, they showed that integrating tissue-specific information improves prediction accuracy. The method involves constructing tissue-specific protein-protein interaction networks and employing them in prioritization, yielding higher area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve and correct gene ranking. The approach was extended to infer new disease-tissue associations by utilizing tissue-specific networks for gene prioritization, with 71-83% of known disease-causing genes significantly expressed in corresponding disease-associated tissues. Adding tissue specificity to various diseases enabled inference of disease-causing genes, with the tissue-specific approach enhancing algorithm performance. Two methods for tissue network construction yielded different prioritization performance, demonstrating the impact of tissue information on prioritization. The study highlights the importance of incorporating tissue-specific expression into gene prioritization schemes, allowing prediction of novel disease-tissue associations and subclinical effects that may escape early detection.
A two-locus model for the spread of insecticide resistance in mosquito populations that transmit diseases such as malaria has been developed, allowing for differential exposure of males and females to high or low concentrations of insecticide and varying selection pressures. The model investigates the relative merits of sequential use of insecticides versus deployment as a mixture to minimize resistance spread. Results show both strategies lasted over 500 generations in 24% of runs, with 56% favoring sequential use and 44% favoring mixtures when resistance spread to high levels. Mixtures are favored when insecticide effectiveness is high and exposure is low. If insecticides do not kill homozygous sensitive genotypes, sequential deployment may be more robust. Resistance spreads slower with mixtures, but may not outperform sequential use. A mixture may last 5 years while two insecticides individually last 3 and 4 years, giving an overall lifespan of 7 years for sequential use. Performance depends on insecticide attributes, application, mosquito behavior, and genetics. Mixtures are favored with higher effectiveness and lower exposure, suggesting new insecticides under development may benefit from mixture deployment. Timeframe is arbitrary and operational implications such as cost and environmental impacts require consideration.
Researchers investigated the saliva of Rhodnius neglectus, a vector of Chagas disease, to understand its role in transmitting American trypanosomiasis. Next-generation sequencing and mass spectrometry-based protein identification revealed 4,230 coding DNA sequences, including 636 putative secretory proteins, with 73 confirmed by proteomic analysis. The sialome of Rhodnius neglectus was characterized with serine protease transcripts and ubiquitous protein families such as lipocalins, serine protease inhibitors, and antigen-5. Metalloproteases, disins, and odorant binding proteins were less abundant. The study aimed to catalog Rhodnius neglectus salivary gland transcripts with probable function in hematophagy using RNAseq and mass spectrometry. Secreted proteins were organized into subclasses including lipocal, nitrophin, antigen-5, serine protease, and disintegrin. Putative secreted proteins included metalloprotease, antigen-5, serpin, and trypsin-like protease. Only one serine protease was detected by proteomic analysis despite high transcript reads assigned to this subclass. The study expands knowledge of hematophagous arthropod sialomes, aiding understanding of hematagy and interactions between vectors and vertebrate hosts, offering new substances for further investigation and functional characterization.
Researchers used Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to study the interaction between native nematodes and soil bacteria, employing transcriptional profiling to identify genes differentially expressed in response to different bacteria isolated from grassland soils. Many regulated genes were predicted to affect metabolism and innate immunity, suggesting influence on nematode community dynamics in natural systems. Mutations in 21 identified genes showed most contributed to lifespan and/or fitness in a given bacterial environment. Changes in food source had a large effect on gene expression with consequences for fitness. Regression analysis demonstrated the degree of differential expression between bacterial environments predicted the magnitude of the effect of gene loss on life traits. C. elegans was exposed to different bacterial environments to model interactions driving changes in bacterivorous nemat communities in response to land use in grasslands. The study aimed to understand naturally occurring nemat-bacterial interactions using C. elegans as a model due to its conserved genes involved in these interactions. Bacteria were isolated from grassland prairies at the Konza Biological Station to discover genes functioning in environmental interactions specifically with bacteria. Transcriptional profiling identified candidate genes regulated in response to different bacteria associated with grassland nematodes or grassland soils.
Researchers investigated the role of gene expression noise in the organization of the early mammalian blastocyst, a critical event in mammalian development where an inner cell mass is surrounded by a trophoectoderm. Utilizing multi-scale stochastic modeling, they found that stochasticity in gene expression promotes cell plasticity and plays a crucial role in organizing the developing blastyst. Asymmetry in the levels of noise variation of Cdx and Oct4 provides a means to gain benefits of noise-mediated plasticity while minimizing detrimental effects. The embryo temporally modulates plasticity by controlling the timing and pace of cell specification, creating a window for cells to adjust their fate. Gene noise has a substantial influence on trophoectoderm and inner cell mass organization, adding robustness to the structural arrangement of mouse blastysts. Asymmetry in noise sources provides a mechanism to promote noise-mediated plasticity without overwhelming the system. Mammalian cell specification is a gradual process, allowing a critical window for noise to fix errors, suggesting noise-induced plasticity improves organization. Results show that noise in Cdx expression improves organization, while noise in Oct4 does not, consistent with modeling predictions that noise has the capacity to promote proper organization of the embryo.
Researchers investigated the ability of germline-encoded antibodies to bind multiple antigens, finding that structural flexibility in these antibodies allows promiscuous binding to diverse antigens. Using the Rosetta multi-state design algorithm, they predicted antibody sequences that could engage multiple antigens at once, revealing residues that enable polyspecificity. The predicted sequences matched gerine sequences to a remarkable degree, reversing antibody maturation in silico. In contrast, designing antibodies to bind a single antigen returned a sequence similar to the mature sequence, mimicking natural maturation in silico. Key positions in the VH encoding CDR1, CDR, and immunoglobulin framework were identified as critical for polyspecificity in gerine antibodies. Computational design of antibodies capable of binding multiple antigens may allow rational design of antibodies that retain polyspecific for diverse epitope binding. Sets of mature antibody-antigen complexes incorporating antibodies derived from a common gerine VH were input into the algorithm, recovering optimal sequences for an antibody to bind all antigens simultaneously. The approach considers multiple antibodies of variable conformation at once, predicting sequences that are flexible and capable of adopting diverse conformations to bind multiple antigens. Gerine and mature sequences optimized through evolution and maturation were compared with predicted sequences based on Rosetta energy applied to co-crystallized antibodyantigen complexes. Designing for polyspecific sequences recovered gerine-encoded sequences, while designing for monospecific returned sequences similar to mature, increasing with the number of somatic mutations accumulated.
Locusts exhibit two interconvertible behavioral phases, solitarious and gregarious, with solitar individuals repelled from other locusts and gregar insects attracted to conspecifics, forming large aggregations such as marching hopper bands. Crowding biases conversion towards the gregar form. A partial-differential equation model incorporating interplay between phase change and spatial movement predicts hopper band formation at the population level, revealing conditions for outbreak characterized by large-scale transition to gregar phase. Stability analysis enables quantification of temporal dynamics, proportion of population that will gregarize, and time for this to occur. Numerical simulations describe aggregation structure, revealing transient traveling clumps of gregar insects. At low densities, both phases are uniformly spread and solitar phase dominates, while at high densities, a traveling patch of gregar locusts emerges and solitar locusts become scarce. Locust clustering at high densities marks onset of hop band, with critical density and final ratio of gregar to solitar locust calculated. Behavioral state is plastic, dependent on local density, with solitarization and gregarization transitions. Gregarization dominates when large numbers gather, potentially leading to outbreak, with dense packs forming, growing, and moving, sweeping solitar locs.
Researchers have characterized an intermediate structure in the flavivirus membrane fusion process, which is driven by conformational changes in viral envelope glycoproteins. Flaviviruses possess a class II fusion protein that mediates fusion at acidic pH, converting from a dimer to a trimer with a hairpin structure during fusion. Exposure of tick-borne encephalitis virus to alkaline pH traps particles in an intermediate conformation, where dimers dissociate and interact with target membranes via the fusion peptide without membrane merger. Further treatment with low pH leads to fusion, suggesting monomers correspond to an elusive intermediate converting prefusion dimer to postfusion trimer. The use of non-physiological conditions allows dissection of the flavivirus fusion process, identifying two steps where membrane insertion of multiple monomers precedes hairpin trimer formation. This sequence provides insights into the dynamic process of viral fusion, where dissociation of the dimer into monomers and interaction with the target membrane is the first step in the proposed flavivirus fusion cascade. Alkaline pH triggers formation of a prehair intermediate and interaction with target membranes but not hairpin formation and fusion, separating the flavivirus process into discrete stages.
Researchers investigated the drivers of extinction risk in plants, focusing on the Cape of South Africa, a global biodiversity hotspot, by comparing Red List data for the British and South African floras. The taxonomic distribution of extinction risk differs significantly between regions, inconsistent with a simple trait-based model of extinction. A comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the Cape revealed a phylogenetic signal in the distribution of plant risks, with most threatened species clustering within short branches at the tips of the phylogeny, opposite to trends in mammals. Analyzing 11 exemplar clades suggested mode of speciation explains the unusual phylogenetic structure of extinction risks in plants of the Cape. Extinction risk is higher for young and fast-evolving plant lineages and cannot be explained by correlations with simple biological traits. The most vulnerable species are marching towards extinction at a rapid pace, independently from anthropogenic effects. The results have implications for conservation and cast doubts on the utility of current Red List criteria for plants in regions with rapid speciation, aiming to maximize preservation of the tree-of-life. Phylogenetic signal in extinction was quantified using Blomberg's K-statistic on a comprehensive phylogenetic tree, with significance calculated by randomizing tips and recalculating. Species turnover, including speciation and extinction, may be generally rapid for plants, with high rates not unusual over evolutionary timescales.
Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) and Vav contribute to Dectin-dependent phagocytosis of Candida albicans in macrophages. Phagocytosis of Candida albicans by the innate immune system is vital to prevent infection. Dect-1 is the major phagytic receptor involved in anti-fungal immunity. TK and Vav are recruited to phagytic cups containing Candida albicans but are absent from mature phagosomes. TK and Vav localize to regions surrounding hyphae while Dect1 lines the length of phagosome. TK and Vav colocalize with lipid PI(3,4,5)P and F-actin at phagytic cup. Using a selective TK inhibitor shows TK contributes to DAG synthesis at phytic cup and recruitment of PKCε. TK or V1 deficient macrophages display defect in zymosan and Candida phagytosis. Bone marrow macrophages lacking TK or V1 show reduced uptake of Candida comparable to Dect1 deficient cells. TK or V1 deficient mice are more susceptible to systemic Candida infection. This work identifies an important role for TK and V1 in immune responses against Candida. Phagocytosis continues throughout coincubation but Candida morphology changes from yeast to hyal form. Total cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblot. Immunofluorescence investigated Dect1 localization during phytosis of Candida hypha. Dect1 enriched in cuff region of phytic cup where TK/V1/Syk recruited. Phosomes with internalized Candida showed little Dect staining. PI(3,4,5)P areas formed during Dect mediated phytosis and TK and V1 recruited with F-act formation.
Rift Valley fever is a vector-borne disease affecting ruminants and humans that heavily affected Madagascar in 2008-2009 with a large and heterogeneous spread. Environmental factors and areas favorable to transmission were identified using Multiple Factor Analysis and Generalized Linear Models. Cattle and human seroprevalence rates were positively associated with humid environments and high cattle density. Frequent contact with raw milk contributed to human infection. Eastern, western, and northwestern parts were identified as high-risk areas for transmission. The study suggests concomitant vectorial and direct transmissions are critical to maintain RV enzoot transmission. Vector transmission probably occurs in cattle and human in at-risk humid environments with suitable Culex and Anopheles mosquitoes. The relative contribution of vector or direct transmissions could be further assessed by modeling. The roles of direct and vector transmissions remain unevaluated and vary among eco-clatic areas. Two major outbreaks occurred in 1990-91 and 2008-09 with epidemic waves during rainy seasons. Control measures need insight into the role of transmission routes. Environmental factors, cattle density, and human behavior were analyzed to identify at-risk areas and human infections in Malasy contexts.
Prions are self-propagating protein conformations that can transmit between non-identical proteins, but this process is often inefficient due to transmission barriers attributed to sequence differences in prion proteins. Researchers used a yeast Rn1/[PIN+]-based system to explore the nature of transmission barriers and found that Rn1 encompasses multiple prion determinants that can independently drive amyloid formation and transmit the [PIN+] state. Analysis of [PIN] transmission between Rn1 fragments with different prion determinants showed one Q-rich region is required and usually sufficient for transmission, despite identical sequences, transmissions are impeded by barriers of different strength. The existence of transmission barriers in the absence of amino acid mismatches indicates complex prion domains with multiple prion determinants act cooperatively attain the final prion conformation and transmission is determined by this fold. Rn1's prion domain carries four discrete Q-rich regions and no single Q region is essential for maintaining the prion state, suggesting multiple determinants support the prion. Bacterially expressed Rn1 fragments lacking Q regions were tested for amyloid formation and results showed Q1's inability to maintain the prion is not unexpected due to its short length and lack of oligopeptide repeats. The study reveals transmission barriers are determined by cooperative folding of prion domains and not just sequence differences, providing insight into prion transmission mechanisms.
A novel likelihood-free inference framework using deep learning is introduced to compute complex population genetic models from genomic data. Deep learning utilizes multilayer neural networks to learn feature-based functions from input to output, effectively inferring population parameters. The method is applied to jointly infer natural selection and demography, separating global demography from local selection without sequential steps. Studying demography and selection is motivated by Drosophila, where selection confounds demographic analysis. The method is applied to 197 African Drosila melanaster genomes to infer demography and regions under selection, finding many regions with hard sweeps and fewer under soft sweeps or balancing selection. Soft sweeps occur more frequently closer to the centromere of each chromosome. Demographic inference suggests previously estimated bottlenecks for African Drosila melanaster are extreme. Deep learning provides a way to distinguish informative statistics and can accommodate complex models, offering a complimentary approach to existing likelihood-free inference. The method can select optimal statistics for ABC and classify regions as neutral or selected, useful for demographic inference. Future work includes applying deep learning to wider scenarios in genetics and exploring hybrid approaches to extend generality and usefulness of ABC.
High-risk human papillomavirus oncogenes disrupt the Fanconi anemia DNA repair pathway by impairing localization and de-ubiquination of Fanc2. Persistent expression of high-risk HPV oncogenes is necessary for the development of anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. E6/E7 expressing cells are hypersensitive to DNA crosslink agent cisplatin and have defects in repairing DNA interstrand crosslinks. E6/E7 attenuate the Fanconi anemia DNA cross repair pathway by increasing Fanc2 monoubitination and foci formation but inhibit completion of repair through multiple mechanisms. E6/E7 impair Fanc2 colocalization with double-strand breaks, hindering recruitment of Rad51 to DSB, and delay Fanc2 de-ubitination, important for effective ICL repair. Delayed Fanc2 de-ubitination is associated with increased chromatin retention of Fanc2, hindering USP1 de-ubiquinating activity and persistently activated ATR/CHK-1/p565 Fanc signaling. E6 mediated p53 degradation does not hamper cell cycle process of Fanc2 modifications but abrogates repair by disrupting Fanc2 de-ubitination. E6 reduces expression and foci of Palb2, a protein downstream of Fanc2. HPV oncogenes promote initiation of FA pathway but hinder completion by multiple mechanisms, causing accumulation of monoubitinated Fanc2 at sites away from DNA damage. Augmented ATR activity results in increased phosphorylation of Fanc, promoting monoubitination and inhibiting de-ubitination, providing a framework for HR-HPV oncogen disruption of the FA pathway. Delayed Fanc2 de-ubitination in E expressing cells may be due to retaining chromatin-bound Fanc2/FI after damage. These findings uncover mechanisms by which HPV oncogen contribute to genomic instability and response to cisplatin therapies.
The Southern Chiapas focus of onchocerciasis in Mexico has undergone semi-annual mass treatment with ivermectin since 1998, with 50 communities shifting to quarterly treatment in 2003 and an additional 113 communities added in 2009. In-depth epidemiologic and entomologic assessments were performed in six sentinel and three extra-sentinel communities. None of the 67,924 Simulium ochraceum collected were found to contain parasite DNA, resulting in an upper bound of 95% confidence interval of infective rate of 0.06/1000,000 flies. Serological testing of 4230 children under 5 revealed 2 exposed to Onchocerca volulus, 0.05%. The findings meet criteria for interruption of transmission. The Oncherciasis Elimination Program aims to eliminate ocular morbidity and transmission in 13 Latin America foci, with the Southern Chiapas focus comprising 21% of the at-risk population. Annual mass ivermect distribution began in 1994, modified to every 6 months in 1998. Coverage remained above 85% from 1998-201, with 22 consecutive rounds reaching 85% of the population. The results indicate interruption of Onchocerca volulus transmission in the Southern Chiapas focus, meeting international criteria.
Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen, invades mammalian cells and escapes from membrane-bound vacuoles to replicate within the host cytosol. The transcription activator PrfA regulates gene products required for intracellular growth and bacterial spread, and becomes activated following L. monocogenes entry into host cells. Researchers have identified a small peptide pheromone, pPpl, secreted by L. monocogenes, which enhances escape from host vacoles and may facilitate PrA activation. The pPpl pherone is generated via proteolytic processing of the Ppl liprotein signal peptide. Bacteria lacking the pP pherone are attenuated for virulence in mice and have reduced efficiency of escape from vacoles in nonphagocytic cells. Mutational activation of PrA restores virulence and eliminates the need for pA-dependent signaling. The pA peptide may signal L.ogen its presence within the host vacole, stimulating expression of products contributing to vacole escape and PrA activation for bacterial growth. The pA pherone is released following cleavage and processing from the Ppl liprotein secretion sequence, and its production enhances escape and is required for full virulence. A proposed model suggests L.ogen produces basal Ppl, secreted through the bacterial membrane, and pA serves to signal vacolar escape in nonphagocytic cells.
Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, has the ability to colonize host intestines and combat host-produced reactive oxygen species during infection. To understand the molecular mechanisms utilized by V. cholera to overcome reactive oxygen species, a whole-genome transposon sequencing analysis was performed comparing gene requirements for colonization in mice with and without antioxidant N-acetyl cystine treatment. Mutants of the methyl mismatch repair system, such as MutS, displayed significant colonization advantages in untreated mice but not in N-acetyl cystine treated mice. The accumulation of catalase-producing mutants and rugose variants was the cause of MutS enrichment by oxidative stress during infection. Rugose variants could revert to smooth colonies upon aerobic in vitro culture. The mutation rate of wildtype colonized in N-acetyl cystine mice was higher than non-treated mice. These findings support a paradigm in which V. cholera employs a temporal strategy to battle reactive oxygen species during infection resulting in enriched phenotypes. MutS and complementation can be used to model hypermutation in pathogens to identify novel resistance mechanisms. The study used a streptomycin-treated mouse model to investigate V. cholera genes involved in reactive oxygen species resistance and found deletion of MutS results in significant colonization advantage in reactive oxygen-rich mice. The results suggest V. cholera utilizes increased mutation rates as a strategy for adopting advantageous phenotypes during infection of a reactive oxygen host.
Researchers analyzed 60 new mlh3 alleles in baker's yeast to understand how Mlh-Mlh functions in meiosis and mismatch repair. Five alleles disrupted mismatch repair, while one, mlh-32, specifically disrupted meiotic crossing over. Mlh-mlh representatives were purified and characterized, displaying wild-type endonuclease activities in vitro. Msh-Msh stimulated the endonuclease activity of Mlh-mlh32 but not Mlh-mlh45, suggesting Mlhmlh45 is defective in Msh interactions. Genome recombination maps for wild-type and ml3 mutants showed increases in noncrossover events, consistent with recombination intermediates resolved through alternative pathways. Observations provide a structure-function map for Mlh, revealing the importance of protein interactions regulating enzymatic activity. Defective meiotic components alter the fate of meiotic recombination intermediates, providing insights into meiotic pathways regulation. Mlhmlh plays a minor role in eukaryotic mismatch repair and major role in meiotic crossing over. Mutations in ml3 compromised DNA binding activity, suggesting linker region importance for meiotic functions. Endonuclease activity is required for both mismatch repair and crossing. Separation of function Mlhmlh complexes explained defects by weakened protein interactions, tolerated in meiosis but not mismatch repair. High-resolution mapping revealed defective meiotic components alter recombination intermediates fate.
The intense use of antibiotics has led to increasing levels of drug resistance in diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, Staphylococcus aureus, and gonorrhea, necessitating a switch to new drugs and discontinuation of older ones. However, resistance often declines slowly or persists after treatment is stopped, attributed to low fitness costs of resistance in the absence of the drug. Research shows that host population structure, particularly heterogeneity in number of contacts, plays a crucial role in reversion dynamics. Host contact structure affects the distribution of resistant strains during treatment and competition after discontinuation, mitigating fitness advantages, resulting in lower reversion rates and probability of reversion to sensitivity. Simulations demonstrate the impact of heterogeneity is maximal when fitness costs of resistance are small, a biologically plausible range for many pathogen-drug combinations. The study reveals large differences between sensitive and resistant strains lead to non-trivial distribution of infections, influencing reversion dynamics after treatment stops. The effects of contact heterogeneity on reversion probability are strongest when fitness differences between sensitive and resistant strains in absence of treatment are small. The framework models the emergence of resistance during treatment and competition between resistant and sensitive strains after discontinuation using a non-limiting susceptible-infected-susceptible model on a heterogeneous network.
Autism spectrum disorders are highly heritable and characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication, as well as restricted and repetitive behaviors. Although highly penetrant gene variants have been identified, there is evidence supporting a causal role for combinatorial effects from multiple loci. Researchers examined synaptic and circadian phenotypes resulting from dosage variants of human orthologs in Drosophila and observed synergistic interactions between pairs of candidate genes affected by large de novo copy number variants found in individuals with autism. Dosage alterations of Drosila orthologs of candidate genes from de novo CNVs displayed neurological defects similar to those in Drosila models of ASD-associated variants. Pairwise changes within sets of orthologs of genes affected by the same de novo CNV showed significant synergistic effects, supporting concordant phenotypic outcomes across interacting gene pairs. The study illustrates mechanisms by which synergistic effects from structural variation contribute to human disease, demonstrating specificity and transitivity between interactors within and between CNV candidate sets, and distinct aetiologies affecting divergent synaptic processes. The findings suggest combined effects of genes' copy change causally contribute to autistic phenotypes, supporting multiple-hit models of autism.
Brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells play a central role in the development of experimental cerebral malaria during Plasmodium berghei ANKA infection in C57/BL6 mice, but the mechanisms of their pathogenic activity remain poorly understood. Intravital two-photon microscopy and ex vivo flow cytometric analysis show that brain-infiltrating T cells accumulate in perivascular spaces in both ECM-inducing and non-inducing infections. However, perivascular T cells exhibit arrested behavior specifically during P. berghei ANKA infection, despite comparable activation phenotypes in both infections. T cells form long-term interactions with CX3CR1-bearing antigen presenting cells during P. berghei ANKA infection, but abrogation of this interaction does not prevent ECM development. Pathogenic CD8 T cells colocalize with apoptotic CD31-expressing endothelial cells, but cellular apoptosis is rare and does not disrupt cerebral vasculature integrity. The arrest of T cells in perivascular compartments is a signature of ECM-inducing infection, implying an important role in ECM development. CD8 T cells accumulate similarly in brains of mice with PbKA and Pb65 parasites, but behave differently in ECM-inducing and non-inducing infections. The source of malar antigen and mode of presentation to pathogenic cells during ECM-inducing infections is under investigation, with antigen-specific CD8 T cells migrating to the brain but not inducing ECM until a critical threshold is reached.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 21 villages in Viga County, Kenya, to determine the burden of Tungiasis, a parasitic disease caused by the sand flea Tunga penetrans. A total of 437 participants, 5 years and above were examined, and the overall prevalence was found to be 21.5% (95% CI: 17.7-25%). Multivariate analysis suggested the occurrence of Tungias was associated with low economic status, age ≤14, no regular use of closed footwear, and lack of toilet facilities. The study used GIS to map the geographic distribution of Tungias in the area and found the highest concentration of cases in Chambiti and Selel villages. Factors contributing to Tungias include low income, earthen floor, lack of toilet facilities and common resting inside the house. Tungias is an important health problem in Viga County occasioned by low economic status. The findings suggest a need to design control strategies for Tias that are cost-effective and easily accessible. The disease affects communities living in precarious conditions, trapping them in a cycle of poverty and disease, with children and the elderly bearing the brunt of infection during peak transmission.
Researchers developed a computational model of auxin transport in the Arabidopsis root, considering hormonal regulation of auxin transporters, cell shape, and polarity, and cell walls. The model reveals that a spatial pattern of cytokinin generated by diffusion is unlikely and not required for correct auxin patterning. Instead, auxin-dependent modifications of cytokinin response allow for necessary feedback, amplifying and stabilizing the auxin maximum. Simulations demonstrate the importance of hormonal regulation of auxin efflux for robustness and predict a role of AUX1 and LAX2 auxin influx transporters in vascular patterning. Polarization of PIN1 generates an auxin circuit that stabilizes accumulation within the xylem axis and provides a mechanism for auxin to accumulate in xylem-pole pericycle cells, an early step in lateral root initiation. Pericycle cells opposite xyle poles compete for auxin accumulation, consistent with observations that lateral roots are not initiated opposite each other. The mutually inhibitory auxin-cytokin loop maintains the auxin maximum in the xyle axis, and simulations show sustained auxin accumulation throughout the xyle axis, similar to the pattern near the quiescent center in Arabidopsis roots. The study provides insights into the dynamics of transverse auxin transport and its role in root growth, highlighting the importance of auxin influx and efflux in vascular patterning and lateral root initiation.
Researchers have identified the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein B (CRE-B) as a key mediator in the neuropeptide F (NPF)/nitric oxide (NO) signaling pathway, regulating phase-related locomotor plasticity in migratory locusts. CRE-B directly activates brain nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression by interacting with the NOS promoter region. Phosphorylation of CRE-B at serine 110 changes in response to population density and is negatively controlled by NPF2. RNA interference and behavioral assays validate CRE-B involvement in NPF-regulated locomotor plasticity. Protein kinase mediates the effects of NPF on CRE-B phosphorylation and NOS transcription. Genome walking and dual-lucase assays characterized the NOS gene promoter sequence. The study reveals a precise signal cascade underlying environment-induced behavioral plasticity, extending previous findings by uncovering key components CRE-B and PKA in the NPF/NO pathway. The NPY/PKA/CRE-B cascade may represent a common mechanism for behavioral plasticity in animals. NPF2 modulates phase-related locomotor activity by suppressing NOS transcription and CRE-B mediates this effect. Phosphorylated CRE-B levels decrease after N2 injection in gregarious locusts and elevate after N2 gene knockdown in solitary locusts. The findings highlight a previously undefined regulatory mechanism of NOS transcription in insects and neuromodulator/effect gene contribution to environment-induced plasticity.
The earliest stages of development in metazoans are driven by maternally deposited proteins and mRNAs, with widespread transcriptional activation of the zygotic genome occurring hours after fertilization at the maternal-to-zygotic transition. In Drosophila, the zinc-finger protein Zelda plays a key role in transcriptional activation of genes that initiate sex determination and patterning. Chromatin immunoprecipation with high-throughput sequencing mapped regions bound by Zelda before, during, and after the maternal-to-zygotic transition, identifying thousands of regions bound by Zelda at cycle 8, most remaining bound through cycle 14. Early Zelda-bound regions include promoters and enhancers of genes transcribed at this stage, as well as promoters of genes first transcribed at the maternal-to-zygotic transition and enhancers bound by transcription factors regulating gene activation. The association between early Zelda binding and maternal-to-zygotic activity is strong, suggesting Zelda plays a major role in activating the genome at this transition. Zelda binding can identify active promoters and regulatory sequences with specificity, indicating a central role in regulating genome activity at the maternal-to-zyotic transition, in addition to its established role in early transcriptional activation. Zelda binding to promoters is required for zygotic activation of early genes, with a strong relationship between Zelda binding and onset of zyg transcription in wildtype embryos, where many genes not expressed until cycle 14 were bound by Zelda at cycle 8.
Researchers have identified 109 novel protein-protein interactions among circadian clock proteins using a yeast-two-hybrid approach, including the interaction between protein phosphatase 1 and CLOCK/BMAL1, which results in BMAL1 destabilization. A dynamic circadian protein-protein interaction network was constructed to predict the timing of interactions using circadian expression data. Systematic circadian phenotyping suggests a crucial role for components involved in dynamic interactions. Analysis of the global network in liver revealed interacting proteins are expressed at similar times, restricting interactions to specific phases. Circadian protein interactions dynamically connect important cellular processes, such as signal transduction and cell cycle, contributing to temporal organization of cellular physiology. The study provides a systems-wide view of circadian protein-protein interaction dynamics, not restricted to specific processes or phases. Novel interactions modulate CLOCK/BMAL function, indicating a role for protein phosphatase 1 in regulating BM1 abundance. The network was extended with validated interactions from literature, essential for normal circadian dynamics. Precise timing of gene expression, protein-protein interactions, and post-transcriptional modifications sustain circadian rhythms. The study highlights the importance of timed protein-protein interactions for the circadian clock, but a comprehensive view of the network and regulation of circadian output via time-dependent interactions remains unknown.
Nematode polyprotein allergens are a class of lipid-binding proteins found in nematodes, synthesized as large tandemly repetitive polyproteins that are post-translationally cleaved into multiple copies of small lipid-binding proteins. The structure of ABA1, a repeating unit of the Ascaris nematode polyallergen, has been determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, revealing a novel seven-helical fold with two discrete hydrophobic ligand-binding pockets. Recombinant ABA1 contains tightly-bound ligand of bacterial origin in one of its binding sites. This structure is the first mature, post-translation processed unit of a naturally-occurring tandem-repetitive polyprotein to be structurally characterized and belongs to a new class. Nematode polyallergens have no counterparts in vertebrates, representing potential targets for drug or immunological intervention. Immune responses to nematode polyallergens have been associated with naturally-acquired resistance to infection in humans and the immune repertoire to them is under genetic control. Several species of disease-causing nematodes express nemat polyallergens that are the target of strong immune responses often associated with hypersensitivities. Nemat polyallergens have affinity for pharmacologically active lipids, suggesting sequestration or delivery of natural molecules may be a mechanism by which parasites subvert host response, making them relevant to parasitology and protein science.
Ciguatera poisoning is a tropical disease prevalent in Pacific Island Countries and Territories, caused by consuming fish contaminated with ciguatoxin from dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria. Between 1998-2008, 39,677 cases were reported, with a mean annual incidence of 194 per 100,000 people, a 60% increase from 1973-198. Underreporting suggests 500,000 islanders suffered from ciguater in the last 35 years, exceeding prior estimates. Ciguater causes acute neurologic, gastrointestinal, and cardiac symptoms, and chronic neurologic symptoms lasting weeks to months. The disease is underdiagnosed and underreported, with only 2-10% of cases reported. Factors such as poverty, global warming, and eutrophication contribute to increasing incidence. Ciguatoxin accumulates in the food web through herbivorous and carnivorous fish, and can only be detected in specialized labs. Diagnosis is based on symptoms and recent consumption of potential cigater fish. Climate change, coastal degradation, and resource exploitation are predicted to increase cigater cases, making it a significant public health concern. Multidisciplinary research is needed to translate advances into practical management solutions to address this acute and chronic illness with major health significance.
Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is characterized by the persistence of the parasite and impairment of the cellular immune response. A study of 38 chronic Chagas patients and 12 healthy controls found a higher frequency of CD4+8+ T cells in patients, with a higher ratio of CD4+8low/CD8high subpopulations. These cells expressed higher levels of inhibitory receptors in proportion to disease severity. Benznazole treatment reduced the frequency of CD4+8+ cells, the ratio of CD8low/8 subpopulations, and co-expression of inhibitory receptors, while enhancing multifunctional capacity. T cruz antigen-specific CD4+8 T cells expressing IL-2 and TNFα increased after treatment. The results suggest CD4+8 T cells play a role in controlling T cruzi infection, producing effector molecules for parasite control. Benznazole partially reversed exhaustion caused by T cruz infection, improving the functional response of T antigen-specific CD4+8 T cells. Over 50% of patients had a positive PCR result for parasite detection, indicating antigen persistence during chronic phase. The findings indicate CD4+8 cells are an important component of the immune response against T cruz infection and benznazole improves antigen-specific responses, providing a tool to analyze treatment efficacy in chronic Chagas disease.
Arabidopsis AtPL2 is a primary phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase involved in phosphoinide metabolism and the endoplasmic retic stress response. Phosphoinides are important lipid signals in plant development and stress response. AtPL2 is the primary phospholase in phosphoinide metabolism and involved in seedling growth and endoplasmic retic reticulum responses. Lipomic profiling of plc mutants showed increased levels of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate and phosphatidyositol 4,5-bisphosphate, indicating impaired phosphoinide metabolic pathway. AtPL2 displayed distinct tissue expression and localized at plasma membrane in cell types where phosphoinide signaling occurs. Seedlings of plc2 mutant showed growth defects complemented by heterologous expression of AtC2, indicating phosphoinosit-specific phospholip C activity is required for seedling growth. The plc2 mutant showed hypersensitive response to ER stress with changes in phenotypes and gene profiles. AtC2 is primary enzyme in phosphoinide metabolism, involved in seedling growth, and emerging link between phosphoinide and ER response. The ER is major site of phospholip biosynthesis and phospholip signaling associated with ER function. At2 is major PI-PL in phosphoinide metabolism and seedling growth in Arabidopsis and important for ER tolerance, suggesting a link between phosphoinide signaling and ER response.
Researchers challenge the reductionist assumption that causation occurs exclusively at the micro level by employing a principled measure of intrinsic cause-effect power, showing macro levels can have higher cause-effect power than micro levels. Evaluating simple systems across spatial and temporal scales, black-box elements consisting of one or more micro elements exhibit higher cause-effect power due to emergent mechanisms and constraints not apparent at the micro level. Macro systems can have higher cause-effect power with more interconnected mechanisms and composition. Local maxima of cause-effect power are identified across spatiotemporal scales, demonstrated in a biological system, the Boolean model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, corresponding to emergent cause properties. Intrinsic-effect power quantifies causal power, refuting reductionism that causal power resides exclusively at the micro. Local maxima capture emergent functional roles of black-box elements, describing the system as sets of NOR, OR/AND, or MAJORITY elements. Evaluating cause-effect power across scales shows local maxima of macro-effect where integrated information decreases or falls to zero. Emergent cause properties include increased intrinsic-effect power and relationships between elements apparent at the macro level, quantified using interventional and counterfactual causal framework of integrated information theory.
Researchers investigated the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, which play a crucial role in cellular adaptation and can cause damage under hypoxia/reoxygenation conditions relevant to various diseases. An extended model of complex III was developed to account for electron transport, proton translocation, and substrate transport to mitochondria, fitting measured electron fluxes in rat mitochondria fueled by succinate or pyruvate and malate. Analysis revealed an association of ROS production with specific radicals of individual transporters in complexes I and III. The phenomenon of bistability in complex III remains valid for the whole respiratory chain, with conditions for switching to a high radical state predicted and confirmed experimentally. ROS generation starts with superoxide formation through interaction between oxygen and free radicals, deactivated mainly by superoxide dismutase. Inhibition of reverse electron transport decreases ROS production in succinate-fueled mitochondria. The model provides insight into respiration and ROS production, explaining experimental data without precise parameter evaluation. Mitochondria fueled by succinate do not expend energy on ATP synthesis, resulting in fast NAD reduction, characterized by NAD-dependent TCA reactions and forward flux from succinate oxidation in the presence of rotenone, an inhibitor of electron transport complex I.
Intracellular transport in eukaryotic cells is facilitated by motor proteins that convert chemical energy into kinetic energy, working in teams to enable unidirectional and bidirectional transport of cargo over long distances. Disruptions in these mechanisms, often caused by mutations altering single motor characteristics, can lead to neurodegenerative diseases. Phosphorylation of kinesin motor at serine residue is implicated in Huntington's disease, with studies indicating lowered single motor stalling forces. This research investigates the effects of such mutations on transport properties of cargo carried by multiple wild-type and mutant motors. Results show that mutants with altered forces can determine average velocity and run-length even when outnumbered, gaining a competitive advantage and increasing run-length when cargo load is near the mutant's stalling force. A semi-analytical method is developed to analyze cargo transport by multiple motor types, determining transition rates between configurations and computing biologically relevant quantities like velocity and run-length without Monte Carlo simulations. This method models alterations in single parameters to deduce effects on transport by multiple motors and is easily implementable with provided software. The study reveals emergent behaviors when cargo is transported by mixed motor proteins, analyzing Ser175 kines mutation impact on transport with wild-type motors, shedding light on how mutants affect intracellular transport and disease onset.
Researchers investigated the role of the CNA1 gene in operant learning by studying mice with a selective knockout of the Cac1 gene, which codes for the α subunit of Cav1.2 calcium channels, and is associated with learning deficits and psychiatric disorders. Using a 2-choice operant cue discrimination task, they analyzed behavioral strategies and performance in Cac1 knockout and control mice. Results showed that C1 knockout did not impair learning overall, but affected the strategy used, with most C1 knockout mice adapting an outcome-based strategy, while controls used the intended cue-association rule. The study suggests a specific role of the C1 gene in learning and highlights the importance of examining response patterns in terms of potential behavioral strategies. The findings have implications for understanding learning mechanisms in normal and psychiatric conditions, as C1 has been implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disease. Calcium influx through Cav1.2 channels is essential for synaptic plasticity and adaptations underlying instrumental learning, and its ablation has been associated with spatial memory and fear learning deficits. The study used a detailed analysis of behavioral responses and rewards, combined with Bayesian computational models, to examine the learning process.
Researchers investigated the impact of cyclical heat stress on Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with different types of Wolbachia bacteria, including wMel, wAlB, and wMel-CLA. The study found that rearing wMel and wMel-CLA-infected larvae at 26-37°C reduced the expression of cytoplasmic incompatibility, a reproductive manipulation induced by Wolbach, and decreased the density of Wolbach in adults. Furthermore, wMel and wMel-CLA infections were not transmitted to the next generation when mosquitoes were exposed to 26-37°C across life stages. In contrast, wAlB infection maintained high density, exhibited complete cytoplasm incompatibility, and was transmitted from mother to offspring with high fidelity under the temperature cycle. The findings have implications for the success of Wolia interventions across environments and highlight the importance of temperature control in rearing. The study demonstrated that wMel and wMel-CLA infections exhibit incomplete cytoplasm incompatibility when immature stages experience cyclical temperatures of 26-37°C and are not transmitted to the next generation under these conditions. Reduced hatch rate in w-infected mosquitoes may reflect the loss of Wolia under heat stress, leading to partial cytoplasm incompatibility. The density of Wolia in whole infected adults was measured using quantitative PCR when reared at different temperatures.
Adenoviruses are significant human pathogens that have been developed as vectors for gene therapies and genetic vaccines. Researchers investigated the natural history of adenovirus infections in non-human primates, discovering that healthy great apes and macaques shed substantial quantities of infectious adenoviruses in stool, with frequencies higher than those found in asymptomatic humans. Thirty novel adenoviruses from apes and three from macaques were purified and sequenced, revealing classification into species corresponding to human adenovirus B, C, and E, with evidence of intraspecies recombination and high phylogenetic relatedness across primate hosts, indicating cross-transmission events. High asymptomatic shedding in non-human primates and evidence of zoonotic transmission warrants caution in handling and housing. The presence of persistent adenovirus infections in the gut should be considered in human and non-human studies with adenovirus vectors. Adenoviruses were detected in 18% of 568 non-human primate stool samples, with 22-38% shedding observed in chimpanzees, bonos, and gorillas. The rate of recovery from human stools was similar to previous reports, with prolonged shedding observed in a subset of individuals. The findings suggest adenoviruses establish chronic infections following initial exposure and may not be clinically relevant.
The eukaryotic genome is packaged into chromatin, with the nucleosome as its fundamental unit, consisting of 146-147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a histone core. To function, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped, a process not well understood at the atomic level. Molecular dynamics simulations calculated free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA, revealing a change of 11.5 kcal/mol, agreeing with single molecule experiments. Various conformation states indicate multiple paths, but the dominant path is asymmetric. Unwrapping starts with five base pairs at one end, followed by five at the same end with no energy increase, then 10 base pairs at the other end. Further unwrapping advances one end, then the other, completing the superhelical turn. Results provide insight into nucleosome construction, disruption, and repositioning during cellular processes. Simulations used adaptively biased molecular dynamics and multiple walker methods, separating unwrapping into stages, showing asymmetric unwrapping despite pseudo-symmetric nucleosome structure and DNA sequence. Free energy profiles show unwrapping costs 11.5 kcal/mol, consistent with quantitative models explaining nucleosome disassembly rates and histone-DNA interactions.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which the protein Lipocalin Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) preserves lysosomal integrity in cells under oxidative stress conditions. ApoD, an antioxidant protein, is secreted by astrocytes to protect neurons from damage, plays a crucial role in maintaining lysosomal pH homeostasis and preventing membrane permeabilization. Upon oxidative stress, ApoD is endocytosed and targeted to vulnerable lysosomes where it maintains acidic environment and prevents lipid peroxide levels from rising, safeguarding lysosomal integrity. This function is necessary for lysosomes to recover from oxidation-induced alkalinization in both astrocytes and neurons. Two lysosomal processes, myelin phagocytosis by astrotes and optimization of neurodegeneration-triggered autagy, require Apo-related lipocalins. The study reveals a previously unknown function of Apo, setting lipoprotein regulation of lysosomal integrity as a mechanism critical for various cellular functions and neurodegenerative diseases. Apo entrance into lysosomes is promoted under pro-oxidative conditions, recruited to vulnerable lysosomes where it maintains pH gradients, avoiding membrane permeabilization. The findings provide a therapeutic route for repair of lysosomes in pathological situations, opening opportunities for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by targeting lipocalin-mediated regulation of lysosomal integrity.
Phlebotomus orientalis, the main vector of visceral leishmaniasis in East Africa, was studied in two Ethiopian localities, a non-endemic Melka Werer and endemic Addis Zemen. Life cycle parameters differed between the two colonies, including larval food and humidity requirements, but genetic analyses showed no differences. F1 hybrids had higher fecundity than parental colonies. Susceptibility to Leishmania donovani was high, with 50% infection at the lowest dose and 90% at higher doses. Development was fast, with metacyclic promastotes in thoracic midgut and stomal valve colonization by day five post-feeding. Both colonies were highly susceptible to Ethiopian L. donani strains. The infective dose at the lowest concentration was one or two promastotes per sand fly meal. Development was similar in both colonies, indicating non-endemic Melka Werer's absence of visceral leishmanis cannot be attributed to local P. orientalis susceptibility. Infection rates were high, around 90%, with slightly higher intensity in Addis Zemen. CytB and COI sequences were identical, submitted to GenBank. Susceptibility was demonstrated using GRE1 strain, with 75% infection on day 2 post-blood meal, proving P. orientalis is highly susceptible, requiring low parasites for establishment.
Advanced schistosomiasis is a leading healthcare priority in China due to its significant health and economic impacts, yet its burden has not been fully accounted for in the Global Burden of Disease study. To address this, researchers conducted a patient-based quality-of-life evaluation for advanced schistosomiasis japonica cases in a hyperendemic county in China. Of 506 candidates, 215 cases were confirmed and assessed using the European quality of life questionnaire, ultrasonography, and laboratory testing. Most patients reported impairments in at least one health dimension, such as pain or discomfort, usual activities, and anxiety or depression. The overall disability weight was 0.447, with age-specific weights ranging from 0.378 to 0.510. Disability weights were positively associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, ascites, and active hepatitis B, while splenectomy and albumin were protective factors for quality of life. The study found that advanced schistosiasis japonica is associated with poor self-reported quality of life, high morbidity, and heavy disability, with an overall disability weight of 0.447. Almost all patients complained of some impairment, with the highest prevalence in pain or discomfort and usual activities. These patient-preference estimates can inform revisions to the Global Burden of Disease and evidence-based decision-making in China's national schistosomias control program.
Human African Trypanosomiasis and Animal Trypanosomias are prevalent parasitic vector-borne diseases in sub-Saharan Africa, transmitted through the bite of an infected tsetse fly carrying the protozoan Trypanoma brucei. A retrospective cross-sectional study utilized national census data to estimate population vulnerability and disability in Kenya's 7 tse belts, assessing potential Human African Trypanosomias infection risk. The study found tse belts significantly associated with increased disability and evaluated direct and indirect exposure pathways, including the bite of a pathogenic tse fly and agricultural production loss due to Animal Trypanosomias. Incorporating disability reports from the census is a promising surveillance tool for future Human African Tryosomias programs. The combined burdens of Human and Animal Tryosomias and agricultural production costs contribute to disability in tse-infested areas. Kenya hosts 8 tse species across 7 belts, with Zone 6 having 92% immigrants from Uganda, where over 40% is infested with tse and 70% livestock at risk of tryosomias. Alternative surveillance approaches are needed due to lack of public health infrastructure in rural areas, justifying the use of national census data to estimate vulnerability and disability.
Hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) is a potent inducer of cell differentiation and HIV production in chronically infected cells. HMBA activates the PI3/Akt pathway, leading to phosphorylation of HEX1 and release of positive transcription elongation factor (P-TEFb) from its complex with HEX1 and 7 small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Released P-TEb is recruited to the HIV promoter, stimulating transcription and viral production. Despite continuous HMBA presence, PTEb reassembles with 7snRNA and HEX1. A mutant HEX1 protein that cannot be phosphorylated and released from PTEb and 7snRNA antagonizes HM-mediated induction of viral production. Inhibition of the PIK/Akt pathway and expression of mutant HEX1 proteins also antagonize HM-mediated induction. HMBA reactivates viral production in chronically infected cells via release of active PTEb from the complex, dependent on PI/Akt pathway activation and HEX1 phosphorylation. Released PTE is recruited to the HIV promoter, stimulating elongation, and RNAPI elongates on the viral genome. HM disrupts the complex in a PI3/Akt-dependent manner to release PTE, recruited to the promoter and coding sequences. Stimulation of HIV transcription by HM can occur independently of NF-κ. In the presence of Tat, HIV transcription continues despite modifications in PTE distribution between active and inactive forms.
Researchers have identified a link between the presence of Leishmania RNA virus (LRV) and the development of mucosal leishmaniasis (ML) or disseminated cutaneous leishmanis (DCL) in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by New World Leishmania species. The LRV exacerbates the disease, leading to hyper-inflammatory responses and tissue destruction. To improve detection methods, a study developed techniques, including an anti-dsRNA monoclonal antibody (J2), for sequence-independent recognition of dsRNA. Applications include immunofluorescence, ELISA, and dot blot, complementing nucleic acid purification and real-time PCR. The J2 antibody successfully detected LRV in several parasite strains, patient samples, and infected mice lesion biopsies. Leishmanis is a significant protozoan disease with 12 million infections and 350 million at risk worldwide, mainly presenting as CL or visceral leishis. Notably, LRV genome is recognized by host Toll-like-receptor, exacerbating disease in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-dRNA immunodetection approach was tested on isolated Leish parasites from an L braziliensis patient and catalogued human isolates, showing potential as a diagnostic tool for predicting LRV-related risk of leishial dissemination.
Enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escheria coli (EPEC and EHE) are closely related pathogens that attach to intestinal epithelial cells, efface microvilli, and promote cytoskeletal rearrangements into protrusions called actin pedestals. The ability to generate these structures correlates with bacterial colonization in animal models, but the precise function of pedestals in infection remains unclear. PEC employs tyrosine phosphorylated transmembrane receptor Tir, while EHE relies on multivalent scaffolding protein EspFU to trigger pedestal formation. Both PEC and EHE form distinct bacterial communities or macrocolonies encompassing multiple host cells. Tir, EspFU, and Arp2/3 complex are critical for expansion of macrocolonies over time. EspFU accelerates formation of larger macrocolon compared to PEC, as Esp-mediated actin assembly drives bacterial motility to junctions where bacteria form secondary pedestals on neighboring cells and divide, allowing one daughter to disengage and infect the second cell. Data reveal Esp enhances epithelial colonization by increasing actin-based motility and promoting efficient cell-to-cell transmission. EHE mechanism of pedestal assembly provides colonization advantage over PEC actin polymerization in polarized intestinal epithelia. EHE and PEC reorganize actin, creating attaching and effacing lesions characterized by intimate attachment, loss of microvilli, and filamentous actin pedestals beneath bacteria. Actin motility driven by EHE and Tir plays key role in extent of tissue colonization and spreading across cell monolayer.
Researchers compared differential centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography for purifying extracellular vesicles from helminth pathogens, specifically Fasciola hepatica. Transmission electron and atomic force microscopy showed that size exclusion chromatography-prepared vesicles were smaller and less diverse than those from differential centrifugation. Protein quantification and Western blotting revealed higher purity and reduced soluble cathepsin proteases in size chromatography-prepared vesicles. Proteomic analysis indicated differential centrifation-prepared vesicles were contaminated with excretory-secretory proteins and tegal proteins. Size chromatography-prepared vesicles contained fewer tegal proteins and had a less diverse proteome. There were 2.6 times more protein identifications in differential centrifation-prepared vesicles, many from excretory-secretory proteins and tegument. The study suggests differential centrifation and size chromatography do not isolate equivalent vesicle populations and caution is needed in choosing purification methods. Size chromatography is proposed for helmin pathogen extracellular vesicle purification prior to downstream studies due to its higher purity and reduced contamination. The findings highlight the importance of reliable protocols for isolating extracellular vesicles from excretory-secretory products for functional studies and applications, particularly in understanding host-pathogen communication and immunity. Size chromatography with functional assays is recommended for helmin pathogen studies in the absence of a standard purification method.
Researchers employed a reverse-engineering approach to study post-transcriptional regulation of gap genes Krüppel, knir, and giant in Drosophila melanaster, utilizing detailed quantitative datasets of gene mRNA and protein expression to fit a model of post-transcription regulation. The results demonstrate that post-transcription regulation is necessary for proper control of protein levels but not required for patterning in this system. The fitted model's uniqueness and specificity were rigorously determined in the context of spatio-temporal pattern formation, increasing the potential of reverse engineering for studying development and complex biological processes. The approach involved fitting models to protein expression data using mRNA patterns as inputs, with successful reproduction of gap patterns indicating no post-transcription regulation requirement and failure to fit identifying features relying on post-transcription processes. Identifiability analysis showed robust and specific results with biologically plausible parameter values regarding time and diffusive properties of gene patterning. The study addressed the importance of post-transcription regulation in animal development, focusing on the dynamics of spatio-temporal formation in the early Drosila melanaster embryo, using a high-resolution dataset of mRNA patterns for the gap genes Kr, kn, and gt, covering the entire blastoderm stage. The findings provide quantitative insights into post-transcription regulation and demonstrate the effectiveness of the reverse-engineering approach for studying complex biological problems.
Rotavirus is a major cause of diarrhea worldwide, exhibiting pronounced intestinal epithelial cell tropism, with infants and neonatal mice being highly susceptible, while adults remain asymptomatic and shed low numbers of viral particles. Research investigated age-dependent mechanisms of intestinal epithelial innate response to rotavirus infection in an oral mouse model, finding Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) expression low in suckling mice epithelium but increasing postnatally, inversely correlating with rotavirus susceptibility, viral shedding, and histological damage. Adult mice deficient in TLR3 or the adaptor TRIF showed higher viral shedding and decreased epithelial expression of proinflammatory and antiviral genes. Neonatal mice deficient in TLR3 or TRIF did not display impaired cell stimulation or enhanced rotavirus susceptibility. A significant age-dependent increase in TLR3 expression was detected in human intestinal biopsies, suggesting upregulation of epithelial TLR3 during infancy contributes to age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus infection. TLR3-Trif mediated immune signaling influenced epithelial cytokine and chemokine expression, antiviral effector recruitment, and viral shedding in adult but not neonate mice. Host protection in adult intestinal epithelial cells relies on TLR/Tr mediated innate activation, whereas antiviral defense in suckling is TRIF independent. Data confirm age-dependent susceptibility to rotavirus correlates with low expression of TLR3 and responsiveness in intestinal cells.
Researchers analyzed whole-exome sequencing data from 1,039 subjects with autism spectrum disorders and 870 controls of similar ancestry to identify rare exonic variations associated with the condition. The data, generated from two sequencing centers using different methods, was filtered and evaluated for consistency. Gene-based association analysis was performed using both meta-analysis and mega-analysis, with simulations showing mega-analysis to be more powerful. Population structure was found to confound case-control studies, but principal component analysis controlled for ancestry and produced appropriate test statistics. No new risk genes for autism spectrum disorders were identified, suggesting standard gene tests require larger samples for effective discovery. Thousands of individuals may be needed to achieve genome-wide significance. The study highlights the importance of rare variants in the genetic architecture of autism spectrum disorders and the need for larger samples to identify novel genes associated with the condition. Exome sequencing has shown success in candidate gene studies, but most have not reached exome-wide significance due to limited power. Combining rare variants within or across genes is necessary for association tests to reach sufficient power, emphasizing the need for larger studies to understand the genetic basis of autism spectrum disorders.
Madurella mycomatis is the prevalent causative agent of eumycoma in Sudan, characterized by the formation of grains. A study investigated the association between polymorphisms in chitin-degrading enzymes, chitriosase and AMCase, and the incidence of M. mycatis mycoma in a Sudanese population. Four polymorphisms were studied in 112 eycoma patients and 103 controls, including a 24-bp insertion in chitriosase gene resulting in impaired activity and single nucleotide polymorphisms in AMCase. DNA was isolated and genotypes determined using PCR-RFLP. Histological staining proved chitin presence in fungal grain. The polymorphism in chitriosase was associated with increased odds of eycoma, odds ratio 2.9, p=0.004. No association was found for polymorphisms in AMCase. Decreased chitase activity was associated with increased risk M. myomatis mycoma. Chitin is present in M mycatis and human immune system produces AM and chitase in vicinity of grain. Polymorphisms in chitase resulting in decreased activity were more frequent in myoma patients. Environmental and patient factors influence myoma risk, including concurrent schistosomiasis and genetic polymorphisms in hormone and immune system. Role of chases in eycoma caused M myatis was not previously investigated. Decreased chit activity associated with increased risk myoma.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has a well-defined acute and latent phase, but recent evidence suggests lytic genes can be transcribed during latency. Using a sensitive Cre-reporter model, researchers found lytic and latent phases are less defined, with half of HSV spreading to latently infected sites beyond initial infection and lytic promoters driving protein expression during latency. The study provides direct evidence that HSV-1 lytic promoters generate protein during establishment and latency, linking CD8 T cell activation in infected dorsal root ganglia with viral expression. This supports either stochastic lytic gene expression as part of latency or early protein presentation to CD8 cells allowing reactivation to be halted by immune mechanisms. Examination of a virus with Cre driven by the ICP47 promoter showed lytic gene expression after the first week of infection, but no marking during latency, matching ICP promoter results. Contrary to previous Cre-reporter studies, this research reveals lytic expression during latency, aligning with immunological studies. The findings redefine HSV-1 latency, where viral DNA persists without infectious virus, and challenge historical views of restricted transcription to latency-associated transcripts.
Misfolding and aggregation of host proteins are key features of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, frontotemporal dementia, and prion diseases, where misfolded proteins increase through seeded polymerization. In prion diseases, host prion protein misfolds into a pathogenic-resistant form, PrPSc, accumulating in neurons, astroglia, and microglia in the CNS. Using dual-staining immunohistochemistry, researchers compared PrSc accumulation in three mouse scrapie strains with different regional pathology, finding strain-specific patterns. Strain 22 associated mainly with astroglia, ME7 with neurons and neuropil, and RML similar to 22 in thalamus and cortex but ME in substantia nigra. Despite cellular differences, neuroinflammatory gene expression profiles were similar across strains, correlating with early disease tempo and activation of astroglia and microglia prior to clinical signs. Upregulated genes differed from those in viral CNS diseases with similar gliosis. Prion diseases are characterized by vacuoles, gliosis, and PrSc deposition, and understanding strain-specific PrSc deposition and neuroinflammation can inform therapeutic strategies against polymerization. The study found PrSc localization varied with astroglia and neurons, but neuroinflammatory responses were similar, suggesting astrocyte resistance to damage or undetected neuronal PrSc.
Researchers have developed a strategy to create efficient coarse-grained models for self-avoiding polymers on a lattice, accounting for polymer entanglement length and volumic density, to investigate the multi-spatial and temporal scales of chromosomes. This approach captures steady-state and dynamical properties, tracks dynamics at different coarse-graining levels, and offers a power-law gain in numerical efficiency. Applying this strategy to a 20 Mbp region of chromosome 3 in Drosophila during a 20-hour cell cycle, they combined coarse-graining with a one-parameter copolymer model integrating epigen-driven interactions, reproducing experimental data and predicting dynamic chromatin motion. Introducing rigidity to the coarse-grained model and controlling volume fraction achieves high numerical efficiency while maintaining quantitative approximation. The model simulates chromosome dynamics during a cell cycle within a day on a desktop computer. This approach is generic and applicable to self-avoiding polymers and off-lattice systems, emphasizing the importance of accounting for topological constraints to avoid misinterpretation. The study demonstrates the role of epigen-driven interactions in folding and dynamics of Drosila genome, highlighting the necessity of accounting for time evolution in quantitative chromosome models, especially in eukaryotes with strongly constrained chromosomes.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms underlying cell specificity of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) by integrating eQTL data with cis-regulatory element data from the ENCODE project. They identified eQs from eleven studies on seven cell types and built a set of classifiers to predict the cell specificity of eTL. The results show that cell specificity of eTL is associated with eQ SNP overlap with hundreds of cell-specific classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and classes of DNA binding proteins. Using a random forest classifier with cell-specific CRE-SNP overlap features, the study demonstrates the feasibility of predicting the cell specificity of eTL. The study also shows that cis-regulatory elements from trait-associated cell types can be used to annotate genome-wide association study associations in the absence of eQ data for that cell type. The findings suggest that eQ SNPs overlapping cell-specific CREs are enriched for cell-specific eTLs, indicating regulatory mechanisms for cell-specific eTL associations. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms generating cell specificity of eTL and the mode of regulation of corresponding eTL, improving the understanding of the mechanistic basis of human phenotypic variation.
Researchers have developed a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line with limited glycosylation to mannose-5 (Man5) or earlier intermediates using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, which inactivates the Mannosyl (Alpha-1,3)-Glycoprotein Beta1,2-N-Acetylglucosamintransferase (MG1) gene. This cell line produces monomeric gp120 that exhibits improved binding to glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) directed to the V1/V2 and V3 domains while preserving glycan-independent epitopes. The MG1-CHO line limits glycosylation without impairing doubling time or growth at high densities, making it suitable for biopharmaceutical production of HIV-1 vaccine immunogens. The discovery of multiple bNAbs recognizing glycan-dependent epitopes has shifted focus towards producing vaccines with specific glycosylation patterns. Standard CHO cell lines incorporate complex glycosylation, whereas the MG1-CHO line may be useful for producing gp120 immunogens with high-mannose forms. The N-linked glycosylation structure is critical in HIV vaccine design and manufacture, with previous vaccines failing to elicit bNA to glycan-dependent epitopes due to differences in glycosylation. The MG1-CHO line may address this limitation, enabling production of glycan-optimized gp120 vaccines for HIV immunization.
Parasitic nematodes cause devastating illnesses in tropical areas, with lymphatic filariasis being a major cause of permanent disability. Trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase from Brugia malayi is a target for therapeutic discovery as it is essential for nematode survival and has no mammalian counterpart. The X-ray crystal structure of T6 from B. malayi reveals a stabilizing N-terminal MIT-like domain and catalytic C2-type HAD phosphase fold. Structure-guided mutagenesis and kinetic analysis identified key residues for binding and catalysis, providing a basis for a model of the T6-trehalose 6-phosphate complex. The model shows a substrate-binding mode driven by shape complementarity and van der Waals interactions, differing from homolog sucrose-6-phosphatase. Results suggest high-affinity inhibitors will be bi-dentate, utilizing substrate-like binding to the phosphoryl pocket and non-native binding to the trehal pocket. Conservation of key residues in T6 enzymes indicates development of broad-range anthelmint and antibacterial therapeutics may be possible. The trehal binding site is dominated by hydrophobic residues and conservation of key residues among T6 phosphatases from parasitic nemodes and pathogenic bacteria suggests a common strategy for T6 inhibitor design for antibiotics and anthelmintics. The structure provides a platform for inhibitor design, with a model of T6 with trehal 6-phosphate bound in the active site constructed to guide development of small molecule anthintics.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to model fluid transport through heterogeneous tumors, incorporating realistic vascular architectures and spatially heterogeneous parameters. The model couples Poiseuille and Darcy descriptions of vascular and interstitial flow, generating accurate predictions of tumor fluid dynamics. Application to orthotopic murine glioma and human colorectal carcinoma showed that incorporating realistic vasculature is key to modeling contrasting fluid response between tumor samples. Reducing tumor interstitial pressure is not essential to increase interstitial perfusion, instead, therapies should develop an interstitial pressure gradient. Normalizing the interstitial microenvironment may provide a more effective means to increase interstitial perfusion within tumors. The framework allows highly-controlled experiments, providing insight into how tumor vascular heterogeneity contributes to fluid transport, and can be applied to large vascular networks, enabling predictions of whole-tumor dynamics. Results suggest vascular normalization alters interstitial conductivity and that stabilizing vessel diameters and permeabilities are key responses following therapy. The model enables quantification of heterogeneities in a computationally efficient manner, permitting predictions of fluid and mass transport to surrounding tissue, and can be applied to any vascular tissue, making it a valuable tool for optimizing anti-cancer therapies.
Researchers investigated the role of cell-to-cell transmission in HIV infection and its vulnerability to neutralizing antibodies and entry inhibitors, finding that the effectiveness of these agents varies depending on their mode of action. While gp41-directed agents remain active, CD4 binding site-directed inhibitors, including the potent neutralizing antibody VRC01, lose potency during cell-to-cell transmission. This suggests CD4-directed antibodies primarily block free virus transmission, allowing HIV to spread through cell contacts, explaining how the virus maintains infectivity and escapes potent CD4-directed antibody responses in vivo. Neutralizing antibodies recognize epitopes on envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, accessible in the oligomeric form of the HIV envelope. The study aimed to dissect the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies and inhibitors in cell-to-cell transmission, crucial for HIV vaccine and entry inhibitor design, as it remains uncertain whether both transmission modes must be blocked equally or only the dominant mode targeted. The findings provide evidence that neutralizing antibodies differ in capacity to block free and cell transmission, implying the need to consider cell-to-cell transmission when evaluating entry inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies.
A model of attention has been proposed to explain the diverse effects of attention on neural firing rates and receptive field structure in the visual system. The model suggests that top-down modulation of higher visual areas, such as V4 or MT, rather than input areas like V1, produces the observed effects on neural responses through modulatory feedback connections between areas and short-range inhibition within each area. Feedback redistributes the top modulation to lower areas, altering inputs of higher cells and producing firing rate modulations and receptive shifts. Short-range inhibition between neighboring cells produces competitive effects scaled to receptive field size. The model reproduces attentional effects on response rates, including gain and biased competition, and receptive structure shifts and resizing in spatial and feature space without modifying parameters. The model predicts attention effects on response curves shift from response gain to contrast as spatial focus drifts away from the cell. The source of modulation is a plain response of the top layer, contrasting existing models that posit attention operates through gain of inputs. The model explains effects of attention through a simple mechanism, requiring modulatory connections and short inhibition, producing observed effects on neural responses and receptive fields.
Researchers investigated the role of the posterior signalling centre in controlling hemocyte homeostasis in the Drosophila larval hematopoietic organ, the lymph gland, and found it maintains janus tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription signalling in hematopoietic progenitors. A type I cytokine-related receptor, CG142/Latran, is required to switch off JAK signalling in prohemocytes for lamelcyte differentiation upon parasitisation. Lat forms heteromers with Domeless, a Drosila type I cytokine receptor, and antagonises its activity in a dose-dependent manner. The primary immune response to parasitism involves a decrease in cytokine mRNA levels in the lymph, followed by an increase in the lat/dome ratio, leading to inhibition of JAK signalling. The function of Drosila Lat is the first in vivo example of a nonsignalling receptor controlling a dedicated immune response, raising questions about its role in vertebrate immunity. JAK signalling has been associated with human diseases, including leukaemia, and plays a central role in hematopoiesis and immune regulation in mice. Drosila larval hemocyte homeostasis is dependent on interactions between hematietic progenitors and their microenvironment, similar to vertebrate hematietic niche. Tight regulation of JAK signalling by lat is crucial for Dophila to mount a cellular defense, involving differential and tissue-specific expression of signalling and antagonist receptors, allowing prohemocytes to differentiate into lamelcytes upon parasitisation.
Genetic recombination is a crucial process in the evolution of many virus species, particularly amongst begomoviruses in the Geminiviridae family. Researchers investigated recombination patterns during co-infections of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus and Tomato leaf curl virus in tomato plants over 120 days. Results showed complex sequence exchanges between viruses, with local sequence similarity influencing recombination breakpoints, not genomic structure. Selection against recombinants with disrupted intra-genomic interactions, such as protein-nucleic acid and protein-protein interactions, influenced overall recombination patterns. Preservation of co-evolved long-range protein-protein and DNA interactions was favored, allowing identification of sequence tracts involved in these interactions. Recombinants with up to 58 detectable breakpoints were observed, with 121 polymorphic nucleotide sites differentiating the two viruses. Natural selection profoundly influenced the survival of recombinants, determining the overall recombination patterns that emerged. The study highlights the complexity of recombination in begomoviruses and the importance of intra-genomic interactions in shaping recombination outcomes, providing insights into the evolution of these viruses and potential emergence of new pathogens. The findings have implications for understanding the role of recombination in begomovirus evolution and disease.
Researchers investigated the relationship between nucleosome binding and sequence evolution in eukaryotes and archaea, comparing substitution patterns around nucleosome footprints in humans to those in the archaeon Haloferax volcanii. Despite fundamental differences between eukaryotic and archaeal nucleosomes, including assembly into octamers versus tetramers and presence of N- and C-terminal tails, the association between nucleosome footprints and sequence is conserved between humans and Haloferax volcanii. Neither mutation nor selection can explain the observed association between nucleosomes and sequence, instead, nucleosome-associated substitution patterns are consistent with a model where sequence divergence results in frequent repositioning of nucleosomes during evolution. Nucleosome reposition is necessary and sufficient to explain the association between current nucleosome positions and biased patterns, highlighting the importance of considering the direction of causality between genetic and epigenetic change. Archaeal histones share a preference for GC-rich sequences with eukotic histones and show similar repositioning behavior when sequence context changes. Archaeal nucleosomes are smaller, wrapping less DNA and have shorter linkers, but form multimer complexes that preferentially assemble onto bendable DNA templates with higher GC content. Patterns break down in sister lineages, consistent with widespread reposition of nucleosomes in response to substitutions rather than mutation or purifying selection acting on static nucleosomes.
Researchers have developed a novel procedure to identify key positions in proteins that sustain conformational diversity associated with ligand binding, applying it to a dataset of 188 paired protein structures in bound and unbound forms. Normal modes involved in conformation change are selected based on overlap with structural distortions introduced by ligand binding, and the subspace defined by these modes analyzes the effect of simulated mutations on conformation diversity. A negative correlation is found between mutation effects on these modes and evolutionary conservations from sequence alignments, with key positions altering these subspaces defined as dynamically important residues mediating ligand-binding conformation change. These positions are mostly conserved, buried aliphatic residues in structural regions like β-sheets and α-helix. The method identifies positions whose mutations significantly affect vibrational modes in ligand-free to ligand-bound conformation changes, crucial for evolutionary conservation of conformation diversity required for ligand binding. Conformation diversity of native state plays a central role in modulating protein function, with coexistence of conformers in dynamical equilibrium the basis for conformation selection for ligand binding. Internal motions guarantee interconversion between conformers, and due to relevance to function, conformation diversity should be evolutionary conserved.
Researchers investigated the role of fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by engineering a strain with regulated FBA levels. Depletion of FBA resulted in clearance of Mtb in both acute and chronic phases of infection in vivo and loss of viability in vitro when cultured on single carbon sources. However, this essentiality could be overcome when cultured on mixtures of glycolytic and gluconeogenic carbon sources, enabling generation of an FBA knockout. In vitro studies revealed that lack of FBA could only be compensated by a balance of glucose and butyrate, where growth and metabolism of butyrate were determined by Mtb's ability to catabolize glucose. FBA is central to glycolysis and gluconeogenesis and has been a focus of structural, enzymatic, and drug studies. Mtb's ability to adapt to environments may be attributed to its metabolic flexibility and capacity to efficiently catabize multiple carbon sources simultaneously. The essentiality of FBA was condition-dependent and could be overcome by availability of two carbon sources entering metabolism above and below the FBA-catalyzed step, dependent on the ratio of glycolytic and gluogenic sources. These findings enhance understanding of Mtb carbon metabolism and are relevant to tuberculosis development, indicating FBA as a potential target in replicating and persistent Mtb.
Researchers investigated the role of mitochondrial 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (mTXx) in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that lacks catalase and selenium-glutathione peroxidases, and found that mTX null mutants were unable to thrive in a murine model of infection. However, the avirulent phenotype was not due to lack of peroxidase activity, as mTX behaved like controls when exposed to oxidants. A perase-inactive version of the protein was competent in rescuing the non-infective phenotype, suggesting a novel function for mTX as a molecular chaperone. mTX was able to suppress thermal aggregation of citrate synthase in vitro and m null mutants were sensitive to temperature shift from 25°C to 37°C. The findings indicate the essential role of mTX in Leishmania pathogenicity is independent of peroxid activity, providing evidence that 2-Cys peroxins can be determinant for pathogenic without peroxid activity. mTX undergoes overoxid when promastotes are exposed to 37°C and lacks sulfiredins to regenerate overoxidized 2-Cys. Infection experiments using mutant mice with impaired pro-oxid capacity supported that mTX is not implicated in Leish protection against host-derived oxidants, establishing mTX as a factor for Leishmania pathogenic.
A multicenter prospective diagnostic study evaluated the accuracy of Histoplasma urine antigen (ALPHA-Histopma EIA) for disseminated histoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients. The study included 288 patients with suspected progressive disseminated histoplasmosis and found 29.5% had confirmed disease. The sensitivity of ALPHA-HAg was 67.1% and specificity was 97.5%. The positive likelihood ratio was 27.2. Co-existing opportunistic infections were diagnosed in 10.5% of confirmed cases, mostly disseminated Mycobacterium complex infection. Results showed high specificity but low sensitivity for ALPHA-HAg. The test may be useful for early antifungal treatment but culture-based approach is necessary due to frequent co-infections and negative results do not rule out disease. Previous studies reported varying sensitivity and specificity for ALPHA-HAg, including 100% and 92.9% in Brazil and 22.7 and 30% in another report. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a urinary assay with 84% sensitivity and 94% specificity. Multicenter comparisons against fungal cultures and histopathology are lacking. On-site HAg tests are preferred outside the US due to logistics and turn-around time. Histlasmosis is underreported in Latin America due to lack of reliable diagnosis methods. Non-culture techniques provide faster results but should not replace culture-based approaches in HIV population.
Diarrhea affects millions of children worldwide, causing approximately 1.8 million deaths annually, with the etiologic agent remaining unidentified in up to 40% of cases. Metagenomic sequencing has enabled systematic characterization of microbial populations, allowing for the detection of viruses, including novel ones, in stool during acute diarrhea episodes. This study employed a "microass sequencing" strategy, requiring minimal sample quantity and purification, to characterize eukaryotic viral communities in 12 pediatric diarrhea specimens. Known enteric viruses and multiple putatively novel viruses with limited sequence similarity to GenBank were detected. Mass sequencing offers an opportunity to explore viral diversity in a systematic and unbiased manner, laying the foundation for assessing the role of novel viruses in human diarrhea. The study demonstrates that microass sequencing can define viral diversity in fecal samples, detecting known and novel viruses with limited sequencing. Previous metagenomic studies of human stool have been limited to healthy patients, with no investigation of viral diversity in diarrhea reported. This study presents data from 12 patients with acute diarrhea using microass sequencing of several hundred reads per sample, analyzing as little as 30 mg of fecal matter.
A study compared Zika and dengue outbreaks in the Dominican Republic using national surveillance data. The appearance of Zika cases followed a large deng epidemic, providing an opportunity to study transmission drivers behind the two flaviviruses. Results showed 75% of deng cases occurred in those under 20 years, while Zika infections were dispersed among the population. Deng attack rates were higher among males at 25.9 per 10,000 population vs 21.5 per 10,000 for females. Zika infections were clustered among females at 73.8% with age-adjusted attack rates of 7.64 per 10,000 vs 2.72 per 10,000 for males. Reproductive number calculations showed a higher metric among females at 1.84 vs 1.72 for males. Guillain-Barre syndrome rates were slightly higher in males at 0.62 vs 0.57 per 10,000 for females. Existing deng immunity had little impact on Zika attack rates. Sex-specific reporting may alter epidemiological metrics. Community awareness and health-seeking behavior influenced increased reporting among women of reproductive age. Media campaigns and screening are recommended for women during Zika outbreaks. Future research should focus on clinical outcomes among deng seropositive individuals.
Researchers have found that in Arabidopsis, PAR2, rather than PAR1, is the predominant poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in DNA damage and immune responses. PAR2 makes the greatest contribution to PAR activity and organismal viability in response to genotoxic stresses caused by bleomycin, mitomycin, or gamma-radiation. In contrast to animals, where PAR1 accounts for over 90% of cellular PAR activity in response to DNA damage, Arabidopsis PAR2 plays a major role in plant damage and immune responses. PAR2 carries DNA binding motifs rather than zinc finger domains common in plant and animal PAR1 proteins. PAR2 also contributes to restriction of pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato growth and reduction of infection-associated DNA double-strand breaks. PARG1, rather than PARG2, is the primary enzyme that counteracts poly(AD-ribose)ation in Arabidopsis. PAR1 and PAR2 interact with each other and with PARG and PARG, suggesting direct interactions among mediators of the balance of poly(AD-ribosylation). Knockout of PAR2 severely depletes detectable PAR activity in Arabidopsis with only marginal elevation of poly(AD-ribosyl)ated proteins detected after bleomycin treatment. Overall, Arabidopsis PAR2 and PARG play predominant roles in poly(AD-ribosylation) during DNA damage and immune responses.
Researchers have identified a new MAP kinase pathway, consisting of MIG-15, NSY-1, JKK-1, and JNK-1, that suppresses synapse formation but not axon termination in mechanosensory neurons of RPM-1 mutants in C. elegans. Transgenic overexpression of these kinases impairs synapse formation in wild-type animals and functions autonomously in mechanosory neurons, localizing to presynaptic terminals, indicating a role in synapse development. Loss of MIG/JNK signaling suppresses defects in habituation to repeated stimuli in RPM-1 mutants, suggesting impaired glutamatergic synapse formation. The MIG/JNK pathway opposes RPM-1 signaling in synapse formation and learning, restricting glutamatergic synapse and short-term learning. MIG-15 is orthologous to mammalian NIK and fly Msn, acting as MAPKs in cells and embryogenesis, and regulates cell migration and axon guidance in C. elegans. Loss of MIG function suppresses synapse defects in RPM-1 mutants similar to NSY-1, JKK1, and JNK1. The MIG/JNK pathway has a specific suppressor phenotype, suppressing synapse defects but not axon termination, and functions cell autonomously in mechanosensory neurons, with transgenic overexpression causing synapse defects. These findings indicate the MIG/JNK pathway as a parallel pathway to RPM-1 in regulating synapse formation and learning.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary changes in a bipotential switch that shapes the sperm/oocyte decision in hermaphroditic nematodes, focusing on the sex-determination protein TR-1. They identified a co-factor, TRR-1, required for spermatogenesis, which works as part of the Tip60 Histone Acetyl Transfer complex and promotes the expression of C-fog-3, a gene necessary for spermatogenesis. Epistasis tests revealed TR-1 works through TRA-1 to activate C-fog-3 and control the sperm/oocyte decision, confirming TRA1 is bipotential. TR1 also regulates male tail development, with Cbr-tra-2 and C-trr-1 double mutants resembling C-tra-1 null mutants. The study found differences in the relationship between the two branches of the switch have arisen during evolution, with C. brigae TR-1 null mutants preventing hermaphrodite spermatogenesis but not C-fem mutants, while C. elegans null mutants prevent spermatogenesis but Cel-tr1 mutants. Synthetic interactions confirmed both halves of the switch exist in each species, indicating the relationship between the two halves can shift during evolution, producing the same phenotype by alternative mechanisms. The Tip60 complex promotes spermatogenesis only if TRA1 is functional, and TR1 acts directly on the fog3 promoter in C. elegans, with conserved binding sites in C. brigae. TR1 is bipotential, activating genes for spermatogenesis and repressing male genes, with full-length TR1 promoting expression of genes that activate spermatogenesis.
A recent measure of integrated information, Φ, quantifies the extent to which a system generates more information than the sum of its parts as it transitions between states, possibly reflecting levels of consciousness generated by neural systems. However, Φ is defined for discrete Markov systems, which are unusual in biology. Two new measures, ΦE and Φ, overcome limitations and are easy to apply to time-series data. Simulations demonstrate the applicability and explore properties, providing opportunities for examining integration in real and model systems, with implications for relations between integrated information, consciousness, and neurocognitive processes. Findings pose challenges for theories ascribing physical meaning to measured quantities. Future work will examine integrated information for time-series from neuroimaging and biological datasets to test intuitions regarding consciousness and neurocognitive processes, investigate how integrated information is modulated, and determine theoretically. Integrated information has received attention in the domain of consciousness science, permitting framing testable hypotheses and specification of synthetic models examining the role in neurocognitive processes. The integrated information theory of consciousness ascribes physical meaning to measures, characterizing consciousness in terms of capacity, not process, with implications for low integrated information corresponding to low conscious levels.
Bayesian geostatistical analysis was used to investigate the spatial distribution of Rhodesian human African trypanosomiasis in Uganda, accounting for spatial autocorrelation and uncertainty in data and model parameters. The study extended previous research that used logistic regression to explore the relationship between disease prevalence and environmental and climatic variables in two affected districts, suggesting the disease spread was due to movement of infected livestock. The results supported the theory that Rhodesian human trypanosomiasis was imported via infected livestock from endemic areas and confirmed the confounding effect of health care accessibility and link between disease distribution and minimum surface temperature. Predictive mapping indicated increased risk of high prevalence in areas surrounding livestock markets, highlighting the importance of livestock trading in disease spread. Adherence to government policy to treat livestock at point of sale is essential to prevent spread. The research demonstrated the utility of Bayesian geostatistical modelling for predicting disease prevalence based on external covariates, providing robust evidence for the role of livestock in disease spread. Spatial variation in disease prevalence was modelled using a generalised linear model and Bayesian inference, allowing accurate parameter estimates and significance. The study confirmed the importance of spatial autocorrelation in epidemiological variables and limitations of non-spatial logistic analysis.
The concept of equilibrium in ecosystems, where species coexist with positive abundances, is a key assumption in complexity-stability debates, but its feasibility has not been tested. Analytical results and simulations show that equilibrium vanishes in species-rich systems, leaving the existence of a feasible equilibrium uncertain. Changing interaction structure and intensity reveals that feasibility and stability are warranted with weak interactions, regardless of species richness. Dynamical behavior in ecologically-inspired architectures differs from unstructured systems. The interplay between interaction strength and network architecture is crucial for understanding ecosystem dynamics. May's paradox led to exploration of topological structure's effects on dynamics, with certain architectures stabilizing ecological networks, but feasibility of different architectures for interaction regimes remains unexplored. Results indicate focusing on interplay between ecological structure, interaction strengths, and distribution yields sensible information on natural systems' dynamics. Species-rich communities require moderate interactions to ensure equilibrium stability. Network architecture plays a non-trivial role in equilibrium, contrary to previous suggestions that topology has a minor role. The probability of observing a feasible equilibrium decreases exponentially with network size, but weak interactions yield non-trivial equilibria in ecologically-inspired systems.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in Western Kenya to assess the sero-epidemiology of Coxiella burnetii in humans and cattle. Serum samples from 204 humans and 955 cattle in 416 homesteads were analyzed for C. burnii antibodies. The overall sero-prevalence of C. burnii was 2.5% in humans and 10.5% in cattle, with no correlation between cattle and human seropreval within households or spatial proximity. Multilevel modeling showed cattle obtained from markets and those in low precipitation areas had higher seropreval. For humans, the youngest age group had highest odds of seropitivity, with variations between ethnic groups and frequent livestock contact being risk factors. Results indicate endemicity of C. burnii in western Kenya, with low prevalence. Environmental factors influence cattle exposure, while human exposure is driven by livestock contact. Livestock markets may be a target for interventions. The study aimed to assess seropval of C. burnii in linked human and cattle populations and determine socio-economic, behavioral, and environmental factors correlated exposure. C. burnii is common in human and livestock in Kenya, with gaps in understanding and lack of recent data addressed by this study.
Researchers have identified 33 putative DEAD-box RNA helicases in the Schistosoma mansoni genome, including three vasa-like genes, Smv1, Smv2, and Smv3, which are members of the Vasa/PL10 DEAD-box subfamily. These genes exhibit conserved motifs characteristic of the helicase family and show high identity to Vasa proteins from other flukes. Transcripts encoding Smv1, Smv2, and Smv3 are present in developmental stages of S. mansoni, with elevated expression in sporocysts, adult females, eggs, and miracidia, and strikingly high in undeveloped eggs. Whole mount in situ hybridization analysis revealed Smv1, Sm2 and Sm3 are transcribed in the posterior ovary where oocytes mature. The germ cell-specific expression of schistosome vasa genes provides a landmark for germ line transgenesis of schistosomes, etiologic agents of major tropical diseases. DEAD-box helicases have been identified as essential for schistosome survival, making vasa-like gene products potential targets for intervention. The availability of draft genome sequences for major schistosome species underscores the need for functional approaches to identify the role and importance of schosome genes for novel anti-schistosomal interventions. The schist vasa-like genes may be valuable markers for functional genomics and introduction of transgenes into the schist germ line.
Heart valve disease is a significant clinical problem worldwide, and cardiac valve development and homeostasis require precise control. The Hippo signaling pathway is essential for organ and tissue development, but its role in valve formation and maintenance was unknown. VGL4, a transcription cofactor in vertebrates, is mainly expressed in valve interstitial cells at the post-EM stage and maintained until adulthood. Tissue-specific knockout of V4 in different lineages revealed loss of V4 in endothelial lineage led to valve malformation with expanded YAP targets. Semi-knockout of YAP in V4 ablated hearts constrained hyperproliferation of arterial interstitial cells. V4 is crucial for valve development, and manipulating Hippo components could be a potential therapy for congenital valve disease. Loss of V4 in endothelial cells resulted in abnormal valves and cardiac hypertrophy, while semi-knock of Y rescued malformation. The study shows V4 and regulated Hippo signaling are required for heart remodeling and maturation. Hippo in VEC is necessary for post-EM semunar morphogenesis and homeostasis, regulating endocard derived mesenchal cell proliferation and valve elongation. Mutations in V4 may underlie human congenital heart dysplasia. V4 regulates valve remodeling by antagonizing YAP activity through interaction with TEAD transcription factor, balancing cell proliferation and apoptosis during development and homeostasis.
Recent studies have argued that soft selective sweeps, a model of positive selection acting on standing genetic variation and multiple mutations, are pervasive across organisms with different population sizes and mutation rates, including humans, Drosophila, and HIV. However, others have questioned the relevance of these models to natural populations and their identifiability from other processes, suggesting soft sweeps are likely rare. This study evaluates three recent studies and their methodologies, using population theory and simulation, and finds they are prone to high false-positive rates, incorrectly identifying soft sweeps under hard and neutral models. Demographic histories combined with rare sweeps provide a more parsimonious explanation. The lack of sufficient testing and statistical analysis has led to inaccurate views of evolutionary processes, and generalization has resulted in misleading answers to old questions in population genetics, suggesting a dominant role for positive selection in shaping patterns of variation. Soft sweeps rely on high mutation rates, large population size, and distribution of fitness effects, but hard sweeps of weakly beneficial mutations and demographic models can be misclassified as soft. Given non-equilibrium history and rare beneficial mutations, pervasive soft sweeps are unlikely in humans, Drosila, and viruses.
Female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the primary vectors of dengue fever, causing 50-100 million infections per year, transmitted between humans and mosquitoes through blood feeding. Aedes aegypti host-seeking behavior is inhibited for three days following a blood meal by a hemolymph-borne humoral factor, with Headpeptide being a candidate for mediating this suppression. Researchers identified eight Neuropeptide Y-like receptors (NLRs) in the Aedes aegypti genome and screened each in a cell-based calcium assay for sensitivity against a panel of peptides. Four Aedes aegypt NLRs responded to one or more ligands, but NPYL1 responded to Headpeptide as well as short neuropeptide-F peptides (sNPs). NPY1 homologs in the Lyme vector Ixodes scaparis were also sensitive to Headpeptide. Injection of synthetic Headpeptide and sPF3 inhibited host-seeking in non-blood female mosquitoes, whereas controls had no effect. Zinc finger nucleases generated npy1 null mutant strains displayed normal behavior, indicating npy1 is not required for host inhibition. The study deorphanized four Aedes NLRs and identified NPY1 as a candidate sPF receptor sensitive to Headpe, concluding other receptors or peptides regulate this behavior.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease influenced by environmental factors such as rivers, elevation, slope, land temperature, land use, and rainfall. This study used satellite-derived data and spatial analysis to identify areas suitable for schistosomias transmission in Akure North Local Government Area, Ondo State, Nigeria. Multicriteria evaluation and Saaty's analytical hierarchy process were applied to determine the weight of individual risk factors, including temperature, drainage, elevation, rainfall, slope, and land use. Weighted overlay analysis identified areas vulnerable to schosomias, with 82% of the area falling under high and very high risk categories. Field observations confirmed the model's predictions, with high-risk zones corresponding to known endemic communities. The study found significant differences in schosomias prevalence between communities, with Oba Ile having the lowest risk and increased risk in Iju, Igoba, Ita Ogb, and Ogb. The results showed environmental factors can be used to identify and predict schosomias transmission and monitor disease risk in rural communities. The spatial model used produced schosias risk zones from factors including temperature, rainfall, elevation, land use, and slope. Satellite-derived data can determine schos risk levels using relevant techniques, supporting prevention, surveillance, and control by prioritizing areas of risk and providing early warnings for potential transmission.
Streptococcus pneumoniae meningitis is a common bacterial infection of the brain, with a survival rate of 75%, but half of the patients suffer from long-term disabilities. The cholesterol-dependent cytolysin pneumolysin is a key factor determining the neuropathogenic potential of pneumococci. Research demonstrates selective synaptic loss within the superficial layers of the frontal neocortex in post-mortem brain samples from individuals with pneumoccal meningitis, also observed in mice with pneumoccal meningitis when bacteria expressed pore-forming pneumolysin. Exposure to pneumolys at non-lytic concentrations caused dendritic swelling, spine elimination, and synaptic loss, reduced by NMDA glutamate antagonists MK801 and D-AP. Pneumys increased glutamate levels in brain slices and initiated glutamate release from astrocytes in a calcium-dependent manner. Pneumys plays a significant synapto and dendritotoxic role in pneumoccal meningitis by initiating glutamate release from astrotes, leading to subsequent glutamate-dependent synaptic damage. Synaptic pathology in pneumoccal meningitis is associated with bacterial cytolin dysregulation of glutamate control, inducing excitotoxic damage. Long-term cognitive decline in pneumoccal meningitis survivors implies synaptic damage as a reason for cognitive abnormalities, supported by permanent loss and alteration of dendritic spines correlating with decreased synaptic numbers and cognitive impairment in neurological disorders.
Human papillomaviruses are DNA viruses associated with major human cancers, and understanding their infectious cycle is crucial for developing prevention methods such as vaccines and microbicides. The HPV life cycle is linked to the differentiation state of the stratified epithelium it infects, with progeny virus produced in the terminally differentiating suprabasal compartment. Research has shown that HPV establishes infection within the basal layer of stratified epithelium, but the reason for this restriction was unclear. Using chemical approaches, it was found that cell cycle progression through mitosis is critical for HPV infection, with recipient cells needing to enter M phase for infection to occur. Inhibitors of late phase had no effect, while G1, S, G2, and early phase inhibitors prevented infection, indicating host cells must pass through early prophase for successful transcription of HPV genes. This explains why HPVs establish infections in the basal compartment of stratified epithelia, which contains cells progressing through the cell cycle. The findings have implications for HPV control, suggesting cell cycle dependence as a condition for susceptibility to infection. HPV genes are expressed throughout the life cycle, while late capsid genes are expressed in terminally differentiated cells. Cell cycling is critical for establishing infection, with movement through mitosis a necessary step, confirmed by testing with wild type HPV16 virions showing one round of cell cycle through M phase is sufficient for early gene expression.
Penicillium marnefei, a thermal dimorphic fungus causing systemic mycosis in China and Southeast Asia, has been found to express microRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) in both mycelial and yeast phases. Using high-throughput sequencing, 24 potential milRNA candidates were identified, with 17 in mycel and seven in yeast phase. Two genes, dcl-1 and dcl-2, encoding Dicer-like proteins, and qde-2, encoding Argonaute protein, were found in P. marfei, with dcl-2 closely related to homologs in other thermal pathogenic fungi. Northern analysis confirmed expression of two milAs, PM-mil-M1 and PM-mil-M2, only in mycel phase. Deletion mutants showed milAs biogenesis dependent on dcl2, not dcl1 or qde2. mRNA levels of predicted targets of PM-mil-M1 were upregulated in knockdown PM-mil-MKD, supporting regulatory function of milAs. This study provides evidence for differential expression of milAs in growth phases of thermal fungi, shedding light on evolution of proteins in milRNA biogenesis and post-transcriptional control governing thermal dimorphism.
Zika virus emerged in French Polynesia in 2013 and spread throughout the Pacific between 2013-2017, with Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynesi mosquitoes potentially contributing to its transmission. This study analyzed the ability of these vectors to transmit Zika at a regional scale by evaluating their competence for a Zika strain that circulated during the 2013-2017 outbreak. Field-collected Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynensis from the Pacific were exposed to Zika and analyzed for infection, dissemination, and transmission rates. Results showed heterogeneous infection rates between Aedes aegypti populations, but moderate and homogeneous dissemination rates, while Aedes polynensis had less heterogeneous infection rates. Transmission efficiency revealed low vector competence for Zika in both species, indicating low transmission by Aedes aegpti and Aedes polensis from the Pacific. These findings suggest other factors like vector density, lifespan, and immunologically naive population contributed to the rapid spread of Zika during the outbreak. Aedes polynensis had infectious particles in two tested populations, demonstrating potential for transmission, while Aedes aegypt had heterogeneous infection profiles. Significant differences in Zika dissemination were observed between Aedes aegypt from New Caledonia and Aedes polynensis from Wallis and between Aedes aegpt and Aedes polynensis from French Polynesia, but no difference in transmission between species.
Researchers have developed a new approach called Targeted StructureSeq to study the structure of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Xist, a key regulator of X-chromosome inactivation in mammalian cells. This method combines chemical probing of RNA structure in cells with targeted massively parallel sequencing, enriching signals from the RNA of interest to achieve high coverage with relatively few sequencing reads. Using TargetedSeq, the full-length Xist lRNA was probed to develop new models for functional elements, including the repeat element at the 5'-end of Xist. The analysis identified new structural elements in Xist that are evolutionarily conserved, including a new element proximal to the repeats important for Xist function. TargetedSeq provides a scalable approach to analyze RNA conformation in cells and can compare differences between RNA structure in vitro and in cells. The study validated utility of TargetedSeq to study lncRNA conformation in mammalian cells and expect it to be useful for advancing mechanistic understanding of lncAs. The data can be used to develop a conformation model of full-length Xist, providing insight into RNA function, molecular evolution, and modularity. The repeat region of Xist is a functional element for gene repression and TargetSeq identified novel evolution conserved elements potentially functional.
A novel statistical framework has been developed to evaluate the predictive power of genetic variants for complex diseases, connecting various predictive indices such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, mean risk difference between cases and non-cases, and net reclassification improvement. Given disease prevalence and variance in liability explained by genetic variants, it is possible to estimate these metrics and construct graphs to visualize risk model performance, including ROC curves, density of risks, and predictiveness curves. Simulations match theoretical estimates, and the methodology is applied to nine complex diseases to evaluate predictive power of genetic tests based on known susceptibility variants. Genome-wide studies have identified many genetic variants for complex diseases, raising hope for individualized risk prediction, but the effect of single markers is typically modest. Commercial companies offer disease estimates based on genomic profiles, yet clinical usefulness is debated, necessitating measures to evaluate genetic risk models. High statistical significance does not equate to good predictive power, and a comprehensive assessment may be achieved by complementing area under the curve with other indices and graphs, such as net reclassification and risk plots, particularly when meaningful thresholds exist.
A prospective evaluation of a rapid diagnostic test for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection using recombinant antigens was conducted. The study compared the accuracy of a new rapid diagnostic test, SD BIOLINE HAT 2.0, using recombinant antigens, with an existing rapid test, SDOLINE HAT, using native antigens, and the Card Agglutination Test for Trypanosomias, CATT. A total of 57,632 individuals were screened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 260 HAT cases confirmed by parasitology. The results showed that SDOLINE HAT 2.0 had the highest sensitivity at 71.2%, followed by CATT at 62.5% and SDOL HAT at 59%. CATT had the highest specificity at 99.2%, while SDOL H and SDOL H 2.0 had 98.9% and 98.1% respectively. Combining two or three tests increased sensitivity, with SDOL H and SD H2.0 reaching 98.4% in passive and 83% in active screening. The recomant-based RDT was more sensitive and as specific as SDOL H and as sensitive but less specific than CATT. Using two or more tests enhanced diagnostic sensitivity but decreased specificity.
Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of Latin Americans, has been effectively controlled in Guatemala after multiple rounds of indoor residual insecticide spraying. However, areas with persistent Triatoma dimata infestation remain, such as Comapa, Department of Juti, where control appears less effective. Cross-sectional entomological and serological surveys were conducted to evaluate a decade of vector control activities. Baseline surveys in 1999 and 2002 were followed by three rounds of insecticide applications and intermittent spraying until 2012. Household inspections and seropreval surveys in school children and women of child-bearing age showed infestation decreased from 39% to 27 and Chagas seroprevalence declined 10-fold from 10% to 1 in school children. However, seropvalence in women of child-bearing age remains >10. After a decade of control, there is evidence of reduced transmission but continued risk of vector-borne and congenital transmission poses a threat to 202 Chagas elimination goal. Systematic vector control, improved screening, and treatment programs are needed to reach elimination in regions with persistent infestation. Insecticide applications temporarily reduce infestation but recovers as insecticides decay. National program invests in control through education, house improvement, and focalized insecticide applications.
Citrobacter rodium is a natural mouse pathogen that causes attaching and effacing lesions and shares a virulence strategy with human pathogens enteropathogenic E. coli and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli. The genome of C. rodium ICC168 displays characteristics of a newly evolved pathogen with many pseudogenes and IS elements. Investigation of genomic flux in C. rodium reveals the genome is unstable due to repeat-mediated large-scale recombination and active transposition of mobile elements such as prophages. Sequencing an additional strain EX-33 shows ICC168 is representative of the species and most inactivating mutations occurred early in evolution. C rodium isolates were originally classified as atypical mouse-pathogenic E coli or Citrobacter freundii but reclassified as Citrobacter rodium due to clonal origin. The genome sequence of ICC168 has horizontally acquired genetic elements conferring virulence similar to EPEC and EHE. Large-scale rearrangements and gene loss suggest C rodium has recently emerged as a pathogen and is adapting to its lifestyle. The study concludes C rodium is a recently evolved pathogen that emerged alongside inbred mice as a model for human disease.
Researchers have developed a computational framework to analyze stochasticity in gene expression, which gives rise to distributions of protein levels across cell populations. The method infers biochemical rate constants governing chromatin modification, transcription, translation, RNA, and protein degradation from stochastic protein expression without assumptions. Analytical solutions for the first four moments of protein distribution were derived, which capture the shape of protein distributions, and an algorithm was developed to infer gene expression constants from these moments. Results show most protein distributions are consistent with multiple biochemical rate sets, but the solution space of constants informs the underlying mechanism, distinguishing between transcriptional bursting and constitutive production regimes. The method agrees with standard approaches and identifies previously unobtainable rate constants, estimating individual biochemical constants or ratios in 91% of tested cases. The framework will be a tool for deducing molecular mechanisms contributing to specific gene expression patterns. Stochastic transcription and translation produce fluctuations in RNA and protein, manifesting as distributions across cells, which contain information about governing processes, though the extent is unclear. Investigators measure expression by recording gene fluctuations, resulting in a protein distribution reflecting cell-to-cell variation, which can be simulated in silico using stochastic models.
Monkeypox virus is an emerging orthopoxvirus that causes human monkeypox, a tropical disease endemic in the Congo Basin and sporadic in West Africa, with increasing human cases due to interactions with infected animals and cessation of smallpox vaccination. Smallpox vaccination provides cross-protection, but current vaccines have safety concerns and no FDA-approved therapies exist. Researchers investigated a new vaccination approach using recombinant bovine herpesvirus 4 vectors expressing monkeypox glycoproteins A29, M1, and B6 in STAT1 knockout mice. The vectors, Bo-4-CMV-A29g106ΔTK, Bo-4-E1-MRg106ΔTK, and Bo-4-E1-BR106ΔTK, were constructed and demonstrated safe with no adverse events. Bo-4-E1-MR106TK alone or combined with Bo-4-CMV-A29TK and Bo-4-E1-BR106TK protected 100% and 80% of mice against mortality and morbidity. This study demonstrates the efficacy of Bo-4-based vectors as a vaccine platform. Monkeypox has a mortality rate of 10% in the Congo region and increasing human cases due to environmental degradation, lack of vaccination, and increased susceptibility. Vaccines against smallpox have shown protection, but first and second-generation vaccines have morbidity and contraindications, while third-generation vaccines require multiple administrations. The global campaign against smallpox utilized vaccines efficacious against monkeypox, but there is no animal reservoir for variola.
The Apa-like phosphatase TbAL1 is the major mRNA decapping enzyme in trypanosomes, acting downstream of deadenylation and upstream of 5'-3' degradation. Trypanosomes lack homologs to subunits of the decapping complex, but deadenylation and 5'-3' degradation are conserved. AL1 co-localises with 5'-3 exonuclease X to a granule at the posterior pole of the cell, indicating a connection between the enzymes. RNAi depletion of AL1 is lethal, causing accumulation of deadenylated mRNAs that have not started 5'-3 decay. Recombinant N-terminally truncated AL1 protein sensitises capped trypan spliced RNA to yeast Xrn1 if an RNA 5 phosphatase is included. The decapping mechanism of AL1 differs from Dcp2, leaving more than one phosphate group at mRNA's 5' end. AL1 has characteristics of an mRNA decapping enzyme, essential, localises to P-bodies, and its depletion causes accumulation of deadylated mRNA. Exclusive co-localisation with 5'-exonuclease X suggests both enzymes are members of the same pathway. The granule separates decay enzymes AL1 and X from mRNA, regulating the amount of mRNA decay needed by the cell. ApH-like phosphatases are present in all branches of eukaryotic kingdom. The data provide strong in vivo evidence for AL1 being trypan decapping enzyme.
Researchers have discovered that inactivating the Arx gene in pancreatic α-cells triggers their conversion into functional β-like cells, a process known as neogenesis. This conversion occurs at any age and induces the mobilization of duct-lining precursor cells to adopt an endocrine fate, with glucagon+ cells being converted into β-like cells upon Arx inhibition. Analysis of Arx and Pax4 double mutants revealed that Pax4 is dispensable for this process, indicating Arx is the main trigger for α-cell-mediated β cell neogenesis. The loss of Arx in αcells regenerates functional β-cell mass and reverses diabetes following toxin-induced β-cell depletion. Lineage tracing showed glucagon-producing cells, even at advanced ages, can be converted into functional β-like cells solely through Arx inactivation, initiating a cycle of endocrine regeneration where gluc+ cells acquire a β phenotype, leading to islet hypertrophy due to β-cell hyperplasia. Arx inactivation leads to continuous gluc+ cell neoformation and conversion into β-like cells, regenerating functional β-cell mass. The loss of Arx may result in Pax4 reactivation in αcells, suggesting Arx maintains αcell phenotype through repression of Pax expression. Detection of gluc+ cells indicates neogenesis is activated to compensate for converted cells, with gluc shortage contributing to this process. Proliferating cells were observed in Arx mutant pancreata, mostly in duct lining instead of islet, indicating potential for new avenues in diabetes treatment by inhibiting Arx or molecular targets.
Eukaryotic cells have thousands of replication origins that must be inhibited to prevent re-initiation, which can lead to genomic alterations. To minimize re-initiation, cells use regulatory mechanisms that reduce replication protein activity. However, origins re-initiate with diverse efficiencies when these mechanisms are disabled, suggesting an additional layer of control. Novel genetic elements, termed re-initiation promoters (RIPs), are necessary for preferential re-initiation of two origins and confer preferential initiation on heterologous origins when control is partially deregulated. RIPs are 60 bp AT-rich sequences acting in a distance and sequence-dependent manner, not enhancing S phase timing or efficiency, and overcome a block to re-initiation after Mcm2-7 associates with origins. Local control creates a complex genomic landscape of replication potential revealed when global mechanisms are compromised, making some regions more susceptible to alterations. Preventing re-init is critical for preserving genome stability, and eukary cells use overlapping inhibitory mechanisms to reduce probability of re-init. The basic strategy is to prevent reassembly of replication complexes at fired origins by regulating Mc2-7 loading. RIPs provide insight into diversity in eukary replication regulation, and investigation into individual mechanisms must be conducted in sensitized systems where overlapping mechanisms are disrupted.
Invasive amebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica is increasing among men who have sex with men and co-infection with HIV-1 is an emerging in East Asian countries. A retrospective analysis of 170 co-infected cases showed clinical presentation of invasive amebias similar to that in normal hosts, with high fever, leukocytosis, and high CRP associated with extraluminal amebic diseases. Two patients died from amebic colitis and three from unrelated causes. Treatment with metronidazole or tinidazole was successful in 165 cases. Luminal treatment following metronazole or tinazole did not reduce recurrence, which was more frequent in HCV-antibody positive individuals and those who acquired syphilis. Various genotypes of E. histolytica were identified but no correlation with clinical features was found. Outcome of metronazole and tinazole treatment for uncomplicated amebis was excellent even in HIV-1-infected individuals. The results emphasize the difficulty of preventing recurrence without an educational approach to prevent new amic infection after treatment in high-risk groups such as HIV-1-infected men who have sex with men. The spread of E. histolytica in men who have sex with men in other countries should be of concern.
Human African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei gambiense transmitted by tsetse flies. A global program aims to eliminate the disease as a public health problem by 2020 and stop transmission by 203. In South Chad's Mandoul area, a persistent focus of Gambian sleeping sickness, around 100 cases were diagnosed annually until 2013. Pre-2014 control relied on case detection and treatment, leading to a gradual decrease in cases due to annual screening. Adding vector control to detection and treatment was assessed to reduce transmission and incidence. Tiny targets were deployed in riverine habitats, attracting and killing tse, resulting in a 70.4% reduction in reported cases between 2013 and 2015 attributed to vector control. Model predictions anticipate elimination as a public health problem could be achieved by 2018 if control and screening continue. The combination of tse control and medical treatment reduced incidence in 2014 and 201, with 62.8% reduction due to tse control and 8.5% to enhanced detection. The use of tiny targets reduced tse numbers, potentially interrupting transmission. Mass screening and passive surveillance have saved lives, reducing annual incidence from 37,000 in 199 to 3,000 in 2015.
A retrospective study of 124 cases of imported strongyloidiasis in Spain, registered in the +REDI Collaborative Network from 2009 to 2017, found that most patients were immigrants from South America. Detection of larvae in stool samples was observed in 21.9% of patients, while serological tests allowed diagnosis in the rest. Eosinophilia was present in 82.2% of cases. Treatment with ivermectin compared to albendazole was strongly associated with achieving cure, with an odds ratio of 2.34. The study highlights the importance of screening for Strongyloides stercoralis infection in patients from or traveling to endemic areas, especially those with immunosuppressant conditions, due to the risk of severe presentation. Most patients were asymptomatic immigrants from South America, with 82.2% having eosinophilia at diagnosis. Diagnostic strategies included classical parasitological methods, serology, and PCR, with cure rates of 76-98% for ivermectin and 38-78% albendazole. The study emphasizes the need for screening due to the long latency of infection and risk of severe presentation.
Vaccination is an effective method to protect against infectious diseases, and an important consideration in vaccine formulation is the inoculum dose, the amount of antigen or live attenuated pathogen used. Higher levels generally lead to better immune response stimulation but may cause severe side effects and reduce population coverage during shortages. Determining the optimal inoculum dose is crucial for rational vaccine design. A combination of mathematical models and experimental data can help determine the impact of inoculum dose. Researchers used data from influenza A virus infection in mice and human parainfluenza virus infection in rats at different inoculum doses to map dose to immune protection and morbidity. The framework combines models with data to study the impact of inoculum on protection and morbidity, showing that its effect depends on the pathogen and does not necessarily increase monotonically with dose. Once vaccine goals are specified, the framework can help design vaccines and determine optimal inoculum. A quantitative framework was developed for live attenuated vaccines using data from two experiments and applied to an inactivated vaccine scenario. The modeling can be applied to specific vaccine candidates to efficiently determine optimal dose. The study contributes a conceptual framework to rationally design vaccines and determine inoculum for any pathogen, allowing systematic determination of inoculum impact on protection and morbidity, illustrating that more inoculum does not always lead to more protection.
Researchers studied the expression of the HetR gene, a transcription factor essential for heterocyst differentiation, in the cyanobacterium Anabaena under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-poor conditions. Using a chromosomally-encoded translational hetR-gfp fusion, they analyzed fluorescence at the individual cell level in wild-type and mutant filaments, demonstrating that HetR expression fluctuations in nearby cells are coupled with a characteristic range of two to three cells. Correlations between cells arise predominantly from intercellular molecular transfer and less from cell division. Under nitrogen-rich conditions, basal-state expression of the Het inhibitor PatS, cell communication influenced by septal protein SepJ, and Het auto-regulation are determinants of HetR fluctuations and distribution along filaments. A comparison between het-gfp expression under nitrogen-rich and nitrogen-poor conditions highlights differences between Het inhibitors PatS and HetN and septal proteins SepJ and Fra/Fra. Key factors known to act during differentiation following nitrogen deprivation also play a role before differentiation is triggered, setting an underlying pattern of spatial correlations of expression along filaments, which the developmental pattern may later be built. These correlations extend two to three cells, setting the scale for cellular interactions along a filament. The results show proteins involved in activation, inhibition, and cell communication combine with stochasticity in gene expression to control coupled fluctuations, giving rise to a one-dimensional pattern in this organism.
Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) genotype has shifted from genotype III to I in China, as shown by molecular epidemiological surveillance. A serological survey of JEV-non-vaccinated pigs confirmed this shift, with a GI/GIII infection ratio of 1.87, indicating co-circulation of both genotypes with GI being more prevalent. To understand this shift, replication kinetics of seven JEV isolates, including three GI and four GIII strains, were compared in C6/36, chicken fibroblast, and porcine endothelial cells. GI strains replicated more efficiently in avian and porcine cells, particularly in chicken fibroblast cells with 22.9-225.3 fold higher titers than GIII. Young ducklings inoculated with GI showed higher viremia and longer duration than GIII-inoculated ducklings, confirming enhanced GI replication efficiency in birds. There are 36 amino acid differences between GI and GIII, which may contribute to this efficiency. Enhanced GI replication in birds may lead to higher exposure and infection in mosquitoes, increasing transmission efficiency in the bird-mosquito-bird enzic cycle, contributing to JEV genotype shift. The study suggests GI displaced GIII by achieving increased replication in hosts, consistent with previous genetic and epidemiological analysis.
Candida albicans biofilm formation is regulated by an integrated network of transcription factors, including Bcr1, Brg1, Efg, Ndt80, Rob1, and Tec1. A systematic genetic approach was used to analyze the interactions between these factors by generating all possible double heterozygous mutants and quantitatively analyzing their effects on biofilm formation. The network is highly susceptible to genetic perturbation, with six heterozygous mutants showing alterations in biofilm formation. Many double heterozyous mutants are as severely affected as homozygous deletions, indicating a highly interdependent'small-world' network that is efficient but not robust. TEC1 expression is highly sensitive to small perturbations in the function of other transcription factors, while ROB1 expression is dependent on auto-regulation and cooperative interactions with other transcription factors. The heterozygous NDT80 mutant is hyperfilous under biofilm and hypha-inducing conditions in a T1-dependent manner. The genetic analysis has provided insights into the functions of individual transcription factors and the role of the network topology in its function. The network's structure and function contribute to the ability of small perturbations at a number of nodes to be communicated through the network to regulate the expression of functionally important members. The biofilm network shows limited capacity to withstand genetic mutations, with 10 of 15 double heterozyous mutants showing decreased biofilm density relative to single mutants, many with phenotypes as severe as homozygous mutants.
Researchers investigated the role of asparagine synthetase A (AS-A) in Leishmania infantum, exploring its potential as a drug target due to its absence in humans. AS-A is responsible for converting aspartate into asparagine using ammonia or glutamine as a nitrogen source. Leishmania infantum AS-A can utilize both ammonia and glutamine as nitrogen donors, similar to Trypanosoma spp. and L. donovani. Gene replacement studies generated LiAS null mutants in L. infantum, showing no significant growth or infectivity defects under normal conditions, but impaired growth in asparagine-limiting conditions. Results indicate AS-A is not essential for parasite survival, growth, or infectivity in vitro and in vivo, excluding it as a suitable target against L. infant parasites. This contrasts with L. donani where AS-A is essential, suggesting asparagine homeostasis regulation differs among trypanosomatids. The dispensability of AS-A in L. infant and Trypanosoma brucei indicates alternative asparagine sources, potentially through extracellular uptake. Overall, findings suggest AS-A is not a viable target for drug development against Leishmania infant parasites.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between toxocariasis and epilepsy, including 11 case-control studies from 13 countries with 474 subjects. The overall odds ratio was 1.69 (95% CI 1.42-2.01) for the association between epilepsy and Toxara spp seropitivity, indicating a positive association. Meta-regression showed no significant association between covariates and outcome. Five studies used Western blot as a diagnostic test, with a common odds ratio of 1.79 (95 CI 1.24-2.59). The analysis provides epidemiological evidence of a positive association between Toxara seropitivity and epilepsy, mainly supported by population-based studies. The findings suggest health strategies to reduce Toxara spp impact are advised. Further research is needed to understand the physiopathological mechanisms of toxara-associated epileptogenesis. Toxocariasis is one of the most common helminth infections worldwide and is potentially preventable, making an accurate estimate of the association between toxari and epilepsy necessary. Prior studies support the possible role of toxari in epilepsy incidence, but the association remains debated. New studies have updated previous research to gain further insight into the association between human toxari and epilepsy and evaluate methodological improvements in the field.
ATM plays a critical role in cellular responses to double-strand breaks, and a new ATM-mediated DNA damage response pathway has been identified involving microRNA miR-335. Irradiation-induced double-strand breaks activate ATM, leading to downregulation of miR-335, which targets CtIP, a trigger of DNA resection in homologous recombination repair. CREB is responsible for a portion of miR335 expression by binding to the promoter region of miR335, and its binding is reduced after irradiation. Overexpression of miR335 in HeLa cells resulted in reduced CtIP levels, post-irradiation colony survival, and BRCA1 foci formation. Patient-derived lymphoblast cell lines with decreased post-irradiation survival demonstrated elevated miR335 expression, reduced CtIP, and BR1 foci. Colony survival, BR1 foci, and Ct levels were partially rescued by miRNA antisense AMO-mi335 treatment. The ATM-dependent CRE-miR335-Ct axis influences the selection of homologous recombination for repair of double-strand breaks. The pathway impacts BR1 foci and retention, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and survival. The downregulation of mi335 by ATM-CRE results in increased Ct expression after irradiation, enhancing the DNA damage response. Phosphorylation of CREB by ATM reduces its activity, leading to downregulation of mi335. Overexpression of mi335 reduces BR1 foci and sensitizes cells to irradiation.
Researchers investigated the role of mentalizing, or attributing mental states such as beliefs and emotions to others, in learning during social interactions. Participants played repeated games against artificial agents with varying levels of sophistication, with some believing they played against humans and others thinking it was a casino game. Results showed participants won against sophisticated agents in the social framing and lost in the non-social framing. Their choices were best explained by mentalizing Bayesian models only in the social framing. This demonstrates the added value of mentalizing in social interactions and shows intentional behavior cannot be deciphered without attributing mental states to others. The study took inspiration from behavioral economics and psychology, extending cognitive models to repeated games involving recognition of others' intentions and beliefs. Social priors induced a sophisticated interpretation of game outcomes, engaging recursive updates specific to human interactions. The social brain assumes others are also Bayesian, updating recursive beliefs from observations in mutual exchanges. Task-relevant information was identical in both framings, but social framing induced mentalizing and recursive inference, while domain-general heuristics in non-social framing were vulnerable to artificial agents.
Researchers have developed an efficient algorithm, FastGM, for inferring Gaussian graphical models in biological networks, addressing limitations of existing approaches that are either statistically rigorous or inefficient for high-dimensional data. The algorithm estimates Gaussian graphical models and obtains p-values and confidence intervals for each edge in the graph, based on a proposal by Ren et al. Simulation studies demonstrate the algorithm is faster by several orders of magnitude than the current algorithm without losing accuracy. Application to transcriptomic data from a childhood asthma study and proteomic data from an Alzheimer's disease estimated gene and protein interaction networks for disease and healthy samples, revealing interesting interactions and differential networks between cases and controls relevant to diseases. The algorithm provides a computationally fast and statistically sound procedure for constructing Gaussian models with high-dimensional data, implemented in an R package named FastGM. FastGM enables researchers to study large-scale networks, such as gene/protein networks, using Gaussian models in practice, making it feasible to infer biological networks at a whole-genome scale. The algorithm is an exact implementation of asymptotically normal and efficient estimation, demonstrated through simulated and real data to speed up existing implementations without losing efficiency, becoming a powerful tool for network analysis under conditional dependence, especially high-dimensional data.
Researchers investigated the activity of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the basal ganglia, crucial for learning and executing movement sequences, and found that their population firing rates vary coherently on behaviorally relevant timescales. A model of a local MSN network showed that such activity emerges only at realistic connectivities and when MSN inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPs) are realistically sized. The study examined how MS network population activity interacts with temporally varying cortical activity and found that at high connectivity, a stable winners-take-all regime occurs where activity separates into fixed stimulus-dependent firing and quiescent components. At lower connectivity, a transition to a dynamic regime occurs where cells switch between activity and quiescence. The optimal regime allows weak changes in cortical driving to interact with many population components, enabling sequential assemblies to be reproducibly activated for hundreds of milliseconds after stimulus onset. This activity is maximized at striatally realistic connectivities and IP sizes, suggesting the local MS network is optimized to generate stimulus-dependent patterns for long periods after cortical excitation. The findings indicate the MS network is neither too stable nor unstable, but balanced to respond dynamically and consistently to cortical variations.
Researchers have discovered that the yeast GTPase Sec4 plays a crucial role in coupling polarized exocytosis with cortical actin polymerization, inducing endocytosis. After polarized exocytosis to the plasma membrane, Sec4 binds Las17/Bee1p and Sla1 and Sla2 during actin assembly. Mutations in Sec4 or its guanine exchange factor inhibit actin formation, while activating Sec4-Q79L accelerates assembly. In vitro assays show GTP-Sec4 overrides Sla inhibition of Las17-dependent actin nucleation, supporting a model where Sec4 relocates from exocytic sites to endocytic sites, promoting actin polymerization and compensatory endocytosis, controlling surface expansion and refining cell polarization. Sec4 meets expectations as a regulator of endocytosis by localizing to endytic sites, disrupting actin assembly, interacting with Las17, and inducing Ar2/3-dependent actin polymerization. Findings suggest Sec4 has a role in actin assembly and endocytic internalization, sharing spatial and temporal co-localization with actin subunits Sla, Las, and Abp. Sec4 plays a role in Sla/Las regulation of Ar2-dependent actin polymerization, working in parallel with other regulators to promote cortical actin formation, maintaining polarized growth dependent on both polarized exocytosis and endocytosis.
Acetaminophen-induced liver injury in mice is a model for drug-induced liver injury in humans, with necrosis beginning adjacent to the central vein and progressing outward, but the underlying mechanism remains elusive. The prevailing NQ zonation hypothesis suggests location-dependent differences in NAPQ formation within hepatic lobules are necessary and sufficient to explain this phenomenon. However, virtual experiments using configured periportal-to-central vein gradients failed to achieve the target phenomenon, indicating at least one additional feature must exhibit zonation decreasing in the central vein direction. Two alternatives were explored: glutathione depletion and ability to repair mitochondrial damage diminishing in the central vein. Including both features enabled achieving the target phenomenon, providing a multilevel, multiscale explanation of acetamin hepatotoxicity. Variants of the merged mechanism explain the variation in 24-hour necrosis scores among 37 genetically diverse mouse strains following a toxic acetamin dose. Virtual experiments provide strong evidence zonation of NQ formation alone is insufficient to explain perivenous necrosis. The merged mechanism offers a credible explanation of how, when, and where injury emerges within hepatic lobules, and why humans exhibit diverse responses.
Researchers investigated the diagnosis of congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection in infants born to infected mothers, focusing on the relationship between conventional diagnosis and quantitative DNA amplification methods. Infants were grouped based on diagnosis timing: those diagnosed by microscopic examination at birth, those requiring a second diagnosis at six months, and those diagnosed by serology at one year. Parasite levels were quantified using PCR, showing median parasitemia of 1,700, 20-500, and 5 parasites/mL for each group respectively. Trypanosoma cruzi parasites were isolated from 19 congenitally infected children, with 18 genotyped as DTU Tc and one as Tc. The study found that 22 out of 51 children had parasitem levels below the detection limit of conventional methods, highlighting the need for more sensitive parasitological methods for early diagnosis. Current tryocidal treatment proved effective in curing infected children, emphasizing the importance of early diagnosis. The study correlated parasitem and ELISA serology values and genotyped isolated parasites to understand congenital transmission and improve diagnosis, demonstrating that only infants with high parasitem can be diagnosed by parasitology at one month, while others may require serology at one year due to low parasitem levels.
Researchers have developed a biophysical model of Escherichia coli that predicts growth rate and cellular composition from a coarse-grained representation of its genome, assuming exponential steady-state growth in a constant environment rich in resources. The model was applied to measurements of seven E coli strains with rRNA operon copy numbers ranging from one to seven, showing growth rate decreases with fewer than six copies. The model reproduces these measurements and suggests the volume of macromolecules inside E coli is not fixed when rRNA copy number is varied. Increasing copy number beyond seven results in cytoplasm densely packed with ribosomes and proteins, predicting growth will not increase substantially beyond wild-type rate. The model indicates changing rRNA copy of wild-type cells in constant environment does not increase growth. Observations of strains with altered rRNA copy, such as nucleoid compaction and rRNA feedback, are qualitatively consistent with the model. Experimental evidence shows exponentially growing cells with altered rRNA copy have lower growth rates, and a strain with extra rRNA on plasmid exhibited 22% reduction in growth relative to control. The model predicts growth in constant medium will not increase beyond wild-type when rRNA copy is increased beyond seven, suggesting kinetic and biophysical considerations determine optimal rRNA copy.
R1, an Arabidopsis MYB protein, interacts with HY5/HYH to modulate seed germination and seedling development in response to abscic acid and salinity. MYB transcription factors are involved in many biological processes, including metabolism and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. R1 belongs to a MYB-related subfamily and previous transcriptome analysis suggests R1 may play roles in plant development, stress, and hormone signaling. Down-regulation or up-regulation of R1 expression alters sensitivity to abscic acid, NaCl, and mannitol in Arabidopsis. The expression of R1 is dynamically regulated by ABA and NaCl. Transcription factors HY5 and HY regulate R1 via binding the R1 promoter. Genetic analyses reveal R1 mediates functions of HY in seed germination and post-germination to ABA and abiotic stresses. Pull-down and BiFC assays show R1 interacts with HY/HY in vitro and vivo. R1 and HY/HY may function as a regulatory module in responses to ABA and abiotic stresses. R1 binds the promoter of ABA INSENSITIVE, regulating its expression while R1 interaction stimulates HY binding the ABI promoter. HY/HY and R1 converge on ABI promoter and regulate ABI expression and ABI-downstream genes, improving adaption to environment.
Mitochondrial complex I, a crucial component of the respiratory chain, links electron transfer from NADH to ubiquinone to pumping four protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space, with defects implicated in various degenerative disorders. Recent X-ray structural analysis confirms redox reactions occur in the hydrophilic peripheral arm, distant from the membrane, suggesting proton pumping is driven by long-range conformation coupling. Deletion of the Yarrow complex's accessory subunit forms a stable subcomplex, nbmΔ, lacking the distal part of the membrane domain. Analysis reveals two subunits, ND4 and ND5, with homology to Mrp-type Na+/H+ antiporters, are missing in nbmΔ, yet it still pumps protons at half stoichiometry. Results indicate the membrane arm of complex I contains two functionally distinct pump modules connected in series by a helical element. Respiratory complex I plays a central role in energy metabolism, with defects linked to neurodegenerative disorders and aging. Composed of over 40 subunits, the enzyme contains FMN and iron-sulf clusters, with 14 conserved subunits forming the core, while 26 accessory subunits' functions are largely unknown. Proton pumping within the membrane arm is indirectly driven, with molecular mechanism, number, and localization of pump sites remaining unclear.
Fever, a regulated increase in body temperature resulting from infectious and non-infectious causes, plays a role in modulating immune responses to infection. Researchers investigated the potential of febrile temperatures in regulating antigen binding affinity to antibodies using isothermal titration calorimetry and ELISA with malar and deng antigens against monoclonal antibodies. Results showed a marked increase in affinity of antibody-antigen complexes at 40°C compared to physiological 37°C or pathophysiological 42°C. Thermal equilibration of proteins at these temperatures prior to measurements further increased binding affinity. Isothermal titration calorimetry was used to investigate the formation of deng and mial immune complexes at 37°C, 40, and 42 after equilibrating proteins for 1 hour at indicated temperatures. Elevated temperatures alter membrane fluidity, cell signaling, and gene patterns, but the role of febrile temperatures directly affecting antibody affinity for antigens has not been explored. Data indicate potential for reversible physiological temperatures increasing in vitro antibody affinity for tertiary and quaternary epitopes and suggest thermal activation for antibodies binding antigens. Thermal equilibration prior to ELISA improved binding affinities by a factor of 9.5 at 37°C and 8 at 40 for deng complex and decreased KD by 1.3 at 37 and 1 at 40 for malar complex.
Actomyosin-based cortical flow is a fundamental for cellular morphogenesis, generated by cross-linked networks of actin filaments and myosin motors, where active stress produced by motor activity is opposed by passive resistance to network deformation. A computational model of a cross-linked network with active motors based on minimal requirements for production and dissipation of contractile stress, including asymmetric filament compliance, spatial heterogeneity of motor activity, reversible cross-links, and filament turnover, was studied. The results show that filament turnover is required to maintain active stress against external resistance and steady state in response to stress. Steady stress increases with filament lifetime up to a characteristic time, then decreases with lifetime above it. Effective viscosity increases with filament lifetime to a characteristic time, then becomes independent of lifetime and sharply dependent on crosslink dynamics. These dependencies define multiple regimes of steady state flow. When filament lifetimes are shorter, dependencies of viscosity and steady stress on turnover cancel, and flow speed is insensitive to turnover, showing a simple dependence on motor and crosslink dynamics. The study provides a framework for understanding how cells tune cortical flow through local control of network remodeling, capturing distinct contributions of cross-link unbinding and filament turnover in stress relaxation within a single framework, confirming theoretical predictions that spatial heterogeneity of activity and asymmetric compliance support macroscopic contraction of unconstrained networks.
Researchers identified a quantitative trait locus, GS11, associated with seedling sensitivity to high sugar in Arabidopsis thaliana, which maps to the ANAC060 gene. The Col AN060 allele confers sugar insensitivity and is dominant over the sugar-sensitive C24 allele due to a single-nucleotide polymorphism affecting splicing patterns, resulting in a truncated AN60 protein lacking the transmembrane domain, leading to nuclear localization. Glucose induces GS11/AN060 expression through abscic acid signaling, with ABI4 directly binding to the GS11/AN060 promoter to activate transcription. However, Col060 reduces ABA sensitivity, Glc-induced ABA accumulation, and ABI expression. The sugar-ABA cascade induces AN060 expression, but the truncated AN060 protein attenuates ABA induction and signaling, resulting in sugar insensitivity. The study used a selective genotyping approach and near-isogenic lines to confirm GS11 and allelism and transgenic complementation tests showed GS11 lies within AN060. The short AN060 protein is found in 12% of natural Arabidopsis accessions. The findings provide insight into sugar signaling pathways, with AN060 belonging to the OsN8 subgroup of NAC transcription factors, including AN089, previously identified in determining seedling fructose sensitivity.
Researchers investigated the molecular basis of second messenger signaling in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, specifically the role of cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) in regulating behaviors such as biofilm formation and motility. They identified a c-di-GMP synthase gene, hsbD, located near the hpt and flagellar genes, and found that the Hpt pathway controls biofilm formation and motility through hsb and anti-sigma factor Hsb. The interaction between hsb and Hsb and control of hsb localization at cell poles enables c-diMP signaling specificity. The Hpt pathway regulates biofilm, twitching, swimming, swarming motility, and chemotaxis in P. aeruginosa. Hsb and SadC contribute to Hpt-dependent biofilm regulation but have distinct impacts on motility, suggesting they act at different positions in the c-diMP network. A sad mutant is defective in biofilm and hyper-swarming but not swimming or twitching. Hsb acts locally at cell poles, intersecting with Sad within the global Gac/Rsm network, which contributes to high c-diMP for biofilm formation. HsbA binds anti-sigma FlgM, inducing flagellar expression, and absence of Hpt leads to Hsb phosphorylation, reducing swarming and increasing biofilm. The Hpt pathway controls biofilm via reduction of Rsm small RNA levels. The study reveals how c-diMP signaling gains specificity in P. aeruginosa through interaction with the Hpt cascade.
Researchers investigated how humans learn and generalize sensorimotor behaviors based on contextual information, specifically the association between visual cues and visuomotor mappings. Participants performed a rapid-pointing task with varying visual feedback offsets dependent on target shapes, requiring different visomotor mappings to "hit" the target. Shapes were morphed between spiky and circular, and after training, performance was tested without feedback on novel shapes. Two hypotheses were compared: explicit extraction of the linear relationship between target and visuomotor mapping, and an implicit Bayesian model predicting categorization-based generalization. Results showed participants applied mappings to the trained shape most similar to the current one, consistent with the Bayesian model, which also predicted slower learning with increased training pairs. The study found a correspondence between the Bayesian model and empirical results, indicating a possible mechanism for learning multiple visuotor mappings. Participants were trained on a subset of shape/visomotor-mapping pairs and tested on generalization to other shapes along the scale, with a linear relationship between shape and visuotor mappings. A questionnaire revealed participants' awareness of shape contingencies with required behavior, and analysis showed learning of shape-mapping contingencies for trained shapes. The study's novelty lies in the continuous variation of shape and visuotor mappings, with training focused on the functional relationship between shape and corresponding mapping.
The inferior olivary nucleus provides one of the main inputs to the cerebellum through climbing fibers, which are believed to be related to timing of motor commands and motor learning. Climbing fiber activation leads to large all-or-none action potentials in cerebellar Purkin cells, overriding other activity and silencing them briefly. Empirical evidence shows climbing fibers transmit short bursts of spikes due to olary somatic spikes, increasing information transferred to the cereum per activation. A three-compartment model of an olary cell investigated factors determining climbing burst size, suggesting phase-dependency is present but limited and charge flow between soma and dendrite is a major determinant. Ensemble synchrony can affect climbing burst size through dendrodentic gap-junction coupling between olary cells. The cereum ensures smooth execution of motor tasks using two channels, mossy and climbing fibers, with climbing carrying sensory information. Variability in spike shape may allow transmission of more information and phase dependency of burst size and somatic spike count allows coarse temporal encoding. The model predicts phase-dependency in a limited range of amplitudes and coupled cell ensembles. Low firing rate of olary cells renders time scales for coding ineffective, requiring investigation of electrophysiological properties to understand information transfer to cereum. Simulations showed correlation between subthreshold oscillation phase and spike count, providing quantitative estimate for computational cerebell models.
A computational model of human liver iron metabolism has been developed to understand the regulation of iron levels in the body. Iron is essential for life due to its redox properties, but can be toxic in overload, and the liver plays a key role in maintaining safe levels. The model includes core regulatory components and was constructed based on known mechanisms and kinetic properties from publications. It was validated by comparing results with published physiological data and reproduces experimental findings, including a time course following an oral dose of iron. A disease simulation of haemochromatosis was created by altering a parameter mimicking a human haemochatosis gene mutation, providing a quantitative understanding of liver overload. The model supports the liver's role as an iron sensor and provides a framework for further modelling to identify targets and design experiments. Existing models are limited, being too specific or generic, and this model balances coverage and detail, allowing what-if experiments and new hypotheses to be tested. It integrates data from multiple sources, including in vitro and animal models, for parameterisation, enabling a translational approach to improve understanding human metabolism. The model elucidates the link from genotype to phenotype, demonstrated with hereditary haechromatosis.
The nuclear pore complex regulates molecular traffic across the nuclear envelope, with selective transport occurring on the order of milliseconds and length of tens of nanometers. A coarse-grained model of the nuclear pore complex has been established, taking into account the polymeric nature of FG-repeats and kap-FG hydrophobic affinity, to mimic nucleocytoplasm transport. The model predicts the first-passage time of a 15 nm cargo-complex to be 2.6 ± 0.13 ms with an inverse Gaussian distribution. The cargo-complex primarily attaches to the channel wall, interacting with the FG-layer as it passes through the central channel. Kap-FG hydrophobic interaction is highly dynamic, ensuring efficient translocation through the nuclear pore. Almost all hydrophobic spots on kap-β are occupied during transport. Cytoplasmic filaments play a defining role in selectivity, as cytoplasmic filaments-deficient NPCs show high permeability to inert cargos. Simulation results corroborate findings, showing radial distribution of cargo-complex inside the central channel and mean trajectory of 15 nm-complex from 150 independent simulations. First-passage times of 9 and 20 nm-complexes are 2.6 and 13 ms, respectively. The model conducts passive transport of small cargos, which diffuse freely across the nuclear pore.
Researchers have developed a protocol to determine the optimal infectious dose of a pathogen for nonhuman primate models, which is crucial for testing interventions against pathogens like HIV and malaria. The protocol aims to find the dose that infects 50% of the time, known as ID50, while minimizing animal use and resources. Using too high or low a dose can lead to false results and excessive animal use. The method involves iterative exposures of animal cohorts to dilutions of the pathogen stock, adjusting the dose between rounds to achieve 50% infection. On average, the protocol requires 15 animals, 3 rounds, and results in an estimate of ID50 within 40% of the true value. The protocol is generalizable to any pathogen and animal but is critical for nonhuman primate models where minimizing animal use is mandated. Determining ID50 typically involves understanding the relationship between probability of infection and dose, and a 2-fold error can significantly impact the experiment's power. The protocol provides an estimate of ID within 1.5-fold of the true value, reducing animal and resource waste, and is essential for achieving statistically significant and biologically meaningful results with minimal animal use.
Researchers investigated adaptation in the auditory neuron AN2 of crickets, characterizing its response to amplitude-modulated sound stimuli and finding adaptation shifts the stimulus-response curve toward higher intensities with a time constant of 1.5 seconds for adaptation and recovery, reducing responses for low-intensity sounds. The study tested two competing hypotheses, infom and selective coding, which predict different changes in the input-response curve when presenting signals with multiple peaks in amplitude distributions. Results showed a reduction in the slope of the response curves and higher absolute thresholds than predicted by infax, with adaptation reducing the amount of encoded information when considering the whole range of signals. The response changes were not consistent with selective coding, as the amount of information conveyed about the loudest part of the signal remained constant, and less information was transmitted about lower intensity signals. The primary task of the first stage of auditory processing in crickets is to maintain and condense relevant information for object localization and recognition for higher centers in the brain, with multiple scales of adaptation observed at the first interneuron level, similar to vertebrate systems and other sensory modalities.
Researchers investigated the role of polybasic domains in the mammalian prion protein PrP in the context of full-length PrP, using prion proteins lacking one or both polybasic domains expressed from Chinese hamster ovary cells as substrates in serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification reactions. After several rounds of amplification, PrSc molecules lacking the central polybasic domain were formed, which could bind and induce conversion of all polybasic domain mutant substrates into PrSc molecules. Surprisingly, these PrSc molecules displayed diminished or absent biological infectivity relative to wild-type PrSc despite their ability to seed reactions. The results suggest that propagation of PrSc may not depend on a single stereotypic mechanism and normal PC/PrSc interaction through polybasic domains may be required to generate prion infectivity. Polybasic deficient PrSc provide the first example of dissociation between brain homogen seeding ability from prion infectivity. The study used a combination of cell expression, purification, and reconstitution techniques to engineer PrSc molecules lacking polybasic domains, which propagate robustly in vitro, to assess whether PC polybasic are universally required for PrSc docking and propagation. The findings indicate the N-terminal polybasic domain participates in wild-type PrSc binding and propagation. The PrSc molecules lacking polybasic domains interact with PC through a novel mechanism, yielding an expanded range and efficient PrSc propagation, but with diminished infectivity, indicating a dissociation between seeding ability and infectivity.
Researchers developed an inverse reinforcement learning framework to identify animal behavioral strategies from time-series data, applying it to Caenorhabditis elegans thermotactic behavior. Fed worms cultivated at a constant temperature with food preferred that temperature on a thermal gradient, while starved worms avoided it. The approach revealed fed worms used absolute temperature and temporal derivative, employing directed migration and isothermal migration strategies. Directed migration efficiently reached specific temperatures, explaining thermotactic behavior when fed, while isothermal migration moved along constant temperatures. Starved worms escaped cultivation using absolute temperature only. The neural basis was investigated by applying the method to thermosensory-deficient worms. Results showed fed animals utilized sensory information of absolute and temporal temperature for their strategy. The value function represented the benefit of each state, indicating expected rewards from a given state. Applying the framework to time-series data identified value functions underlying thermotactic strategies. Population thermotaxis assays were performed with 80-150 worms cultivated at 20°C on agar plates with thermal gradients. Behavioral crosstalk was negligible due to low worm density. Cross-validation confirmed prediction for future state transition was higher in 2D than 1D strategy, indicating worms utilized both absolute and temporal temperature for behavior.
Researchers have sequenced the genome of Chrychromulina tobin, a member of the Prymnesiales order of haptophytes, providing new insights into the evolutionary history, ecology, and economic importance of hophytes. The nuclear genome is small, compact, and encodes approximately 16,777 genes, with 40% of the genome being protein-coding. Genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, modification, and catabolism show distinct patterns of expression over the circadian photoperiod. The genome harbors a hybrid polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthase complex, anti-microbial peptides, and proteins involved in multidrug and toxic extrusion. A new haptophyte xanthorhodin and two RuBisCO activases shared across algal lineages were identified. Chrychromina tobin represents the second hapt whose nuclear and chloroplast genomes have been sequenced. The genome shows evidence of lateral gene transfer contributing to the taxon's evolutionary restructuring. The study enhances understanding of hophytes role in aquatic ecosystems, carbon sequestration, and as a nutritive food source. Genomic knowledge will support commercial endeavors in aquaculture, nutraceuticals, and biofuel production, and understanding of metabolic processes associated with harmful algal blooms.
Breast cancers that are triple-negative for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 markers typically belong to the Basal-like molecular subtype, which is associated with defective Rb, p53, and Brca pathways. Mouse studies demonstrate that combined inactivation of Rb and p53 pathways suppresses physiological cell death of mammary involution, while concomitant inactivation of all three pathways in mammary epithelium has an additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes highly penetrant metastatic adenocarcinomas. Tumors are poorly differentiated and have histologic features common to human Brca-mutated tumors, including heterogeneous morphology, metaplasia, and necrosis. Gene expression analyses show tumors share attributes of Basal-like and Claudin-low signatures. p53 is mutated in 20-30% of human breast cancers, nearly all Basal-like with BR1 have concomitant p53 mutation, and germline BR1 mutation predisposes early onset triple-negative breast cancers. Concomitant inactivation of tumor suppressor pathways has additive effect on tumor latency and predisposes malignant carcinomas. Mouse models mimic the complexity of triple-negative breast cancer and will be tools for defining cellular biology and behavior. Loss of BR1 may alter tumor phenotype through deregulation of EMT. CG analysis revealed CNAs consistent with human breast cancer genomic surveys. Mammary tumors caused by inactivation of Rb, Br1 and p53 mimic aggressive forms of breast cancer, including rapid progression, poor differentiation, metastasis and genomic instability.
Aedes aegypti is the primary vector of dengue, a significant arboviral infection globally, and controlling its population is crucial for preventing transmission. Accurate predictions of vector populations are required to develop effective reduction strategies. A study in rural Kamphaet, Thailand, from 2004 to 2007, analyzed 84,840 water-holding containers to model Aedes aegypti pupal production. Regression modeling assessed the effect of larval site density, access to piped water, and seasonal variation on container productivity, accounting for differences between container types. The results showed that the number and density of larval sites were primary determinants of Aedes aegypti pupae distribution and abundance. Container productivity increased with habitat density, indicating that an ecological approach considering site density is suitable for predicting Aedes aegpti population and control. Adult production is unevenly distributed across potential larval sites, with key factors such as container capacity, temperature, water source, and location affecting production. Incorporating site density into control efforts can lead to a cohesive understanding of Aedes aegpti dynamics and effective interventions. Longitudinal studies of epidemiological, entomological, and behavioral factors are necessary to examine changes in deng burden and vector populations. The model provided reasonable estimates of container productivity but did not predict the number of pupae from small super-producing containers.
The Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TOR2) mediates gut-to-brain signaling in the regulation of phenotypic plasticity in Caenorhabditis elegans, integrating external cues with internal conditions such as metabolic state to execute behavioral and developmental decisions. TOR2 controls multiple processes in response to cellular stressors and growth factors, and regulates larval development and adult behaviors in response to environmental cues and feeding state. During development, pherone, bacterial food, and temperature regulate expression of daf-7 TGF-β and daf-28 insulin-like peptide in sensory neurons to promote a decision between reproductive growth and entry into the alternate dauer larval stage. TOR2 acts in the intestine to regulate neuronal expression of daf-7 and daf28, reflecting bacterial-diet dependent feeding status, providing a mechanism for integration of food signals with external cues in regulation of neuroendocrine expression. In adults, TOR2 modulates food-regulated foraging behaviors via a PDF-2/PDF-1 neuropeptide-dependent pathway. Genetic variation affects food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes, and quantitative trait loci are associated with these traits. TOR2 acts as a hub for communication of feeding state from the gut to brain, contributing to modulation of neuronal function by internal state. Intestinal TOR2 signaling regulates food-dependent adult foraging and dauer decisions, and is required for food modulation of dauer entry and exploratory behavior in C. elegans. The essential TOR2 component rict-1/Rictor acts in the intestine to promote neuronal expression of daf7 TGFβ and daf28 IL genes.
Researchers analyzed transcriptional profiles of mouse embryonic stem cells and primordial germ cells to understand transcriptional regulation of pluripotent cells. Genes upregulated in pluripotent cells were identified and found to be enriched in roles in transcription, chromatin remodeling, cell cycle, and DNA repair. A novel algorithm, CompM, was developed to predict short DNA motifs regulating gene expression by combining sequence alignment and probabilistic segmentation. The algorithm identified conserved motifs overrepresented in genes upregulated pluripotent cells, which were active in undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem cells and human embryonic germ cells. The motifs acted as enhancers in the context of an endogenous promoter and their activity was conserved in human cells. Transcription factor NF-Y specifically bound to one motif, was differentially expressed during cell differentiation, and required for cell proliferation. The study identified clusters of genes upregulated in pluripotent cells, novel cis-regulatory motifs, and transcription factor NF as a regulator of gene expression in embryonic stem cells. The results provide insights into transcriptional networks of pluripotent cells and a basis for understanding mammalian embryogenesis, self-renewal, and pluripotency. The approach can be applied to understanding transcription networks in mammalian species.
Researchers have characterized the structure of a soluble heterodimeric complex between a variant of vesicular stomatitis virus nucleoprotein lacking 21 N-terminal residues and a phosphoprotein peptide encompassing the molecular recognition element that binds RNA-free nucleoprotein. The complex crystallized in a decameric circular form and was solved at 3.0 Å resolution, revealing how the molecular recognition element folds upon binding and competes with RNA binding and polymerization. Small-angle X-ray scattering and NMR spectroscopy confirm the binding and indicate flanking regions remain flexible in the complex. The structure suggests a mechanism for initiation of viral RNA synthesis and encapsidation of newly synthesized RNA. The molecular recognition element adopts a stable conformation upon binding to nucleoprotein, including residues 6 to 35, and corresponds to a previously identified fragment essential for maintaining nucleoprotein in a soluble form. The heterodimer crystallized into a circular decamer, similar to previously crystallized decameric RNA ring, revealing mechanisms of molecular recognition attachment to nucleoprotein. The findings demonstrate the reconstituted complex is a suitable model for the viral nucleoprotein-phosphoprotein complex, providing insights into viral RNA synthesis and encapsidation.
Researchers investigated the role of gap junctions in the fly visual system, specifically in the vertical system network, where cells primarily connect via axonal gap junctions, to explore their function in sensory processing. A theoretical analysis of a realistic network model showed that within 10ms of visual input onset, axonal junctions enable efficient encoding of the axis of rotation of the fly's motion, near-optimal with respect to physical limits. The subset of vertical cells connected to downstream pathways, VS5-6-7, encodes motion more efficiently and robustly than the whole network across signal-to-noise ratios. Efficient encoding by this subpopulation is necessary for visually guided behavior, such as banked turns in evasive maneuvers. Gap junctions, formed among axons, impact system readout while maintaining dendritic input intact, suggesting richer computational principles than previously appreciated. The study found near-optimal efficiency emerged regardless of signal-to-noise ratios, with VS5-6-7 reaching 90% of physical limits. Initial evidence suggests gap junctions improve transmission in other systems, including retina and neocortical L2/3 inhibitory interneuron networks. This study encourages exploration of gap junctions as a common mechanism for improving information transmission, providing insights into how network connectivity leads to efficient encoding of sensory stimuli.
Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is a major causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth disease, and has been associated with neurological diseases, including fatal cases in large outbreaks in the Asia region. Human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) has been identified as a cellular receptor for EV71 entry and replication in leukocytes. PSGL1 is a sialomucin expressed on leukocytes, serving as a high-affinity counterreceptor for selectins, mediating leukocyte rolling on endothelium. Tyrosine sulfation at the amino terminus of PSGL1 is critical for EV71 infection, with site-directed mutagenesis at potential tyrosine sulfation sites impairing PSGL binding to EV71. O-glycosylation on T57 is not necessary for PSGL binding to EV71. An inhibitor of sulfation, sodium chlorate, blocks PSGL-EV71 interaction and inhibits PSGL-mediated replication of EV71 in Jurkat cells in a dose-dependent manner. Tyrosine sulfation, not O-glycosylation, in the N-terminal of PSGL1 facilitates virus entry and replication of EV71 in leukocytes. The identification of PS-GL1 as a receptor for EV71 has provided clues in the elucidation of molecular basis of early-host interactions and pathogenesis of EV71. Further studies are needed to identify genetic determinants in EV capsid proteins required for PSGL binding and the biological significance of two EV71 receptors, PSGL-1 and SCARB.
Leishmaniasis is a significant global health problem with limited treatment options due to toxicity and resistance. Inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have shown anti-pathogen properties. This study tested therapeutic efficacy of mTOR inhibitors in controlling Leishmania major infection in BALB/c mice. Rapamycin, GSK-2128 and KU-379 were administered, and footpad swelling, parasite burden, cytokine production, and lymph node cell changes evaluated. Treatment with rapycin and GSK-8 lowered foot swelling and parasite load, while KU-379 had no effect. Rapycin did not kill promastigotes in vitro but reduced IL-4 production, increasing IFNγ:IL-4 ratio, indicating Th1-skewed cytokine profile. CD69 expression on CD4 and CD8 T cells was enhanced in rapycin-treated mice. Select mTOR inhibitors may be used therapeutically for leishias management, with beneficial effects stemming from immunomodulatory properties. Adjuvantic mTOR may be considered in vaccination strategies against Leishmania. Rapycin and GSK-8 decreased parasite burden, reduced morbidity, and modulated anti-parasite immunity. CD4 and CD8 T cell participation in anti-leish immunity is unclear, requiring further study. The adjuvant effects of rapycin and GSK8 can be exploited for cutaneous leishias treatment, yielding promising therapeutic results.
Natural transformation is a biological process where competent bacteria take up free DNA and incorporate it into their genomes, becoming genetically altered. To prevent deleterious transformation by foreign DNA, some species preferentially take up their own DNA containing specific DUS sequences. The ComP receptor in Neisseria species plays a crucial role in this process. By modulating ComP levels in Neisseria meningidis, researchers found that transformation enhancement in the presence of DUS is entirely dependent on ComP, which also controls transformation in the absence of DUS. Inner bases of DUS are essential, as single mutations led to impaired interaction with Com and transformation. Naturally occurring DUS variants in human Neisser commensals differing by one or two bases were also impaired for transformation of N. meningidis. ComP from N. flavan commens binds its cognate DUS variant and mediates D-enhanced transformation when expressed in a Com mutant N. meningidis, indicating a similar mechanism used by Neisser species to promote transformation of their own or closely related DNA. The findings shed light on molecular events in the earliest step of natural transformation, revealing a mechanism for modulating horizontal gene transfer between competent species sharing the same niche.
Cooperation between the paxillin-like protein Pxl1 and glucan synthase Bgs1 is essential for actomyosin ring stability and septum formation in fission yeast. Pxl and Bgs cooperate to maintain the position and integrity of the contractile actomyin ring during cytokinesis and are necessary for synthesis of the septum structure. Pxl concentration at the contractile actin ring increases during cytokinesis and depends on the SH3 domain of the F-BAR protein Cdc15. Lack of Pxl in combination with B1 depletion causes failure of ring contraction and lateral cell wall overgrowth without septum formation. Depletion of B1 in cells carrying cdcΔSH allele causes ring disassembly and septation blockage similar to cells lacking Pxl. Absence of Pxl is lethal when Cdc function is affected generating a sliding of the contractile actin ring with deposition of septum material along the cell cortex. Cdc through the SH domain and Pxl cooperates with B1 to confer stability to the contractile actin ring and form the septum during cytokinesis. Cooperation between Pxl and B1 is essential for contractile actin ring maintenance and septum formation as cells without B1 display disassembly and cannot form septa when Pxl is absent. The synthesized product of B1 is required for the contractile actin ring to be stably anchored to the plasma membrane.
Researchers investigated a recent outbreak of glanders, a zoonotic disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia mallei, in Bahrain using high-resolution genotyping and whole genome sequencing. The disease, eradicated in many Western countries, has re-emerged in Asia, the Middle East, and South America. Analysis of 9 B. malle isolates from Bahrain and 15 from a 2004 UAE outbreak revealed two distinct clusters, indicating a complex epidemiological background and multiple B. malle strains involvement. Bahrain samples were closely related to UAE's 2004 isolates, suggesting repeated importation from similar geographic sources. High-resolution genotyping and genome analysis confirmed the same phylogenetic patterns. The close relationship between UAE and Bahrain B. malle populations may indicate a common origin. Eight horses and one camel tested positive for B. malle, with the camel strain closely related to UAE's 2004 horse isolate. Results suggest two independent introductions, supported by animal import records from Syria and Kuwait, where one necropsied horse originated. At least two B. malle populations were involved, with strains from 2010 and 201 in both clusters, indicating a persistent outbreak across years. Genome phylogeny confirmed MLVA data, supporting the hypothesis of two B. malle populations causing the Bahrain outbreak, posing a risk for human infections due to worldwide horse trading.
American cutaneous leishmaniasis is a disease producing approximately 67,000 new cases per year, with severity depending on the parasite species. The World Health Organization recommends pentavalent antimonial derivatives, such as Glucantime, as first-line treatment for Leishmania braziliensis. However, treatment failure occurs in about 25% of cases, with unknown reasons. A cross-sectional study of 43 patients in Colombian Army reference centers characterized clinical and parasitological features of those not responding to Glucime. Leishmania braziliensis was the predominant species in 95.4% of cases, and 35% of parasites showed decreased in vitro Glucime susceptibility. Lesion size and parasite infectivity correlated negatively with Glucime susceptibility. A negative correlation between lesion size and parasite resistance was found. Leishmania braziliensis was the main species associated with treatment failure or relapse. The indication of a second round of treatment with pentavalent antimonials for Leishmania braziliensis is questionable. Patients had completed at least one round of Glucime treatment, 20mg/kg/day for 20 days, and experienced treatment failure or relapse. Recruitment occurred from June 2013 to March 2014 in three reference centers for complicated cutaneous leishmanias. Species in the Leishmania Viannia subgenus, including Leishmania brazili, are more prone to treatment failure than those in the Leishmania subgenus.
Researchers investigated the interplay between biosynthetic pathways of iron-scavenging molecules, known as siderophores, and the genotoxin colibin in Escheria coli. Two 4-phosphantethein transferases, EntD and Clb, are required for these pathways. EntD is part of the core genome, while Clb is encoded on the pks pathogenic island, associated with high pathogenic island in highly virulent strains. Clb contributes to sideroph synthesis and inactivation of both EntD and Clb abolishes virulence in extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli. Presence of either Ent or Clb is necessary for survival in vivo. The pks island is constantly associated with yersabactin gene cluster and Clb is a promiscuous phosphopantethein transferase that promotes synthesis of colin, yersactin, enteract, and salmochins. The association of pks with high pathogenic island has been selected in highly virulent E. coli because Clb contributes to both genotoxin and sideroph synthesis. This connection between phosphantin-requiring pathways leading to functionally distinct metabolites has implications for understanding E. coli virulence and development of anti-virulence strategies.
Researchers have developed a probabilistic model for multiple sequence alignment that accounts for insertions and deletions, in addition to substitutions, given a phylogenetic tree. The model uses a rate matrix augmented by a gap character, starting from a continuous Markov process, and constructs a non-reversible birth-death evolutionary model for insertions and deletions. The model assumes insertion and deletion events occur one residue at a time. The extended program, dnaml, improves accuracy relative to the usual approach of ignoring gaps while retaining computational efficiency of Felsen's peeling algorithm. Benchmarking on simulated data and real ribosomal RNA alignments shows improved accuracy. Phylogenetic inference calculates probability of multiple alignment given a tree and evolutionary model describing sequence change over time. Widely used phyetic models only account for residue events, whereas HMMs and SCFs account for insertions and deletions. Felsen's algorithm efficiently calculates probability of ungapped alignment, scaling linearly with length and number of sequences. The new model integrates evolutionary modeling into probabilistic models for sequence analysis, such as HMMs and SCFs for homology search and genefinding, improving phyetic inference on real data with insertions and deletions.
Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) initiates immunity through a mechanism that is not fully understood, initially infecting mucosal epidermis before entering nerve endings. In human skin, Langerhans cells (LCs) are the first to encounter HSV, then migrate into the dermis where they interact with dermal dendritic cells (DCs). Infected LCs undergo apoptosis and form clusters with BDCA+ dermal DCs and DC-SIGN DC/macrophages, transferring viral antigen for presentation. HSV-expressing LC fragments are observed inside dermal DC/macroph and BDCA+ dermal DCs upregulate damaged uptake receptor CLEC9. LCs isolated from skin infected with HSV1 in vitro also undergo apoptosis and are taken by BD3 dermal DCs and DC-SIGN cells. A viral relay occurs where infected LCs undergo apoptosis and are taken by dermal DCs for antigen presentation, providing a rationale for targeting these cells with mucosal or intradermal immunization. LCs are infected in situ in epidermis by HSV1, expressing structural and non-structural viral proteins, and pass virus or antigen to dermal DC through clusters in dermis. BD3 or DC-SIGN dermal DC taking antigen via LC may present to T cells in lymph nodes and dermis after CD4 and CD8 cell infiltration.
Researchers investigated the biogenesis of parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages infected with Leishmania major or L. amazonensis amastigotes using multidimensional imaging. Tight-fitting PVs housing one or two L. major amastotes and giant PVs housing many L. amazonensis amastotes were observed. The study characterized PV biogenesis and remodeling in macroages hosting amastotes of either L. major or L. amazonensis and loaded with Lysotracker, a lysomotropic probe. Three dynamic features of Leishmania amastote-hosting PVs were documented, including entry of Lysotracker within tight-fitting L major amastote-housing PVs, decrease in macroage acidic vesicles during L major PV fission or L amazon PV enlargement, and L amazon PV remodeling after homotypic fusion. Multidimensional imaging provided high-resolution morphological characterization of Leish PVs in live macroages, including volumetric expansion and homotypic fusion. The fission of Leish tight-fitting PVs was a two-step process involving amote replication prior to separation into distinct PVs accumulating lysomotropic probe, accompanied by macroage acidic compartment depletion. Acidic vesicles contributed to PV biogenesis, with approximately 50 detected vesicles consumed during infection, representing a volume of 30m3, partially accounting for Leish PV dimensional doubling. Software permitted quantification of host acidic vesicles distinguished from Leish PVs, indicating secondary lysosomes as the main source of membrane for Leish PV biogenesis. The study updated understanding of Leish species differences in PV biogenesis could be useful for studying other intracellular microorganisms.
Researchers investigated the role of chromatin structure in homology-directed repair using the chicken cell line DT40 as a model, where immunoglobulin genes undergo sequence diversification by gene conversion templated by pseudogene donors. The immunoglobulin V pseudogene array was found to be characterized by histone modifications associated with active chromatin. By expressing heterochromatin protein HP1 as a fusion to Escheria coli lactose repressor tethered to polymerase operators within the pseudo-V array, histone acetylation was diminished and the outcome of V diversification altered, resulting in nontemplated mutations rather than templated mutations. This demonstrates the importance of chromatin structure for gene conversion. Histone modifications may contribute to maintaining genomic stability by preventing recombination between repetitive sequences. The study suggests that permissive chromatin structure at the donor is crucial for homologous recombination and has implications for gene therapy, where providing an intact gene to replace a deficient gene. The findings indicate that chromatin regulates homology-directed repair, with histone modifications playing a key role in maintaining genomic stability and preventing recombination between repetitive sequences, and highlight the importance of considering donor chromatin structure in therapeutic applications.
The cerebellum plays a crucial role in adjusting motor behavior to meet situational needs, guided by the difference between desired and actual behavior, or error information. Cerebellum-based learning induces lasting changes in parallel fiber synapses on Purkinje cells, mediating behavioral adjustments. Olivary climbing fibers transport error information for synaptic modification but are not thought to contribute to memory. Research on monkeys in a saccadic learning paradigm challenges this concept, demonstrating a complex spike signature of error at occurrence and its reverberation before new behavior, improving it. Studies have shown patterns of complex spikes at odds with assumptions, indicating alteration of sacc amplitude by climbing fiber occurrence in the primary interval. Random saccadic adaptation reveals error-related changes in discharge before upcoming sacc, reflecting past errors in climbing fiber discharge. Climbing fibers convey information on behavioral insufficiencies to improve future manifestations, a central concept with seemingly incompatible findings, characterized by the assumption that climbing fibers convey error information for synaptic modification but not memory. The study reveals a clear spike signature of error and its reveration, contributing to understanding cerebellar motor learning and climbing fiber role.
Researchers investigated the effects of TDP-43, an RNA/DNA binding protein associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), using a yeast model exhibiting TDP-43-dependent toxicity. Overexpression of TDP-43 altered cell shape and reduced ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, but excess of the Hsp40 chaperone Sis1 reduced TDP-43's effects on toxicity, cell shape, and proteolysis. The presence of endogenous yeast prion [PIN+] influenced the strength of these effects, although S1 altered TDP-43 aggregation without physical association, suggesting indirect effects. Overexpression of mammalian S1 homologue DNA1 relieved TDP-mediated toxicity in primary rodent cortical neurons, indicating S1 and its homologues may have neuroprotective effects in ALS. TDP43 aggregation is associated with ALS and other diseases, and its overexpression forms cytoplasmic aggregates in yeast and mammalian neurons, inhibiting clearance of misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin proteasome system. Unbiased screens identified numerous yeast proteins as TDP toxicity modifiers, including P1 with human homologue ATX2, associated with increased ALS risk. Excess S1 reduces TDP-43 toxicity, and DNA1 reduces TDP-mediated toxicity in rodent neurons, suggesting potential neuroprotective effects in ALS and related conditions with cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of DNA/RNA binding proteins like TDP43.
Researchers investigated the parasite load and molecular diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi in 65 chronic Chagas disease patients from different regions of Brazil. Using multilocus conventional PCR and quantitative real-time PCR, 35 patients (53.8%) were positive, with 20 (30.7%) having the indeterminate form and 15 (23.1%) the cardiac form of the disease. The median parasite load was 2.54 [1.43-11.14] parasite equivalents/mL, with higher loads in patients over 70 years old. Genotyping identified TcVI, Tc, and mixed TcVI+T infections in 40%, 17.1%, and 14.3% of patients, respectively. Patients infected with TII had higher parasite loads (7.56 par Eq/mL) compared to TcVI (2.35 Eq/mL), but lower frequency of chagasic cardiomyopathy (16.7% vs 50%). The study contributes to the epidemiological knowledge of T. cruzi discrete units in Brazil, highlighting age and TII infection as factors leading to higher parasitemia levels. The results support the use of real-time PCR for detection and quantification of T. cruzi in peripheral blood samples, even in the chronic phase of the disease, and its potential as an indicator of therapeutic failure in Chagas disease.
A study on rabies in bats was conducted in Guatemala between 2009 and 201 as part of a larger pathogen detection program, where 672 bats of 31 species were sampled and tested for rabies. The prevalence of rabies virus detection among collected bats was low at 0.3%. Viral antigens were detected and infectious virus isolated from two common vampire bats, with viral RNA detected in all examined tissues except the liver of one bat. Sequencing showed the viruses were 100% identical in the nucleoprotein gene and had a non-synonymous substitution in the glycoprotein gene. The isolates were phylogenetically related to viruses from vampire bats in eastern Mexico and El Salvador. 7% of sera from 398 bats demonstrated rabies neutralizing antibody, varying across trophic guilds, indicating complex intraspecific compartmentalization of rabies perpetuation. The overall RNA prevalence was similar to other studies in Peru, Grenada, and Trinidad. Two rabies virus sequences were generated and deposited into GenBank. Despite detection of rabies in livestock, no cases were reported in bats during the same period. The study is the first report of rabies virus isolation from bats in Guatemala, with low prevalence even among vampire bats.
Researchers investigated the role of A-type lamins in herpesviral DNA targeting and heterochromatin modulation, finding that the nuclear lamina plays a role in downregulation of heterochatin and gene activation. Herpes simplex virus initiates replication near the nucleus edge, excluding histones from these structures. Studies in wild-type and A-type lamin-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts showed reduced viral replication compartments in lamin-deficient cells, failing to target the nuclear periphery. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence demonstrated HSV DNA association with increased heterochatin in lamin-deficient cells. Results argue for a functional role of A-type lamins in viral expression, DNA replication, and growth, reduced in lamin-deficient cells. Lamin A/C is required for targeting the viral genome and reduction of heterochatin on promoters during lytic infection. The nuclear lamina serves as a scaffold for DNA and protein complexes regulating euchromatin and heterochatin modifications. The study provides evidence for lamin-dependent targeting of HSV to the nuclear periphery, associated with reduction of heterochatin on lytic genes, suggesting a role in maintenance of heterochatin and gene silencing. The requirement for lamin A in replication was multiplicity-dependent, with a 5-fold reduction at high MOI and 100-fold at low MO. The nuclear lamina may provide a platform for recruitment of viral DNA and chromatin-modifying enzymes, keeping the genome active during productive infection.
Mitochondria originated from proteobacterial endosymbionts and their transition to organel was linked to the establishment of protein import pathways. The translocase of the outer membrane is common to all forms of mitochondria but an unexpected diversity of subunits between eukaryotic lineages has been predicted. Researchers analyzed the TOM complex in hydrogenosomes, a metabolically specialized anaerobic form of mitochondria found in Trichomonas vaginalis, and demonstrated that the highly divergent β-barrel T vaginal TOM40 forms a translocation channel to conduct hydrogenosomal import. The complex is composed of four subunits, including Tom36, Tom46, Tom22-like, and hydrogenosomal outer protein 19, which bind hydrogenosomal preproteins and function as receptors. Electron microscopy revealed that TvOM forms three pores and has an unconventional skull-like shape. The results suggest the triplet-pore TOM complex, composed of conserved subunits, was present in the last eukaryotic ancestor while receptors for substrate binding evolved independently in different eukotic lineages. Phylogenetic profiling predicted Tom7 in free-living excavates despite its apparent absence in TvOM. The study extends knowledge of TOM diversity in eukotes, isolated and characterized the complex from hydrogenosomes, an anaerobic form of mitochondria in Trichomonas vaginalis, providing insight into the evolution of eukotic cell function.
Researchers investigated the role of CD4 and CD8 T cells in autoimmune diseases by analyzing expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and identified cell-specific regulation of genes associated with autoimmune diseases. A trans-acting locus at chr12q13.2 containing the rs1137 SNP in the RPS26 gene was found, and a missense variant in IL27 associated with type 1 diabetes resulted in decreased protein activity and reduced expression of IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4 T cells. The rs181[G] variant of the IL27 gene confers protection against type 1 diabetes by inhibiting IRF1 and STAT1 expression in CD4 cells, while IL27 may promote autoimmunity via upregulation of the STAT pathway. Genome-wide studies identified thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with immune diseases. eQTL mapping in purified CD4 and CD8 T cells revealed effects on regulation of genes associated with autoimmune diseases, demonstrating specificity and sensitivity across cell types. A missense variant in IL27 was identified as a significant trans-eQ for IRF and STAT in CD4 cells. The study provides insights into gene regulation in T cells and pathways involved in disease susceptibility in the adaptive immune system, highlighting the role of distinct lineage of CD4 T cells in controlling autoimmune diseases.
A qualitative study was conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo to understand socio-cultural barriers to screening and treatment of Human African Trypanosomiasis. Semi-structured interviews and focus discussions were held with current and former patients, healthcare providers, and program managers in two provinces lagging in elimination efforts. Community members and health workers cited prohibitions after treatment, including no work, sex, hot food, or sun exposure for six months, believing violations cause serious complications. These restrictions originated to mitigate melarsrol regimen side effects but are now obsolete with safer drugs. The prohibitions are well-known, causing some to avoid screening due to fear of observing taboos. Improved understanding of these prohibitions is required to improve control strategies. Medical advice has transformed into enforced tabos affecting screening and treatment adherence, potentially abandoned with safer options like NECT. Participation in screening and treatment is negatively affected by restrictions, with unclear origins and basis. The study aimed to document perceptions and attitudes in high-prevalence provinces, where failure and adverse rates vary. Systematic follow-up after treatment is no longer recommended by WHO, and community non-participation compromises control objectives, partly due to community-enforced prohibitions associated with treatment.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 45 villages in Al-Gisha locality, eastern Gedaref State, Sudan, to estimate the incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Between May 5 and June 2011, 17,702 households with a population of 94,369 inhabitants were interviewed. The crude mortality rate over 409 days was 0.13/10,000 people per day, with VL a possible cause of 19% of deaths. The VL-specific mortality rate was 0.9/100 per year. Medical teams examined 551 individuals with a history of fever, diagnosing 16 primary VL cases. The overall incidence over the past year was 7.0/100 persons per year, or 7.9/100 per year including deaths possibly due to VL. 12.5% of the population reported past treatment. VL represents a significant health burden in eastern Gedf State. Active case detection had a low yield in this setting with adequate care and may not be the priority to enhance control in similar contexts. Post-kala-azar dermal leishmanis (PK) affects up to 50 of treated cases in Sudan, appearing within 6 months after cure and lasting months or years. Leishmania parasites are transmitted by female phlebotine sand flies, mainly in South Asia and Eastern Africa, where Sudan is the most affected country.
Gyrase catalyzes negative supercoiling of DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction that helps condense bacterial chromosomes into a compact interwound nucleoid. The supercoil density of prokaryotic DNA occurs in two forms, diffusible supercoil and constrained supercoil, which contribute equally to the total in vivo negative supercoil density. Escheria coli chromosomes have a 15% higher level of supercoil density compared to Salmonella enterica. Analysis of Salmonella using a 9 kb "super sensor" inserted at positions around the genome showed RNA transcription caused supercoiling to increase upstream and decrease downstream of highly expressed genes. Excess upstream superiling was relaxed by Topo I and gyrase replenished downstream supercoil to maintain equilibrium. Strains with TS gyrase mutations exhibited significant supercoil losses varying from 30% of WT levels to total loss of diffus supercoil at most locations. Supercoil losses were influenced by transcription as addition of rifampin caused super density to rebound throughout the chromosome. Gyrase mutants also reduced transcription elongation rates throughout the genome. The link between RNA polymerase elongation speed and gyrase suggests bacteria with fast growth rates generate higher supercoil densities than slow species. The mean supercoil density of Salmonella DNA is determined by a mechanism linking catalytic efficiency of gyrase to elongation rate of transcription. Local supercoiling levels rise and fall dramatically at opposite ends of highly transcribed operons in cells at permissive temperatures. Elongation rates range 45-60 nt/sec at different points around genome causing DNA rotations of 4-6 supercoils per second. Gyrase supercoils DNA at 4-5/sec and Top I removes negative supercoils at the same rate.
The intracellular protozoan Leishmania amazonensis replicates in parasitophorous vacuoles that share features with late endosomes and lysosomes, and these vacuoles expand during infection. Research shows host cells infected with L. amazonensis upregulate transcription of LYST/Be, which regulates lysosome size. Mutations in LYSTBe cause further vacuole expansion and enhance parasite replication, while LYSTBe overexpression leads to small vacuoles that do not sustain parasite growth. Treatment with vacolin-1 reverses this, expanding vacuoles and promoting growth, whereas E64 reduces vacuole size and inhibits replication. Large vacoles protect parasites from oxidative damage as inhibition of nitric oxide synthase has no effect on L. amazonensis viability within them. Upregulation of LYSTBe functions as a host innate response limiting growth by reducing vacole volume and inhibiting intracellular survival. Findings provide evidence LYSTBe restricts Leishmania growth by counteracting vacole expansion, suggesting a search for drugs blocking L. amazonensis vacole expansion could lead to novel therapeutic strategies against infections. Transcription of LYSTBe is upregulated in macrophages and fibroblasts infected by L. amazonensis and vacole size is a determinant of intracellular survival. Vacole enlargement protects Leishmania from microbic mechanisms common to macroages and fibroblasts.
Researchers have developed a zebrafish model to study Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome, an X-linked psychomotor retardation characterized by delayed development, intellectual disability, muscle weakness, and thyroid hormone disturbances. The syndrome is associated with mutations in the monocarboxylate transporter 8 gene, which transports thyroid hormone. MCT knockout mice failed to exhibit neurological symptoms despite abnormal thyroid levels, but mct−/− zebfish showed neurological and behavioral deficiencies, including reduced locomotor activity, altered light response, and increased sleep. Time-lapse imaging revealed reduced filopodia dynamics and axon branching in sensory neurons and decreased synaptic density in motor neurons. The study suggests MCT regulates neural assembly, mediating sensory and motor control. Administration of thyroid hormone analogs restored myelin and axon growth in mct−/− larvae. The findings propose a mechanism by which MCT regulates neural circuit and suggest early administration of thyroid analogs may reduce neurological damage in patients. The mct−/− zebfish model provides a stable model for whole-brain analysis during developmental stages, allowing assessment of therapeutic potential of thyroid analogs that can enter cells in the absence of MCT. The study sheds light on the pathophysiological mechanisms of Allan-Hndon-Dudley syndrome and potential treatment of psychomotor retardation.
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous virus that infects a wide variety of cell types using distinct entry pathways involving different forms of the gH/gL glycoprotein and the viral fusion glycoprotein gB. The minimal machinery sufficient for cell-cell fusion is gH/gL and gB. Research demonstrates that HCM gB and gH/g form a stable complex after synthesis in the absence of other proteins, with g/gL interacting with gB mutants unable to mediate cell fusion. g-gH/g complexes comprise up to 16% of total gH/g in HCM virus particles. In contrast, only small amounts of gH/gO and gH/UL-131 complexes are associated with gB. All herpesviruses express gB and gH/g molecules, with most models suggesting g/gH interacts with gB to mediate membrane fusion. Results show HCM gB and gH form stable g-gH/g complexes incorporated into virions without receptor binding or fusion, supporting the proposal that g/g interacts with g. The study found HCM g-gH complexes in extracellular virions, suggesting these form before g is activated for fusion and entry, and that gB does not need to be fusion-competent to interact with g/g.
Researchers have identified Gimap3, an outer mitochondrial GTPase, as a critical regulator of tissue-specific mitochondrial DNA segregation in leukocytes. Using a heteroplasmic mouse model, they demonstrated that G3 regulates the segregation of pathogenic mtDNA mutations, which determines the onset and severity of disease. Gimap is essential for cell development and survival, suggesting leukocyte survival may be a key factor in regulating mtDNA sequence variants and modulating human diseases. The study found that mtDNA segregation in hematopoietic tissues is a complex, age-dependent trait, independent of mtDNA copy number. Altered mRNA splicing of the CAST/E allele changes the G3 protein sequence but not the C-terminal transmembrane domain, which anchors it to the outer membrane. Analysis of G3 sequence does not support a direct interaction with mtDNA, implying cell-specific context or pathway is required to alter mtDNA segregation. Retroviral overexpression of CAST G3 in heteroplasmic murine embryonic fibroblasts had no effect on heteroplasmy levels. The findings suggest Gimap regulates mtDNA segregation in hematietic tissues through an indirect mechanism. This study is the first to identify a nuclear-encoded gene influencing mtDNA segregation in mammals and highlights the importance of Gimap in regulating mtDNA variants and modulating human diseases.
Buruli ulcer, a geographically-restricted skin and soft-tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, has a mean incubation period of 4-5 months in Victoria, Australia. A retrospective review of 443 cases between 2013-2016 found the mean incubation period to be 143 days, similar to a previous estimate of 135 days, despite a shift in exposure location from the Bellarine to Mornington peninsula. No association was found between incubation period and age, sex, location, duration of exposure, or lesion location. This suggests the mode of transmission is similar in different regions. The primary risk factor for disease acquisition is contact with an endemic area, and delayed diagnosis is common among non-residents. The causative organism was first described in Australia in 1948 and all isolates belong to the virulent classical lineage, closely related to strains from Africa and Papua New Guinea. The study confirms the incubation period, guiding clinicians and suggesting similar transmission modes in different regions. This knowledge is crucial as patients' symptoms may appear months after travel to an endemic area, and awareness of the rare mycobacterial infection is low among non-residents and practitioners.
Researchers investigated the role of a Niemann-Pick C1-related protein in the intracellular parasite Toxoplas, which possesses a gene coding for a protein containing the phylogenetically conserved sterol-sensing domain. The protein, named TgCR1, has significant identity to human NPC1 and localizes to flattened vesicles beneath the plasma membrane of Tooplas, unlike mammalian NPC1 which localizes to endo-lysosomes. Disruption of TCR resulted in viable parasites with normal cholesterol levels but accumulation of cholesteryl esters, sphingomyelins, and ceramides. Mutant parasites exhibited abundant lipid bodies, membranous tubules, and increased replication rates, and were more virulent in mice. Expression of TCR in mammalian NPC mutant cells restored cholesterol and GM1 clearance from endo-lysosomes, indicating a conserved activity between TCR and human NPC. Results suggest TCR plays a role in lipid homeostasis in Toxlas, controlling intracellular lipid levels, and its deficiency leads to stimulation of lipid storage, membrane biosynthesis, and parasite division. TCR's function is distinct from exogenous sterol transport as Toxoplas does not internalize host cholesterol into endo-lysosomes. Overall, the study provides insight into the role of TCR in lipid regulatory mechanisms in Toxoplas and its potential impact on parasite pathogenicity.
Ophtho-acromelic syndrome, also known as Waardenburg anophthalmia, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by eye malformations and post-axial oligodactyly. Researchers identified homozygous mutations in the SMOC1 gene in eight unrelated families, with four being nonsense, two frameshift, and two missense mutations. The orthologous gene in mice, Sm1, shows site and stage-specific expression during eye, limb, craniofacial, and somite development. A targeted preconditional gene-trap mutation of Sm1 resulted in highly penetrant hindlimb post-axial oligodacty and eye malations in mice. Loss of SM-1 function is the major cause of otho-acelic syndrome, with a conserved non-redundant function during ocular and limb development. SM-1 is a mammalian paralog of Drosophila Pentagone, an inhibitor of decapentaplegic, and functions as a Bone Morphogenic Protein antagonist in early embryogenesis. The loss of BMP antagonism during mammalian development explains the limb and eye phenotypes in humans and mice. A proportion of Sm1 homozygous mice have cleft palate, iris, and retinal coloboma, consistent with high expression of Sm1 in the developing pharyngeal arch. The study supports SM-1 as a major cause of oth-acelic syndrome, providing a plausible explanation for both limb and eye phenotypes in humans and mice.
Type 1 interferons restrict HIV replication by inducing the tripartite motif protein TRIM22, which acts as a key mediator. Transcriptional profiling identified TR22 as one of the most strongly up-regulated genes following interferon treatment. TR22 over-expression inhibits HIV replication, and its depletion using RNAi increases HIV particle release, indicating TR22 acts as an antiviral effector. TR22 inhibits budding of virus-like particles containing Gag, but not MLV or EIA Gag particles, suggesting Gag is the target. Inhibition is associated with diffuse cytoplasmic staining of HIV Gag rather than accumulation at the plasma membrane, indicating disrupted trafficking. Mutational analyses show catalytic amino acids Cys15 and C18 of the RING domain are required for TR22 antiviral activity. TR22 blocks late stages of assembly and release in the viral cycle, and its knockdown reverses inhibition induced by IFN treatment. TR22 expression blocks HIV-1 Gag particles release, dependent on the RING domain, and alters Gag localization, forming punctate structures at the plasma membrane. TR22 acts specifically on HIV Gag, not MLV or EIA Gag, and associates with HIV-1 Gag. These findings disclose a pathway by which Type 1 interferons obstruct HIV replication, with TR22 as an interferon inducible effector responsible for the late IFN block to HIV-1 replication.
Mutualisms between species, where both parties benefit, are challenging to explain as cheaters can outcompete cooperators, leading to instability. The fig-pollinator mutualism, where monoecious figs are pollinated by host-specific wasps, is a classic example. Female pollinating wasps oviposit into ovules inside the receptive sycon, with a documented segregation of pollinator galls in inner ovules and seeds in outer ovules across Ficus species. This pattern suggests wasps avoid or are prevented from ovipositing into outer ovules, resulting in mutual stability. However, mechanisms preventing wasps from exploiting outer ovules remain unknown. In Ficus rubosa, offspring in outer ovules are vulnerable to parasitic wasps that ovip from outside, decreasing towards the sycon center where inner ovules provide enemy-free space for pollinator offspring. This gradient in viability likely contributes to selection on pollinators to avoid outer ovules, forcing wasps to focus on a subset of ovules, reducing galling rates. This previously unidentified mechanism may contribute to mutual persistence, independent of plant defenses or physiological constraints. The majority of Ficus sycon receive enough foundresses to exploit more ovules than produce wasps, leaving seed production unexplained. Variance in floral morphology and parasitic wasp occurrence indicates potential for parasitic wasps to contribute to stability. The study shows pollinating wasps gain fitness by selecting inner ovules due to reduced parasitism, demonstrating the larger partner, the tree, controls resources available to the smaller partner.
Researchers conducted six controlled growth trials on an interspecific Setaria italica x Setaria viridis recombinant inbred line population to assess how genetic architecture of plant height is influenced by developmental cues, water availability, and planting density. The results show that plant height is reduced under water limitation and high planting density and affected by environment. Plant height is a heritable, polygenic trait with major loci that influence height independent of environment. The identity and contribution of loci that influence height changes throughout development and reduction in water-limited environments is due to delayed progression of the genetic program. Alleles from the weedy S. viridis parent increase plant height early, while domesticated S. itica parent alleles increase height later in development. Combining field and controlled analysis with quantitative genetics dissected genetic and environmental components of plant height, exhibiting strong genetic canalization but influenced by temporal and environmental factors. Seven QTL associated with plant height development were identified, with known height genes from Poaceae accounting for a fraction of loci. Organism growth is complex, influenced by genetic and environmental factors in time-dependent manner, and understanding interactions is critical for trait determination.
The Brazilian Pantanal wetlands host diverse wildlife and hematophagous arthropods, favoring zoonotic arbovirus circulation. A recent study in the Nheândia sub-region reported serological evidence of flaviviruses, including West Nile and Ilhe virus. To extend this, 3,234 mosquitoes of 16 species were collected and tested for infectious virus and flaviral RNA. A pool of 50 non-engorged Aedes scaplis females tested positive for Ilhe virus, indicating a minimum infection rate of 2.5 per 1000. Full-length genomic sequence exhibited 95% identity to the only available Ilhe genome. The data confirm Ilhe virus circulation in the Brazilian Pantanal. Neutralizing antibodies to flaviruses were detected in horses, but circulation was never confirmed by isolation until now. The isolation of Ilhe in mosquitoes, which efficiently transmit the virus, warrants investigation by the Brazilian arbovirus program and physicians. The high prevalence of neutralizing antibodies in horses and Ilhe isolation in mosquitoes confirm arvirus activity of medical importance in the region. Aedes scaplis, the most prevalent species identified, has anthropophilic behavior, high prevalence, and susceptibility to infection, implicating it as a potential vector. The study confirms Ilhe activity in the Nheândia sub-region through isolation from Aedes scaplis.
A preclinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of single-dose Moxidin (MO) compared to two-dose Ivermectin (IVM) in a porcine scabies model. Twelve pigs were randomly assigned to receive either MO (0.3mg/kg once), IV (0.2mg twice), or no treatment. Treatment efficacy was assessed by mite count, clinical lesions, pruritus, and ELISA-determined anti-S scabiei IgG antibodies. At day 14 post-treatment, all MO-treated pigs were mite-free with 100% efficacy, while only two IV-treated pigs were mite-free with 62% efficacy. Clinical lesions, pritus, and anti-S sciei IgG antibodies completely disappeared in all MO-treated pigs but only 75% of IV pigs. MO persisted 9 times longer in plasma and skin than IV, enabling long-lasting efficacy. Results demonstrate single-dose MO was more effective than two-dose IV, supporting MO as a potential therapeutic approach for scabies. The study used an optimized porcine scabies model, which developed clinical manifestations resembling human scabies, with lesions, pritus, and infection. Treatment commenced when mite counts rose above 100 and all pigs showed clinical signs of infection. MO is being developed as an alternative for onchocerciasis and considered for regulatory submission for human use, with further studies to investigate efficacy and dose selection in humans, including a Phase II trial for scabies elimination.
Staphylococcus aureus can survive with a minimal peptidoglycan synthesis machine but sacrifices virulence and antibiotic resistance. The bacterial peptidoglycan synthesis machine is responsible for the synthesis of the main component of the cell wall and is a target of many antibiotics. Researchers deleted seven of nine genes encoding peptidoglycan synthesis enzymes from the S. aureus genome without affecting normal growth or cell morphology, generating a strain capable of peptoglycan biosynthesis catalyzed by two penicillin-binding proteins, PBP1 and bi-functional PBP2. However, bacteria with minimal peptoglycan synthesis machinery became highly susceptible to cell-targeting antibiotics, host lytic enzymes, and displayed impaired virulence in a Drosophila infection model. S. aureus can grow and divide with only two peptoglycan synthesizing enzymes, showing most enzymes are redundant in vitro. The minimal peptoglycan machinery of S. aureus is important in environments other than in vitro as expendable synthesis enzymes play a role in pathogenicity and antibiotic resistance. A mutant S. aureus strain was generated by deleting seven known genes encoding proteins with peptoglycan activity, demonstrating the minimal machinery required for peoglycan synthesis. Results show S. aureus can synthesize peoglycan using two proteins, PBP1 and PBP, performing transpeptation and transglycosylation reactions. The strain encoding only PBP and PBP as peogcan enzymes was viable in rich and minimal medium. Deletion of seven peogcan synthesizing enzymes had little effect on viability, growth, morphology, or composition, but in vitro assays are insufficient to study pathogen fitness.
Burkholderia pseudomallei is a bacterium that can infect humans and cause melioidosis, a difficult-to-manage disease with high mortality rates. Despite proper diagnosis and treatment, mortality rates range from 20% in Australia to 40% in Thailand. To understand how B. pseudomallei infects and survives within hosts, researchers investigated the role of iron-acquisition systems, including siderophores and hemin uptake. Deletion of major siderophore mallein and pyochelin gene clusters in strain 171b revealed residual sideroph activity unrelated to known Burkholder siderophores. Deletion of hemin loci hmu and hem showed Hmu is required for utilization of hemin and hemoglobin. Prolonged incubation of hmu mutant in hemoglobin minimal medium yielded variants able to utilize hemoglobin and hemin, suggesting alternate pathways for iron utilization. Lacterrin utilization was dependent on malleactin, not pyochelin synthesis. A quadruple mutant could use ferritin as iron source and was lethal in acute murine melioid model. Data suggest B. pseudalle employ novel ferritin-iron pathway to sustain in vivo growth. Researchers found that loss of primary sideroph systems does not result in attenuation of virulence and B. pseudallei may adapt to acquire iron in absence of mallein by upregulating production of other sideroph or iron mechanisms.
Genome-scale constraint-based metabolic models provide comprehensive representations of cellular function, but their usability is often hindered by inconsistencies. COMMGEN, a tool for Consensus Metabolic GENeration, automatically identifies and resolves inconsistencies between concurrent models, consolidating knowledge of metabolic function. Tests on four organisms showed that automatically generated consensus models were predictive and increased coherence of representation. COMM reconciles two or more distinct models of the same organism, identifying similarities, dissimilarities, and complements of metabolic networks based on an extensive classification of problems and novel algorithms. Genome-scale metabolic models integrate bio-chemical entities, accounting for thousands of metabolites, reactions, and genes. Automatically generated consensus models have higher predictive power than manually curated models and comparable to manually constructed ones. COMM increases coherence with the biological system while maintaining predictive power, crucial for usability and reliability to elucidate cell interactions. The tool bridges automation and high-quality manual curation for consensus model generation, particularly useful for complex scenarios where manual curation does not scale, such as eukaryotic organisms, microbial communities, and host-pathogen interactions. COMM provides a necessary step towards accurate and comprehensive representations of metabolism, essential for understanding cellular function.
Researchers investigated the role of cartilage matrix in controlling the timing of endochondral ossification by inhibiting chondrocyte maturation using zebrafish mutants. Mutations in fam20 and xylosyltransfer1 (xt1) genes, which encode proteoglycan synthesis enzymes, resulted in decreased cartilage matrix and increased perichral bone formation. The mutants failed to produce wild-type levels of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, leading to precocious chondrocy maturation and early expression of markers such as runx2, collagen 10a1, and ihh. Ultrastructural analyses demonstrated aberrant matrix organization and early cellular features of chrocy hypertrophy. The study revealed that cartilage proteoglycans inhibit chondrocy maturation, dictating the timing of perichral bone development. The findings suggest that defective cartilage synthesis alters expression of transcription factors determining chrocy maturation rates, changing perich bone formation timing. Mutations in fam20 and xyl1 primarily accelerated chrocy maturation and ih expression, triggering early per bone formation. Biochemical and histochemical analyses confirmed defects in chondroit sulfate proteoglycan production, and rescue experiments supported the notion that mutant chrocy undergo precocious maturation, inducing per bone formation. Overall, cartilage defects in fam20 and xyl1 mutants accelerated chro maturation, leading to early per bone formation.
Researchers investigated the role of Topoisomerase II in the separation of heterochromatic regions during meiosis in Drosophila melanaster females. Topoisomerase II knockdown by RNAi in later stages of meiosis resulted in defects in the separation of heterochromatic regions after spindle assembly, with heterochromatic regions failing to separate during prometaphase and metaphase I. Heterochromatic regions were stretched into abnormal projections with centromeres localizing near the tips in some oocytes. Bipolar spindles were observed in most Top2 RNAi-expressing oocytes, but achiasmate 4 chromosomes failed to move towards the poles during promaphase, and both achias and chias chromosomes displayed bioration defects. Euchromatic regions separated normally as they separate earlier in prophase. Embryos from Top2 RNAi-express females failed to initiate mitotic divisions. Data suggest Topoisomerase II is involved in resolving heterochromatic DNA entanglements during meiosis, which must be resolved to complete meiosis. Top2 plays a role in releasing bonds holding heterochromatic regions together during prophase, and its absence leads to missegregation of chias and achias chromosomes. Immunofluorescence analysis with α-tubulin and histone 3 phosphorylated at serine 10 marked meiotic spindles and DNA threads connecting achmate chromosomes, confirming Top2's role in resolving homologous entanglements in Drosila oocytes.
A field study was conducted in a highly endemic area in Brazil to evaluate the effectiveness of deltamethrin-impregnated collars in controlling and preventing canine visceral leishmaniasis. The study involved two areas, an intervention area where seronegative dogs were collared and a control area with conventional control measures. At baseline, seropositive dogs were removed, and seronegative dogs were included. Dogs were reevaluated every 7-8 months for two years, with new collars given to seronegative dogs and newly identified seronegative dogs collared. Significant reductions in seroprevalence were seen in both areas at the second evaluation, with 6% in the intervention area and 11% in the control at the final evaluation. The relative risk indicated protection against canine visceral leishias in the intervention area. Although incidence did not differ between areas, an increase was observed in the control, possibly due to low seroconversion or loss to follow-up. The study suggests deltamrin-impregnated collars provide protection over time, representing an operational challenge for local zoon control, requiring adjustments including improved design. Previous studies in Italy and Iran showed reduced seroconversion rates using deltamrin-impregnated collars, differing from the principal vector in Brazil. This study included a control area, focusing on the general canine population, evaluating collar use with euthanasia of seropos animals in a highly endemic area.
The X chromosome in mammals has a non-random gene content, which may be shaped by limits on gene expression due to haploid expression. If the X chromosome is transcribed at comparable rates to the ancestral rate prior to its formation, it is not a tolerable for genes with high maximal levels of expression due to transcriptional jams. Analysis of data from the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements and Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome projects shows that maximal expression of X-linked genes is lower than autosomal genes, with an average of 87 versus 261 tags per million. Autosome-to-X retroposition events are associated with lower expression of retrogenes on the X, while X-linked genes have lesser increase in expression compared to autosomal ones if highly expressed. Highly expressed tissue-specific genes are rare on the X and broadly expressed genes tend to be lowly expressed, indicating the trend is shaped by maximal level not breadth. Tissues with highly expressed genes, such as secretory tissues, have relatively rare expression on the X. The limit on maximal expression explains many features of X's gene content, expression, and evolution, providing a simple rationale for its peculiarities.
Researchers investigated the prevalence and population structure of Helicobacter pylori in Baka Pygmies in Cameroon, anticipating the presence of ancient H. pylori lineages within hunter-gatherer populations. Gastric biopsies were obtained from 77 Baka and 101 non-Baka individuals and cultured for H. pylori, revealing a significantly lower infection rate among Baka (20.8%) compared to non-Baka (80.2%). Multilocus haplotypes were generated, but no Baka-specific lineages were identified, with most isolates assigned to hpAfrica or hpNE. Population hpAfrica was divided into East and Central African subpopulations, while a new hpAfrica subpopulation supported eastern and western expansions of Bantu languages. An age-structured model showed low H. pylori prevalence among Baka is achievable within a few hundred years, suggesting demographic factors like small size and low life expectancy can lead to eradication. Coalescent simulations and phylogenetic inference indicated Baka acquired extant H. pylori through contact with agricultural neighbors. H. pylori prevalence was analyzed in 178 Cameroonians, including 77 Baka and 101 non-Baka, by culture from gastric mucosal biopsies obtained esophagogroduodenoscopy. High prevalence was found in non-Baka, concordant with infection rates in Cameroon patients and asymatically infected individuals, while Baka infection rate was significantly lower and consistent between two sampling locations. The study suggests Baka were either H. pylori-free or lost ancient lineages during demographic fluctuations, acquiring extant H. pylori through contact with agricultural neighbors within the past 3-6 years.
The C-terminal 18 amino acid region of Dengue virus NS5 regulates its subcellular localization and contains a conserved arginine residue essential for infectious virus production. Dengue virus NS5 is responsible for capping, methylation, and replication of the flavivirus genome and interactions with host proteins modulate immune responses. The C-terminal 18 residues of NS5 direct the protein to the cytoplasm or nucleus, with low micromolar binding affinity between NS5 C18 and nuclear receptor importin-alpha allowing molecular complex purification and visualization at 2.2 Å resolution. Structure-guided mutational analysis reveals residues important for NS subcell localization, with proline 884 allowing proper presentation for binding and mutation to threonine resulting in mislocalization to cytoplasm without compromising virus fitness. A single mutation to alanine at NS position 888 results in non-viable virus, while R888K leads to attenuated phenotype, with R888 forming hydrogen bond with Y838 conserved in flaviviruses. Data suggests evolutionarily conserved function for NS C18 possibly in RNA interactions critical for replication independent of subcell localization. The C-terminal region in thumb subdomain with priming loop may initiate de novo RNA synthesis. A motif within C18 of NS5 is determinant for differential subcell localization, with single amino change resulting altered phenotype. The C18 of D2 and D3 NS interacts with importins targeting protein to nucleus, while D1 NS may bind other host factors and is mostly cytoplasmic.
A novel integrated mapping protocol, known as the Integrated Threshold Mapping (IT) methodology, has been developed and field-tested for neglected tropical diseases including lymphatic filariasis, trachoma, schistosomiasis, and soil-transmitted helminths. The protocol aims to determine if a threshold for public health intervention has been reached and relies on World Health Organization recommended indicators for disease-specific age groups. Field testing was conducted in one district in Mali and Senegal, comparing IT methodology with current WHO methodologies for each disease. Results showed IT reached same conclusions as WHO methodologies for trachoma and soil-transmitted helminths but resulted in more targeted recommendations for schistosomias. IT demonstrated practicality, feasibility, and overall cost savings compared to standard non-integrated methodologies. IT uses age-specific disease indicators as recommended by WHO and does not provide prevalence figures, its purpose is to balance epidemiologic rigor and practicality for Ministries of Health in NTD-endemic countries to launch disease-specific interventions. Limitations were encountered, including convenience sampling for schistomiasis and trach mapping and lack of independent gold standard comparison. Despite this, IT could facilitate implementation of much-needed programs in endemic countries by providing district level data in timely manner.
Researchers have identified a novel requirement for histone modifications in the release of the mitotic regulator Cdc14 from nucleolar chromatin in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The phosphatase Cdc14 is anchored to nucleolar chromatin by Cfi/Net1 until anaphase and is released into the nucleoplasm through two redundant pathways, FEAR and MEN. Analysis revealed that ubiquination of histone H2B by Bre1 ubiquitin ligase is necessary for Cdc release when MEN is inactivated. This function is mediated by histone H3 methylation on lysines 4 and 79 but not dependent on histone deacetylase Sir2. Defects in C14 release were observed in cells lacking H3 lysine 36 methylation and histone deacetylase recruited by this modification. These histone modifications are required for accessibility and action of FEAR components on nucleolar chromatin. The non-redundant role of these modifications contrasts the notion of a combinatorial code of histone marks controlling biological processes. The study provides evidence for a role of conserved ubiquitin ligase Bre1 and monoubiquination of histone H2 in early mitotic exit and demonstrates a requirement for histone ubiquination in C14 release during anaphase without MEN activity. All known methylation marks on histone H3 play a role in this process, suggesting their conserved function in controlling C14 localization from yeast to mammals.
Researchers have developed GeneProgram, a novel unsupervised computational framework based on Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes to identify expression programs, sets of co-expressed genes orchestrating normal or pathological processes, and characterize their functional breadth. GeneProgram addresses challenges such as cellular inhomogeneity, genetic variation, and uncertainty in numbers of programs and sample populations, and temporal behavior. The framework uses expression data to organize tissues into groups and genes into overlapping programs with consistent temporal behavior, producing maps of programs sorted by generality scores. GeneProgram outperformed popular analysis methods in synthetic and real expression data and was applied to a compendium of 62 time-series gene datasets exploring human responses to infectious agents and immune-modulating molecules. A map of 104 expression programs was produced, with a substantial number enriched for genes involved in key pathways and bound by NF-κB transcription factors. GeneProgram discovered programs implicating signaling pathways and receptor types, including Wnt signaling and neurotransmitter, in response to infection. The map may guide future experiments, with low generality score genes serving as potential new targets and high generality genes maintaining physiological responses in disease states. GeneProgram is multipurpose and can be applied to novel compia of biological data, providing automatic grouping and expression generality scores to aid interpretation.
Human cytomegalovirus infection drives epigenetic imprinting of the IFNγ locus in NKG2Chi natural killer cells. Memory type 1 helper cells are characterized by stable expression of interferon-γ and epigenetic imprinting of the IFN locus. Among innate cells, NK cells play a crucial role in defense against cytomegalovirus and represent the main source of interferon-γ. NKGChi cells expanded in human cytomegalovirus seropositive individuals underwent epetic remodeling of the IF conserved non-coding sequence, similar to memory CD8 T cells or TH1 cells. The accessibility of this region enhances interferon transcriptional activity in response to NKG and 2B engagement, leading to consistent interferon production in NKGChi cells. Epigenic imprinting of the IF locus is a hallmark and crucial mechanism driving strong interferon expression in cytgalovirus-specific cell expansions, providing a basis for regulation of adaptive features in innate cells. Epigen remodeling of the conserved non-coding sequence is a hallmark of NKGChi cells and cytokine-primed cells, sharing an open configuration with TH1 cells. This region acts as an enhancer of interferon transcription in TH1, especially in response to TCR triggering. Epigen regulation contributes to high interferon competence and stability in NK cells displaying memory properties, with broader epigen remodeling accompanying adaptive features induced by inflammatory and pathogen cues.
Legionella pneumophila exploits the host proteome to temporally regulate effector function through a novel mechanism involving an effector protein called LubX, which acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to target the bacterial effector SidH for degradation. Delayed delivery of LubX to the host cytoplasm leads to the shutdown of SidH within host cells at later stages of infection. This demonstrates a sophisticated level of coevolution between eukaryotic cells and L. pneumila involving an effector that functions as a key regulator to temporally coordinate the function of a cognate effector protein. The temporal regulation of Sid mediated by L. pneumila LubX E3 ligase and the host proteasome illustrates a novel mechanism by which bacterial effectors are regulated. LubX acts as a negative regulator of Sid within host cells and is the first example of a bacterial effector that targets and regulates a cognate effector within host cells, designated as a "metaeffector". The determinants of susceptibility are encoded in effectors, with L. pneumila Sid being an intrinsically stable within host cells and LubX controlling its instability by targeting for ubiquination. Lub represents a bona fide metaeffector regulating the function of another effector within the host. The targets of bacterial E3 ligases remain largely unknown, with Sid being the first example of a bacterial target of a bacterial E3 ligase effector, suggesting some effectors may possess regulatory functions as metaeffector to coordinate expression spatiotemporally.
Researchers investigated the diversification of HIV-1 env sequences in 81 early subtype infections to understand the host and immune responses experienced by the newly transmitted virus. By analyzing sequences from acutely infected hosts, they found evidence of adaptive evolution and identified 24 rapidly diversifying codon sites, 14 of which were clustered in CTL epitopes or had APOEC-mediated G-A substitutions. Ten sites could not be explained by CTL or APOEC hypermutation, including the most mutated site in the fusion peptide gp41. The study also examined insertions and deletions, finding that length variation in hypervariable regions is a consequence of selection, not mutational hotspots. The results highlight the role of CTL escape and hypermutation in shaping viral evolution during new infections. A model of codon evolution was fitted to 2,207 env sequences, showing purifying selection at most sites and indels, but also a subset diversifying more rapidly than expected under neutral evolution. Knowledge of the infecting virus enabled discrimination of mutation direction and distinction between insertions and deletions. The study underscores the importance of CTL escape in early infection but does not discount potential antibody escape contribution to env evolution. The findings provide a detailed view of HIV-1 diversification following transmission, highlighting the role of immune responses in shaping viral evolution during establishment of new infections.
A minimal model of epigenetic silencing in budding yeast has been introduced and analyzed, incorporating two key chromatin marks, H4 acetylation and H3 methylation, to explore the role of multiple marks in epigenetic silencing and emergence of a stable bivalent chromatin state. The model identifies epigen marks essential for bistability of epetic states and shows that having both modifications is important for robustness of epetic silencing. A novel bivalent state with both active and silencing marks emerges under certain perturbations, such as knock-out mutations or inhibition of enzymatic activity, resulting in patchy silencing. The titration effect due to limited supply of silencing proteins can result in counter-intuitive responses. The design of the silencing system is systematically investigated, assessing disparate observations within a single framework, including behavior of Sir protein recruitment and stability of silenced regions in commonly-studied mutants, illuminating the role of Dot1 in yeast silencing biology. The model captures mechanisms of cooperativity at the molecular level, including histone modification and protein interactions, and can be extended to include other silencing and active marks, informing which are essential in resolving epigen fate and reinforcing one over another.
Severe acute malnutrition remains a major health problem in developing countries, manifesting in oedematous and non-oedemat forms. The pathogenesis of both types in children is unknown, but gut microbiota dysbiosis has been linked to oedous malnutrition. This study assessed gut microbiota composition in Ugandan children with oedous and non-oedemat severe acute malnutrition. Fecal samples from 87 children aged 6-24 months were analyzed using PCR, Denaturing Gradient Electrophoresis, and 16S rRNA-targeted high-throughput sequencing. Results showed gut microbiota composition differed between the two groups, with non-oedemat children having lower alpha diversity. However, beta analysis revealed no compositional differences between oedemat and noned groups. Non-oemat children had lower gut microbiota diversity compared to oedemat children. Previous studies suggest a link between gut microbiota and malnutrition, with predominance of pathogenic bacteria in malnourished children. Transplanting fecal samples from malnourished twins into germ-free mice demonstrated a relationship between malnutrition and gut microbiota. This study's findings justify further research into therapeutic strategies, such as pre and probiotics, for severe acute malnutrition in children in developing countries, where it accounts for 12.6% of deaths under 5 years.
Researchers investigated telomere length variation in 112 wild-type Saccharomyces sensu stricto isolates and found extensive variation in S. paradoxus isolates, with European strains having shorter telomeres (<150 bp) and American isolates having longer teleres (>400 bp). Insertion of the URA3 gene near telomeres allowed analysis of individual telere lengths and telere position effect. Crossing American and European strains resulted in F1 spores with a continuum of telere lengths, suggesting multiple quantitative trait loci involvement. Variation in telere length and silencing was quantitative and weakly correlated. Genotyping F1 segregants identified several quantitative trait loci associated with telere length and silencing, including candidate genes and regions with no known involvement in telomeric properties. Transgressive segregation was detected for both phenotypes. YK80 and TLC1 were validated as telere-length quantitative trait loci in two S. paradoxus subpopulations. Sequence divergence in the Ku heterodimer generates negative epistasis in one allelic combinations, resulting in very short telomeres. The study reveals telere length is a complex trait controlled by multiple loci, consistent with previous findings in S. cerevisiae, worm, mouse, plant, and human species, with over 150 genes altering telere length, including telerase, Rap1, yKu, Mre11, Pifp, and Cdc.
Researchers investigated the cognitive and neural processes underlying human decision-making, focusing on the prediction of when people choose, in addition to how they choose. Sequential sampling models assume decisions emerge from a bounded evidence accumulation process, making response times predictable. However, a difficulty arises when individuals are not forced to respond immediately but can sample information sequentially, allowing them to delay and terminate the accumulation process. Studies using electroencephalography and functional magnetic imaging data showed standard models did not adequately describe response time distributions, but adding a mechanism for postponing decisions improved the fit. Time-frequency analysis revealed alternating states of increasing and decreasing oscillatory power in beta frequencies, indicating responses were prepared and inhibited, supporting the existence of a decision to not decide. The extended model accounted for results in an adapted paradigm where participants pressed a button for more information. The findings demonstrate computational modeling of decisions and response times supports a deeper understanding of hidden dynamics in cognition. Factors such as cue number, variability, and presentation time influence decision postponement. The study established computational evidence for a hidden choice mechanism reflected in a specific oscillatory pattern, providing insight into decision-making processes.
Researchers have identified a mutation in the SUV39H2 gene as the cause of Hereditary Nasal Parakeratosis (HN) in Labrador Retrievers, a skin disorder characterized by crusts and fissures on the nasal planum. A genome-wide association study of 13 HN cases and 23 controls revealed a strong signal on chromosome 2, which was narrowed down to a 1.6 Mb interval with 25 genes. Resequencing and genotyping identified a missense variant in SUVH2 encoding histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K) methyltransferase, which mediates chromatin silencing. The variant changes an evolutionary conserved asparagine to lysine in the enzyme's catalytic domain. Histopathological analysis showed HN is not caused by hyperproliferation but delayed differentiation of keratinocytes. SUVH2 is involved in epigen regulation of kerocyte differentiation ensuring proper stratification and sealing of mammalian epidermis. Clinical symptoms of HN are restricted to epidermis of nasal planum, possibly due to tissue-specific expression of redundant H3K methylases. HN affected dogs develop crusts and fissuring at young age but are otherwise healthy. Immunofluores staining showed changes compatible with earlier descriptions. The study suggests SUV39H2 plays a role in epigenetic regulation of kerocyte differentiation.
Researchers investigated the emergence of transmissible reassortant influenza viruses in swine co-infected with avian and swine influenza A viruses. Genomic analysis of 571 isolates from co-housed pigs identified 30 distinct genotypes of reassortants, with the largest diversity found in lower respiratory tract viruses. Reassortants from lower tracts had the largest variations in growth kinetics in respiratory epithelial cells, and temperature in swine nasal cells selected the type of reassant shed. One reassant was consistently identified in upper, middle, and lower respiratory tissues and transmitted efficiently between pigs. Findings suggest genetic reassments occur in the lower respiratory tract and tissue tropism selects transmissible reassant. Feral swine may serve as an intermediate host generating reassort viruses with avian and swine genes to domestic swine and humans. Housing IAV-seronegative pigs with HN2AV and avian H1 IAV-oculated pigs showed reassants generated in lower tracts but few were shed, with tissue tropism key to selecting shedable reassant virus. Thirty of 254 reassant genotypes between avian H1 and swine H2 were detected, mostly in middle and lower tracts, with compatibility between viruses subtype and strain-dependent. Results indicate tissue tropism presents bottleneck for reassment and selects shed viruses.
A study examined the effects of maternal Schistosoma mansoni infection and praziquantel treatment during pregnancy on Schistoma mansoni infection and immune responsiveness among offspring at age five years. Offspring of Schistoma mansoni-infected women in schosomiasis-endemic areas may be sensitized in-utero, influencing their immune responsiveness to schosome infection and schosomiasis-associated morbidity. The study found no evidence that maternal S. mans infection and its treatment during pregnancy influence prevalence and intensity of S. mans infection or effector response to S. mans infection among offspring at five years. However, prazantel treatment of S. mans during pregnancy had an effect on IL-10 responses to SWA, which was higher in offspring of women who received prazantel during pregnancy than those who did not. Cytokine and antibody responses to SWA and SEA, and FoxP expression were higher among infected than uninfected children. The study suggests maternal S. mans and treatment during pregnancy may affect immunoregulatory responsiveness in childhood schosomiasis, which might have implications for pathogenesis of the disease. No conclusive evidence of an effect of maternal schosomiasis or its treatment on susceptibility to S mans infection in children was found.
Inflammatory stimuli reprogram macrophage endocytic machinery from receptor-mediated phagocytosis to macinocytosis, allowing rapid transfer of internalized cargo to lysosomes in a receptor-independent manner. This reprogramming occurs through protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of macrophage coronin 1, activating phosphoinositol 3-kinase necessary for macinocytic uptake. Expression of a phosphomimetic form of coronin 1 induces PI3-kinase activation and macinocytosis even in the absence of inflammatory stimuli. Upon macroage activation, serine phosphorylation of coronin 1 is the molecular switch that reprograms macrophage from phagocytic mode to macinocytosis, enabling internalization of large amounts of cargo for direct transfer to lysosomes. Phosphorylation of coron 1 is sufficient to redirect phagytic cargo via macinocytosis to lysosomes, even without inflammatory stimuli. Induction of macinocytosis through cytokine-mediated macroage activation is a strategy for immune defense to eradicate pathogenic material, providing a way to clear large amounts of extracellular material and avoid silencing inflammatory responses associated with receptor-mediated phagocytic pathways. This mechanism regulates internalization and degradation of infectious material during inflammation, offering a novel understanding of how macrophage activation is coupled to clearance of pathogens.
A qualitative study was conducted in Arua District, North Uganda, to assess community acceptance of tset baits, a method for controlling tse flies that transmit sleeping sickness. The study involved 16 focus group discussions with male and female participants in eight villages, where tse control had or had not been previously been conducted. Results showed varying perceptions of tse baits between villages, with those unfamiliar with them expressing fear and anxiety, associating them with witchcraft and illness, while those with prior exposure had positive attitudes and understanding of their purpose. The difference in acceptance was attributed to duration of experience with tse control programs. Previous studies have shown community acceptance is crucial for effective tse control, with negative attitudes leading to damage and vandalism of traps. The study highlights the importance of early community engagement and sensitization for successful interventions, particularly in areas new to tse control. Sleeping sickness, caused by Trypanosoma brucei transmitted by tse, affects humans and livestock, with significant economic losses estimated at US$4 billion. The study's findings suggest community-based interventions require tailored approaches to address local perceptions and experiences for effective tse control.
Researchers have generated a high-resolution description of genomic and population variation in recombination in Drosophila melanaster, distinguishing between crossing over and gene conversion, two outcomes of meiotic recombination. By genotyping 139 million SNPs and mapping 106,964 recombination events at a resolution of 2 kilobases, whole-genome maps of crossing over and gene conversion rates were created. Results show extreme and punctuated variation in crossing over rates along chromosomes with hot and coldspots, and extensive intra-specific variation associated with hotspots at low frequency. Gene conversion rates are more uniformly distributed and detectable in regions with reduced or absent crossing over. Recombination events are associated with sequence motifs and occur within transcript regions, suggesting chromatin accessibility favors double-strand breaks. The study underscores the potential for selection to act on recombination modifiers and alter the landscape of recombination across the genome. The findings highlight the need to account for multiple layers of variation in recombination to obtain accurate estimates and inform new population genetic models of interaction between selection and linkage. The high-resolution maps provide insight into intra-specific variation at 250-kb resolution, with over 106,000 recombination events mapped at a median distance of less than 2kb to the nearest SNP.
Researchers have identified ID2 and its paralogs, ID1 and ID2, as components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation machinery in Arabidopsis thaliana. The coiled-coil domain of ID2 is essential for homodimerization, while the XH domain is required for interaction with ID1 and ID2. ID1 is necessary for de novo methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional silencing, whereas ID2 has partially overlapping roles with ID1. Unlike ID2, ID1 and ID2 cannot bind double-stranded RNA, suggesting distinct roles in the ID2-ID1/ID2 complex. The ID2 XH domain is crucial for ID2 function in RNA-directed methylation and transcriptional silencing. ID2 interacts with itself via the coiled-coil and with ID1 and ID2 via the XH domain. ID1 and ID2 belong to a different subfamily from ID2 and its homologs. The ID2-ID1/ID2 complex is required for the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway, with ID1 and ID2 playing essential roles in de novo methylation, siRNA accumulation, and transcriptional silencing. Mutations in the ID2 XH domain result in failure to complement DNA methylation defects, demonstrating its importance for ID2 function in RNA-directed methylation and transcriptional silencing in vivo.
Exposure to Leishmania braziliensis triggers neutrophil activation and apoptosis. Neutrophils are the first line of defense against invading pathogens and are rapidly recruited to the sites of Leishmania inoculation. Inoculation of serum-opsonized L braziliensis promastigotes in mice induced neutil accumulation in vivo, peaking at 24 hours. In vitro exposure of thyoglycollate-elic inflammatory or bone marrow neutils to L brazili modulated the expression of surface molecules and induced the oxidative burst. Neutroph activation following contact with L brazili was confirmed by release of TNFα and neutil elastase. Neutrophils infected with L brazili displayed markers of early apoptosis. L brazili induces neutil recruitment in vivo and neutils exposed to the parasite in vitro respond through activation and release of inflammatory mediators. This outcome may impact parasite elimination, particularly at early stages of infection. Neutroph infiltration to the site of L brazili inoculation was confirmed and maximal accumulation at 24 hours. Serum-opsonized L brazili induced significant increase in production of superoxide, hallmark of neutil activation, and ROS detection was higher in infected neutils. Co-culture of infected macrophages and neutils induced parasite killing, and co-inoculation of Lili and neutils decreased lesion size, whereas depletion of neutils increased parasite load.
Vaccination for bovine tuberculosis in cattle is not currently not used in international control programs due to interference with the tuberculin skin test. New diagnostic tests that differentiate infected from vaccinated animals offer potential for vaccination introduction into existing programs. Researchers used within-herd transmission models from Great Britain to explore the feasibility of supplemental vaccination, finding that specificity of the test is the greatest barrier to herd-level benefit under intensive testing. A specificity of at least 99.85% and sensitivity of >40% is required for protective vaccination without increased risk of missed infection. Data suggests this target could be achieved using a cocktail of antigens, maintaining sensitivity of 73.3% relative to post-mortem detection. The economic impact of bovine tuberculosis is dominated by testing and movement restrictions, and farmers' willingness to adopt vaccination requires reduction of both infection burden and restrictions. Relaxation of testing could mitigate negative effects but increase hidden infection in officially free herds. Researchers estimated the range of test characteristics necessary for protective vaccination, considering epidemiological and economic costs, including condemned reactors, tests, and infected animals left after restrictions. The use of BCG vaccination with DIVA testing may provide benefits relative to current tuberc testing regimes.
Researchers have identified a new class of anthelmintic compounds, dihydrobenz[e][1,4]oxepin-2(3)-ones, effective against Trichuris parasites, which infect approximately 500 million people worldwide. Using Trichuris muris as a model, a library of 480 small molecules was screened for paralysis of adult parasites, leading to the discovery of 20 active dihydrozoxepinones with EC50 values comparable to existing anthelmintic levamisole. These compounds show low cytotoxicity against murine epithelial cells, demonstrating selectivity for the parasite. Dihydrozepinone O029 reduces the ability of embryonated Tris eggs to establish infection in the host in vivo. The dihydrozepinones are a new class of anthintics active against both egg and adult stages of Trichis parasites, demonstrating encouraging selectivity and scope for further optimisation to improve potency and pharmacokinetic properties for clinical development. A total of 192 dihydrozepinones were tested, with 20 showing activity confirmed through resynthesis, allowing understanding of molecular features important for activity against the parasite. Developing a pharmaceutical for trichiasis is an economic and practical challenge, but dihydrozepones offer an alternative strategy, acting in the environment to interrupt the parasite lifecycle, potentially via a spray. The discovery of dihydrozepones provides a new lead for anthintic development against Trichis parasites, with potential for optimisation to improve potency and pharmacokinetic properties for clinical use.
Researchers re-examined the concept of "date" and "party" hubs in protein-protein interaction networks, where date hubs display low co-expression with partners and party hubs have high co-expression. However, the study found that the importance of date hubs to network connectivity can be attributed to a tiny subset of extremely central hubs that do not display low correlation, undermining the idea of a link between this quantity and hub function. The date/party distinction was motivated by an approximately bimodal distribution of hub-expression, but this feature is not robust to methodological changes. Topological properties of hubs do not correlate with co-expression, yet interaction centrality correlates with functional similarity of interacting proteins. The division of hubs into date and party categories appears susceptible to changes in data and methods, and observed differences in network vulnerability arise from a small number of important hubs. The attributed properties of date and party hubs do not correspond with estimated topological roles, which are more diverse than explained by a simple dichotomy. The study suggests conceiving roles for protein-protein interactions rather than individual proteins, as thinking in terms of date/party dichotomy may not be meaningful.
Researchers have developed methodologies to reconstruct transmission trees in infectious disease outbreaks from whole genome sequence data, but a limitation is the requirement for genetic diversity to arise on epidemiological timescales. To address this, the concept of 'transmission divergence' is introduced, defined as the number of mutations separating whole sequences from transmission pairs. Simulations using literature parameters estimated transmission divergence for ten major outbreak-causing pathogens, finding low mean values with many outbreaks characterized by genetically identical pairs. The impact on reconstructing outbreaks using tools, R and phybreak, showed genetic data from rapidly evolving pathogens like RNA viruses provide valuable transmission information, while data from pathogens with low transmission divergence, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Clostridium difficile, provide little information. Results highlight limitations of genetic data in certain scenarios and the need to integrate other epidemiological data. Transmission divergence depends on genomic and epidemiological factors and can be estimated from a transmission tree by determining mutations between pathogen samples of known pairs. The study evaluated the informativeness of genetic data with respect to the underlying tree, varying across methods, and introduced'mission divergence' as a measure for reconstructing chains during infectious outbreaks.
Researchers analyzed allele-specific expression and chromatin structure of X-linked genes in mouse tissues and cells to identify genes that escape X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) and explore regulatory mechanisms. A binomial model assessed allelic expression, demonstrating a continuum between silencing and expression from the inactive X. Allele-specific RNA polymerase II occupancy and DNase hypersensitivity correlated with escape levels, consistent with an open chromatin structure at escape genes. Few genes, approximately 3-7%, escape XCI in mouse tissues, suggesting stringent silencing and escape controls. In contrast, an in vitro embryonic-kid-derived Pats cell line showed a higher density of escape genes, 21%, representing kidney-specific and cell-specific genes. Allele-specific CTCF binding on the Xi clustered escape genes was denser in brain, contributing to a compartmentalized structure and fewer escape genes. Surveys showed 8-15% human genes consistently escape XCI, 10-13% display variable levels, and 10-20% vary between cell lines. Escape results in sex dimorphisms and bi-alle expression is crucial for a normal phenotype in females. Mouse tissues have 3-7% escape genes, potentially exceptional compared to other mammals, while Pki cells have more escape, possibly due to epigenetic changes or cell properties. Escape genes are distributed along the X, rarely clustered, and distance from XIC does not influence expression, playing roles in transcription and translation, dosage-sensitive, explaining consistent escape in tissues and identifying tissue-specific genes for understanding sex differences.
Researchers have characterized a novel cysteine protease, Vivapain-4, from Plasmodium vivax, a parasite responsible for hundreds of millions of malaria cases worldwide. Vivapain-4 exhibits dual substrate specificity depending on pH, hydrolyzing certain substrates at acidic pH 5.5 and others at neutral pH 6.5-7.5. It prefers positively charged amino acids and Gln at the P1 position, with less specificity at P3 and P4. The enzyme is localized in the food vacuoles and cytoplasm of the erythrocytic stage of P. vivax, showing activity against actin at neutral pH, P. viv plasmepsin 4 at neutral/acidic pH, and hemoglobin at acidic pH. Vivain-4 demonstrates pH-dependent substrate switching, potentially allowing efficient cleavage of different substrates in various environments. It may function as a hemase in the acidic vacuole, maturase of P. viv plasm 4 at neutral/acidic pH, or cytoskeleton-degrading protease in the erythrocyte cytosol. Three amino acids in the S2 pocket differ from Viv-2 and Viv-3. Replacement of Glu180 abolishes activity against a substrate at neutral pH, indicating its importance in pH-dependent preference. Comprehensive studies of P. viv cysteine proteases have been hindered by inability to culture P. vivax, but identification and characterization of these enzymes can help investigate biological roles and targets for antimalarial drugs.
Researchers have developed a novel genome-scale model of metabolism and macromolecular synthesis for the acetogen Clostridium ljungdahli, a microorganism capable of fermenting a broad range of substrates, including H2/CO2 syngas, making it ideal for biotechnological production. The model, named iL965-ME, captures major metabolic, amino acid, nucleotide, lipid, cofactor, and vitamin pathways, as well as RNA and protein synthesis, broadening predictability of microbial biology. The model predicts protein allocation and media influence on metabolic pathways and energy conservation, accurately predicting secretion of multiple fermentation products, including acetate, ethanol, and glycerol. It also predicts overflow metabolism, enabling new strategies such as glycerol formation, broadening metabolic capabilities. Experimental validation of secretion rates based on metal availability provides insights into fermentation optimization, proteome utilization, and carbon flux. The model includes updated cofactors and mechanisms for energy conservation, allowing exploration of cofactor requirements. Accurate turnover rates for enzymes were approximated, and coupling constraints linking macromolecular costs with reactions were calculated. The model sheds light on autotrophic growth, where proton export is coupled to ferredin oxidation and NAD reduction by the Rnf complex, advancing understanding of acetogen physiology and enabling design strategies for biotechnological production.
Researchers utilized a panel of human osteoblasts to conduct a transcriptomic survey, similar to studies in lymphoblast cell lines, to assign biological relevance to genetic signals identified in genome-wide association studies. The distinct nature of osteoblasts and lymphoblasts is reflected by preferential grouping of cell-specific genes within biologically and functionally relevant pathways unique to each type. Cis-association analysis with genotypes identified genetic variations of transcript isoforms, indicating differential expression in osteoblasts is partly controlled by cis-regulatory variants. Isoforms are regulated by variants in tissue-specific and tissue-independent fashion, confirmed by RT-PCR validation. Multiple isoforms are often present in both tissues, with genetic control affecting relative expression of one isoform to another. Examination of top SNPs from genome-wide association studies of bone density showed overlap with probeset associations in this study, with the top hit corresponding to FAM118 gene revealing a novel isoform variant. Comparing osteoblasts and lymphoblasts, RT-PCR replication of many isoform variants in osteoblasts suggests a proportion of variation is common between cell types. Allele-specific expression of isoforms in osteoblasts but not lymphoblasts identified unique isoforms potentially important in osteoblasts. Top pathways under genetic control include Wnt/β-caten signaling and IGF-1 pathways. The study suggests examining transcriptome variation in multiple tissue types is useful for detecting genetic variation common to cell types and identifying cell-specific isoform variants functionally relevant for genome association studies.
Saccharomyces eubus, the non-Saccharomyces cerevisiae parent of lager-brewing Saccharomyces pastorian, cannot utilize the α-tri-glucoside maltotriose, a major carbohydrate in brewer's wort. Researchers studied the evolvability of maltotri utilization in Saccharomy eubus CBS123T by subjecting maltose-assimilating mutants to laboratory evolution in carbon-limited chemostat cultures on maltose-enriched wort. An evolved strain showed improved maltose and maltotri fermentation, and whole-genome sequencing revealed a novel mosaic SeMALT413 gene resulting from repeated introgressions by non-reciprocal translocation of at least three SeMALT genes. The predicted structure of SeM413 was comparable to the original SeM transporters, but overexpression of SeM413 enabled growth on maltotri, indicating neofunctionalization occurred. The mosaic structure of SeM413 resembles the structure of Saccharomy pastorian maltose-transporter SpMT1, which has high sequence identity to Saccharomyces MAL1, Sacparadox MAL1, and Sac eubusM3. The evolution of the maltotri transporter in hybrid Sacchar pastus lager-brew strains likely involved mechanisms similar to those observed in the study, suggesting laboratory evolution can lead to emergence of maltose utilization in Sac eubus CBS123T through neofunctionalization of SeM transporters.
Researchers have established a correlation between the excess mortality caused by influenza virus strains and their antigenic variation, enabling the development of a method to rapidly estimate the mortality burden of influenza A (H1N1) virus by predicting antigen distance between strains. A host-virus interaction model revealed a positive correlation between antigenic variation and excess mortality, allowing for accurate prediction of mortality burden based on HA sequences. This method can help formulate cost-effective responses for influenza control and prevention. The relationship between antigenic variation and mortality was explored using a simplified host-virus model, focusing on strains causing significant infection in the population, denoted as "antigen strains". The ability to predict antigen distance with high accuracy suggests utility in estimating mortality burden. The predicted antigen distance of A(H1N) virus correlates with observed mortality, indicating potential for rapid assessment of future variants and applicability to A(H3N2) and B viruses with modification. Timely and accurate assessment of influenza impact is invaluable for planning, and this method can aid in developing preparedness that balances public health and economic costs.
Researchers have identified a small cysteine-rich protein, Pp23, from the Asian soybean rust fungus Phakopsora pachyrhizi, which suppresses plant immunity. The protein interacts with soybean transcription factor GmPL12, a negative regulator of soybean defenses. Silencing GmPL12 results in constitutively active immunity, indicating its role in regulating plant defense responses. Pp23 has a tandem repeat of ten-cystine motif found in other rust fungi, suggesting a conserved protein-protein interaction platform for manipulating host immunity. The study provides evidence for the virulence function of a small secreted cystine-rich protein, with Pp23 able to suppress soybean immune responses and interact with GmPL12. Infection assays on Gm12-silenced and P23-silenced soybeans showed no change in macroscopic disease phenotypes, possibly due to redundancy of pachhizi effector proteins. G12 acts as an immune suppressor to ensure normal plant growth in the absence of infection. The cluster 112 protein characterized by the ten-cystine motif is present in rust species, indicating P23 may be representative of a conserved platform for manipulating host responses. The findings shed light on molecular mechanisms of rust fungi interacting with host plants, specifically the role of small secreted cystine-rich proteins in suppressing plant immunity.
Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular bacterium, invades host cells and replicates within a membrane-bound vacuole called an inclusion, recruiting multiple host proteins to support its development. The bacterium induces long-lasting activation of the PI3 kinase pathway, required for efficient replication. EphrinA2 receptor (EphA) has been identified as a chlamydial adherence and invasion receptor that induces PI3 kinase activation, promoting replication. Interfering with binding of C. trachatis serovar L2 to EphA, downregulation of EphA expression, or inhibition of EphA activity significantly reduces Ctr infection. EphA remains active around the inclusion, interacting with the p85 regulatory subunit of PIK, supporting PIK/Akt signaling required for normal chlamial development. Overexpression of full-length EphA enhances PIK activation and Ctr infection, while depletion of EphA from the cell surface induces upregulation through ERK activation, maintaining an apoptosis-resistant state. EphA plays a crucial role in PIK activation during chyd infection, with early activation of the Eph2-PIK pathway important for chyd development. Post-translational modification by phosphorylation is the main mechanism of activation during the early phase, while PIK appears less important in the middle and late phase. Activation of PIK is not completely dependent on Eph2, indicating possible other PIK-inducing pathways.
Research has shown that neurons exhibit dendritic excitability through the expression of voltage-gated ion channels, but the role of this excitability in dendritic computation has remained unclear. A model of an active dendritic tree demonstrates that its output is a highly non-linear function of afferent rate, achieving large dynamic ranges above 50 dB, and yields double-sigmoid response functions observed in retinal ganglion cells. The primary role of active dendritic conductances is enhancement of dynamic range, allowing neurons to detect and amplify weak signals while saturating for stronger activity. Neurons with larger dendritic trees are predicted to have larger dynamic ranges, while blocking active conductances should decrease dynamic range. Active dendrites enable detection and amplification of weak signals and saturation for stronger activity, addressing the universal dynamic range problem of sensitivity and saturation in signal processing, crucial for neurons, neural networks, and organisms. Dendritic spikes under synaptic bombardment may result in a double-sigmoid behavior, as observed in retinal ganglion cells, rather than a simple Hill-saturating curve. The findings suggest active dendrites play a key role in enlarging operational range, benefiting neurons even without plasticity, such as sensory neurons.
Researchers investigated the inference of quantitative models of bacterial promoters from time-series gene data, focusing on the importance of correcting biases in existing methods that assume mRNA abundance represents protein concentrations and neglect changes in gene expression machinery and global effects. Using a combination of models and experiments, they measured the activity of genes in the Fli-FlM module of the E. coli motility network and estimated protein concentrations and global effects through kinetic models of gene expression. The results showed that correcting these biases improves the quality of inferred models, particularly for systems with longer protein half-lives and varying gene machinery activity. A new approach was proposed using constitutively-expressed genes, mathematical models, and computational procedures to reconstruct protein concentrations and integrate physiological effects into the inference process. Estimating protein concentrations from promoter activities using kinetic models and physiologically realistic half-lives improved the inference of regulatory interactions and gene functions. The study demonstrated the importance of global effects and active regulation of Fli and FlM half-lives for Fli-dependent promoter dynamics, providing a broadly applicable method for learning regulatory network structure and dynamics from time-series transcriptome data.
A study characterized the spatial-temporal distribution of Oligoryzys fulvesens, a mammalian reservoir in Central America, in Agua Buena, Panama, from April 2006 to December 2009. Non-spatial and spatial analyses revealed heterogeneous patterns in population densities and dispersion that varied across seasons and years. The species was typically absent during late transitional months and re-established locally in subsequent years, with populations recurring in the same area for three years before shifting south in the final year. Spatial autocorrelation indicated local populations encompassed approximately 300-600m with sharply demarcated borders between suitable and unsuitable habitats. Results showed a well-defined spatial pattern evolving over time, leading to changing aggregation and shifting hotspots of abundance. This variation was associated with seasonality and anthropogenic pressures from agricultural activities, influencing occurrence, timing, and duration of synanthropic populations and human exposure. Multi-annual dynamics demonstrated seasonal and yearly heterogeneity in abundance and distribution, making pathogen hotspot identification challenging. The study provides characterization of challenges in monitoring zoon disease at the reservoir level, subject to fluctuations over time and geographically restricted populations. Rodent-borne zoonoses are sensitive to population size, demographic, and persistence, with temporal changes in host distribution determining pathogen establishment and transmission.
Researchers have developed a method to infer antigenic trees for the major surface protein hemagglutinin of human influenza A(H3N2) viruses, assigning antigenic weights to tree branches to resolve the antigenic impact of amino acid changes. The technique predicts antigen distances with comparable accuracy to antigenic cartography and identifies known and novel sites with antigenic impact in the evolution of influenza A(H3N2) viruses from 1968 to 2003. The method applies a least-squares optimization procedure to fit pairwise antigenic distances onto an evolutionary tree, allowing fine-grained resolution of antigen impact without time and cost-intensive experiments. Antigenic trees represent the antigen evolution over a 35-year period, with branch lengths inferred from HI data and maximum likelihood of the HA domain hemagglutinin. The technique identified areas and branches corresponding to known antigen types and transitions, enabling identification of isolates with large antigenic impact for vaccine updates prior to transitions. The method is not restricted to influenza analysis but can be applied to any system with homologous genetic sequences and pairwise distances, allowing inference of phenotype and genotype-phenotype relationships from pairwise distances.
A two-step high-throughput RNA silencing screen identified host factors required for human papillomavirus type 16 infection, revealing a cluster of mitotic genes implicated in viral DNA import into the nucleus. In interphase cells, viruses were endocytosed, routed to the perinuclear area, and uncoated, but failed to be imported into the nucleus. Nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis allowed HPV16 infection. The viral DNA associated with host chromatin on the metaphase plate, suggesting HPV requires nuclear envelope breakdown for access to the nucleasm. The study used large-scale RNA interference to analyze pathogen-host interactions and uncovered a crucial role for mitosis in HPV nuclear entry. Nuclear envelope breakdown removes the nucleo-cytoplasmic barrier during mitosis, allowing the provirus to access the nucleasm. HPV entry requires cell progression through the cell cycle into early mitosis, with the virus promoting prolonged mitosis and associating with host chromatin to facilitate vDNA import. The results highlight the value of RNA screens for investigating viral infections and provide a resource for future virus-host interaction studies, listing cell functions required for HPV infection.
Black Sigatoka or black leaf disease, caused by the Dothideomycete fungus Pseudocospora fiji, is the most significant foliar disease of banana worldwide. Due to lack of effective host resistance, management requires frequent fungicide applications, increasing economic and environmental costs. Two strains of P. fiji were sequenced and assembled, revealing a 74-Mb genome expanded by LTR retrotransposons, the largest within Dothideomycetes. Genetic analyses showed chromosome-length polymorphisms, high diversity, and strong selection with limited gene flow. Frequencies of fungicide resistance were higher in treated plantations than in wild-type populations. A homologue of Cladosporium fulvum Avr effector, PfAv4, was identified, and infiltration into banana leaves resulted in hypersensitive response, suggesting unknown resistance gene recognizing PfAv4. The P. fiji genome will aid in developing fungicide schedules and improving banana breeding programs. Rapid development of fungicide resistance, variability, and high reproduction make this pathogen adaptable to changing conditions, diversifying host resistance may be the only way to slow devastation. The genome shows a decrease in gene families associated with pathogenicity compared to necrotrophic Dothomycetes. Availability of the P. fiji sequence will facilitate development of resistant cultivars in breeding programs, blunting its threat to global production.
Changes in cis-regulatory composition resulting in novel patterns of gene expression contribute to the evolution of lineage-specific traits. A novel framework utilizing a birth-death model traces the evolution of lineage-specific transcription factor binding sites without relying on detailed base-by-base cross-species alignments. The model was applied to ChIP-seq data for six transcription factors along the human lineage after the human-mouse common ancestor, estimating 58-79% of binding sites originated since divergence. Over 15% of all sites are unique to hominids, often near genes associated with specific pathways, and harbor more SNPs than older sites. The method generates motif predictions using lineage-specific sites, producing statistically significant predictions for five of six factors. Previous approaches rely on fixed cross-species alignments, which are frequently of low quality in noncoding regions, with error rates increasing with more species involved. The results support the method's ability to identify lineage-specific elements, helping understand their role in gene regulation variation across species. The study used ChIP-seq data for six transcription factors, chosen for diverse attributes, well-documented motifs, and availability in human and mouse, determining cases with lineage differences in evolutionary rates along a branch in phylogeny. The findings provide strong support for the method's ability to identify lineage-specific regulatory elements, a step towards understanding regulatory evolution's role in gene regulation variation.
Researchers investigated the regulation of the zebrafish period2 gene, a key component of the circadian clock, and found that light exposure induces its expression in most zebrafish cell types. Using transgenic fish and cell-based assays, a Light Responsive Module within the per2 promoter was identified, necessary and sufficient for light-driven gene expression and circadian regulation. The LRM sequence is conserved in vertebrate per2 genes and the human LRM can substitute for zebish LRM to confer light-regulated transcription. The LRM contains E- and D-box elements critical for its function, with E-box directing circadian regulation and D-box conferring light-driven expression. The zebish homolog of thyrotrophic embryonic factor binds to the LRM and transactivates expression, with tef mRNA levels being light-inducible. Knockdown of tef attenuates light-driven transcription, supporting a model where light-dependent crosstalk between E and D-box factors determines per2 expression. The study reveals a novel mechanism combining light-induced and clock-regulated transcriptional control, shedding light on light entrainment of the circadian clock and photic responses. D-box enhancers direct light-driven expression in zebish cells, providing insight into transcriptional mechanisms in vertebrate circadian clock evolution.
The actin filament-binding protein coronin plays a crucial role in regulating gliding motility in Plasmodium berghei sporozoites, the motile forms of a rodent malaria-causing parasites transmitted by mosquitoes. Parasites lacking coronin exhibit motility defects that impair colonization of the mosquito salivary glands but not migration in the skin, resulting in decreased transmission efficiency. Coronin localizes to the periphery of sporozoites in a calcium-dependent but actin-independent manner and contributes to parasite motility through actin-binding. Engagement of extracellular ligands triggers intracellular calcium release, followed by actin-dependent relocalization of coronin to the rear and initiation of motility. Mutational analysis and imaging suggest coronin organizes actin filaments for productive motility. Protein kinase A contributes to actin filament disassembly, and calcium and cAMP signaling regulate a switch from parasite motility to host invasion by differentially influencing actin dynamics. Coronin is required for efficient transmission of the parasite from mosquitoes to mice, with coronin-deficient parasites showing defects in salivary gland invasion. The data suggest a crucial interplay between TRAP-family adhesins, actin filaments, and actin-regulating proteins for adhesion as a prerequisite for sporite migration, with actin filaments linked to transmembrane proteins containing adhesive domains driving parasite motility upon attachment to a substrate.
Researchers have identified genomic instability at the locus of sterol 24-methyltransferase as a mechanism promoting amphotin B resistance in Leishmania parasites. Four novel amphotin B-resistant Leishmania mexicana lines were characterized, all exhibiting altered sterol biosynthesis and hypersensitivity to pentamidine. Whole genome sequencing revealed a resistance-associated mutation in the sterol biosynthesis gene sterol 5-desaturase in one line, while RNA sequencing showed loss of expression of sterol 24-methyltransferase in three lines. The loss of miltefosine transporter was also associated with one line. Sterol 24-methyltransferase is encoded by two tandem gene copies with varying expression levels, with reduced expression linked to loss of the 3' untranslated region of the dominant copy due to structural variations. Sequence homology between gene copies and SIDER retrotransposon elements contribute to these variations. Notably, loss of sterol 24-methyltransferase expression was not associated with loss of virulence in primary macrophages or in vivo. The findings highlight the risk of resistance to amphotin B, a key treatment for leishmanias, with no evidence of associated fitness costs, emphasizing the need to monitor emergent resistance through downregulation of sterol 24-methyltransferase expression.
Researchers investigated how attention and prediction interact to modulate information processing in the brain, focusing on their roles in encoding sensory information. A recent extension of predictive coding theory suggests attention optimises expected precision by modulating synaptic gain of prediction error units, implying attention increases selectivity for mismatch information in response to surprising stimuli. Alternative models propose attention increases activity of prediction neurons, suggesting attention and prediction synergistically modulate selectivity for feature information. Using electroencephalography, participants performed a visual task with predictable, surprising, or unpredictable grating orientations, finding surprising stimuli evoked responses encoded differences between predicted and observed features. Attention facilitated encoding of this type of information, supporting the theory that attention optimises expectations by increasing gain of prediction errors. The findings demonstrate attention boosts mismatch information evoked by surprising stimuli, consistent with predictive theory, and show a significant effect of attention on mismatch profiles in response to surprising stimuli. Results indicate attention increases selectivity for mismatch information in neural response to surprising relative to unsurprising stimuli, advancing understanding of how attention and prediction modulate processing in the brain and supporting the theory that attention optimises precision during hierarchical inference by increasing gain of prediction errors.
Trypanosoma brucei is a parasite found in sub-Saharan Africa, divided into three subspecies that differ in geographical distribution, host range, and disease caused. T. brucei is unable to infect humans due to sensitivity to trypanolytic factors (TLF) 1 and 2 in human serum, while T. rhodesiense and T. gambiense are resistant to lysis by TLF. Two distinct groups of T. gambiense differ genetically and by human serum resistance phenotypes, with group 1 having an invariant and group 2 a variable phenotype. Group 1 T. gambi is resistant to TLF-1 due to reduced uptake of TLF1, mediated by reduced expression of the haptoglobin-hemoglobin receptor (HpHb) gene. Investigation of group 2 T. gambi found that both resistant and sensitive lines express the HpHb gene and internalize fluorescently labeled TLF1 similarly to T. bruce. Both groups internalize recombinant APOL, but only sensitive group 2 parasites are lysed, indicating group 1 T. gambi is resistant to the lytic component AP1. Group 2 T. gambi is innately resistant to AP1, possibly through the same mechanism, but variably displays this phenotype, not correlating with changes in HpHb expression. The results demonstrate differences in human serum resistance mechanisms between T. gambi groups 1 and 2.
Researchers investigated the role of DNA methylation in controlling HIV-1 latency, finding that CpG methylation of the HIV-1 5' long terminal repeat is an epigenetic mechanism that restricts reactivation and determines latency stability. In an in vitro model and latent HIV-1-infected patients, CpG methylation acts as a late event in establishing latency, not required for initial silencing, with high proportions of non-methylated 5' LTR in aviremic patients. Latency controlled solely by transcriptional interference and chromatin mechanisms is leaky and easily reactivable, whereas hypermethylated promoters in viremic patients resist reactivation. Dense methylation does not confer complete resistance to reactivation with histone deacetylase inhibitors, protein kinase agonists, and TNFα, and combinations with 5-aza-2deoxycytidine. The study proposes a two-step model of epigen control of HIV-1 latency and correlates in vitro data with data from HIV-1-infected patients, showing the possibility of studying epigen control in infected individuals despite low provirus-harboring cells and decreased PCR sensitivity. Methylation restricts latent HIV1 against reactivation signals and determines stability, although not required for initial silencing, and can be reverted during reactivation. The study suggests both extremes of methylation density can be selected in different settings as a function of reactivation-proneness of latently infected cells, with implications for strategies aimed at eradicating HIV-1 infection.
Researchers have created a comprehensive catalog of genetic variants in Drosophila melanogaster, including single-nucleotide, multi-nucleotide, and structural variants, identifying over 3.6 million distinct variants, with more than 800,000 insertions, deletions, and complex variants. The study reveals a high density of molecular polymorphisms, with a SNP every 43 base pairs and an indel or complex variant every 144 base pairs, contributing a genetic marker every 33 base pairs on average. The findings show that indels comprise 10% of all cis-expression quantitative trait loci and have larger effects than SNP-expression trait loci, with two-fold more gene associations in males compared to females. The majority of cis-expression trait loci are sex-specific, indicating a partial decoupling of the genomic architecture between sexes and the importance of genetic factors in mediating sex-based expression. RNA-seq-based allelic imbalance analyses validated the majority of strong-expression trait loci in heterozygous individuals. The study provides insights into the regulatory architecture of gene expression in adult flies and the impact of polymorphisms on phenotypes, expanding the understanding of the relationship between genetic and phenic variation in Drosila.
The rectified surface EMG signal is commonly used to estimate neural drive to muscles and infer synaptic input to motor neurons, but amplitude cancellation due to overlap of motor unit potentials may distort its spectrum and correlation with neural drive. This study investigated the impact of amplitude cancellation on this correlation using analytical derivations and computational models of motor activity, force, and EMG signals. Results showed that an ideal rectified EMG without amplitude cancellation is a superior estimator of neural drive, confirmed by simulations where correlation between neural drive and EMG was high at low contraction levels but decreased linearly with cancellation. Stronger neural drive implied a stronger correlation between rectified EMG and neural, but cancellation distorted low-frequency components. The study found that amplitude cancellation distorts the rectified EMG spectrum, implying its use as an estimator requires low contraction and strong synaptic input. Theoretical and simulation analyses demonstrated that cancellation disrupts the ability of rectified EMG to reflect neural drive, except in conditions with low contraction and highly variable synaptic input. Amplitude cancellation impairs the degree to which rectified EM reflects neural drive, making some components weakly present in EMG.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanism of auxin-mediated root growth inhibition in response to aluminum stress in Arabidopsis. They found that YUCCA, encoding flavin monooxygenase-like proteins, regulates local auxin biosynthesis in the root transition zone in response to aluminum stress. Aluminum upregulates YUC3/5/7/8/9 in the root apex, resulting in auxin accumulation and root growth inhibition. Ethylene signaling modulates YUC expression and root inhibition, with increased or disrupted signaling enhancing or reducing YUC upregulation. Ethylene-insensitive 3 and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 are involved in YUC transcriptional regulation. PIF acts as a transcriptional activator for Y5/8, promoting aluminum-inhibited primary growth by regulating YUC and auxin in the root apex. The study reveals a regulatory cascade of YUC-mediated local auxin biosynthesis in the root apex, mediating growth inhibition in response to aluminum. Mutant analysis showed YUC involvement in ethylene modulation of auxin signaling, with yucas attenuating the effect on auxin signaling. YUC regulates the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis via conversion of IPyA to IAA in stress-regulated growth. Spatial expression analysis of YUC genes showed YUC-dependent auxin production in the root apex under aluminum stress. The results indicate YUC-dependent auxin forms part of cellular machinery for stress-induced growth inhibition, with Y-regulated biosynthesis involved in local auxin response and root inhibition.
Researchers investigated the interaction between simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) peptides and natural killer (NK) cell responses in primates, focusing on the binding of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecule Mamu-A*002 to inhibitory receptor Mamu-KIRDL05. Twenty-eight of 75 SIV peptides bound to Mam-A*002 suppressed the cytolytic activity of primary Mamu-KIRDL+ NK cells, including three immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes. Substitutions at C-terminal positions changed inhibitory peptides into disinhibitory peptides and vice versa without altering binding to Mam-A*002. Low concentrations of inhibitory peptides dominated NK responses in mixtures of inhibitory and disinhibitory peptides. SIV replication was higher in Mam-A*+ CD4 lymphocytes co-cultured with Mam-KIRDL+ NK cells than Mam-KDL- cells. The findings demonstrate that viral peptides modulate NK responses by affecting MHC class interactions with inhibitory killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), providing a mechanism for immunodeficiency viruses to evade NK responses. High-affinity peptides for Mam-A002, including immunodant CD8 T epitopes, strongly suppressed cytolytic activity of Mam-KDL+ NK cells and may be presented at greater density on SIV-infected cells, impacting NK responses. The results support the possibility that HIV-1 and SIV acquire changes in epitopes to increase MHC binding to inhibitory Ks, impairing NK killing of virus-infected cells.
Bacterial pathogens must adapt to dynamic environmental stressors to survive and colonize and persist. Researchers hypothesized that strains adapted to nutrient deprivation are more adept at colonization and establishment of chronic infection. A study detected microevolution in response to transient heme-iron limitation through mutation in the ic gene, decreasing 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase activity in nontype Haemophilus influenzae. In a preclinical model of otitis media, the ic mutant strain showed decreased recovery of effusion from infected ears. Clinically, resolution of otitis media coincides with clearance of middle ear fluid, but the ic mutant formed more intracellular bacterial communities than the parental strain. Although the parental strain formed few communities initially, it increased later, suggesting a mucosal reservoir after clinical resolution. The study provides insight into NTH microevolution during nutritional limitation and demonstrates intracellular communities in a preclinical otitis media model. Paired NTH strains from middle ear effusion and nasopharynx of children showed genetic variations, with ic mutations affecting cAMP phosphodiester activity. The ic mutant remained associated with middle ear tissues despite decreased fluid, indicating uncoupling of fluid and bacterial burden. Transient heme-iron restriction led to a single nucleotide polymorphism abolishing cAMP phosphodiester activity, shifting infection kinetics and decreasing middle fluid, a clinical indicator of resolution.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, modulates host iron homeostasis to facilitate iron availability and intracellular survival. Upon infection of primary macrophages, expression of ferroport is downregulated, resulting in higher iron availability within macrophages. Exogenous modification of iron export by hepcin or iron supplementation by ferric ammonium citrate leads to increased intracellular iron, stimulating B. pseudomalle growth, whereas the iron chelator deferoxamine reduces bacterial survival. Iron-loaded macrophages exhibit lower expression of NADPH oxidase, iNOS, lipocalin 2, cytokines, and activation of caspase. Infection of mice with the pathogen causes diminished hepatic ferroport expression, higher retention in liver, and lower iron levels in serum. Administration of ferric ammonium citrate promotes bacterial growth and inflammatory response, whereas limitation of iron availability significantly ameliorates bacterial clearance, attenuates cytokine levels, and improves survival of infected mice. Data indicate that modulation of cellular balance is a strategy for B. pseudalle to improve acquisition, restrict antibacterial effector mechanisms, and promote intracellular growth. Changes in host homeostasis influence susceptibility to meloidosis, suggesting iron chating might be a therapeutic option. B. pseudalle evades immune strategies by modulating homeostasis in murine macrophages, providing insights into the role of cytosolic pools and ferritin for intracellular infection. Iron supplementation stimulates systemic and hepatic load, leading to higher bacterial numbers and cytokine release, while limitation improves outcome by reducing bacterial burden and inflammatory response.
Researchers have developed a novel technique called functional mode analysis to identify collective motions in proteins directly related to specific functions. This approach uses an ensemble of structures and a functional quantity that quantifies the protein's state to detect maximally correlated motions. The functional quantity can be geometric, electrostatic, chemical, or any variable relevant to protein function. Two correlation measures are applied: Pearson coefficient for linear correlation and mutual information for interdependence. This method allows deriving a model for the functional state in terms of a single coordinate. Established methods like PCA and NMA identify large-scale and low-frequency modes but not necessarily related to function. Functional analysis aims to elucidate collective motions directly related to protein function, complementary to experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. State-of-art approaches like PCA extract collective motions with largest variance contribution to atomic fluctuations, while normal mode analysis identifies low-frequency modes expected to correspond to large displacements. Elastic network models assess intrinsic motions to protein structure. The technique is expected to elucidate relations between collective motions and protein function in cases where it is unclear how functionally quantities relate to atomic motions, such as hinge, rotations, or side chain reorientations. The approach is illustrated using biomolecules like polyalan-helix, T4 lysozym, Tr-cage, and leucine-binding protein.
Researchers investigated the order of removal of conventional and nonconventional introns from nuclear transcripts of Euglena gracilis, specifically in the tubA and gap genes, which contain both types of introns. Nonconventional introns in Euglena and diplonids lack conserved borders characteristic of spliceosomal introns and sequence complementary to U1 snRNA at the 5' end, forming a stable secondary structure that brings together exon/intron junctions. Analysis using PacBio Next Generation Sequencing revealed that nonconventional introns are removed after spliceosomal introns. Accumulation of transcripts with conventional introns removed and nonconventional introns present suggests a time gap between the two types of splicing. Nonconventional introns have been found in nuclear genes of eugids and marine diplonids, with frequent insertions at new positions observed, whereas conventional introns are conserved or lost. Intermediate products of splicing were analyzed, leading to the conclusion that nonconventional introns are removed later than spliceosomal introns. Nonconventional introns form a stable secondary structure but do not resemble self-splicing or tRNA introns and are conserved to a small extent. Results indicate the process of nonconventional intron removal is rapid and precedes removal of outron and addition of splice-leader takes place before conventional splicing.
Coxsackievirus B (CVB) is an enterovirus that commonly causes self-limited febrile illness in infants, but severe cases can lead to myocarditis. Researchers investigated the impact of juvenile CVB infection on cardiac progenitor cells and postnatal heart development using a mouse model of subclinical coxsievirus B3 (CV3) infection, which showed no evident symptoms immediately or in adult mice. However, following physiological or pharmacologically-induced cardiac stress, juvenile-infected mice underwent cardiac hypertrophy and dilation, indicative of progression to heart failure. CV3 efficiently infected juvenile c-kit cells and cardiac progenitor numbers were reduced in the hearts of juvenile-infected mice, suggesting the exhausted cardiac progenitor pool may impair the heart's ability to increase capillary density to adapt to increased load. Infectious virus and viral RNA were eventually cleared from the heart, but a significant decrease in the number of cardiac progenitor cells was observed in the hearts of mice infected early in life. Subjecting mice to cardiac stress via exercise or pharmacological induction, adult mice with juvenile CV3 infection developed left ventricular hypertrophy and dilation. Viral protein expression colocalized with c-kit and Sca-1, indicating infection of cardiac progenitor cells in the juvenile heart. These results provide evidence that self-limited juvenile CV3 infection may have lasting effects on the ability of mice to undergo compensatory vascular remodeling under cardiac stress.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of melioidosis, regulates IL-1β and IL-18 production through NOD-like receptors NLR3 and pyroptosis via NLRC. Research shows caspase-1 processing and pyroptosis is exclusively dependent on NLRC, not NLR3, in the early phase of macrophage infection, while later caspase-1 activation and cell death is NLRC-independent. An early pathway involving casases-9, -7, and PARP downstream of NL4 and casase1 was identified. Casase-1-deficient infected macroages revealed a strong induction of apoptosis dependent on activation of apoptotic and effector casases. B. pseudomalle factors, including flagellin FliC and T3SS effector Bop, play a role in casase1 processing. T3 inner protein Bsa mutant failed to activate casase1, resulting in reduced intracellular counts, cell death, and IL-β secretion. Intranas infection of BAL/c mice with the Bsa mutant displayed decreased mortality and bacterial loads. Results indicate a major role for functional T3 in NLRC-mediated cas1 activation and pyptosis, contributing to late casase-dependent and independent cell mechanisms in B. pseudalle pathogenesis. NL4-dependent activation of casases-1, -9, and -7 is essential for Burkholder-dependent PARP proteoly inactivation during pyptosis. Casase9 and -7 cleavage of PARP occur downstream of NL4/case1 inflamome in the early phase, with possible casase-dependent and independent death mechanisms later.
Arabidopsis KINγ, a plant-specific subunit of the SNF-related kinase 1 complex, plays a crucial role in regulating pollen-stigma interactions during pollination. The KINγ subunit is localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus of vegetative cells in pollen grains and is essential for pollen germination on the stigma. The kinγ mutant pollen fails to germinate on the stigma, but germinates normally in vitro, due to compromised hydration. The addition of water to the stigma promotes germination of mutant pollen, indicating hydration is the primary defect. The kinγ mutant exhibits destroyed mitochondria and peroxisomes structure, reduced numbers, and decreased reactive oxygen species levels. Supplementing H2O2 in vitro compensates for reduced water absorption, while overexpressing Arabidopsis CATAL 3 reduces ROS, resulting in compromised hydration. KINγ regulates ROS levels by mediating biogenesis of mitochondria and perisomes, required for pollen-stigma interactions. The kinγ mutation leads to defective biogenesis of mitochondria and perisomes, resulting in compromised germination. Pollen grains of kinγ mutants germinate in vitro but not on the stigma due to reduced ROS levels. The study provides insights into pollen-stigma interaction mechanisms, highlighting the importance of KINγ in regulating ROS and hydration for successful pollination.
Researchers have identified the essential function of RNase III in Bacillus subtilis as protecting the organism from the expression of toxin genes borne by prophages Skin and SPβ through antisense RNA. RNase III cleaves double-stranded RNA, playing a key role in host defense mechanisms against viral infection. The enzyme degrades two toxin-encoding mRNAs, txA and yon, from Skin and SPβ prophages, and its presence is crucial for cell survival. In the absence of these prophages or toxin-encoding mRNAs, RNase III deletion is possible without affecting growth. The essential role of RNase III in B. subtilis is distinct from its function in rRNA metabolism or maturation and is not related to the 4.5S particle involved in co-translational insertion of proteins. Other enzymes, such as RNase J, Mini-III, and RNase M, efficiently catalyze rRNA maturation without prior RNase action. Tiling analysis revealed a minor contribution of RNase to the stability of many antisense RNAs. This study highlights the importance of RNase III in silencing foreign toxin genes, similar to its role in bacterial gene silencing by CRISPR RNAs and RNA interference in eukaryotes, where enzymes like Dicer and Drosha process microRNAs.
The filarial nematode Brugia malayi, a causative agent of Lymphatic Filariasis, releases extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing bioactive proteins and small RNA that allow secretion of parasite effector molecules and potential trafficking to host tissues. Researchers profiled EV release across all intra-mammalian life stages, including microfilariae, L3, L4, adult male, and female worms, and found discrete vesicle populations indicating a secretory process conserved across the life cycle. Brug EVs are internalized by murine macrophages with no preference for life stage, suggesting a uniform mechanism for effector trafficking via phagocytosis. Proteomic profiling of adult and female EVs revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in the EV proteome, defining biogenesis of Brug EVs and sexual dimorphic characteristics in immunomodulatory cargo. Ivermectin was found to inhibit EV release by all Brug life stages, also observed in the related filarial nemode Dirofilaria imitis, but not in an ivermect-unresponsive isolate, highlighting a potential mechanism of action and new screening for anti-filar drug development. The study provides insight into the mechanisms by which filarial nematodes modulate host biology, suggesting EVs play a key role in establishment and maintenance of parasitemia.
A cross-sectional survey conducted in ten rural villages in the Western Province of the Solomon Islands found a substantial prevalence of scabies and impeto. The total unweighted prevalence of scabies was 19.2% and age and gender weighted prevalence 19.2%, with the highest prevalence found in infants under one year of age at 34.1% and children aged 1-4 years at 25.7%. Scabies affected two or more body regions in 80.9% of participants and 4.4% of cases were classified as severe. The total unweighted prevalence of active impeto was 32.7% and age and gender weighted 26.7%, with the highest prevalence in children 1-4 years at 42.6%. Scabies infestation was associated with active impeto infection, with 41.1% of active impeto cases also having scabies. The study suggests community control strategies for scabies may reduce the burden of both conditions and their complications. The age and gender adjusted prevalences of scabies and impeto are lower than previous studies in the Solomon Islands, but consistent with global estimates, highlighting the need for standardized clinical criteria and algorithms for diagnosis in field settings to facilitate accurate data collection and comparisons.
Researchers investigated the genetic and functional relationship between cells and cellular proliferation in the adult hippocampus, specifically in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus, where neurogenesis occurs throughout life in mice. A significant correlation was found between cellular proliferation in the hippocampus and proportions of CD8 versus CD4 T lymphocyte subsets in 719 outbred stock mice, reflecting shared genetic loci except for the H-2a locus. Analysis of knockouts and repopulation of TCR-deficient mice confirmed the influence of T cells on adult neurogenesis, indicating CD4 T cells mediate the effect. The study reveals a broader impact of genetic variation controlling T cell development and homeostasis than previously suspected. The correlation between T cells and cellular proliferation in the hippocampus is driven by genetics, with QTLs contributing to variation in cell proliferation also contributing to variation in CD4 and CD8 T cell proportions. Higher hippocampal proliferation is associated with higher CD8 T cell proportions and lower CD4 cell proportions and CD4/CD8 ratio, accounting for 6% of phenotypic variance. The findings extend previous observations that T cells contribute to variation in adult neurogenesis, suggesting a role for T cell function broader than previously suspected.
Researchers investigated the protective efficacy of a multi-component DNA-prime-protein-boost vaccine, TVac2, against Trypanosoma cruzi in mice. TVac was constituted of selected antigens identified by computational/bioinformatics approach and cytokine expression plasmids. Mice immunized with TVac exhibited strong antigen-specific antibody response and moderate lymphocyte proliferation. Upon infection, TVac-vaccinated mice expanded IgG2/Ig1 antibodies and elicited substantial CD8 T cell response associated with type 1 cytokines, resulting in control of acute parasite burden. During chronic phase, antibody persisted, splenic activation of CD8 cells and IFNγ/TNFα cytokines subsided, and IL4/IL10 cytokines became dominant. Tissue parasitism, inflammation, and fibrosis in heart and skeletal muscle of TVac-vaccinated mice were undetectable by histological techniques. TVac-induced type 1 antibody and lymphocyte responses provided resistance to acute infection and prevented chronic immunopathology associated with parasite persistence in chagasic hearts. Mice injected with vector or cytokines only responded with mixed type 1/type 2 antibody, cell, and cytokine response, and exhibited persistent parasite burden and immunopathology in myocardium. The study demonstrated TVac efficacy in reducing tissue parasite burden below detection limits in chronic chagasic animals. TVac elicited strong parasite-specific antibody expanded after challenge and controlled chronic activation of CD8 cell proliferation and proinflammatory cytokine production. Histological analysis revealed no infiltration of inflammatory cells in heart and skeletal muscle of TVac-vaccinated mice.
Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified susceptibility loci for common and complex diseases, but quantifying individual disease risk based on genotype data for personalized prevention and treatment remains a challenge. Researchers applied a Support Vector Machine algorithm to a genome-wide association study dataset for type 1 diabetes, optimizing a risk model with hundreds of markers, and tested it on independent datasets, achieving an area under the ROC curve of 0.84. In contrast, using only known susceptibility loci resulted in poor performance. The study suggests improved risk assessment can be achieved by accounting for interactions between a large ensemble of markers, making genotype-based risk feasible for diseases where a notable proportion of risk has been captured by SNP arrays. A machine-learning approach was tested on three datasets, achieving satisfactory performance when hundreds of SNPs were included, with AUC scores of 0.84 for predicting type 1 diabetes risk, while logistic regression achieved 0.66. Whole-genome imputed genotypes were generated for one dataset and shared markers utilized for risk assessment. The model can account for additional variables and cumulative epidemiological studies can identify disease-specific factors. Computational approaches are robust with inclusion of non-contributing markers, utilizing established markers associated with disease.
Memory CD8+ T cells in circulation rapidly infiltrate non-lymphoid tissues following infection and provide protective immunity in an antigen-specific manner. During secondary infection, central memory CD8 T cells traffic into the skin independent of CD62-mediated lymph node reactivation and provide robust immunity against Vaccinia virus infection. Central memory, but not effector memory, CD8 T cells differentiate into functional CD69+/CD103 tissue residents following viral clearance, dependent on local antigen recognition in the skin microenvironment. Memory CD8 T cells express granzyme B after trafficking into the skin and utilize cytolysis to provide immunity against Vaccinia infection. Circulating memory CD8 T cells rapidly infiltrate the skin independent of their ability to survey lymph nodes and provide significant immunity. Central memory CD8 T cells become cytolytic following rapid infiltration of the skin to protect against viral infection and differentiate into functional CD69 tissue-residents. The capacity of memory CD8 T cells to home and survey lymph nodes does not play a major role during secondary response against local infection. Central memory CD8 T cells provide immunity through rapid and specific trafficking into inflamed non-lymphoid tissues.
Researchers have identified a role for Myosin VI, a minus-directed motor, in the localization of axonal proteins in neurons. Myos VI plays a vital role in the enrichment of proteins on the surface of axons, and engineering non-neuronal proteins to interact with Myos VI causes them to become highly concentrated at the axonal surface in dissociated rat neurons. Disruption of Myos VI function or expression leads to aberrant dendritic localization of axonal proteins. Myos VI mediates the enrichment of proteins on the axonal surface by stimulating dendrite-specific endocytosis, a mechanism that underlies the localization of many axonal proteins. Myos VI contributes to the direct trafficking of proteins to the axon and plays a role in specifying the polarized structure of neurons, necessary for proper electrical signaling. Interaction with Myos VI directs proteins to the surface of the axon, and its involvement in endocytosis suggests it contributes to the enrichment of proteins on the surface of the axon. A version of Channelrhodopsin 2 engineered to bind to Myos VI is concentrated at the surface of the axon of cortical neurons in mice, suggesting it could be a tool for probing circuit and function. Myosins shape the polarized distributions of both axonal and dendritic proteins, with Myos VI being the only known minus-directed motor to move towards the pointed end of actin filament, participating in the localization of axonal proteins.
Researchers have identified two Doublesex (Dsx) genes, DapDsx1 and DapDsx2, in Daphnia magna, a freshwater crustacean that produces males in response to environmental cues. DapDsx1 is crucial for male development during environmental sex determination and exhibits a similar domain organization to Dsx genes in insects, which are thought to be the sister group of branchiopod crustaceans. However, the molecular basis for sexually dimorphic expression of DapD1 is different, with dimorphic differences in transcript abundance rather than sex-specific regulation at the pre-RNA splicing level. Expression of DapD1 is increased in males during embryogenesis and primarily detected in male-specific structures. Knockdown of Dap1 in male embryos resulted in female traits, while ectopic expression in female embryos resulted in male-like phenotypes. Silencing and overexpression of D2 did not induce phenotypic changes, establishing D1 as a key regulator of the male phenotype. The findings reveal environmental sex determination is implemented by selective expression of a fundamental genetic component functionally conserved in animals using genetic sex determination, suggesting an ancient link between genetic and environmental sex determination. The function of Dsx is conserved between Daph and genetic sex-determining insect species but the factors regulating Dsx expression are independently co-opted in each lineage. The results indicate Dsx expression in sexually dimorphic tissues is key to induce differentiation in crustace Daph and insects.
A trivalent HSV-2 subunit vaccine administered with CpG and alum was evaluated in rhesus macaques and guinea pigs to prevent genital herpes. The vaccine contains glycoproteins C, D, and E to block virus entry and immune evasion. In rhes macaques, it induced plasma and mucosa neutralizing antibodies, blocked immune activities, and stimulated CD4 T responses. After challenge, a self-limited vaginal infection was detected in naïve but not trivalent immunized maca. In guinea pigs, trivalent and trivalent plus g2 groups were 97% and 99% efficacious in preventing genital lesions, outperforming g2 alone. Vaginal swabs evaluated for HSV-2 DNA and replication showed reduced shedding in all groups, with fewer days of competent virus in trivalent than g2 and none in trivalent plus g2. The trivalent group had lesions less than 1% and competent virus shedding 0.2% days. The vaccine has potential for prevention of genital herpes in humans, meeting immunogenic goals in macques and highly efficacious in guinea pigs, with a booster dose of g2 minimally enhancing efficacy.
Perm-seq is a prior-enhanced read mapping method for ChIP-seq experiments that accurately allocates multi-mapping reads in highly repetitive regions of genomes. Standard methods discard multi-mapping reads or are prone to false positives and negatives due to short reads mapping to multiple locations. Perm-se utilizes DNase-seq and histone ChIP-se data to discriminate between multiple alignments, improving multi-read allocation accuracy. Applied to 64 ENCODE ChIP datasets, Perm-se identified novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplications, revealing evolutionarily less conserved sites sharing characteristics with non-repetitive regions. A probabilistic model incorporates DNase-derived priors, mapping reads with high accuracy, and enables incorporation of multiple data sources like histone ChIP. Analysis indicates repetitive and non-repetitive protein-DNA interactions share chromatin signatures. Perm-se expands ChIP capability for profiling repetitive regions, capitalizing on DNase-seq and histone ChIP data, resolving the bottleneck of multi-read allocation and improving specificity. The approach identifies broader regions of open chromatin, exhibiting transcription factor occupancy, and active cis-regulatory elements. Novel targets in highly repetitive regions, especially segmental duplications, exhibit similar chromatin signatures to non-repetitive modes of protein-DNA interactions.
Schistosomiasis affects 218 million people worldwide, mostly in Africa, and may increase the risk of HIV-1 acquisition and impair control of HIV-1 replication. A nested case-control study in Tanzania found pre-existing schistosome infection increased the odds of HIV-1 acquisition in women, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.8, but not in men, with an odds ratio of 0.7. The study tested 73 HIV-1 seroconverters and 265 controls and found schosome-infected women had higher odds of HIV-1 acquisition. HIV-1 RNA levels were higher in 15 seroconverters with schosomiasis, 4.4 log copies/mL, compared to 22 without, 3.7 log copies/mL. The study confirms pre-existing schosome infection increases HIV-1 acquisition in women and raises viral load at seroconversion. Approximately 200 million schistosome-infected individuals live in African countries with HIV-1 epidemics and 6 million are co-infected. This study demonstrates the effect of schosome on HIV-1 susceptibility and control and differentiates by gender.
Researchers investigated ribosomal DNA copy number and sequence variation in cancer using computational and droplet digital PCR approaches in human and mouse genomes. They found that copy number and sequence can change in cancer genomes, with human cancers showing a loss of copies accompanied by global copy number co-variation and increased sequence variability. Cancer genomes with lower copies exhibited mutational evidence of mTOR hyperactivity, and PTEN phosphatase, a tumor suppressor critical for genome stability and negative regulator of the mTOR pathway. Hematopoietic stem cells from a Pten-/- mouse model for leukemia had lower rDNA number than normal tissue, despite increased proliferation, rRNA production, and synthesis. Loss of copies occurred early and was associated with hypersensitivity to DNA damage, indicating that copy loss is a feature in cancers with mTOR activation. Ribosomal copy number may be a useful indicator of cancer sensitivity to DNA treatments. The study used a Pten/- mouse model to assess rDNA copies in hematietic stem cells and found reduced rDNA number in cancer with mTOR activation, increased copy number of additional genes, and single nucleotide variation in repeats. The findings suggest cancer cells with low copy number may be sensitive to DNA damaging agents and targeting these loci is possible.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to study the within-host spatiotemporal dynamics of invasive bacterial disease, specifically Salmonella infection, using tagged wild-type isogenic strains that are phenotypically identical but distinguishable by quantitative PCR. This method allows for the estimation of bacterial death rates and growth based on strain disappearance over time. The study found that shortly after infection, concurrent death and rapid replication lead to the establishment of independent bacterial subpopulations in different organs, controlled by host antimicrobial mechanisms. Later, decreased microbial mortality results in exponential bacterial increase and spread between organs via bactemia and stochastic selection. The approach provides insight into the pathogenesis of S. enterica infections, illustrating complex spatial and stochastic effects driving infectious disease. The method involves tracing subpopulations of identical bacteria through infected animals and organs, addressing limitations of previous methods that disrupt bacterial phenotype and immune response. Tagged strains enable derivation of quantitative information on within-host dynamics, building mechanistic models, and generating hypotheses. The study reveals mixing of bacterial populations between organs, such as spleen and liver, via blood during later stages with further selection of subpopulations, providing a comprehensive view of within-host dynamics.
Existing schemes for 3D motion perception, such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, and joint encoding of motion and disparity, do not provide a general solution to the inverse problem of binocular 3D motion. Local velocity in combination with binocular disparity and other cues offers a more flexible framework for solving the problem. Two default strategies are proposed: preferring slow motion in 3D and cyclopean average based on slow motion 2D. Theoretical results suggest velocity constraints and disparity from feature tracking are necessary to solve 3 motion perception. Motion and disparity are processed in parallel and integrated late in the visual hierarchy. The inverse problem of 3 motion is underdetermined and existing models are insufficient. Velocity constraints in binocular geometry require additional information to disambiguate local velocity. Late integration of motion and disparity with cues solves the problem, allowing flexibility in binding inputs into a global 3D percept. Geometrically, the intersection of two planes defines a line in 3D velocity space. Feature tracking with binocular velocity provides a strategy to disambuate 3 motion. Three approaches have emerged: interocular difference, changing disparity over time and joint encoding, but psychophysical results are inconclusive and 3 motion remains unresolved.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa secretes the anionic O-acetylated exopolysaccharide alginate during chronic infection in lungs of cystic fibrosis patients to form a protective biofilm matrix. Four proteins, including AlgJ and AlgX, are implicated in the O-acetylation of alginate. The structure of AlgJ was determined to 1.83 Å resolution, revealing a SGN hydrolase-like protein with a distinctly different electrostatic surface potential compared to AlgX. AlgJ exhibits acetylesterase activity in vitro, with a conserved catalytic triad composed of D190, H192, and S288. Binding studies showed AlgJ has weak or no detectable binding to polymannuronic acid, while AlgX binds specifically in a length-dependent manner. AlgX can utilize a surrogate acetyl-donor to catalyze O-acetylation of polymuronic acid. The results suggest AlgJ and AlgX have separate and distinct roles in O-acetylation, with AlgX as the terminal acetyltransferase. The O-acetylation of alginate requires four proteins, AlgF, AlgI, AlgJ, and AlgX, and can occur at the C2 and C3 hydroxyl groups of mannuronic residues. The study provides a refined model for alginate acetylation and a rationale for the variability in the number of proteins required for polysacchar Oetylation.
Candida albicans is a common cause of human fungal infections and can evade the immune system by masking its cell wall component β(1,3)-glucan with an outer layer of glycosylated mannoproteins. However, mutations or drugs that disrupt the cell wall can lead to exposure of β(1,3)-glan, allowing detection by innate immune cells through receptors like Dectin-1. The phosphatidylserine synthase enzyme Cho1 plays a role in β(1,3)-glan masking, with the homozygous mutant cho1Δ/Δ exhibiting increased exposure of β(1,3)-glan. The Cek1 MAPK pathway is activated in cho1Δ/Δ, acting downstream of the small GTPase Cdc42. Hyperactivation of Rho1 in wild-type cells increases β(1,3)-glan unmasking and activation of both Cek1 and Mkc. Independent activation of the MAP kinase Ste11 leads to Cek activation and increased β(1,3)-glan exposure. Upregulation of the Cek MAPK pathway causes unmasking and may be responsible for unmasking in cho1ΔΔ. Disruption of Mkc does not decrease unmask in cho1Δ, suggesting Cek activation is key to β(1,3)-glan exposure. These findings suggest that activation of the Cek pathway promotes β(1,3)-glan exposure, potentially improving antifungal strategies by enhancing detection of fungal cell antigens by host cells.
A genome-wide association study of neuropathologic features of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias was conducted using data from 4,914 brain autopsies to gain insight into molecular pathogenesis. The study defined clinico-pathologic dementia or controls, assessed core neuropathologic features, and evaluated co-morbid neuropath changes. Genome significance was observed for clinico-pathologic dementia, neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and Lewy body disease, with variants associated with apolipoprotein E, Galc transferase 7, and ATP-Binding Cassette. Twelve non-apoE genetic loci for clinically-defined dementia were confirmed, with nine showing larger odds ratio in clinico-pathologic samples. Correlation of effect sizes for dementia risk with neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques showed positive correlation, while vascular injury showed negative correlation. New genetic associations were discovered with specific neuropathologic features, aligning known risk with neuropathologic changes. The study identified genetic loci associated with specific neuropath features, including Potassium Conductance Calcium-Activated Channel and intergenic region on chromosome 9. The results suggest genetic stratification of risk for common causes of cognitive impairment and dementia, providing insights into molecular drivers of characteristic lesions. Strong association was found with apolipop E locus and clinico-path defined dementia, confirming previous findings.
Researchers investigated the role of urea in protein unfolding by analyzing 30 representative proteins through molecular dynamics simulations, finding that urea concentrates in the first solvation shell of quasi-native proteins but with lower density than the fully unfolded state. Urea reduces protein vibrations, slowing atomic motions that oppose unfolding, and its stickiness and slow diffusion are crucial for unfolding. Long-residing urea molecules around the hydrophobic core stabilize partially open structures generated by thermal fluctuations. Simulations indicate urea does not favor formation of partially open microstates but actively selects and stabilizes them, driving the protein conformational ensemble away from native and sampled conformations during thermal unfolding. Van der Waals interactions drive urea accumulation on the protein surface, while hydrogen bonds stabilize long-living urea interactions near hinge points, biasing protein dynamics towards unfolding. The study provides a complete picture of urea's role in destabilizing folded proteins and its mechanisms in accelerating unfolding. Urea's denaturing properties remain elusive despite decades of research, with the dominant paradigm claiming its capacity to interact with exposed residues more strongly than water. Simulations detected unfolding signals in microseconds, with progress dependent on neither fold nor secondary composition, and similar for proteins with and without disulfide bridges.
A systematic review of dengue disease epidemiology in Colombia from 2000 to 201 reveals a stable baseline annual number of cases with major outbreaks in 200-2003 and 2010. The geographical spread of deng disease increased, affecting most of the country by 201, with a 90% rise in municipalities reporting cases from 424 to 743 between 200 and 201. The majority of cases were among those under 15 years old. Incidence was low in south and southeast Colombia due to low population density. The period saw a general increase in annual deng hemorrhagic fever cases from 200 to201, followed by a decrease in 201. There is a lack of information on asymptomatic deng virus infection, primary and secondary infections, risk factors for severity, and underreporting. Improved surveillance is needed to address these gaps. The review highlights the need for better understanding of factors determining disease expression to improve control and management. Deng disease remains a public health priority in Colombia with control being challenging. The study provides an overview of deng epidemiology in Colombia within the context of national and regional trends, including incidence by age, seroprevalence, and serotype distribution.
Tegumentary leishmaniasis is a disease of skin and mucosal tissues caused by Leishmania parasites, and patients may concurrently carry other pathogens that influence the clinical outcome. This review focuses on the frequency of coinfections in human populations, interactions between Leishmania and other pathogens, and implications for clinical practice. Coinfections with Trypanosoma cruzi and helminthias have been reported in 41% and 15-88% of patients in Argentina and Brazil, respectively. Interactions between microorganisms may involve innate immunity and regulatory networks affecting acquired responses. Diagnostic problems occur when concurrent infections cause similar lesions or when pathogens are present in the same lesions. Coinfections can reduce antileishial treatment effectiveness and cause cumulative adverse effects. In patients, coinfections can lead to diagnostic errors, delays, and influence treatment effectiveness and safety. Research is needed to understand how coinfections interfere with the pathogenesis of Tegument leishmanis. Leish parasites produce a spectrum of manifestations from asymptomatic to life-threatening disease, with an estimated 1 million people developing Teg leishmanis yearly, mainly in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Algeria, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iran, and Pakistan. Coinfections add complexity to the disease, making the outcome unpredictable and influencing treatment response.
Genetic variation in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) affects CD4∶CD8 lineage commitment and MHC expression. Researchers assessed the impact of natural variation on MHC expression and CD4∶CD lineage commitment using two genetic models in rats, identifying 10 Quantitative Trait Loci (Qs) associated with variation in MHC class I and II protein and the CD4∶8 T cell ratio. Qs for individual traits colocalized within a region spanning the MHC, which was refined to two intervals of ∼0.25 Mb in the MHC-I and II regions. Interaction between these intervals affected MHC class I expression, negative selection, and lineage commitment of CD8-positive thymocytes, mapped to the transporter associated antigen processing 2 (Tap2) in the MHC-II region and classical MHC class I gene (RT-A) in the MHC region. Recombination between RT-A and Tap2, occurring in 0.2% of rats, led to a restricted peptide repertoire on MHC I molecules, resulting in reduced selection of CD8 cells. Two haplotypes in MHC-I and II regions control MHC expression and T cell selection in rats, with recombination affecting negative selection and lineage of CD8 cells associated with TapB and dependent on RT-A co-expression. The study shows natural polymorphisms in Tap2 influence negative selection and CD4∶8 lineage commitment in rats.
Chagas disease is a significant health concern in Spain due to its high number of Latin American migrants, with 172 hospitalizations recorded between 1997 and 201. Hospitalization rates increased from 18 to 242.8 per 100,000 population between the periods 1997-2004 and 2005-201. The median age of patients was 35 years, with 74 female and the 16-45 age group being the most represented. 23 hospitalizations included Chagas disease with complications, predominantly heart-related. Being male, aged 45-64, and hospitalization cost above 3,065 euros were associated with organ affectation. Most hospitalizations were asymptomatic women of fertile age, highlighting the need for early detection. Invasive or non-invasive procedures were documented in 84.6 of cases and surgical intervention in 12.2. The predominant admission type was urgent, with 50 of hospitalizations related to Chagas with complications. Re-admissions accounted for 31.6 of cases, with 90 recorded between 2005-201. The study emphasizes the need for systematic detection and control of Chagas disease in Spain.
Researchers have developed a novel approach called BlocBuster to identify combinatorial interactions of genetic markers associated with complex diseases, addressing the issue of "missing heritability" in genome-wide association studies. Applying BlocBuster to psoriasis, they discovered a combinatorial pattern of 17 alleles with an odds ratio of 3.64 and Bonferroni-corrected p-value of 5×10−16, which was replicated in independent data. This pattern lies within the major histocompatibility complex and provides a precise allelic fingerprint for future investigations, outperforming conventional GWAS results where the highest odds ratio for a single SNP was 2.41. The BlocBuster network exhibited odds ratio of 3.45 for the entire bloc as a unit and identified a psori risk association with an odds ratio of 3.64 and p-value of 5×10−16. The results improve disease susceptibility prediction and understanding of psoriasis pathogenesis, demonstrating BlocBuster's potential for discovering combinatorial genetic associations within genome-wide data and transcending individual marker limitations. The identified pattern was computationally validated and confirmed in independent data with an odds ratio of 3.86 and p-value, supplying specific information along a 211 kb span in the MHC region.
Agenesis of the corpus callosum, cerebellar hypoplasia, and polymicrogyria are severe congenital brain malformations with largely undiscovered causes. A large-scale chromosomal copy number variation discovery in 255 ACC, 220 CBL, and 147 PM patients and 2,349 controls found significantly more ACC patients had rare genic CNVs over one megabase compared to controls. Rare genic CNVs impacted at least one gene in less than 1% of the combined population of patients and controls. Independent qPCR showed 9.4% of ACC patients had de novo CNVs, which overlapped de novo CN previously observed in patients with autism spectrum disorders. The study confirmed and refined known CNVs, including the 8p23.1-p11.1 duplication, and found novel CNVs likely deleterious deletions and duplications. One patient with microcephaly had a paternally inherited deletion of 16p13.11 including NDE, with a recessive matern inherited nonsense mutation in the non-deleted allele of NDE. The study shows a higher prevalence of large gene-rich CNVs in ACC than CBL and PM. The genomic burden of large, gene-rich, rare CNVs, particularly deletions, was higher in ACC patients than controls, but not in CBL or PM. The findings facilitate interpretation of CNV results in patients with developmental disorders and discovery of underlying genes and pathways.
Researchers investigated the role of the Hippo signaling cascade effector Yorkie (Yki) in planarian regeneration, using the freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea as a model. They found that in Yki(RNAi) regenerating animals, wound responses are hyperactivated, with increased stem cell proliferation and transcriptional wound program heightened and prolonged. Novel wound-induced genes were uncovered by RNAseq that were repressed in Yki(RNAi) animals compared to controls. Yki(RNA) animals had expanded epidermal and muscle populations, hypothesized to be sources of wound-induced genes. The sensing of injury size by eyes, pharynx, brain, gut, and midline was not appropriate, and could not scale correctly remodel to the size of the regenerating fragment. Results suggest Yki functions as a key molecule integrating injury response, including proliferation, apoptosis, injury-induced transcription, and patterning. In Yki(RNA) animals, proliferative and transcriptional injury responses were hyperactivated and temporally prolonged, with no block in differentiation, producing increased epidermal and muscle cells. Yki is not appreciably expressed in the stem compartment, suggesting extrinsic signals cause de-repression of the wound program, increasing stem response. Upregulation of key members of the transcription wound response was observed, with increased expression of genes prior to injury, indicating Yki's direct effect on wound response.
Exosomes released from EV71-infected cells contain viral and host factors that modulate recipient cellular response, resulting in productive infection. EV71 infection upregulates exosome secretion, packaging viral RNA and miR-146 into exosomes, with miR146 preferentially enriched in exosomes. Exosomes contain replication-competent EV71 RNA, miR146, Ago2, and GW182, mediating EV transmission independent of virus-specific receptors. Exosomal RNA is transferred and replicates in new cells, while exosomal miR146 suppresses type I interferon response, facilitating viral replication. IFN-stimulated gene factors, BST2/tether, regulate EV71-induced exosome upregulation. In vivo studies show exosomal RNA exhibits differential tissue accumulation compared to free particles. EV71-infected cells secrete exosomes with high mi146, facilitating replication in recipient cells by suppressing type I interferon response. Exosomal mi146 is co-packaged with EV genomic RNA, stabilizing viral RNA and suppressing IFNβ expression upon entry into host cells. Association of Ago2 and GW182 with EV RNA and mi146 in exosomes stabilizes viral RNA, facilitating replication, and enables mi146 to act on cognates in recipient cells, promoting EV71 infection.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the interaction between PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) and Parkin, two genes associated with early-onset Parkinson's disease, using Drosophila models. PINK is a serine/threonine kinase required for mitochondrial homeostasis, while Parkin is a RING-finger protein with ubiquitin-ligase activity. A PINK-binding protein, PGAM, was identified and found to modulate the PINK pathway, with loss of PG5 suppressing muscle degeneration, motor defects, and shorter lifespan resulting from PINK inactivation due to mitochondrial degeneration. However, PG5 inactivation did not modulate parkin mutant phenotypes, and ectopic expression of PG5 exacerbated PINK and parkin phenotypes. The results suggest PG5 negatively regulates the PINK pathway for mitochondrial maintenance and acts between PINK and parkin or independently of parkin downstream of PINK. Studies show PINK recruits parkin to damaged mitochondria, promoting degradation through mitophagy, but little is known about PINK regulation of mitochondrial integrity through parkin. The findings demonstrate PG5 modulates the PINK pathway in Dophila, but further work is needed to determine how PG5 regulates PINK at the molecular level and potential therapeutic implications for PINK-associated Parkinson's disease.
Interferon-γ plays a crucial role in early immune defense against Mycobacterium ulcerans infection in mice. Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is a chronic necrotizing human disease associated with the production of the cytotoxic macrolide mycolactone. Research has shown that interferon-γ knockout mice displayed faster progression of infection compared to wild-type mice, with accelerated tissue necrosis and edema formation, and higher bacterial burden after five weeks of infection. This indicates that mice lacking interferon-γ have reduced capacity to kill intracellular bacilli during the early-macrophage growth phase of M. ulcer. The study demonstrates a prominent role of interferon-γ in defense against M. ulcer infection, supporting the view that concepts for vaccine development against tuberculosis may be valid for Buruli ulcer. Evidence suggests clearance of M. ulcer infection by the immune system is possible, particularly before large clusters of mycolone-producing extracellular bacteria form. Interferonγ-dependent activation of bactericidal activity of macrophages helps contain the infection during its intracellular stages. Interferonγ, produced by TH1, TC, and NK cells, activates macroages to kill intracellular bacteria at an early stage of infection. The study used an experimental mouse model comparing disease progression in wild-type and interferonγ knockout mice during active infection with a virulent M. ulcer strain, showing interferonγ is critical for host defense against M ulcer infection.
Researchers have developed a new methodology to model the mechanism of reactive oxygen species generation in mitochondria, addressing the paradox of increased production under anoxia. The model reveals bistability of mitochondrial respiration, with complex III operating in low or high ROS-producing modes at the same environmental conditions. Anoxia can switch complex III to a high ROS-producing state, persisting after oxygen supply returns. Experiments validate this prediction, explaining anoxia-induced cell damage. The model constructs differential equations for each redox state based on algorithms reflecting red reactions between transporters, allowing expansion to other parts of the electron chain and metabolism. This method provides a new direction for detailed analysis of bioenergetic systems, enabling novel therapeutic strategies for oxidative stress. Anoxia increases ROS levels in isolated mitochondria, confirmed experimentally demonstrated for the first time, with higher amounts released upon oxygen resumption. Temporal anox and ADP presence can switch between low and high ROS-producing states, explaining differences in ROS generation before and after anoxia episodes. This understanding of bistability may lead to new strategies for managing oxidative stress, with the modeling method applicable to systems biology studies.
Researchers utilized an integrative systems-level approach to investigate the regulatory effect of the terminal gene huckin (hkb) on gap expression in the early embryo of Drosophila melanaster, providing a model to study the role of genes in pattern formation. The gap network constitutes the first zygotic tier in the hierarchy of segmentation genes involved in specifying the position of body segments. Quantitative expression data for the Hkb protein enabled inclusion in gap gene circuit models, which are mathematical models of gene networks used to extract regulatory information from spatial data. The results showed Hkb is involved in the regulation of the posterior hunchback domain but not any other essential function, specifically required for the anterior shift in the posterior border. The models presented gap circuits are able to reproduce mutants of terminal genes, capturing expression of all posterior genes and variational properties of the system. This is an important towards a better understanding of developmental and evolutionary dynamics of the gap network. The study confirms previous results and extends them by correctly reproducing the expression and shift of the posterior domain and dynamic of all posterior domains.
Brucellosis is a zoonotic disease causing significant economic losses worldwide, with no effective immunotherapy or biomarker for monitoring available. Researchers have developed a novel immunotherapy using phage lysates of Brucella abortus strains S19 and RB51, which induces antibody and cell-mediated immunity. A single subcutaneous dose of 2ml of a cocktail of both lysates eliminated virulent Brucella from infected cattle, with undetectable plasma Brucella-specific RNA and negative blood culture at 3 months post-immunization. Trials were conducted on 21 Bruclos-affected cows, divided into groups receiving S19 lysate, RB51 lysate, or a cocktail of both. The immunotherapeutic potential of phage lysates was assessed through interferon-producing lymphocytes and ELISP assay. Results showed successful elimination of virulent Brucella in 3 months. The study employed Brucella-specific RNA in plasma as a biomarker, allowing non-invasive monitoring of therapy efficacy. Phage lysates of RB51 and S19 retained maximum immunogenicity, opposed to heat or chemical inactivation. This is the first report of minimally invasive monitoring antibacterial therapy using RNA as a biomarker and RB51 phage lysate for Bruclos immunotherapy in cattle.
Researchers have identified a specific requirement for Cdk2 activity in the DNA damage response in human cells using chemical genetics. Cdk2 is active throughout S and G2 phases, but its protein is dispensable for survival due to compensation by other cyclin-dependent kinases. To uncover the requirement for Cdk2 activity, researchers replaced wild-type Cdk with a mutant version sensitized to inhibition by bulky adenine analogs. Transient inhibition of analog-sensitive Cdk2 after ionizing radiation enhances cell-killing, indicating a non-redundant requirement for Cdk activity in response to DNA damage. Cdk2 phosphorylates the Nijegen Breakage Syndrome product Nbs, a component of the conserved Mre11-Rad-Nbs complex, on a consensus CDK site at Ser432. In vivo, selective inhibition of Cdk delayed and diminished Nbs-S432 phosphorylation during S phase, and mutation of Ser432 to Ala or Asp increased IR-sensitivity. The study reveals a specific Cdk-dependent pathway within the DNA response of human cells, where Cdk2 plays a role in orchestrating an effective damage response by phosphorylating proteins de novo in response to DNA lesions. The findings suggest that Cdk2 has a specific function in the DNA damage response, distinct from other cyclin-dependent kinases, and that Nbs is a target of Cdk within the DNA repair machinery.
Researchers applied the formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements method to map active regulatory elements at loci associated with hematological traits, coronary artery disease, and myocardial infarction in megakaryocytic and erythroblast cell lines. The study revealed distinct patterns of open chromatin in the two cell types and identified an open chromatin region at chromosome 7q22.3 in megakocytes, but not erythroblasts, which harbors the non-coding variant rs293 associated with platelet volume and function. Resequencing this region provided evidence that rs293 is the putative causative variant. The C- and G-alleles differentially bind transcription factor EVI1, affecting PIKCG gene expression in platelets and macrophages. A protein-protein interaction network indicated PI3CG is associated with pathways in plate membrane biogenesis and thrombus formation. Rs293 is the functional variant at this locus, the first among platelet quantitative trait loci to be elucidated. The study suggests a molecular mechanism by which a non-coding GWA SNP modulates platelet phenotype. Six additional putative variants associated with hematological and cardiovascular traits were identified in open chromatin regions. The intersection of open chromatin maps with GWA variants facilitates the search for underlying functional variants, demonstrating the procedure with the locus at chromosome 7.22.3 associated with mean plate volume and function, elucidating the molecular mechanism contributing to plate phenotype.
Researchers investigated the effects of persistent sodium current blockade in respiratory circuits using computer simulations, focusing on two pharmacological mechanisms: pore obstruction by tetrodotoxin and altered inactivation by riluzole. The results matched experimental data from isolated neurons to intact networks and generated testable predictions. The study provided a mechanistic explanation for contradictory in vitro results, showed in vitro block effects are not equivalent to intact preparations, demonstrated why ruzole may fail to block sodium current in intact networks, and predicted low tetrotoxin will stop respiratory rhythm generation. Simulations supported a critical role for sodium in respiratory rhythmogenesis and highlighted the importance of considering mechanisms when interpreting pharmacological blockade. Tetrotoxin directly obstructs the sodium pore, while ruzole shifts inactivation in the hyperpolarizing direction. Ruzole blockade fails to completely block sodium, whereas tetroxin at low concentrations selectively blocks sodium without affecting action potential fast current. The study showed ruz may fail to block sodium due to its mechanism and network interactions, pre-bursting is dependent on inhibitory interactions and sodium, and tetroxin application terminates rhythmicity. Simulated tetroxin blockade does not yield reactivation by hyperpolarizing perturbations, unlike ruzole blockade.
MicroRNAs play a crucial role in tumor metastasis, and the regulation and function of miR-218 in gastric cancer metastasis has been investigated. miR218 expression is decreased in metastatic gastric cancer, along with its host gene Slit3, while Rob1, a Slit receptor, is negatively regulated by miR218, establishing a negative feedback loop. Decreased miR218 eliminates Rob1 repression, activating the Slit-Robo pathway through Rob1 and Slit2 interaction, triggering metastasis. Restoring miR218 suppresses Rob1 and inhibits tumor invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. A Slit-miR218-Robo circuit disruption contributes to gastric cancer metastasis, suggesting targeting miR218 as a strategy for blocking metastasis. Rob1 overexpression in cancer promotes angiogenesis and metastasis via Slit interaction. The inverse relationship between miR218 and Rob1 was confirmed in 40 gastric cancer cases, with Rob1 upregulated in metastatic cancer where miR218 has low expression. Loss of miR218 affects metastasis with Rob1 as a critical target, an axon guidance receptor for Slit. Induction of Rob1 without miR binding reverses mi218 suppression of tumor invasion, while Rob1 knockdown reduces tumor invasion similar to miR restoration.
Researchers investigated the transcriptional response of atherosclerotic lesions to plasma lipid-lowering therapy, using a mouse model with human-like hypercholesterolemia and a genetic switch to lower lipoproteins. Atherosclerotic lesions progressed slowly at first, then expanded rapidly, and plateaued after advanced lesions formed, with accumulation of lipid-poor macrophages leading to rapid expansion and foam cell formation. Lowering plasma cholesterol prevented formation of advanced plaques and identified 37 cholesterol-responsive genes mediating this effect. Validation by siRNA inhibition in macrophages revealed a network of eight cholesterol-responsive atherosclerosis genes regulating cholesterol-ester accumulation. Genome-wide expression profiling identified a point where atherosclerosis developed slowly with low-level inflammation, followed by rapid expansion and increased inflammation, leading to advanced plaques. The cholesterol-lowering effect was mediated by 37 cholesterol-responsive atheros genes, including regulators of foam-cell formation. Key genes, such as PVRL and HSDL, may be considered for therapies to prevent plaque formation. The study identified a network of atherosclerosis genes responding to plasma cholesterol-lowering, preventing advanced plaque formation, and merits attention for novel therapy development. The findings provide insight into molecular mechanisms of atherosclerotic wall induced by cholesterol-lowering and potential therapeutic targets.
Researchers have developed a high-throughput assay to identify mutants with envelope biogenesis defects in Escherichia coli and used it to screen an ordered-gene deletion library. The screen identified numerous known mutants involved in envelope assembly and implicated 102 genes of unknown function encoding factors that impact biogenesis. One factor, Ely, was characterized and plays a critical role in the metabolism of the lipid carrier for biogenesis of cell wall and surface polysaccharides. Further analysis of Ely and other hits is likely to uncover new information about biogenesis of Gram-negative envelope and vulnerabilities suitable for drug targeting. The assay is adaptable to other organisms to study biogenesis of different architectures. Understanding envelope assembly is key to combating resistance, with many aspects of Gram-negative assembly poorly characterized, including regulatory strategies to coordinate construction of different layers. Study of these factors may reveal mechanisms serving as targets to block growth or render the envelope permeable to approved drugs. Discovery of Ely validates the screening approach and its role in lipid metabolism has implications for biogenesis, particularly in Und-P production or recycling, with effects on extracellular polysaccharides synthesis pathways.
Researchers have developed a semi-supervised learning framework to fuse heterogeneous datasets and create an integrated view of multivariable dynamics in biological systems. This approach exploits the intrinsic geometry of high-dimensional datasets and can be applied to various imaging modalities. The method was demonstrated using a dataset from Drosophila pattern formation studies, resulting in a continuous trajectory that reveals joint dynamics of gene expression, cellular protein localization, phosphorylation, and tissue morphogenesis. The dataset consisted of approximately 100 images showing spatial positions of nuclei and distribution of components of the patterning network. Pairwise similarities between images were computed using a common channel to apply the semi-supervised approach. The result is a multivariable trajectory for joint dynamics of tissue shape and molecular components within the regulatory network. The reconstructed trajectories provide a basis for advanced mechanistic studies of multivariable processes responsible for developmental pattern formation. This systematic approach addresses the challenge of synthesizing data from different observations into coherent multivar trajectories, a task discussed in multiple contexts but lacking established methods. The outcome is a closed-form expression for estimated values of variables using harmonic extension, enabling further data analytics and modeling of biological dynamics.
Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) of classes PI, PII, and PIII were compared in terms of tissue localization and ability to hydrolyze basement membrane components in vivo. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed PII and PIII enzymes co-localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and post-capillary venules to a higher extent than PI, which showed a widespread distribution. Hydrolysis patterns of laminin, type collagen, and nidogen differed, but all enzymes showed similar degradation of type IV collagen, supporting its critical role in microvessel destabilization and hemorrhage. Proteomic analysis of wound exudate showed similarities and differences, with PI having higher proteolysis of extracellular components and fibrin, while PII and PIII had higher intracellular proteins. Results indicate SVs induce microvasculature damage and hemorrhage through selective localization in microvessels. PII and PIII SVs co-localized with type IV collagen in capillaries, arterioles, and venules, while PI had widespread distribution. Variable degradation patterns were observed for nidogen and laminin, but type IV collagen was hydrolyzed similarly by all enzymes. Proteomic analysis detected toxin-induced alterations not seen by traditional histology, revealing distinct SV localization patterns, with PII and PIII associated with microculature and PI widespread in tissue. Findings provide a new understanding of microvessel damage and hemorrhage by SVs.
The homeotic genes in Drosophila melanogaster are aligned on the chromosome in the order of the body segments they affect, with genes affecting more posterior segments repressing more anterior genes. However, this posterior dominance rule is qualified in the case of abdominal-A (ab-A) repression by Abdominal-B (Abd-B). Animals lacking Abd-B show ectopic expression of ab-A in the epidermis of the eighth segment but not in the central nervous system. Repression in neuronal cells is accomplished by a 92 kb noncoding RNA, "iab-8 RNA", which produces a micro RNA to repress ab-A and also has a second redundant mechanism acting "in cis". Transcriptional interference with the ab-A promoter is the likely mechanism. The iab8 RNA interferes with an ab-A enhancer downstream of the iab-418 breakpoint and the major poly site lies 1.1 kb upstream of initiation of ab-A. Two mechanisms repress ab-A, first through iab8 miRNA acting in trans and second repressive acting in cis. Rearrangements truncating iab RNA near start cause derepression of ab-A in CNS indistinguishable from Df(3)C4 homozygotes. Several lines of evidence suggest a 90 kb transcription unit between Abd and ab-A with start in iab8 region. RNA in situ hybridizations detect RNA in 8th and 9 abdominal segments.
Focal seizures are episodes of pathological brain activity that arise from a localized area of the brain and have been distinguished into two types: low amplitude fast oscillations and high amplitude spikes. Research has explored the mechanisms underlying these patterns using a computational model of neocortical tissue validated by clinical recordings. The low amplitude onset is initiated by independent patches of localized activity invading surrounding tissue, while the high amplitude is a global transition triggered by a local event enabled by increased excitability of surrounding tissue. Simulations show the difference in tissue excitability explains clinically reported differences in surgical outcomes. The model demonstrates changes in tissue excitability could be elucidated using active stimulation, suggesting surrounding tissue excitability plays a role in seizure pattern and surgical outcome. Two common onset patterns are reported: low amplitude fast activity with oscillations in the beta to gamma range and high amplitude with slower oscillations below alpha. The model reproduces the onset and evolution of seizures, including growing amplitude in low amplitude patterns developing into high-amplitude spiking activity. Cortical excitability measured by cortico-cortical evoked potentials is lower in low amplitude onsets compared to high amplitude, indicating distinct mechanisms generating different patterns.
Researchers have identified the role of defensin-like cysteine-rich protein Zm4 in maize, leading to pollen tube growth arrest, burst, and sperm release. Zm4 is exclusively expressed in female gametophyte cells and accumulates in vesicles at the secretory zone of mature synergid cells, released during fertilization. Using RNAi knockdown and synthetic Zm4 proteins, it was found that Zm4 induces pollen tube burst in a species-preferential manner. Pollen tube plasma membrane depolarization occurs after Zm4 application, and channel blocker experiments point to a role of K+ flux in the pollen rupture mechanism. The intrinsic rectifying K channel K1 is a direct target of Zm4, opening at physiological potentials and closing after washout. Vesicles containing Zm4 are released from sygid upon male-female gamophyte signaling, interacting with K1, resulting in channel opening and K influx, leading to water uptake and osmotic burst. The species-preferential activity of Zm4 indicates a prezygotic hybridization barrier and component of reproductive isolation in plants. Z4 converts potassium channel K1 from voltage-dependent to non-rectifying, inducing pollen rupture in vitro in a species-preferential manner. Silencing Z4 results in pollen tubes failing to release contents, occasionally showing overgrowth inside the egg apparatus. The discovery of Z4's role provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of pollen tube arrest and burst, and its connection to pathways such as FER or LRE signaling and ACA2 pumps, shedding light on double fertilization in flowering plants.
Researchers have developed a HER2-targeted oncolytic herpes virus, R249, which selectively infects and kills tumor cells expressing high levels of human HER2, a protein overexpressed in ovarian and breast cancers. In mouse models of disseminated ovarian and breast carcinomas, intraperitoneal administration of R249 strongly inhibited carcinomatosis, resulting in 60% of mice free from peritoneal diffusion and 95% reduction in total weight of neoplastic nodules. R249 also inhibited growth of ovarian metastases of HER2+ breast cancer cells and reduced brain metastases. The virus was effective against HER2+ trastuzumab-resistant cells, an important for clinical application. In murine hosts, R249 inhibited peritone dissemination of HER2 ovarian and mammary carcinomas. R249 retargeted to human HER2, unlikely to infect cells with low HER2 expression, such as non-cancer cells. Viral replication occurred in ovary and brain HER2 metastatic deposits, with strong antimetastatic effect against peritone metastases of breast cancers and some therapeutic effect on extraperitone metastases. Overall, HER2-redirected oncolytic HSV reduced growth of ovarian and breast carcinomas disseminated to peritone cavity.
Centrosome duplication once per cell cycle is essential for bipolar spindle formation and genome maintenance, controlled in part by cyclin-dependent kinases. The study identifies Sfi, a conserved component of centrosomes, as the first Cdk substrate required to restrict centrosome duplication to once per cycle. Reducing Cdk phosphorylation of Sfi by changing phosphorylation sites to non-phosphorylatable residues leads to defects in separation of duplicated spindle pole bodies and inappropriate duplication during mitosis. Cells display defects in bipolar assembly, chromosome segregation, and growth. Phosphorylation of S1 by Cdk promotes SP separation for spindle formation and prevents premature SP duplication. Protein phosphatase Cdc has the converse role of activating, likely via dephosphlation of S1. Cdk phosphorylates at least four S1 C-terminal residues, allowing SP separation and bipolar formation during mitosis. Dephosphlation of S1 by Cdc at the end of mitosis licenses the SPBs for the next cycle of G1 SP duplication. Non-phosphlatable s1 mutations lead to premature licensing of SP duplication during mitosis, pointing to S1 as the first target of Cdk in blocking redup. Decrease in C1 activity eliminates the block to SP duplication, allowing SPBs to become licensed for duplication.
The HIV-1 protein Vpr accelerates viral replication during acute infection by exploiting proliferating CD4+ T cells in vivo. Vpr causes G2 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis predominantly in proliferating CCR5+ CD4 cells, mainly regulatory T cells, resulting in Treg depletion and enhanced virus production. This effect is observed in CCR-tropic but not CXCR-tropic HIV-1-infected mice, suggesting dependence on coreceptor usage. Immune activation occurs in CCR-tropic wild-type but not vpr-deficient HIV1-infected humanized mice. Depleting Tregs with denileukin difox increases activation and proliferation of memory cells, enhancing C5 expression and susceptibility to CCR-tropic HIV1. Vpr takes advantage of proliferating C5+CD4 cells to enhance viremia of CCR-tropic HIV1. Tregs are more vulnerable due to Vpr exploitation during acute HIV1 infection as they exist in a higher cycling state. The study demonstrates Vpr plays a crucial role in accelerating C5-tropic HIV propagation by utilizing C5+CD4 cells, including Tregs. Significant Vpr-dependent G2 arrest and apoptosis in R5 HIV1-infected Tregs leads to Treg depletion and immune activation. This is the first report to show Vpr positively affects HIV1 replication by taking advantage of Tregs in vivo.
Microsatellite DNA analysis revealed a drastic genetic change in the Plasmodium vivax population in the Republic of Korea during 2002 and 2003. Vivax malaria was eliminated in South Korea in the late 1970s but re-emerged in 1993. To control and evaluate malaria, understanding the genetic structure of the parasite population is crucial. Analysis of 14 microsat DNA loci from 163 Korean isolates collected from 199 to 8 showed a decrease in linkage disequilibrium levels and genetic differentiation between successive years, suggesting a drastic change in the population. Results indicate continual introduction of P vivax into Korea through other sources, possibly North Korea, particularly during 200 and 200. Molecular epidemiology using microsat DNA is effective for assessing population structure and dynamics, assisting in elimination of vivax malaria. The study used allelic data to analyze linkage disequilibrium, genetic differentiation, and population structure, providing a detailed estimate of temporal change in the parasite population. The drastic change may be influenced by North Korean vivax cases and chemoprophylaxis by South soldiers. The number of vivax cases in South Korea fluctuated between 864 and 2,227 per year from 200 to201, indicating changes in endemicity, with low recombination rate of the P viv population.
Enhancement of transcription by splicing-competent introns is an evolutionarily conserved feature among eukaryotes, with the molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon not entirely clear. Research shows the intron is an important regulator of promoter directionality, with strand-specific transcription analysis indicating transcription of mRNA favored over antisense transcripts in the presence of an intron. Mutation of 5' or 3' splice sites resulted in reversal of directionality, suggesting the entire splicing-compet intron regulates transcriptionality. ChIP analysis revealed recruitment of termination factors near the promoter region in the presence of an intron, with removal or mutation of splice sites affecting factor localization. Intron-mediated enhancement of transcription is dependent on gene looping, which is crucial for recruitment of termination factors in the promoter-proximal region of intron-containing genes. A looping-defective mutant showed compromised promoter occupancy of termination factors and loss of directionality despite normal splicing. Results propose intron-dependent looping places terminator-bound factors near the promoter for termination of upstream antisense transcription, conferring directionality. Transcriptionality of a subset of genes in yeast is dependent on the presence of a splicing-compet intron, facilitating recruitment of CF1, CPF, and Rat1 termination complexes near the promoter. Intron-dependent looping facilitates recruitment of termination factors near the promoter, with mutation of splice sites reducing promoter occupancy of termination factors. The presence of a splicing-compet intron facilitates recruitment of termination factors, stopping antisense transcription and providing direction to promoter-initiated transcription.
Researchers have identified a novel transcription factor, ZBED6, derived from a domesticated DNA transposon, which regulates IGF2 expression and muscle growth. A single nucleotide substitution in intron 3 of IGF2 in pigs abrogates a binding site for the repressor ZBED, leading to 3-fold upregulation of IGF in skeletal muscle, affecting muscle size, heart, and fat deposition. Silencing ZBED in mouse C2C12 myoblasts affected Igf expression, cell proliferation, wound healing, and myotube formation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing identified 2,500 ZBED binding sites in the genome, with a consensus motif matching the established site in Igf2. Genes associated with ZBED sites showed enrichment for development and transcriptional regulation. Phenotypic effects in mutant pigs and ZBED-silenced C2 myoblasts, sequence conservation, nucleolar localization, and broad distribution suggest Z6 is an important transcription factor in placental mammals, affecting development, cell proliferation and growth. Binding of ZBED to target sites leads to repression of IGF expression in skeletal muscle and C2 cells. Disruption of ZBED and IGF interaction leads to increased IGF expression and altered body composition. Silencing ZBED resulted in increased cell proliferation, myotube formation and wound healing. ZBED interacts with over 1,000 genes, including those involved in cell proliferation and cancer, and is detected in nuclei of postnatal muscle and brain tissue.
Researchers have generated a comprehensive profile of the RNA editome in rhesus macaques, a close relative of humans, by combining genome and transcriptome sequencing of multiple tissues from the same animal, identifying 31,250 editing sites, 99.8% of which are A-to-G transitions. Verification of 96.6% of editing sites in coding regions and 97.5% of randomly selected non-coding regions demonstrated the feasibility of the experimental approach. Adenosine deamination is associated with the macaque editome, with A-to-G sites flanked by sequences with attributes of ADAR substrates, and sequence and expression of ADARs influencing editing variance across sites and tissue types. Evolutionary constraint maintains some editing sites, with decreased divergence detected around editing sites, suggesting functional relevance. The findings support the continuous model of tinkering-based origination of functional editing sites. The study highlights RNA editing as a widespread regulation in primate evolution and provides a framework for understanding RNA editing in humans. The macaque editome shows intra-population conservation and parallels across primate species, with cross-species similarities maintained by purifying selection due to functional implications of regulations. Local sequence context of editing sites is important for RNA regulation and ADAR substrate formation. The study verifies RNA editing as a form of functional regulation shaped by purifying selection, providing an evolutionary context for understanding RNA regulation in humans.
Researchers have discovered a new perceptual bias in two-alternative visual discrimination tasks, where observers decode sensory responses with remarkably low precision when discriminating spatial frequencies. Using spectrally filtered noise, an asymmetry is induced in the likelihood function of spatial frequency, mainly affecting irrelevant frequencies. Despite this, a significant shift in perceived grating frequency occurs, indicating evaluation of a broad range of irrelevant frequencies and discarding prior knowledge of stimulus alternatives. Filtered visual noise alters perception of gratings, shifting spatial frequency to lower and higher frequencies in low-pass and high-pass conditions. Observers consider log likelihood of spatial frequencies unlikely to occur, lowering detectability and biasing perceived frequency. Log functions are asymmetrical around the veridical grating frequency in filtered noise. High contrast gratings were presented, corresponding to 84%-correct detection thresholds in broadband noise, with steep psychometric functions indicating decisions based on verical spatial frequency. Signal uncertainty has been studied, but not in neural decoding context. The model differs from traditional psychophysical models, assuming external noise affects variability without changing average response. Filtered noise backgrounds alter grating perception, low-pass decreasing and high-pass increasing spatial frequency, dramatically changing detectability and discriminability.
Researchers have discovered that piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) in Caenorhabditis elegans are transcribed as autonomous units, requiring only a 21-nucleotide sequence and a 50-nucleotide upstream motif for expression. This motif is necessary for germline-enriched, Pi-dependent piRNA expression and a single nucleotide within it directs differential germline enrichment. Over 70% of C. elegans piAs are selectively expressed in male or female germl, suggesting independent evolution of these populations. The upstream motif acts as a promoter, specifying which sequences are expressed as piAs, their abundance, and germl. With over 15,000 unique piRNA sequences, the number of transcriptional units encoding piAs rivals the number of mRNA genes in the C. eleg genome. Combining computational and transgenic approaches, the conserved core motif defines the piRNA transcription cassette, specifying expression of 21 RNAs from genomic thymines. Autonomous expression of synthetic 21 RNAs occurs from minimal transgenic cassettes consisting of the core motif, spacer, 21 RNA sequence, and flanking context. Single-copy transgenes show the clustered organization of endogenous piRNA loci is dispensable for robust piRNA expression, indicating each 21 RNA locus encodes all necessary information for independent transcription. The conserved motif influences germl enrichment of dependent 21 RNA species, with a single nucleotide position directing differential expression in male or female germl.
Brucella species replicate within host cells in endoplasmic retic reticulum-derived vacuoles, but the mechanisms by which they acquire these vacoles and obtain a continuous membrane supply for replication remain unclear. The IRE pathway of the unfolded protein response is activated in a time-dependent manner during Brucella infection, with upregulation of COPI vesicle components Sar1, Sec23, and Sec24. A novel host factor, YipA, is identified for activation of the IRE pathway in response to tunicamycin treatment and Brucella infection. YipA is responsible for phosphorylation of IRE through high-order assembly of Ire molecules at ER exit sites under unfolded protein response conditions. YipA-knock cells fail to generate ER-derived vacoles and remain in endosomal/lysosomal compartments. Autagy-related proteins Atg9 and WIPI, but not DFC1, are required for biogenesis of ER-derived compartments. Activation of the IRE pathway and subsequent formation of ER-derived vacoles are critical for Brucella to establish a safe replication niche and YipA is indispensable for these processes. The study proposes a model for intracellular Brucella replication exploiting host unfolded protein response and ER-derived vacole machineries dependent on Y1-mediated IRE activation.
Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIR) recruit the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) into the large replication compartment, which is crucial for viral replication. The function of Vps34 is critical for TV replication, suggesting that PI(3) phosphoinositide is utilized by TV for building the replication compartment. Increased expression of Vps and higher abundance of PI(3) in the presence of tombusviral proteins leads to efficient tombvirus replication. Overexpression of PI(3) phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibits TV replication on peroxomal membranes and IR replication on mitochondrial. The purified PI(3)phosphatase reduces TV replicase assembly in a cell-free system. Detection of PI(3) with antibody or bioprobe reveals enrichment of PI(3) in the replication compartment. Vps is recruited into the replication through interaction with p33 protein. Gene analysis shows TV requires vesicle transport of Vps, and in absence of Vps, TV cannot recruit Rab-positive endosomes for membrane biogenesis. Vps and PI(3) are necessary for stability of p33 protein, degraded by 26S proteasome when PI(3) is decreased. Vps and PI(3) provide optimal environment for replication of peroxomal TV and mitochondrial IR.
Researchers conducted a study in Iquitos, Peru, to assess the feasibility of feeding Aedes aegypti mosquitoes on dengue virus-infected human volunteers for vector competence studies. Between 2011 and 2015, 58 participants with viremia ranging from 1.3 × 10^2 to 2.9 ×10^6 focus-forming units per mL participated in artificial and natural blood feeding methods. Mosquitoes were tested after 14 days of extrinsic incubation for DENV infection and dissemination. DENV infection and dissemination rates were not significantly different following direct and indirect-EDTA feeding, but lower for mosquitoes fed indirectly on blood with no additive. Dissemination rates were similar across all methods, with no differences detected in DENV infection or dissemination in mosquitoes fed directly on participants with different deng illness severity. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using direct and indirect feeding methods for field-based studies on vector competence, with direct mosquito feeding preferable in terms of logistical ease, biosecurity, and reliability. Statistical analysis included 2,120 individual mosquitoes exposed to the blood of 49 participants, with nine excluded due to undetectable viremia or unavailable samples. The study aimed to compare DENV infection and dissemination in mosquitoes fed on humans and blood, correlate results to infectious particles, and obtain data on the ability of DENV from people with mild disease to infect mosquitoes.
Researchers investigated the variability in sensitivity to anti-neoplastic drugs that target topoisomerase II using the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans and found that wild strains of C. elegans vary in their sensitivity to these drugs. An unbiased genetic approach demonstrated that this variation is explained by a methion-to-glutamine substitution in topoisomerase (TOP-2). The presence of non-polar methion at this residue increases hydrophobic interactions between TOP-2 and poison etopide, compared to polar glutamine. The affected residue is conserved from yeast to humans and differs between human topoisomerase II isoforms, with methion in hTOPIα and glutamine in hPIβ. This difference influences cytotoxicity of topoisomerase poisons in human cell lines, explaining why hPIα and hPIβ are differentially affected by various poisons. The study used genome-edited human cell lines to show the residue in hPIα contributes to differential toxicity of topoisomerase poisons. Results demonstrate the power of using C. elegans natural variation to identify mechanisms of drug susceptibility in human cells, informing health decisions based on genetic information. Genome-edited top-2 strains showed variation underlies differences in some but not all topoisomerase poisons, with cells containing glut-edited hPII allele less affected by tenipide and XK.
Researchers investigated the genetics of lifespan determination by analyzing genomic and transcriptomic data from 17 rodent species, focusing on African mole-rats with exceptionally long lifespans. They identified 250 positively selected genes associated with enhanced longevity, which showed an expression pattern fitting the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging in long-lived naked mole-rats and short-lived rats. These genes were enriched for terms related to aging, including cellular respiration, metal homeostasis, and processes regulated by the mTOR pathway, such as translation, autophagy, and inflammation. Notable genes included RHE, a regulator of mTOR, and IGF, central components of aging-relevant pathways, and novel candidates RBL1, AMHR, PSM, and AGER. Expression analysis revealed downregulation in long-lived and upregulation in short-lived rodents, consistent with the antagonistic pleiotropy theory. The mTOR pathway plays a critical role in regulating inflammatory and immune responses. The study provides a resource to link identified genes and amino acids under selection to aging and lifespan, offering insights into genetic mechanisms determining mammalian lifespan, with implications for understanding aging in long-lived mammals like humans.
Researchers have developed a new Aedes albopictus transfection line, ARW-M, by introducing wMel Wolbachia into the ARW line, which had previously replaced wAlb and wAlb Wolbach with wP strain. The ARW-M line showed 100% maternal inheritance of wMel and wP Wolbach. Survival, female fecundity, and fertility did not differ between ARW-M, ARW, and wild-type Aedes albopictus. Crosses between AR-M males and wild-type females were fully infertile, while egg hatch in reverse crosses increased with age. AR-M males induced higher sterility than expected when competing with wild-type males. Wolbach density in AR-M females was 15-fold higher, mostly due to wMel, corresponding to reduced vector competence for chikungunya and deng viruses. Transmission rates were 5 and 0% at 14 and 21 days post-infection, respectively. No significant differences were found for Zika virus between AR-M and ARW, but none of AR-M females transmitted Zika. The introduction of wMel in ARW had a profound impact on vector competence, with wAlA and wAlB not interfering with transmission, and wP not blocking the virus. These findings promote the exploitation of Wolbach to suppress wild-type Aedes populations.
Researchers analyzed high-resolution three-dimensional structures of protein interactions to identify novel peptide-mediated interactions, focusing on the observation that peptides adopt a well-defined structure upon binding to their partner domains. The analysis revealed characteristic structural features of motifs, including a stretched and elongated shape, distinct from other peptides of the same length. A Support Vector Machine-based strategy was implemented to identify unnoticed peptide-mediated interactions among known 3D structures, incorporating structural features and interface information. Derived patterns were compared to established linear motifs and binding domains, and cross-validated on interactome networks from four organisms, revealing significant over-representations of 64 domain-motif interactions, including 46 previously undescribed interactions involving 6,000 peptides. High-resolution 3D structures provided crucial information on protein recognition, specificity, and context, and identified key residues in binding pockets. The study exploited structural data to find new instances of peptide-mediated interactions among 50,000 high-resolution 3D structures in the PDB, recognizing structural features of peptides and considering the interaction environment to identify domain-motif interactions. The results include a list of novel peptide-binding domains, high-resolution 3D structures, and consensus motifs, providing molecular details of the binding.
Environmental enteropathy is associated with growth failure, micronutrient malabsorption, and impaired responses to oral vaccines. A study of 49 adults with environmental enteropathy in Lusaka, Zambia, used confocal laser endomicroscopy, histology, immunohistochemistry, and mRNA sequencing of small intestinal biopsies, and correlated with plasma lipopolysaccharide and zinc uptake. Results showed virtually ubiquitous small intestinal damage and epithelial defects, predominantly at the tips of villi, corresponding with leakage in vivo. Circulating lipopolysaccharide correlated with cell shedding and serum glucagon-like peptide-2. Zinc uptake was attenuated in 64% of individuals and reduced by HIV, but positively correlated with glucagon-like peptide-2. Transcript analysis identified 23 differentially expressed genes in severe enteropathy, including protective peptides and proteins. Epithelial defects, identified by confocal endomicroscopy and claud 4 immunostaining, are probable sites of bacterial translocation. Increased epithelial surface area increases the burden of translocation. Glucagon-like peptide-2 and other peptides may play a role in mucosal protection in environmental enteropathy. Biomarkers of microbial translocation and inflammation were compared with confocal images and zinc uptake to explore barrier defects and identify potential biomarkers. Severe enteropathy was associated with reduced expression of DMT1, contributing to impaired zinc uptake. Hypochlorhydria was common, but unlikely to be the explanation for impaired zinc uptake. The study suggests many Zambian adults live with a constant source of chronic inflammation due to epithelial breaches associated with high lipopolysaccharide.
Turnip crinkle virus (TCV) blocks re-infection of host cells by the same or highly similar viruses through superinfection exclusion (IE), a phenomenon determined by p28, one of the two replication proteins encoded by the virus. p28 expressed from TCV exerts strong IE to different TCV, and its repressive activity is enhanced by C-terminally fused epitope tags or fluorescent proteins but weakened by N-terminal modifications. p28 forms large, mobile inclusions that aggregate non-coalescing, IE-defective yet replication-competent p28 mutant, supporting a model where TCV IE is caused by formation of multimer p28 complexes intercepting fresh p28 monomers from superinfecting genomes, abolishing superfect replication. The study demonstrates p28 acts as replication facilitator and repressor depending on cellular concentration, forming multimer intracellular inclusions inactivating p28 from superinfectors, denying superfectors chance to replicate. The mechanism could be applicable to other RNA viruses, offering novel targets for antiviral therapy. p28 subcellular localization was examined by expressing it as fusion with GFP attached to its C-terminus, revealing post-translational interaction with p28/p88 encoded by different RNA. The findings provide insights into TCV IE, where p28 acts as replication facilitator and repressor, and its repression involves post-translational interaction with p28/p88, predicting a novel target for antiviral therapy.
Immunization with Trypanosoma cruzi trans-sialase (TS) using plasmid DNA, adenoviral vector, and CpG-adjuanted protein has proven highly immunogenic and provides protection against acute challenge. However, long-term protection by DNA vaccines has not been reported. Co-administration of plasm encoding IL-15 (pIL-15) with plasm encoding TS (pTS) was tested to improve duration of protection. BALB/c mice immunized with pTS with or without pIL15 showed TS-specific IFNγ responses and survived lethal challenge within 3 months. Addition of p15 did not alter responses during early post-vaccination. However, mice vaccinated with pTS and p15 challenged 6 months post-vacc were more protected against lethal T cruzi than pTS alone. Improved protection correlated with higher TS-specific IFN producing and CD8 T cells detected 6 months postimmunization. These cells expanded better after in vitro restimulation. Addition of p15 improved long-term cell survival, memory, and protection against Tcruzi. Vaccination with pTS or pTS p15 elicited strong TS-specific T responses 3 months postvacc. Potent TS antibody responses were observed 6 months postvacc in pTS but not protected against Tcruzi. Combination of p15 and pTS induced higher CD4 Th1 and TS IFN producing CD8 cells with enhanced proliferative capacity. No differences in TS IgG responses were detected between pTS and pTS p15 vaccinated mice. Challenge with lethal Tcru showed improved protection in pTS p15 vaccinated mice compared to pTS alone.
Researchers have identified a Cullin4-based ubiquitin ligase complex, CRLW1, which regulates Polo-like kinase abundance in Trypanosoma brucei, promoting bilobe duplication, basal body segregation, and flagellum attachment. The complex consists of Cull, DNA-binding protein homolog TbDB1, and WD-repeat protein W1. W1 interacts with Polo-like kinase through its C-terminal domain and binds to TbDB through its N-terminal WD motif. Depletion of W1 inhibits bilobe duplication, disrupts flagellum attachment, and causes excessive accumulation of Polo-like kinase in the basal body and bilobe, leading to continuous phosphorylation of Centrin. W1 localizes to the basal and bilobe region during the cell cycle and functions as a Polo-like receptor in the Cull ubiquitin ligase complex. Depletion of W1 impairs Polo-like ubiquination and degradation, resulting in defective bilobe duplication, FAZ assembly, and flagum attachment. The study reveals a novel WD-repeat protein as a Polo-like receptor in the Cull-DB ubiquitin ligase for degrading Polo-like in the basal and bilobe after the G/S cell transition, promoting bilobe duplication, basal separation, and flagell-cell adhesion. CRLW1 is responsible for Polo-like degradation in the basal and bilobe, regulating diverse cellular processes in eukaryotes.
Researchers have identified the RNA helicase DDX3 as a crucial mediator of innate antimicrobial immunity, demonstrating its pivotal and sex-specific role in the immune system. Mice lacking DDX3 in hematopoiesis exhibited altered leukocyte composition in bone marrow and spleen, and were unable to combat Listeria monocytogenes infection due to decreased effector cell availability and impaired cytokine synthesis. The loss of DDX3 impacted the immune system through its role in hematopoies and regulation of innate response to Lister infections. DDX3 belongs to the DEAD-box RNA helic superfamily with widespread functions in RNA metabolism and has been identified as a regulator of IFN transcription in infected cells. DDX3 deficiency altered the expression of genes contributing to antimicrobial response in macrophages in a sex-dependent manner. The discovery highlights the essential contribution of non-RL DEx/H RNA helic to innate immunity and suggests it may contribute to sex differences in resistance to microbes and inflammatory disease. DDX3 deficiency resulted in altered bone marrow and splenic populations and susceptibility to L infection. The study demonstrates the vital role of sex-specific DDX isoforms in innate immunity to Lister and provides further evidence for the role of non-RL DEx RNA helic in antimicrobial responses.
A biophysical model of pheromone transduction in male moth olfactory neurons has been developed, accounting for pre- and post-effector processes, including pheromone molecule translocation, receptor interaction, and G-protein activation, and second messenger production. The model simulates the evolution of chemical species and membrane potentials in response to pherone stimulation, capturing the main features of dose-response curves, rising and falling times, and reproducing second messenger kinetics. The results suggest two depolarizing ionic channels play different roles at low and high pherone concentrations, with DAG-gated cation channel at low and Ca+-gated Cl channel at middle and high concentrations. The model fits experimental data and makes testable predictions for future developments. Olfactory receptor neurons recognize odor molecules through hundreds of proteins in vertebrates and a smaller number in insects. Recent studies indicate insect ORs can activate independently of G-protein coupled pathways through ionotropic pathways. G-proteins are functional in moth pherone-responding ORNs and required for pherone stimuli response in Xenopus oocytes. The model takes advantage of vertebrate olfactory transduction studies and addresses post-effector processes in insects, providing insights into pherone transduction mechanisms.
Researchers investigated how p53 sequences and chromatin context interact to affect p53 binding and gene transactivation in response to cellular stress. Genome-wide mapping of p53 and H3K4me in human lymphoid cells treated with doxorubicin revealed relationships between p53 occupancy, gene expression, H3Kme, chromatin accessibility, and p53 sequence conservation. Inducible p53-regulated genes were associated with steady-state chromatin status and repressive histone modifications. Weaker p53s resided in open promoters while stronger p53s were in enhancers and repressed chromatin. p53 occupancy correlated with DNA sequence similarity but inversely with pre-existing nucleosome accessibility and conservation. Occupancy of p53 REs overlapping transposable elements was higher and correlated with stronger p53 sequences. However, binding at these elements was not associated with transactivation of adjacent genes. p53 regulated response appears tuned via evolutionary processes leading to repression or utilization of p53s from primate transposon elements. The study examined genome-wide changes in p53 binding, H3me, gene expression, and DNase hypersensitivity induced by doxorin in human lymphoid cell lines, assessing changes in ENCODE chromatin states and p53 sequence content. The interaction between features appears shaped by evolutionary pressure driven by transposable elements, highlighting the importance of sequence and epigenetic factors in interpreting p53 stress responses.
Researchers have explored the signal-response relationship in a specific motif found in two-component signaling systems, where a single histidine kinase phosphotransfers reversibly to two separate response regulator proteins. This motif allows for rapid signal termination and implements a sigmoidal signal relationship under experimentally observed parameters from bacteria and yeast. Two mathematical conditions on system parameters necessary for sigmoidal signal relationships were identified, defining key parameters controlling threshold and sensitivity of the signal curve. Experimental reconstitution of the motif in the Sinorhizobium meliloti chemotaxis pathway confirmed these findings, showing level of sigmoidality can be controlled by the presence of a sink and an auxiliary protein binding to the histidine kinase. The one-two motif enables tunable switch-like signal processing, providing a basis for developing threshold devices for synthetic biology applications. Two-component systems consist of a histidine kinase and response regulator, with activity controlled by environmental stimuli, and are utilized by bacteria, eukaryotic microbes, and plants for signal transduction. A generic model of the one-two motif was developed, revealing capability for enhancing termination and implementing threshold-response, displaying sigmoidal relationship in steady state phosphorylated output levels. Findings have implications for understanding bacterial physiology, designing synthetic circuits, and any two-component circuits with multiple regulators competing for phosphorylation.
Researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells responding to stress, revealing significant regulatory variation in individual cells before and after stress. A subset of cells decouples expression of ribosomal protein genes from the environmental response, partly correlated with the cell cycle but unrelated to the ultradian metabolic cycle. Live-cell imaging showed coordinated and decoupled nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of transcription factors, including Msn2, Dot6, Sfp, and MAP kinase Hog1. Results suggest cells maintain a filter against decoupled bursts of transcription factor activation but mount a stress response upon coordinated regulation, even in a subset of unstressed cells. The study found variable activation of both ESR and condition-specific regulators after stress and heterogeneity in ESR activation in unstressed cells due to coordinated and discordant induction of ESR regulators. Cell-to-cell variation in M2 activation could explain heterogeneity in stress tolerance, and M2 overexpression is sufficient to induce multistress tolerance in yeast. The study provides new insights into heterogeneity in yeast stress response, showing that regulation of induced-Environmental Response and repressed-Environmental Response genes can be decoupled in wild-type cells, and fluctuations in response correlate with cell phase.
Trypanosoma brucei triggers a marked immune response in male reproductive organs. African trypanosomias is caused by the protoan parasite Tryosoma bruce, transmitted between mammals by the bite of a tse. The parasite accumulates in large numbers in various organs and tissues, including the testis. Research shows parasites can be detected by fine aspiration of the male system and histological analysis revealed T. bruce accumulates in the stroma of epidid, epidal adipose tissue, and fibrous tunics of testis. No parasites were found in the lumen of epididymal ducts or seminiferous tubules, indicating the majority are not in immune-privileged sites. These parasites are associated with inflammatory infiltration, degeneration, and tissue damage of epidymal ducts, which may be related to reduced fertility. The detection of high parasites in this organ opens the possibility of using fine aspiration as a diagnostic tool. Epidym and test are circumscribed by adipose tissue a reservoir of T. bruce parasites. Immunohistochemistry analyzed the presence of tryosomes at stages post-infection in test, epidym, epidal adipose tissue. The majority of parasites located in stroma epidym, epidal adipose, not protected by tissue barriers. T.bruce infection associated with inflammation reproductive organs, disruption blood-test, blood-epidym barriers. Accumulation in male organs since day 6 post-infection, epidym adipose, stroma epidym most parasitized, attain 105 parasites per mg late disease.
Researchers investigated the plasticity of the chemoreceptor repertoire in Drosophila melanaster to understand how chemosensation is mediated by large families of chemoreceptor proteins in response to environmental changes. Using customized cDNA microarrays, they found that chemoreceptor genes clustered in the genome undergo independent transcriptional regulation at different developmental stages and between sexes. Expression of distinct subgroups of chemoreceptor genes is sensitive to reproductive state and social interactions. Exposure to odors of the opposite sex alters transcript abundance of chemoreceptor genes, distinct from those altered by physical contact with same or opposite sex members. Analysis revealed 20 small biologically relevant modules of correlated transcripts, enabling fine-tuning of chemoreceptor expression in response to environmental and physiological conditions. The study showed transcription profiles of chemosens genes are highly plastic during development, aging, mating, and social contexts, with sexually dimorphic and antagonistic expression. The modular organization of chemens transcriptome allows phenotypic plasticity of chemoreceptor under different conditions. Transcriptional responses to environments are modular, yet chemosens genes can alter expression independently under various external conditions. The findings provide systematic description of plasticity of chemosensory window through which flies experience their environment.
Meiotic recombination in human oocytes has been linked to the origin of trisomies, with abnormal recombination events near or far from the centromere associated with nondisjunction at meiosis I or II. Studies have used immunofluorescence methodology to examine the meiotic recombination process, analyzing crossover-associated proteins such as MLH1 in fetal oocytes. The number of MLH foci is lower than predicted, but its localization conforms to expected patterns for a crossover protein. Observations provide evidence for "vulnerable" crossover configurations in fetal oocytes, consistent with the idea that these lead to nondisjunction events in adult oocytes. Analysis of 103 prophase oocytes from 31 ovarian samples evaluated MLH as a marker of crossing-over and found achiasmate chromosomes and suboptimal patterns. Direct analysis revealed "vulnerable" crossover configurations with chromosome specificity consistent with trisomic conceptions, such as distally located exchanges for chromosome 16 and proximal and distal exchanges for chromosome 21. However, some results were inconsistent, with no evidence of increased distal or proximal MLH foci on chromosome 21 despite association with meiosis I and II-derived trisomy 21 cases. Overall, the study characterizes genome-wide recombination in females, providing insights into the relationship between meiotic recombination and subsequent nondisjunction.
Blood-feeding arthropods, such as mosquitoes, sand flies, and ticks, transmit diseases that impose significant public health and economic burdens. When these arthropods bite mammals, they inject saliva containing immunogenic compounds that facilitate feeding, eliciting immune responses that can alter disease progression if the host becomes infected. Pre-exposure to arthrop saliva can both exacerbate and limit infection symptoms, depending on the system, with implications for recovery. A general model of vector-borne disease shows that the abundance of pre-sensised infected hosts increases when control efforts moderately increase vector mortality. If preensisation leads to rapid infection clearance, increasing vector mortality achieves greater disease control, but when preensisation prolongs infection duration, control can increase infected hosts. Sensitivity analysis suggests negative consequences can be mitigated through integrated management. Experimental evidence from rodent leishmanis models shows immunological effects of preexposure wane over time. Understanding preensised hosts' contribution to transmission is key to estimating saliva's impact on epidemiology. Models predict adverse control consequences can be avoided if transmission probability from preensised hosts is smaller than naïve hosts. Pre-exposure alters epidemiological outcomes positively or negatively, but precise predictions are hindered by gaps in knowledge of preensisation's effect on clinical and transmission.
Leishmaniasis is a significant disease affecting 12 million people worldwide, with 2 million new cases annually, and Leishmania amazonensis is a major agent in Brazil, causing varying clinical forms from localized to diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis. To study the effect of the host immune system on Leishmania proteins, researchers compared proteomes of amastotes isolated from BALB/c and BAL/c nude mice. The athymic nude mice resemble patients with diffuse cutaneous leishiasis, considered T-cell hyposensitive or anergic to Leishmania antigens. Among 44 differentially expressed proteins, those related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and proteases were identified, including known Leishmania virulence factors such as oligopeptidase B and tryparedin peroxidase. Specific isoforms of these proteins increased in parasites from nude mice, suggesting T cells restrain post-translational modifications in BAL/c mice. Conversely, an isoform HSP70 increased in amastotes from BAL/c mice. The study analyzed proteomes using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, comparing amotes from BAL/c and BAL/c mice. Changes in Leish phenotypes are studied at protein level due to lack of conventional transcription factors. Known virulence factors like oligopeidase B and trypin peroxidase were overexpressed in nude-derived parasites, while HSP70 isoforms were less abundant. The findings may allow identification of potential virulence factors and regulation of expression.
Activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) initiates immunoglobulin gene diversification by deaminating cytosines in DNA, but its high mutagenic activity can cause genomic instability and chromosomal translocations in B cell malignancies. Research shows AID is cell cycle regulated, with slower nuclear degradation in G1 phase than S or G2 phase. Mutations affecting phosphorylation or catalytic activity alter AID stability and abundance. Enforced nuclear localization of AID in G1 accelerates somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination, while compromising viability in S2 phase. Derivatives of AID accelerate somatic hypermutation with minimal impact on viability, useful for gene engineering and protein mutagenesis. Cell cycle regulates nuclear stability of AID, determining cellular response to A-initiated DNA damage. AID persistence is limited by proteosomal degradation and CRM1-dependent export, with catalytic activity improved by active site mutations, but also stimulating translocation and compromising viability. Low AID levels in G2 phase lead to elevated levels in next G1, favoring Ig diversification in subsequent cycles. Phosphorylation at Ser3 downregulates somatic hypermutation and class recombination. Cell cycle regulation may be applicable to studying DNA repair and genome engineering.
Researchers have developed a method to analyze how microbes break down plant polysaccharides, integrating carbohydrate-active enzyme assays, RNA sequencing, and anaerobic growth screening, and applied it to the bacterium Clostridium phytofermentans. This bacterium ferments various plant components, including glucans, mannans, xylans, galactans, pectins, and arabin, with variable efficiencies and prioritizes metabolism of preferred substrates. Strand-specific RNA sequencing reveals the bacterium responds to polysaccharides by upregulating specific groups of enzymes and transporters to metabolize constituent sugars. Fifty-six upregulated enzymes were purified and their activities show polysaccharides are degraded by multiple enzymes, often from the same family but with divergent specificities and localizations. The enzymes were tested in combination to identify synergies between those acting on the same substrate with different mechanisms. Clostridium phyferment has 171 CAzyme-encoding genes, including 116 glycoside hydrolases in 44 families, and grows on a panel of plant polysaccharides and sugars. Elucidating polysaccharide metabolism is key to understanding plant-degrading microbial communities and developing enzyme mixtures and recombinant microbes for industrial biomass processing. The presented strategy involves high-resolution anaerobic measurements, RNA sequencing, and enzyme assays, complementing other methods like proteomics and metagenomics, focusing on upregulated enzyme genes organized into regulons responding to polysaccharides.
Three annual mass drug administrations were conducted in 12 onchocercias-endemic districts in Sierra Leone from 2008-2010 with good geographic and drug coverage. Mid-term assessment showed a significant impact on lymphatic filariasis, with overall microfilaria prevalence decreasing from 2.6% to 0.3%, a 88.5% reduction. Four districts had a 100% decrease, and seven had reductions between 70-95%. Only Bombali still had a prevalence of 1.58%. Mean microfilar density decreased 65% among positive individuals and 96% in the entire population. The results indicate a significant reduction in lymphatic filariasis after three rounds of mass drug administration, with prevalence below 1% in all but one district. Prior studies showed high lymphatic filari prevalence in the region, but baseline prevalence in 2007-2008 ranged 0-6.9%. The National Tropical Disease Control Programme in Sierra Leone effectively managed onchercias and lymphatic filari through an integrated approach, utilizing ivermectin to reduce lymphatic filari prevalence. Annual mass drug administrations since 2008 achieved adequate treatment coverage above 65% and geographic coverage 100%.
High-throughput sequencing techniques, such as 16S rRNA gene profiling, can elucidate the complex workings of microbial communities, but identifying dependencies between members is challenging due to compositional effects, where data takes the form of relative fractions of genes or species rather than absolute abundances. Simulated and real data from the Human Microbiome Project show compositional effects can be widespread and severe, with many correlations being artificial and true correlations appearing with opposite signs. Community diversity modulates the acuteness of compositional effects. A new approach, SparCC, estimates correlations from compositional data and infers a rich ecological network connecting hundreds of interacting species across 18 sites on the human body. Standard approaches yield 3 spurious species interactions for each true interaction and miss 60% of true interactions, mostly in low diversity samples. Compositional effects are pronounced in 16S rRNA surveys of the human microbiome and a novel procedure, SparCC, is developed for estimating correlations. SparCC can be applied to any compositional data and is shown to infer correlations with high accuracy even in challenging sets.
The abundance of lysozyme on mucosal surfaces poses a challenge to bacterial colonizers, which must evade its antimicrobial effects to survive. Lyzym has muramase activity that hydrolyzes peptidogcan and non-muramid activity as a cation antimicrobial peptide. Two enzymes, PgdA and Ad, modify peptogcan in Streptoccus pneumoniae, implicated in resistance to lyzym in vitro. The antimicrobial effect of human lyzym is due to muramase activity, requiring peptogcan modifications for full resistance. Competition experiments in lyzym-sufficient and deficient mice showed wild-type pneumocci outcompeted pgdadr mutant in lyzym-sufficient but not deficient mice. Single mutations in pgd or adr prevailed over wild-type in both mice, indicating peptogcan modifications diminish fitness. The combination reduces fitness but is outweighed by benefits of resistance to peptidogcan degrading lyzym. Inactivation of muramase eliminated lyzym's ability to kill pneumocci, while cation antimicrobial peptide activity was ineffective. The combined effect of modifications by Pgd and Ad on resistance is due to muramase, not non-muridase activity. Lysozym limits mucosal colonization and peptogcan modifications provide survival advantage when lyzym is abundant. The findings demonstrate the critical role of lyzym and peptogcan modifications in dictating the composition of the microflora of the mucosal surface of the airway.
Dengue is the most important arthropod-borne viral disease worldwide in terms of morbidity and mortality, caused by four serotypes of deng virus. Brazil accounts for approximately 80% of deng cases in the Americas, with 5,944,270 reported cases, including 21,596 deng hemorrhagic fever and 874 fatal cases since 1986. A study investigated NS1 antigen capture as an alternative tool to detect DENV in tissue specimens from 23 confirmed deng fatal cases in 2002. Seventy-four tissue specimens were analyzed, including liver, lung, kidney, brain, heart, skin, spleen, thymus, and lymph nodes. Three NS1 capture tests were evaluated: Dengue Early ELISA, Platelia NS, and NS Ag Strip, with detection rates of 34.7%, 60.8%, and 91.3% respectively. The NS Ag Strip showed highest sensitivity at 78.3% and was most sensitive in liver, lung, kidney, brain, spleen, and thymus. This study demonstrates DENV NS capture as a valuable approach for postmortem deng confirmation. The NS1 antigen was detected in 22 of 23 deng fatal cases and 73.9% of tissues evaluated. The NS Ag Strip detected NS1 in 91.3% of liver, 71.4% lung, 100% kidney, 80% brain, 66.6% spleen, and 100% thymus. This approach may be a useful tool for disease surveillance with increasing DHF and fatal cases.
A comprehensive molecular profiling study of 718 multiple myeloma cases revealed significant differences in mutation frequencies between African and European descent patients. Multiple myeloma, a plasma cell malignancy, has higher incidence and mortality rates among African Americans compared to Caucasians. The study utilized somatic whole exome and RNA sequencing, and clinical data from the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation CoMMpass Interim Analysis 9, and found significant differences in mutation frequencies between self-reported racial groups. Genes BCL7, BRWD3, and AUT2 showed higher mutation frequencies in African American cases, while TP53 and IRF4 had higher frequencies in Caucasian cases. These genes are involved in translocations in B-cell malignancies. The study provides a rationale for diverse tumor cohorts to understand tumor genomics across populations and sheds light on potential ancestry-related biological mechanisms of myelagenesis. The frequency of FAM46 mutation was 8.3% in Caucasian cases and 12.6% in African American cases, suggesting potential enrichment in myeloma biology among patients of African ancestry. The study used publically available 1000 Population Exome Phase1 Genotypes and MUTSIG algorithm to identify driver mutations, with significance set at q<0.1 and p<0.05. The findings highlight the need for deeper understanding of oncogenic processes driving myeloma pathogenesis in multi-ethnic cohorts to address disparities in incidence and outcomes among African descent patients.
Researchers studied the expansion of cancer cell populations to understand the role of passenger mutations in cancer evolution. Most mutations in cancer cells are passengers, which do not affect cell reproduction, but provide information on evolutionary history and can serve as targets for immunotherapy. The study analyzed the growth of primary tumors and metastatic lesions, calculating fixation probabilities and frequencies of successive passenger mutations. Results showed that the ratio of birth and death rates of cancer cells influences the shape of the cancer's phylogenetic tree and the number of subclonal mutations. A formula was derived to estimate the expected number of subclonal mutations of any frequency, which can be fitted to cancer sequencing data to determine the ratio of birth and death rates during clonal expansion. The study found that if the death-birth ratio is close to 1, several clonal passengers may not be present in the first cell but collected during expansion, while a ratio of 0.99 results in 150 passenger mutations in over 1% of cells. The formula was applied to a colorectal cancer dataset, supporting neutral evolution during clonal expansion, where passenger mutations can infer tumorigenic process parameters. The number of subclonal mutations above 50% equals clonal collected during progression, allowing estimation of initial malignant cell mutations by subtracting subclonal from total clonal mutations.
Huntington's disease is associated with a polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein, specifically in exon 1, which can form amyloid aggregates when the number of glutamines exceeds 36-40 repeats. The misfolding of monomeric exon 1 plays a crucial role in length-dependent aggregation. Molecular dynamics simulations of monomeric exon 1 with flanking regions, a variant missing proline regions, and isolated polyQ peptide were performed to study glutamine lengths of 23, 36, and 47. Results show a positive correlation between polyQ length and probability of forming a β-rich misfolded state. Flanking regions affect the probability of forming a β-rich state, with proline regions decreasing this probability. Lengthening polyQ leads to the N-terminal 17 residues adopting a β-sheet conformation over α-helix. The study provides insight into exon 1 misfolding, elucidating the role of flanking sequences in aggregation. Aggregation displays complicated behavior, with length-dependent misfolding of polyQ critical in oligomerization and β-amyloid aggregate formation. Increasing glutamine repeats induces N17 to fold into β-strand, suggesting polyQ and flanking regions are coupled in folding and misfolding. The role of flanking regions is debated, with one model suggesting aggregation initiated by N17 misfolding, leading to polyQ misfolding into protofibrils and fibrils. Disease onset depends on length, with long Q aggregating faster due to frequent misfolding and short Q aggregating slower due to rare misfolding.
The CRISPR/Cas adaptive immune system is a defense strategy used by bacteria and archaea against foreign nucleic acids, including phages and conjugative plasmids. The Human Microbiome Project's shotgun metagenomic datasets enable exploration of CRISPR distribution and diversity in human-associated microbial communities. A targeted assembly strategy was developed to reconstruct CRPR arrays, recruiting reads from datasets and assembling them into CRPR loci to extract unique spacer sequences. This approach identified 64 known and 86 novel CRPRs, with largely body-site specific distributions. Analysis of CRPR loci showed that oral microbiomes shared most spacers when sampled from the same site and individual, while different sites and individuals shared fewer. CRPRs can be used to trace rare species and virus exposure. The study highlights the importance of CRPR identification and characterization in understanding microbiome ecology. The targeted assembly improved detection of CRPR elements in metagenomic datasets, identifying known CRPRs in more human microbiomes than whole-genome assemblies. Novel CRs were identified in whole-genome assemblies, with potential applications in understanding human and microbiome biology. The study utilized metadata from the Human Microbiome Project datasets to explore CRPR distributions across body sites.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide analysis to identify light and temperature-entrained circadian transcripts in Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode with previously thought to have non-robust circadian rhythms. The study found transcripts exhibiting rhythmic expression with temperature-compensated 24-hour periods, sustained under constant conditions, indicating circadian regulation. Light and temperature cycles drive gene expression, entraining largely nonoverlapping sets. Mutations in the TAX-2 cyclic nucleotide-gated channel, required for sensory transduction, abolished both light and temperature-entrained expression, suggesting environmental cues act cellautonomously to entrain circadian rhythms. The findings demonstrate circadian-regulated transcriptional rhythms in C. elegans. Both light and temperature act as zeitgebers, driving and entraining transcripts at the genome level, with temperature driving a larger set of genes than light. Genes implicated in metabolism are enriched in temperature-driven sets, while those in circadian behaviors are enriched in light-entrained datasets. The results show C. elegans utilizes a timekeeping mechanism distinct from other animals and has a bona fide circadian clock entrained by light and temperature, providing a model to explore the evolution and function of this critical timekeeping mechanism.
Researchers investigated the hyper-recombination phenotype in yeast strains with mutations in the RAD3 gene, a homolog of human XPD, which encodes a helicase in the TFIIH complex involved in nucleotide excision repair and transcription. Mutant alleles rad3-101 and rad3-102 exhibit partial DNA repair defects and hyper-recombination, attributed to persistent single-stranded gaps converted to double-strand breaks by replication. Using a system to detect reciprocal products of mitotic recombination, rad3-101 and rad3-102 elevated crossover frequencies about 100-fold, with three-quarters reflecting double-strand breaks at the same positions in sister chromatids and the remainder in single chromatids. Mapping 216 genomic alterations, including crossovers, conversions, deletions, and duplications, showed association with regions of elevated gamma-H2AX and a hotspot for deletions and duplications at IMA and HXT genes. Comparison with spontaneous mitotic recombination suggests incomplete nucleotide excision repair and unrepaired double-strand breaks contribute to homologous recombination. Two types of recomogenic lesions were identified: unrepaired single-stranded nicks converted to single chromatid breaks and double-strand breaks in unreplicated chromosomes converted to sister-chromid breaks, both repaired during S or G2. Genome-wide analysis showed rad3 mutations stimulate crossovers and conversions by one to two orders of magnitude, with patterns of gene conversions associated with mitotic crossovers. The hyper-recombination phenotype is attributed to elevated levels of recomogenic lesions or directed repair toward recombination between homologs rather than sister chromatids.
Helicobacter pylori, a gastric pathogen, has a set of simple sequence repeats that facilitate adaptation to the host environment through a slipped mispairing mechanism. A model explains how an intergenically located T-tract operates a rheostat function to fine-tune activity of the promoter driving expression of sial acid binding adhesin SabA. T-tract length generates multiphasic output from the sabA promoter, altering H. pylori binding to syl-Lewis receptors on gastric mucosa. Fragment analysis shows T-tract length is highly variable in H. pylori, mirroring host-pathogen interplay where the bacterium generates clones with best-fit phenotypes selected in the host. In silico and in vitro analyzes reveal T-tract length affects DNA structure and RNA polymerase binding, shifting axial alignment between core and UP elements. Variations in T-tract act as rheostats modulate promoter output in other H. pylori genes with similar T-tracts. This mechanism provides alternative transcriptional regulation in bacteria with limited classical regulatory factors. T-tract length varies between strains, influencing sabA expression, with optimal length positioning upstream elements for RNAP interaction, enhancing promoter activity. Variations in T-tract affect sab mRNA and protein levels, adjusting sLex binding and gastric mucosa binding. Small alterations in T-tract length influence final Sab expression and sLex activity, visible in heterogeneous populations post-infection.
High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) must evade immune surveillance to establish persistent infections and amplify genomes upon epithelial differentiation. Members of the JAK-STAT family, including STAT-5, modulate the inflammatory response and cell cycle progression. Research shows HPV31 activates STAT-5 phosphorylation without altering total protein levels. Inhibition of STAT-5 phosphorylation abolishes viral genome amplification and late expression in differentiating keratinocytes, but has no effect on undifferentiated cells. The STAT-5β isoform is responsible for this activity, mediated through the ATM DNA damage response. The peroxome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PARγ), a downstream target of STAT-5, contributes to ATM pathway effects. HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 play roles in cell transformation and immortalization, with E7 activating STAT-5 phosphorylation. STAT5 regulates genome amplification through ATM activation, mediated by PARγ. Phospho-STAT5 levels are increased in HPV positive cells, and STAT5 is necessary for genome amplification. STAT5 activation occurs without added growth factors or cytokines, identifying it as a regulator of the HPV life cycle. STAT5 activity is crucial for genome amplification and late expression in suprabasal cells, but not undifferentiated cells. Overall, STAT5 promotes viral replication through the ATM damage response, revealing a new regulatory mechanism in HPV pathogenesis.
Researchers used in vivo-induced antigen technology to identify immunogenic Salmonella Typhi antigens expressed in chronic carriers in Kathmandu, Nepal. Thirteen antigens were found to be immunoreactive in carriers but not in healthy individuals from a typhoid endemic area, including putative membrane proteins, lipoproteins, and hemolysin-related proteins. Ync, an uncharacterized protein with an ATP-binding motif, showed prominent responses. Seventy percent of chronic carriers had detectable anti-Ync IgG in blood, compared to 0% of bile-negative controls, 0% of healthy individuals, and 12.5% with acute typhoid fever. Further evaluation of Ync and other antigens could lead to improved diagnostic assays for asymptomatic S. Typhi carriers. The study aimed to understand host-pathogen interactions in the biliary tract during S. Typhi carriage, where little is known about chronic carriage and no reliable diagnostic assay exists. The identified antigens represent candidate biomarkers for asymptomatic carriage and may improve understanding of S. Typhi survival in chronic carriers. The majority of identified genes encode proteins with putative or unknown function, such as ST238, an uncharacterized liprotein, and ST136, hypothetical periplasmic protein. Analysis of Ync and other antigens could lead to improved understanding of host-pathogen interactions during chronic S. Typhi infection and development of diagnostic assays for asymptomatic carriers in typh endemic zones.
Researchers have discovered a new epigenetic phenomenon called trans-reactivation, where non-functional alleles of a gene can reactivate the expression of a wild-type copy of the same gene silenced by heterochromatin. The study found that non-functional alleles of the white gene, unable to produce a coding transcript, could reactivate the expression of a wild-type copy of the same gene silenced by heterochromatin. This phenomenon is heritable, relies on the presence of homologous RNA, and is affected by mutations in genes involved in post-transcriptional silencing. The presence of non-functional alleles causes an increase in the wm4 gene transcript and an opening of the chromatin structure at the wmh locus. Trans-reactivation is a new level of gene control mediated by homologous molecules in the context of heterochromatic genes, distinct from previously characterized epigenetic events such as paramutation, induction, and transvection. The mechanisms and features of trans-reactivation are different, where non-coding RNAs can positively influence the transcriptional state of a homologous locus silenced by heterochromatin. The study suggests a general and unexpected level of gene control by homolog RNA in the context of heterochromatic genes, indicating trans-reactivation as a new epigen phenomenon controlling gene expression through homolog RNA molecules.
Boophil, a multifunctional Kunitz protease inhibitor from the midgut of the tick Rhipicephalus microplus, targets thrombin, elastase, and kallikrein to prevent host hemostasis. Expressed in HEK cells and purified to homogeneity, Boophil behaves as a classical non-competitive inhibitor of thrombin, blocking platelet aggregation, fibrin formation, and clot-bound thrombin in vitro. It also inhibits FXa, preventing FIX activation and kallikrein activity, indicating it targets the contact pathway. Additionally, Boophil inhibits cathepsin G and plasmin-induced platelet aggregation and affects elastase-mediated cleavage of Tissue Pathway Inhibitor. In vivo, Boophil inhibits carot artery occlusion and promotes bleeding. Through inhibition of several enzymes, Boophil maintains the midgut microenvironment at low hemost and inflammatory tonus, allowing ticks to digest blood, critical for metabolism and egg development. As the first tick midgut FXa anticoagulant to inhibit thrombosis, Boophil plays a major role in tick feeding and metabolism. With a Ki of ~100nM, Boophil inhibits thrombin in a non-canonical manner and attenuates clot-bound thrombin with an IC50 ~1μM. Silencing the Boophil gene resulted in 20% reduction in egg production, highlighting its importance in tick survival.
Researchers have developed the Spatial Explicit General-purpose Model of Enteric Tissue (SEnT) to investigate inflammation and tissue patterning in the gut, representing a finely tuned system where tissue structure influences and function as an absorptive surface and defensive barrier. The mucosa of the intestinal tract plays a key role in diagnosis, characterization, and pathophysiology of gastrointestinal diseases, with inflammation being a significant factor in pathogenesis. SEEn integrates multiple modules, including intracellular morphogenic and inflammatory pathways, cell transitions, and spatial diffusion of morphogens to define epithelial behavior for homeostatic maintenance. The model simulates cellular and molecular interactions that maintain and modify enteric mucosal architecture, generated by behavior of epithelial cells undergoing replication, migration, and differentiation, incorporating the effect of inflammation on morphogenic processes. SEEn provides insight into clinically relevant mechanisms, such as phosphatase tensin homolog/phosphoinositide-3-kinase as a key point of crosstalk between inflammation and morphogenesis and protective role of enterocyte sloughing in ischemia-reperfusion. Results suggest SEEn can serve as a platform for studying inflammation in gastrointestinal disease, unifying a broad spectrum of intestinal diseases by viewing mucosal architecture maintained by morphogenesis subject to control modules balancing interplay of objectives in health and disturbed in pathological conditions.
Traditional vector control methods have limited effect on reducing Aedes aegypti populations, prompting the use of Wolbachia as a tool to mitigate arbovirus transmission. Models predict rapid increase of Wolbachia-positive Ae aegypti, supported by cytoplasmic incompatibility and high maternal transmission. Wolbach wMel strain was released for 20 weeks, achieving 87% household approval, with frequency peaking at 65% but dropping after releases stopped. High maternal transmission was observed at 97.56%. However, pyrethroid resistant genotypes in wMel decreased from 68 to 3.5% after 17 generations. A new strain, wMelRio, was produced by backcrossing wMel with field males to introduce pythroid resistance, increasing survival but reducing fecundity traits. wRio established where wMel failed, revealing matching local genetics is critical for invasion. Household support remained high at 90%. Wolbach deployment should match insecticide profile to achieve invasion, considering pyrethroid-resistance is widely distributed in Ae aegpti populations. Future deployments must maintain insecticide resistance in lab colonies for releases. Aedes aegpti from Tubanga showed high pythroid resistance above 80% during releases, while wMel retained low resistance below 20%. Empirical evidence demonstrates knowledge of insecticide status is critical for Wolbach usage as disease control strategy.
Poxviruses utilize complex signaling pathways to engage cellular mechanisms and modulate viral factors, with the vaccinia B1 kinase playing a crucial role in in inactivating the antiviral factor B and orchestrating other pathways. Experimental evolution of a B1 deletion virus led to the identification of suppressor mutations and novel pathways involving B, revealing that mutations correlating with loss of vaccinia B12 pseudokinase provide a fitness enhancement to the virus. Expression of full-length B12 reduces fitness in viruses with a defect in B1, but has no impact on wild-type or mutant poxviruses, indicating B12 possesses inhibitory activity masked by B1. B12 localizes to the nucleus, a rare characteristic among poxiral proteins, and reduces B phosphorylation under conditions without B1, suggesting it enhances antiviral activity of B. The paralog kinase-pseudokinase pair exhibits a unique epistatic relationship, potentially enhancing B1 conservation and orchestrating nuclear events during infection. Loss of B12 suppresses fitness defects in B mutant viruses but not in wild-type viruses, consistent with B12 acting as a repressor of vaccinia replication in a B-dependent manner. The study provides insights into poxvirus adaptation and signal transduction, raising questions about pseudokinase mechanism and its governance by B1.
Researchers investigated the conformation behavior of two synthetic peptides, LKKKLLKKLLKL and EAALAEAEAE, with built-in secondary amphiphicity, using molecular dynamics simulations. These peptides adopt multiple conformations and secondary structures with short lifetimes in bulk water, providing a basis for conformation selection and population shift upon environmental changes. The peptides' response to macroscopic and molecular interfaces can be linked to their inherent alpha-helical tendencies in water. Aggregation behavior is affected by the presence or absence of an interface and depends on surface charge and hydrophobicity. Simulations showed that LKKLLKLLKL and EAALAEAE are neither random coils nor fully formed alpha-helices in bulk, but adopt various conformations, including partial alpha-helices. Introduction of a macroscopic interface leads to partitioning of hydrophobic and hydrophilic residues, stabilizing the alpha-helical form for both peptides. The L peptide's bulk ensemble is dominated by conformations with a large fraction of residues in alpha-hel state, while EAALAEAE's conformation is more susceptible to environmental conditions. The study demonstrates the influence of interfaces on conformation behavior of intrinsically disordered peptides with built-in alpha-helical amphiphicity, highlighting the role of hydrophobic and hydrophilic partitioning in determining conformation behavior.
Human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6) and 6B (HH-6) are betahpesviruses that infect humans within the first years of life and establish latency in various cell types by integrating their genomes into telomeres of host chromosomes. Researchers investigated the role of telomeric repeats (TMR) in HH-6, which are identical to human telomere sequences, in viral integration. Deletion of TMR in HH-6 genome showed that they are not essential for replication but crucial for integration and maintenance in latently infected cells. Individual deletion of perfect TMR (pT) and imperfect T (impT) revealed pT plays a major role in HH-6 integration, while impT makes a minor contribution. The study established a model for HH-6 integration, suggesting T facilitate integration into host telomeres through homologous recombination. The findings indicate TMR are dispensable for virus replication but necessary for integration, allowing the virus to persist in the host. Integration occurs in vitro and in vivo, and is essential for maintenance of the genome in latently infected cells. The study provides evidence for the role of TMR in HH-6 integration, previously proposed based on sequence analyses, and supports the idea that HH-6 integrates exclusively into telere regions of host chromosomes during latency, unlike other herpesviruses that maintain episomes.
Researchers have determined the 2.6 Å crystal structure of vaccinia virus D13, a key component of the outer scaffold of viral crescent-shaped precursors in poxvirus particles. D13 folds into a double-barrel structure with two jellyrolls and a head domain, assembling into trimers similar to adenovirus and icosahedral viruses. When tethered to artificial membranes, D13 forms a honeycomb lattice structurally similar to viral crescents and immature particles, supporting a model of assembly similar to giantivirus. The findings establish that poxvirus morphogenesis utilizes an ancestral lipid-remodeling strategy common to icosedral DNA viruses infecting all kingdoms of life. The scaffolding protein D13 drives this process, forming immature-vion-like particles without other viral factors, and its neutralization by mutation or rifampin inhibits viral assembly. The structure of D13 reveals a double-bar organization with two jellyrolls and a β-sandwich head, adopting a classical jellyroll fold found in viral capsids. The induced lipid remodeling is specific to the His6-D13 interaction and independent of buffer molarity and ionic strength. The study provides insight into poxvirus morphogenesis mechanisms and establishes D13 as a target for development of poxvirus inhibitors, with implications for understanding the assembly of large viral capsids.
Researchers investigated the role of auxin homeostasis in Brachypodium distachyon seminal roots, comparing findings to the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana. A mutation in the Brachypodium TAR-LIKE gene, BdT2, resulted in reduced tryptophan aminotransferase activity and surprisingly led to elongated roots due to enhanced cell elongation. This phenotype was also observed in another Bd2 allele and mimicked by treating wild type with L-kyunine, a TAA/TAR inhibitor. Contrary to expectations, L-kyine-treated and Bd2 roots displayed elevated auxin levels, not resulting from alternative biosynthesis but increased YCCA gene expression, which is rate-limiting for IPA to auxin conversion. YCCA genes were downregulated by ethylene precursor ACC and upregulated in an ethylene-insensitive mutant, suggesting ethylene inhibits IPA-dependent auxin biosynthesis. This contrasts with Arabidopsis taa/tar mutants, which display reduced root growth and auxin levels. The results reveal a delicate homeostasis of local auxin and ethylene controlling cell elongation in Brachodium, suggesting alternative wiring of auxin-ethylene crosstalk compared to Arabidopsis, where ethylene may inhibit the rate-limiting step of auxin biosynthesis to confer suboptimal auxin levels for cell elongation.
Researchers investigated the relationship between gene expression evolution and promoter nucleosome organization in yeast, finding that genes lacking a nucleosome-free region (OPN) diverge in expression between species, while those with a nucleosome-free region (DPN) remain conserved. To examine the role of evolutionary dynamics, they artificially selected for high expression of GFP-fused proteins and found that both OP and DP genes increased expression by similar amounts, but through distinct mechanisms: DP genes duplicated genomic regions, while OP genes favored mutations. When selection was removed, DP genes reverted to wild-type levels, consistent with their lower diversity between species. The results suggest that promoter organization constrains early evolutionary dynamics and biases long-term evolution. The study found that dozens of GFP-fused proteins increased expression, regardless of promoter class, and that DP and OP genes responded differently to selection, with DP genes duplicating regions and OP genes mutating. The findings support the idea that flexible promoter organization directs the path of evolution, with OP genes adapting more easily to selection due to their structure. The study used 41 yeast proteins spanning mid-to-high expression levels, with no preference to function or position, and found that genes were distributed between DP and OP classes based on nucleosome occupancy.
The human T-lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) trans-activator/oncoprotein Tax activates NF-κB, leading to cell proliferation and transformation, but also induces cellular senescence through upregulation of cyclin-dependent inhibitors p21 and p27. This senence constitutes a checkpoint against IKK/NF-κB hyperactivation and is mediated by RelA acting upstream of the anaphase promoting complex to stabilize p27 and p21. Tax-induced senence is attenuated by mutations reducing IK/NF-κB activation and prevented by blocking NF-κB. The HTLV anti-sense protein HBZ downregulates NF-κB, delaying or preventing Tax-induced senence. The balance between Tax and HBZ determines the outcome of HTLV infection, with robust replication and Tax driving IK/NFκB hyperactivation and senence, while HBZ modulates viral replication and NF-κ activation, allowing infected cells to proliferate. Inactivation of the senence checkpoint can facilitate persistent NFκ activation and leukemogenesis. Impairments of p21 and p27 function have been observed in HTLV-transformed T cells and disabling this pathway may accompany NF-κ deregulation in human cancers. Constitutive IK activation and NF-κ hyperactivation cause Tax-induced senence with RelA as the major driver, acting through unscheduled activation of the APC to stabilize p27.
The frontal lobes play a crucial role in decision-making and executive control, including the selection and coordination of goal-directed behaviors. Current models of frontal function do not fully explain decision-making in uncertain and changing environments. A proposed computational model clarifies this issue, showing that the frontal function monitors up to three or four concurrent behavioral strategies and infers their ability to predict outcomes, choosing the most reliable one to guide action selection and maximize rewards. If a strategy appears unreliable, a new one is formed from stored memory, probed, and confirmed to drive action. The executive function has a limited capacity to monitor three or four strategies, compensated by a binary control structure promoting exploration and creation of new strategies in ambiguous situations. The model integrates reasoning, learning, and creative abilities in service of decision-making and adaptive behavior, controlling creation, learning, storage, and selection of strategies for action. It regulates exploration versus exploitation of rules and creativity, managing an expanding repertoire of flexible strategies for action in uncertain environments. The frontal lobe manages task sets, representations of strategies in long-term memory, adjusted according to outcome values for utility, and continuously arbitrates between adjusting, switching, and creating new task sets for action.
The Analysis of Dynamic Adaptations in Parameter Trajectories (APT) is a new modeling approach to analyze long-term effects of pharmacological interventions, introducing time-dependent parameters to study molecular adaptations. APT predicts progression by identifying necessary changes in model parameters to describe transitions between experimental data at different stages of treatment, providing insight into affected biological systems and molecular events. It captures modulating effects on proteome and transcriptome levels, often less understood, through time-dependent parameters. APT was applied to metabolic adaptations upon pharmacological activation of liver receptor (LXR), a potential target for atherosclerosis treatment. Results showed counterintuitive insight into scavenger receptor class1 function, revealing reduced hepatic cholesterol clearance capacity upon prolonged treatment, confirmed experimentally by immunoblot measurements. APT identifies potential side effects and designs new interventions to prevent them. Mathematical modeling predicts long-term effects, linking experimentally observed phenotypes as a function of time, providing an integrated understanding of pharmacological intervention or disease progression. Time-varying parameters capture dynamic adaptations, inferring necessary changes in model parameters from experimental data. APT was applied to hepatic lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, predicting adaptations upon LXR agonist T0907 treatment, integrating biological pathways with substantial measured components.
Researchers propose a new hypothesis on how the spinocerebellar system and cerebellar cortex interact to support coordination of multi-segment limbs and bodies. The spinocerear neurons combine sensory and motor signals to approximate spatial and temporal dependencies between limb segments, necessary for coordination. However, random recombination of sensory and motor signals is limited by the number of granule cells. Instead, the spinal circuit provides useful recombinations, described as linear projections through multi-dimensional sensorimotor space. Gran cells enhance these projections, allowing Purkinje cells to establish piecewise-linear approximations of non-linear functions. The spinocerear system avoids superfluous recombinations and forms 'good' recombinations with high probability. The spinal circuit makes sensorimotor functions available to the cerear cortex through projections, and the cerear gran layer receives this information. The structure of the spinocar network prior to the gran layer explains how dimensionality is partially lifted, enabling coordination of multi-segment limbs. The cerebellum is crucial for coordination, but mechanisms underlying this function are unknown. The hypothesis provides a novel view on spinocere and cerear function, illustrating how coordination is supported by recombinations performed by spinocar neurons.
Researchers utilized next-generation sequencing to investigate the regulation of microRNAs during Chikungunya virus infection in Aedes albopictus, a primary vector of the disease. They identified 88 and 79 known microRNAs in uninfected and CHV-infected Aedes albictus cell lines, respectively, and discovered nine novel microRNAs. Comparison of the libraries revealed differential expression of 77 common microRNAs between them, with CHV infection altering the microRNA profile of a specific set of eight microAs. The putative targets of these regulated microAs were identified and classified into pathways. The study provides insight into cellular modification by microAs during CHV infection and potential candidates for vector-based antiviral strategies. MicroAs play crucial roles in regulation of gene expression, cell development, proliferation, differentiation, host defense, fat metabolism, and apoptosis. Four over-expressed microAs and four under-expressed microAs were analyzed for putative targets. High-throughput small RNA sequencing using the Illumina platform was used to evaluate the impact of CHV on Aedes microAs, comparing infected and uninfected cell lines. The results highlight the role of vector-encoded microAs in disease transmission and pathogen development, providing leads for identifying candidates for antiviral strategies.
Cystic echinoccosis is a globally distributed parasitic infection of humans and livestock with significant medical and economic importance in many countries, including Iran. The study estimated mean number of surgical cases per year from 2000-2009 was 1,295, with 635,232 asymptomatic individuals living in the country. The annual cost of CE in Iran was estimated at $232.3 million, including direct and indirect costs, with human costs at $93.39 million and livestock costs at $132 million. The cost per surgical case was $1,539. CE has a considerable economic impact on Iran, with costs approximating 0.03% of the country's gross domestic product. Productivity losses in asymptomatic individuals, prevalence in sheep, and fecundity losses in cattle had the largest impact on overall cost. Direct costs of human CE were 1.2% of total cost, but accounted for three quarters of economic losses in surgical cases. Annual cost with livestock was $132 million, assuming government slaughter values. Establishing a surveillance system and control program is necessary to reduce economic burden, with cost-benefit analysis of control recommended, incorporating knowledge of economic losses due to CE in Iran.
Researchers conducted a global analysis of mouse polyomavirus infection in NIH3T cells using deep sequencing to examine viral and host transcriptomes at various times post-infection. The study revealed dynamic regulation of viral and host gene expression, including widespread RNA editing of viral transcripts at late infection stages. By 36 hours post-infection, 359 host genes were significantly upregulated and 857 downregulated. Gene ontology analysis showed upregulation of transcripts involved in translation, metabolism, RNA processing, DNA methylation, and protein turnover, while downregulation of extracellular adhesion, cytoskeleton, zinc finger, SH3 domain, and GTP activation. Long noncoding RNAs, including MALAT1, were altered, with some upregulated and others downregulated. The viral transcriptome analysis provided insights into early-to-late switch with both-strand and late-strand RNAs transcribed at all times, confirming previous observations of the MPV lifecycle. Mouse NIH3T cells were infected with wild-type MPV at a multiplicity of 50 plaque forming units per cell, allowing strand-specific quantification of changes in transcription, splicing, and editing. The study generated a detailed picture of viral gene expression throughout the life cycle and its impact on host cell expression, providing new insights into viral regulation, including changes in start sites of early transcripts and extensive RNA editing throughout the genome.
Hundreds of thousands of runners register for marathons each year, with over two-fifths experiencing severe performance-limiting depletion of physiologic carbohydrate reserves, known as 'hitting the wall', and approximately 1-2% dropping out before finishing. Analyses of endurance physiology suggest human glycogen reserves are insufficient to fuel a marathon, making 'hitting the wall' seem inevitable, or that maximal glycogen loading is required to complete without it. However, this study demonstrates energetic constraints on runners depend on variables including muscle mass, liver and muscle glycogen densities, and running speed, in personalized and quantifiable ways. The approach estimates distance runners exhaust glycogen stores as a function of intensity, providing guidelines for safety and optimizing performance by setting paces and prescribing midrace fuel requirements. The analysis sheds light on standards in marathon running, including qualifying times for the Boston Marathon. Carbohydrate loading influences performance by allowing runners to run at greater speeds without 'hitting the wall', typical levels permitting completion between four and five hours. The model incorporates metabolic cost and dependence of fat versus carbohydrate on exertion, revealing dependencies of distance to glycogen depletion and pace to run without exhausting stores.
Researchers investigated the interaction between Toxoplasma strains and murine macrophages to understand the molecular basis of differences in pathogenesis. They infected macrophages with 29 Tooplasma strains representing global diversity and used RNA-sequencing to determine host and parasite transcriptomes. The results showed large differences between strains in expression of parasite effectors and chromosomal structural variation. Novel strain-specific host pathways were identified, including regulation of type I interferon response by atypical strains. IFNβ production was associated with parasite killing, independent of interferon gamma, and dependent on endosomal Toll-like receptors and cytoplasmic retino acid-indible gene 1 in macrophages and fibroblasts. The study provides insight into host and parasite transcriptional responses upon infection with canonical and atypical Toxlasma strains, allowing identification of novel strain-specific host responses and parasite effectors. Large differences were observed between strains in modulation of host genes, including activation of inflammatory response. Macrophages infected with different Toxma strains had at least 2-fold difference in expression and FPKM≥5 in at least 1 strain, indicating strain-specific modulation of host signaling pathways. The findings suggest Toxma strains have unique interactions with host cells, contributing to variable outcomes in toxoplasmosis patients, with genotype of the parasite playing a major role besides host and environmental factors.
Recombination in enteroviruses is a biphasic replicative process involving the generation of greater-than-genome-length imprecise intermediates. Despite its importance in acquiring novel sequences and contributing to genotype diversity, the recombination process remains poorly understood. Researchers investigated heterologous recombination using a novel genetic approach, isolating chimeric intertypic polioviruses with duplicated sequences at the recombination junction. Serial passage of these viruses yielded progeny with increased fitness that lost the duplicated sequences. Mutations altering polymerase fidelity or replication complex coalescence changed the yield of recombinants, indicating a replicative process. Analysis of 136 intertypic poliovirus recombinants showed 70% contained additional sequences, forming distinct junctions, contrasting with previous reports of precise recombinants. The majority of heterotypic recombinants contained sequences within the recombination region, suggesting imprecise recombinants have a growth disadvantage. Inhibitors of poliov negative strand initiation blocked recombinant formation. Results indicate recombination in enteroviruses involves an initial generation of imprecise recombinants followed by selection of precise recomants with enhanced fitness. This bipic process has implications for understanding evolution by duplication in positive-strand RNA viruses, suggesting it may be possible to enhance or reduce recombination-mediated evolution.
Organic cation transporter 3 (Oct3) is a distinct catecholamine clearance route in adipocytes mediating the browning of white adipose tissue. Beiging white adipose tissue is a target for therapeutics in treating metabolic diseases through norepinephrine-mediated pathways. Oct3 is highly expressed in white adipose tissue and displays the greatest uptake of norepinephrine as a non-neural route, differing from neurons or macrophages. Adipocytes express high levels of norepinephrine degradation enzymes, providing a basis for clearance with reuptake transporter Oct3. Norepinephrine administration and ablation of Oct3 induces higher thermogenesis and lipolysis, and cold challenge shows stronger browning and elevated thermogenic gene expression. Glycolytic genes are reprogrammed to compensate for ATP loss in adip-specific Oct knockout mice. Inhibition of β-adrenergic receptor abolishes higher lipolytic activities, indicating norepinephrine overload in Oct3 adipocytes. Reduced OCT3 alleles are associated with increased basal metabolic rate in humans. Oct3 governs β-adrenergic activity as a norepinephrine transporter, offering therapeutic applications for metabolic disorders. Adip-specific Oct knockout mice have no differences in body weight, metabolic parameters, or adipose morphology under room temperature. Oct3 is required for norepinephrine uptake in white adipocytes, and inhibition blocks transport, mimicking β3 agonists, resulting in browning and enhanced lipolysis. Development of OCT-specific inhibitors may improve metabolic disorders, but the contribution of extraneonal norepine uptake through Oct versus neuronal clearance remains to be investigated.
Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) plays a critical role in regulating transcription and contains two domains, the chromo and chromoshadow, with the chromo-domain binding histone H3 methylated lysine 9. However, HP1's affinity to native chromatin is relatively poor, suggesting additional histone binding activities. The chromoshadow interacts with histone H3 at the entry/exit point of the nucleosome, also contacted by SWI/SNF complex catalytic subunits Brg1 and Brm. Efficient SWI/SNF remodeling requires this contact and is inhibited by HP1. Antagonism between SWI/SNF and HP1 is observed in interferon-regulated genes, with SW/SNF favoring HP loading onto chromatin. HP chromosh-domains benefit from nucleosomal opening to bind chromatin and detect unwanted remodeling. HP1 recognizes histone H3 methylated lysine 9 and harbors DNA and RNA-binding activities, targeting chromatin through multiple contacts. HP1 binds weakly to reconstituted methylated nucleosomal arrays but efficiently to peptides mimicking histone H3 methylated K9. Binding to native chromatin is improved by auxiliary factors or chromatin opening. HP1 establishes alternative interactions with histones, contacting the globular domain of histone H3 at the border. This region is also contacted by hSW/SNF subunits B1 and Brm, with HP1 negatively affecting hSW/SNF-mediated chromatin remodeling. HP1 recruitment may be initiated by chromatin opening where SW/SNF functions as repressor or by methylated histone H3 where SW/SNF acts as activator, functioning as sensors of unwanted SW/SNF activity and blocking the reaction.
Researchers investigated the property of self-containment in RNA structures, which refers to the tendency of an RNA sequence to adopt the same secondary structure regardless of its surrounding context. They developed a scoring method called the self-containment index to measure this property and found that microRNAs exhibit high self-containment, consistent with their requirement for structural invariance during biogenesis. Analysis revealed a trend towards higher self-containment among conserved and clustered microRNAs, suggesting it may be a characteristic of novel microRNAs acquiring new genomic contexts. MicroRNAs displayed enhanced self-containment compared to other functional RNAs, and a trend towards natural selection for self-containment was observed in most RNA classes. The study suggests self-containment arises from selection for robustness against perturbations, invariance during biogenesis, and modular composition of function. The self-containment index was used to compare four RNA classes, including human microRNA loops, random structured RNAs, 5S rRNAs, and tRNAs, and found microRNAs had significantly higher self-containment. A positive association was found between high self-containment and membership in human-specific or cross-species microRNA families and location in genomic regions not overlapping protein-coding genes. A Python implementation and web interface to calculate the self-containment index is available.
Researchers have identified four transcription factors in Arabidopsis that limit the spread of necrotrophic fungal pathogens, including Botrytis cinerea and Plectosphaella cucumerina. Mutants defective in these transcription factors displayed increased disease susceptibility and activation of non-immune host processes contributing to disease. Transcriptome analysis revealed a common transcriptional signature of 77 upregulated genes, including those encoding secreted peptides named PROIR, which contribute to plant susceptibility. Overexpression of PROIR factors increased susceptibility, while loss-of-function mutants conferred resistance, indicating their importance in fungal pathogenesis. The identified transcription factors and PROIR represent novel determinants for plant susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens. The study found that ZFP2, BHL99, PAP2, and ATG10 transcription factors are required for plant resistance, with mutants showing susceptibility to B. cinerea and P. cucina. The upregulated genes encoding secreted peptides in these mutants are causative for enhanced susceptibility, and co-regulation with MY46 and CESA7/8 may be involved in biological processes regulating disease/susceptibility to necrotrophs. The discovery of these transcription factors and PROIR provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms of plant susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens, highlighting the role of host factors in facilitating fungal growth and access to plant cells.
Researchers have identified the transcription factor Forkhead Box 1 (FOXO1) as a critical regulator of endometrial receptivity in vivo, essential for successful embryo implantation. Uterine ablation of Fox1 resulted in infertility due to altered epithelial cell polarity and apoptosis, preventing embryo penetration of the luminal epithelium. Analysis of the utine transcriptome after Fox1 ablation showed alterations in gene expression involved in cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, β-catenin (CTB) signaling, and increased PGR signaling. Increased PGR signaling was due to PGR retention in uterine epithelium during receptivity. Constitutive expression of epithelial PGR inhibited FOX1 in uterine epithelium nucleus. Reciprocal expression of PGR and FOX1 was observed in human endometrial samples during the proliferative and secretory phase. FOX1 expression and loss of PGR during receptivity are interrelated and critical for implantation. FOX1 regulates uterine epithelial integrity and progesterone receptor expression for successful implantation. FOX1 ablation affects multiple pathways, including P signaling and inflammatory and growth, required for proper uter function. Spatiotemporal expression and localization of FOX1 and P in endometrial epithelium requires mutual regulation for successful implantation. FOX1 is involved in downregulation of epithelial PGR, and may be in a mutually regulatory relationship with PGR in endomet epithelium. FOX1 regulates components of signaling pathways establishing receptive phase, including cell invasion, molecular transport, apoptosis, CTB signaling, and inhibition of PGR in murine endomet epithelium.
Researchers developed a negative binomial generalized linear mixed model to investigate the spatial variation in monthly dengue cases in Bangladesh, accounting for zero-inflation, spatial, and temporal effects. The model was fitted to district-level reported deng cases from 2000 to 2009 and found mean temperature and its interaction with diurnal temperature range, lagged two months, significantly associated with deng incidence. Mean rainfall two months prior was positively associated with incidence. Densely populated districts and those bordering India or Myanmar had higher incidence. The model estimated 92% of annual deng cases occurred between August and September. Cases were identified across the country with 94% in the capital Dhaka. Less than half the districts reported cases as observed. The proportion varied by month with higher reporting in high-incidence districts but dropped towards the end of the transmission season. A zero-inflation parameter confirmed significant underreporting in deng data. Districts not bordering India or Myanmar had lower incidence compared to adjacent districts. The study provides model-based estimates of spatial variation in deng cases, accounting for underreporting, and contributes to prioritizing deng control and elimination interventions across Bangladesh.
Researchers have identified a new type of preferred location, termed "knots," in mouse exploratory behavior, characterized by high tortuosity and frequent visits. Knots are distinct from home bases, with high speed inbound and low outbound paths, and are typically located near the point of introduction to the arena, away from walls. Mice establish one knot per session, with distinct boundaries maintained within and across sessions. Injecting mice with saline and placing them in an exposed portion of the arena enhances knot establishment, suggesting stress and arousal consolidate a long-term contingency between a locale and knot-scribling. In environments devoid of proximal cues, mice mark a locale with twisting and turning, creating a self-generated landmark. The behavior, knot-scribling, involves tracing a tortuous path with multiple views of the environment, potentially allowing recalibration of the mouse's map and compass. Knots are characterized by high path density, frequent visits without scribbling, and higher speed entering than exiting. The vestibular input generated by scribling may improve visual scene interpretation. Mice perform knot-scribling sporadically, with short visits, unlike home bases, and exhibit a preference for the point of entry, with longer-than-expected dwell time spent in the entry quadrant.
Invasive fungal infections cause more deaths worldwide than malaria, and researchers have identified the ergoline compound NG04 as a potential antifungal agent with selectivity over mammalian cells. High-resolution chemogenomics revealed the lipid transfer protein Sec14 as the target of NG04, with compound-resistant mutations defining interactions in the substrate pocket of the protein. Sec14 is essential for lipid transfer in various pathogenic fungi and involved in secretion of virulence determinants, making it an attractive antifungal target. NG04 inhibits growth of clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans and has equal or higher potency against others. Analogues showed fungicidal activity against fluconazole-resistant C. neoformans strains. Genetic evidence supports NG04 inhibiting fungal Secp, a novel antifungal starting point. The S cerevisiae and C neoform proteins show 53% similarity, with conserved residues in the lipid-binding pocket, and critical sites for NG04 sensitivity are conserved. NG04 binds to fungal proteins similarly and scored anti-cryptoccal activity, with potent derivatives identified. Secp-dependent virulence has been described for C neoans but not other pathogens. Targeting Secp seems efficacious in C neoans and intervening in lipid pathways may yield novel targets.
Mefloquine, an antimalarial drug, possesses promising antischosomal properties in mice. A single dose of 200 or 400mg/kg administered orally to mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni or S. japonicum resulted in 72.3-100% female worm burden reduction. High worm reductions were observed in young stages of S. mansoni and S. japonicum. Mefloquine enantiomers resulted in high worm reductions in mice with patent or subpatent S. mansoni infection. Oral administration of 400mg/kg to mice infected with juvenile or adult S. mans and S. japonicum resulted in high worm reductions. Other antimalarial drugs showed no antischosomal activity. Mefloquine has advantage over praziquel with high reductions against all development stages of schistosomes. Single dose of 100mg/kg achieved 94-100 worm reduction in juvenile S. mansoni. Further studies are launched to elucidate the mechanism and effect of mefloquine on S. haematium and other trematodes to develop a novel antischosomal drug based on aminoal functionality. Mefloquine may have an impact on schistosomias in areas where malaria and schistosomias coexist.
A study was conducted in Cameroon to map the distribution of podoconiosis, a non-filarial elephantiasis that causes massive swelling of the lower legs, identified as a neglected disease by the World Health Organization in 2011. A multi-stage sampling design with stratification of the country by environmental risk of podoconiosis was used, sampling 76 villages from 40 districts in ten regions. All individuals 15 years or older were surveyed and screened for lymphedema using a clinical algorithm to diagnose podoiosis excluding filarial lymphedema. Of 10,178 individuals, 83 had lymphedema and two were FTS positive but negative for Wb test, with no microfilaria or DNA of W. bancrofti found. 52 people had podoiosis with an overall prevalence of 0.5%. At least one case was found in every region except two villages in Adamawa, with 17 districts having no cases, 15 with 0.2-1% and 8 with 1.2-2.7% prevalence. The study demonstrates low but widespread podoiosis in Cameroon. A control program is vital with a health response through surveillance and morbidity services. The study used clinical, parasitological, and serological methods to exclude other causes of lymphema and supports inclusion in routine screening at primary care. The findings are comparable to Ethiopia with 22.7% and demonstrate the need for a complete profile of podoiosis in Cameroon.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch signaling in the age-associated decrease of adhesion of germline stem cells to their niche, finding that Notch signaling increases with age in Drosophila female germl stem cells, resulting in their removal from the niche. Clonal analysis revealed that cells with low Notch signaling exhibit increased adhesiveness to the niche, outcompeting neighbors with higher Notch levels through regulation of E-cadherin expression. Experimental enhancement of Notch in stem cells hastens age-dependent loss, while disruption does not delay loss during aging, nor affect BMP signaling for self-renewal. Notch activation in the niche maintains integrity and mediates retention, but is reduced with age, indicating Notch regulates occupancy intrinsically and extrinsically. Findings expose a novel role of Notch controlling adhesion in response to aging, relevant to metastatic cells where Notch suppresses adhesion. Notch signaling in niche is required for integrity, decreased with age contributing to loss, and intrinsic and extrinsic Notch control residency during aging. Notch in niche and stem cells is affected differently by age, decreased in niche but increased in stem cells, suggesting Notch in niche may affect Notch in stem cells and vice versa. Collectively Notch promotes aging, needing low levels in young stem for anchorage, previously reported for niche integrity and maintenance, with unknown function in stem, now found to help loss from niche through E-cadherin regulation.
The UL97 protein of human cytomegalovirus is a kinase that phosphorylates the cellular retinoblastoma tumor suppressor and lamin A proteins, substrates of cellular cyclin-dependent kinases. Functional assays have shown UL97 has authentic cyclin-dependent kinase-like activity. Other human herpesviruses encode kinases with sequence and positional homology to UL97, termed conserved herpesvirus protein kinases. The ability to phosphorylate retinoblastoma and lamin and disrupt nuclear lamina is shared by conserved herpesvirus kinases from beta and gamma-herpesvirus families, but not alpha-herpesvirus homologs. Most beta and gamma-herpesvirus kinases display bona fide cyclin-dependent kinase activity, while alpha-herpesvirus proteins do not. Non-cyclin-dependent activities reported for UL97 show weak conservation among conserved herpesvirus kinases and do not segregate to specific viral families. The genomic and evolutionary conservation of these kinases has not been maintained at the functional level, indicating related kinases likely serve overlapping and non-overlapping functions during infections. The conserved activity of conserved herpesvirus kinases is cyclin-dependent-like function, found in beta and gamma-herpesvirus, and absent in alpha-herpesvirus. These kinases are targets of approved antiviral drugs and represent novel virally-encoded cyclin-dependent kinases.
Burkholderia pseudomallei, a Tier 1 Agent and cause of melioidosis, is a Gram-negative bacillus present in the environment in many tropical countries. Defining the global pattern of B. pseudomallei distribution underpins efforts to prevent infection and is dependent on robust environmental sampling methodology. An international working party, Detection of Environmental Burkholderia pseudomalle Working Party, reviewed literature on detection of environmental B. pseudalle to update risk maps for melioidosis and propose international guidelines for soil sampling. Global coverage was found to be patchy, with a lack of studies in many areas where meloidosis is suspected to occur. Sampling strategies and bacterial identification methods used were highly variable and not robust. Consensus guidelines were developed to reduce probability of false-negative results and provide affordable 'low-tech' methodology applicable in both developed and developing countries. The proposed guidelines provide the basis for an accurate and comprehensive map of environmental B. pseudalle. Environmental sampling can identify areas at risk before cases are recognized, with 50/61 studies reporting detection of B. pseudalle using culture and/or PCR. Most cases have been reported from northeast Thailand and northern Australia, where meloidosis is a significant cause of death due to infectious diseases.
Researchers have identified peptides derived from the membrane-proximal region of the dengue virus E protein that bind specifically to the post-fusion conformation of E, a model for a fusion intermediate, and inhibit viral infectivity. The mechanism of membrane fusion involves large-scale rearrangements of the envelope glycoprotein E and a transition from dimers to trimers. The peptides bind to the stem-less E trimer, a conformational intermediate, and block viral fusion in vitro assays, with potency proportional to their affinity for the conformation intermediate. Inhibition occurs when peptides bind virions before attachment and are carried into endosomes, where acidification initiates fusion, and depends on particle dynamics, with no inhibition at 4°C. A two-step model for the mechanism of fusion inhibition is proposed. Membrane fusion is critical for infectious entry of enveloped viruses, facilitated by a viral protein in response to molecular cues for the cellular compartment. Deng and flaviviruses penetrate endosomes following clathrin-mediated endocytosis and proton binding is the immediate trigger. The conformation reaches when fusion is complete, amino-acid residues in the stem bind domain II, and on a mature virion, residues interact with the viral membrane and fused bilayers. The hydrophobic fusion loop inserts into the target bilayer, and rearrangement draws together the fusion and transmembrane segment, forcing membranes together, allowing fusion to ensue. Stem-derived peptides inhibit deng-virus fusion with liposomes, detected by trypsin susceptibility and content mixing assays, supporting targeting viral entry as an effective way to block infection and strategies for inhibiting flavivirus entry.
Researchers have successfully sequenced the whole genome of Vibrio cholerae from stool specimens preserved on filter paper, providing valuable molecular epidemiological information on circulating strains. Cholera outbreaks cause approximately 4 million cases and 95,000 deaths annually worldwide, with recent outbreaks in Haiti and Yemen highlighting its ongoing global concern. Whole genome sequencing recovered close to complete V. cholera O1 genome with satisfactory coverage from stool enriched alkaline peptone water and V. cholera culture isolates spotted on filter paper. The minimum concentration of V. cholera DNA required for quality genomic information was 0.02 ng/μL. Genomic data confirmed the presence or absence of genes of epidemiological interest, including cholera toxin and pilus loci, and identified V. cholera strains within the current global phylogenetic tree as the 7th pandemic El Tor. The technique also detected co-infections and provided insight into specific V. cholera strains causing outbreaks in cholera-endemic areas. Analysis of over 700 V. cholera genomes showed epidemics in Africa and the Americas stem from a single pandemic lineage from Africa and Asia. The study demonstrates the potential of whole genome sequencing from filter paper-preserved specimens to explore the gut microbiome, identify co-infections, and inform public health policy on cholera control and elimination.
Researchers have identified a protein network controlling epithelial polarity, but little is known about how individual proteins become localized within cells. A genetic screen in Drosophila follicle cells found cytoplasmic Dyne motor is essential for apico-basal polarity, acting through cytoplasm scaffolding protein Stardust (Sdt) to localize transmembrane protein Crumbs via apical targeting of specific sdt mRNA isoforms. The sdt mRNA localization signal is mapped to an alternatively spliced coding exon, with its presence or absence corresponding to a developmental switch in sdt localization. Apical transcripts are found during early epithelial development, while unlocalized transcripts predominate in mature epithelia. Dyin is required for epithelial polarity and mRNA localization may regulate apico-basal organization. Alternative splicing of a coding exon controls mRNA localization during development. Loss of Dyin leads to defects in apico-basal polarity and affects cell architecture by targeting apical proteins. Crb is a potential Dyin cargo, transported to the apical surface. Dyin enriches sdt transcripts in the apical cytoplasm during epithelial polarity development. The cis-acting signal targets sdt transcripts to the apical cytoplasm using UAS-transgenes. These findings demonstrate Dyin's role in epithelial polarity and introduce a mechanism of alternative splicing controlling mRNA localization.
Researchers have discovered evidence of intraclonal genetic exchange in Leishmania infantum, a parasite that causes leishmaniasis, within its natural vector Phlebotomus pernus sand fly. Transgenic L. infantum lines expressing green and red fluorescent markers were used to study genetic exchange between identical genotypes. The results showed successful exchange of markers within the sand fly midgut when fed with a mixture of parental clones, indicating genetic exchange in L. infantum. The hybrid progeny was triploid and stable throughout the parasite life cycle. Infection of BALB/c mice with the hybrid clone resulted in reduced parasite loads in spleen and liver and lower arginase activity compared to parental strains. The study confirms Leishmania's ability to recognize and mate with the same genotype within the sand vector, producing viable but less virulent hybrids. The findings support the existence of a non-obligate sexual cycle in the extracellular stage of the parasite within the sand fly. The discovery of doubly-resistant intraclonal yellow hybrids extends genetic exchange to visceral strains and suggests the possibility of fusion between haploid and diploid cells. The study demonstrates Leishmania's capacity for mating within its natural vector, with implications for understanding the parasite's life cycle and virulence.
Visceral leishmaniasis, caused by Leishmania donovani, is a significant health issue in Ethiopia, with parasites transmitted by different vectors and clustering into distinct genotypes. A study characterized strains from VL and HIV-VL co-infected patients in north and south Ethiopia, examining 63 L. donani strains using polymerase chain reaction targeting internal transcribed spacer 1, cystine protease B, and HASPB regions. The results identified strains as L. donani, with HASPB amplicon size varying by patient origin. Most northwestern strains produced a 290bp product, while southwestern strains produced a 450bp amplicon. Sequence analysis revealed the k26 region comprised polymorphic 13 and 14 amino motifs, with the 13 amino peptide prevalent in L. donani and rare in L infant. The number and order of repeats varied geographically. High-resolution melt analysis distinguished different products, showing considerable polymorphism among L. donani strains from East Africa. This polymorphism should be considered when designing diagnostic assays and vaccines based on this antigen. Leishmania strains were isolated from patients with VL or HIV co-infections in northwestern and southern Ethiopia, cultured and analyzed using ITS PCR and cpB, confirming L donani complex. Written consent was obtained, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. The study found clonal variation in HASPB of Indian L donani, but no polymorphism in repeat region of protein in Ethiopian strains. The number, order, and arrangement of repeats in L donani varied geographically, indicating a need for consideration in diagnostic and vaccine design.
Researchers investigated the distribution of recombination breakpoints in HIV-1 genomes to understand the role of recombination in the evolution of the virus. A probabilistic model of HIV-1 recombination was generated and compared to observed breakpoint distributions from the HIV pandemic. The model accurately predicted intertype recombination frequencies across most of the HIV-1 genome, indicating that sequence identity is sufficient to explain breakpoint locations. However, regions with over or under representation of breakpoints were identified, suggesting natural selection influences recombination patterns. The envelope gene had fewer breakpoints, indicating recombinants in this region are less likely to be successful, while regions near the env gene had more breakpoints, indicating selection for these recombinants. The findings indicate specific portions of the genome deviate from a probabilistic recombination model, suggesting only a minority of recombination events are significant to HIV-1 evolution. The study identified regions with more or fewer breakpoints than predicted, providing insight into the influence of sequence on template switching and recombination hotspots associated with drug resistance. The results show most recombinant breakpoints provide limited selective advantage, except in specific regions where recombination has higher probability of being important to viral evolution.
A novel hierarchical Bayesian inference framework is proposed for concurrent model fitting and comparison in group studies, addressing the interdependence between estimating individual variation in parameters and comparing candidate models. This framework combines previous approaches, leveraging population-level distributions to estimate parameters and comparing models, while accounting for individual variation in model expression. The method shows advantages in parameter estimation and model comparison, with smaller errors and robustness against outliers, and no bias towards simplistic models. The fully Bayesian approach enables inference on group-level parameters and statistical tests, quantifying uncertainty and errors. The framework is hierarchical, regularizing individual parameters with group statistics, and Bayesian, representing uncertainties with probability distributions. It addresses challenges in statistical inference over parameters and models, assuming the best-fitting model varies by subject, and conducts hierarchical estimation without assuming a single model for all subjects. The approach solves problems of model fitting and comparison within the same framework using variational techniques, providing a solution to issues that have remained elusive with previous methods, and enabling statistical tests about group parameters and corresponding errors.
Researchers investigated the role of Hox genes in the development of auditory circuitry in the mouse brainstem, specifically the contribution of rhombomeres to brainstem auditory nuclei. They found that rhomere 4 contributes to functionally linked sensory and motor components, including the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, posterior cochlear nuclei, and olivocochlear neurons. The assembly of these components depends on interactions between Hox1 and Hox2. Mutations in Hox1 and Hox2 result in impaired transmission of low-level auditory stimuli, leading to hearing impairments. Hox2 regulates axon guidance and controls contral projections from the anterior cochlear nucleus to the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, a circuit involved in sound localization. Individual rhomeres and associated Hox codes control distinct subcircuits in the auditory brainstem. Hox1 and Hox2 are crucial in rhomere patterning, and ventral rhomere 4 changes to a more anterior identity in the absence of Hox1. The study shows Hox genes are involved in the assembly of sensorimotor circuits, with rostral rhomeres and associated Hox required for two major circuits in the central auditory system. Rhom-specific and Hox-dependent assembly of auditory subcircuits is supported by fate mapping and expression profiles. Functional inactivation of Hox1, Hox2, and Hox2 was analyzed, with H1 deletion resulting in repatterning of ventral rhom 4 into a more anterior identity. The study demonstrates the importance of Hox genes in auditory circuit development and hearing.
The complete genome sequence of the carbohydrate-degrading marine bacterium Saccharophagus degradans strain 2-40 has been reported, revealing an unusually large number of enzymes that degrade complex polysaccharides. The bacterium exhibits an extraordinary range of catabolic capability, with many enzymes showing novel combinations of catalytic and substrate-binding modules, likely adaptations for depolymerization of complex polysaccharides in the marine environment. The genome is the first of a marine bacterium that can degrade plant cell walls, a key component of the carbon cycle not well-characterized in the marine environment. Genomic, RT-PCR, enzyme, and MS studies show the carbohydrases are regulated by multiple mechanisms, induced by complex polysaccharide complexity, and repressed by glucose. Sacophagus degradans strain 2-40 is the first free-living marine bacterium demonstrated to degrade cellulosic algae and higher plant material, a member of the gamma-subclass of phylum Proteobacteria. The bacterium's enzymatic capabilities suggest a significant role in the marine carbon cycle, functioning as a "super-degrader" mediating breakdown of polysacides from plants, algae, and invertebrates, contributing to atmospheric CO2 inputs. The polysacchar degrading systems contain multiple enzymes with synergistic activities, including endo-acting and exo-acting cellulases liberating cellobiose from cellulose chains.
Japanese Encephalitis virus is a zoonotic flavivirus that causes significant childhood neurological infections in Asia, with a shift in dominance from genotype III to I over the past 20 years. The mechanism of this displacement is unknown. Culex pipiens mosquitoes, common in China, play a crucial role in maintaining the JEV transmission cycle. Researchers used Cx pipiens mosquitoes as an in vivo model to explore the potential role in JEV genotype shift, exposing them to GI and GIII strains. Results showed Cx pipiens were competent vectors for both GI and GIII infection with similar rates and kinetics. Both genotypes disseminated to secondary organs at similar rates and were detectable in salivary glands at 14 days post-infection with 29.4% and 36.3% positivity for GI and GIII respectively. No statistical difference in transmission rate was detected between GI and GIII infected mosquitoes. Data demonstrated GI and GIII viruses have similar infectivity in Cx pipiens, suggesting Cx pipiens may not play a critical role in JEV genotype shift. The study used a single representative strain from each genotype, further studies with multiple strains are needed to confirm this conclusion. The findings indicate Cx pipiens mosquitoes from China may not contribute to JEV genotype displacement.
A retrospective review of dengue deaths in Malaysia from 2013-2014 found 322 cases with a mean age of 40.7±19 years, half females, and 72.5% adults. The median duration of first medical contact and hospitalization were 1 and 3 days. Diabetes and hypertension were common comorbidities among adults and elderly. Warning signs included lethargy, vomiting, and abdominal pain, but 22.4% had no warning signs. Only 34% were suspected of dengue at initial presentation. Adults developed severe plasma leakage and 54% had multi-organ involvement. Dengue shock syndrome contributed to 70% of deaths, severe organ involvement 69%, and bleeding 29.7%. Deaths occurred at a median 3 days post-admission. The study found deng deaths primarily in adults, with deng shock the leading cause regardless of age. Atypical presentation and progression prompts early recognition and intervention to prevent deaths. The study reviewed all deng-related mortality reported between 2013-2014, with each case extensively reviewed and causes determined by an independent panel of consultant physicians. Majority of deng deaths occurred in adults of working age 15-59, highlighting the need for strengthened surveillance to capture deng-related deaths at home or out-patients.
Researchers investigated the relationship between insulin signaling and female attractiveness in the fruit fly Drosophila melanaster, finding that tissue-specific insulin signaling in the fat and ovarian follicle cells affects attractiveness. Functional ovaries were required for global insulin effects on attractiveness, and manipulations of insulin in follicle cells replicated global effects, while modulation of insulin in the body produced opposite effects, suggesting a competitive relationship with the ovary. All tissue-specific insulin manipulations that changed attractiveness also changed fecundity, indicating insulin activity as a link between fecundity and attractiveness cues. Cuticular hydrocarbons responded distinctly to fat and follicle manipulations, indicating independent readouts of pathway activity from these tissues. Insulin signaling in the fat produced opposite effects compared to global and follicle manipulations, potentially due to its function in nutrient storage. Manipulation of insulin in germline or early follic cells produced inconsistent effects on attractiveness and reproductive output, indicating insulin-dependent cues are determined non-autonomously by integration of nutrient-sensing activities from different tissues. Results show female attractiveness results from connection between attractiveness cues and organism state of high fecity created by lowered insulin in fat and increased insulin in follicle cells.
The 2013-2015 Ebola virus disease epidemic in West Africa exhibited heterogeneous transmission patterns across Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. A statistical approach was applied to estimate the basic reproduction number (R0) for each district and country using weekly incident case numbers. At the district level, R0 ranged from 0.36 to 1.72 in Guinea, 0.53 to 3.37 in Liberia, and 1.14 to 2.73 in Sierra Leone. Nationally, R0 was estimated at 0.97 for Guinea, 1.26 for Liberia, and 1.66 for Sierra Leone. Socio-demographic variables such as high population density and wealth were positively associated with R, suggesting urban growth contributed to the spread of the disease. District-level data from the epidemic was used to calculate epidemic growth and transmissibility, expressed as R for the three countries and their 53 districts. The relationship between R and socio-demographic variables was explored as potential drivers of transmission. The study confirms geographical heterogeneity in transmission and the suitability of a mixed model to quantify local growth during large-scale epidemics. The findings align with infectious disease theory but cannot fully explain the contribution of different factors.
Researchers investigated the interplay between structural properties and evolutionary age as determinants of protein evolutionary rate using a large set of one-to-one orthologs between human and mouse proteins with mapped PDB structures. They found that previously observed structural correlations hold within each age group, including relationships between solvent accessibility, designability, and evolutionary rates. However, age also plays a crucial role, modulating the relationship between solvent accessibility and rate, with younger proteins evolving faster than older ones despite being less designable. The study showed that previously reported relationships between age and rate cannot be explained by structural biases among age groups. A knowledge-based function was introduced to study protein stability through large-scale computation, revealing that older proteins are more stable for their native structure and robust to mutations than younger ones. The results underscore that several determinants, both intrinsic and historical, interact to determine rates of protein evolution. The analysis found that residues with high solvent accessibility evolve quickly, while proteins with a larger fraction of exposed residues evolve slowly, regardless of age. Protein age modulates the correlation between structural properties and evolutionary rates, supporting its role in shaping evolutionary rates beyond solvent accessibility and secondary structure.
Polycomb-like 3 (Pcl) is a component of Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that promotes embryonic stem cell self-renewal by regulating gene expression during development, differentiation, and cancer. Pcl interacts with core PR2 components, including Suz12, Eed, and Ezh2, a methyltransferase that participates in di- and tri-methylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3). Knockdown of Pcl in embryonic stem cells increases spontaneous differentiation, reducing H3K27me levels, while overexpressing Pcl increases H3K27 levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing reveals Pcl co-localizes with PR2 component Suz12, and depletion of Pcl decreases Suz12 binding at over 60% of PR2 targets. The Tudor domain of Pcl is essential for recognizing methylated histones and H3K27me formation. Pcl and its paralog P2 exist in different PR2 complexes, binding many of the same PR2 targets, particularly CpG islands regulated by Pcl. Pcl promotes the expression of multiple markers of pluripotency, and its diminishment does not derepress all PR2 targets but may derepress a subset that restrain differentiation. Pcl-dependent H3Kme regulates genes that promote differentiation upon Pcl inhibition. Thus, Pcl is a component of PR2 critical for embryonic stem self-renew, histone methylation, and recruitment of PR2 to a subset of genomic sites, providing insight into how Pcl upregulation returns cancer cells to transcription states and self-renew capacities similar to embryonic stem cells.
Researchers investigated the regulation of a feeding-state dependent chemoreceptor gene, srh-234, in Caenorhabditis elegans, which modifies chemosensory behavior in response to feeding changes. The study found that MEF-2 transcription factor acts with basic helix-loop-helix (bH) transcription factors to regulate srh234 expression as a function of feeding state. A cis-regulatory MEF binding site is necessary for starvation-induced downregulation of sr234, while an E-box binds bH factors to drive sr234 expression in ADL neurons. HLH-2, HL-3, and HL-4 act in AD neurons to regulate sr234, while MXL-3 and HL-30 in the intestine regulate sr234 remotely, dependent on insulin signaling in AD neurons. Insulin-like peptides mediate intestine-to-neuron regulation of sr234. The results suggest chemoreceptor expression is regulated by cell-autonomous and non-autonomous transcriptional mechanisms by MEF and bH factors, allowing fine-tuning of chemosensory responses to feeding state changes. Expression of sr234 in AD sensory neurons is dynamically modulated by feeding state, downregulated by starvation and upregulated in fed states. The study provides insight into how feeding-state signals are translated into chemoreceptor gene expression changes in chemosensory neurons, involving MEF2 and bH factors and cognate sites.
A study investigated the association between the detection of Mycobacterium ulcerans in mosquitoes and the risk of Buruli ulcer disease in southeastern Australia. Adult mosquitoes were trapped in seven towns on the Bellarine Peninsula in Victoria from 2004 to 2009 and screened for M. ulcerans by real-time PCR. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of Buruli ulcer in residents during the same period was tallied to determine the average incidence in each location. A strong dose-response relationship was found between the detection of M. ulcer in mosquitoes and the risk of human disease. The results support the hypothesis that mosquitoes are involved in the transmission of M. ulcer in southeastern Australia. Public health measures to minimize mosquito bites in residents and visitors should be encouraged in endemic areas. The study found a positive correlation between the proportion of M. ulcer-positive mosquitoes and the average incidence of Buruli ulcer. The association was strongest in areas with the highest incidences of Buruli and highest proportions of M. ulcer-positive mosquitoes. The findings have implications for the development of intervention strategies to control and prevent Buruli ulcer.
Researchers have identified a mutation in the Mrs2 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial Mg2+ channel, as the cause of demyelination in rats. The mutation, known as dmy, results in severe myelin breakdown in the central nervous system after normal postnatal completion of myelination. Positional cloning revealed a G-to-A transition 177 bp downstream of exon 3, generating a novel splice site that inactivates the mutant allele. Transgenic rescue with wild-type Mrs2 validated the findings. Mrs2 is essential for Mg+ homeostasis in mitochondria in yeast and human cells. Dmy rats have mitochondrial deficits, elevated lactic acid in cerebrospinal fluid, 60% reduced ATP, and increased mitochondria in oligodendrocytes. MRS-GFP recombinant BAC transgenic rats showed M2 is dominantly expressed in neurons and localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane. The study concludes dmy rats suffer from a mitochondrial disease affecting myelin maintenance, distinct from its production. Mg+ homeostasis in CNS mitochondria is essential for myelin maintenance. Morphological observations suggest demyination is enhanced by activated microglia and astroglia. The Mrs2 gene encodes an inner Mg+ channel and belongs to a family with orthologs in various species. This demyination syndrome appears unique with no reported homologue in mammals, including humans. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been observed in multiple sclerosis, but pathophysiology requires further investigation, making this mutant rat a potential tool for studying demyination diseases.
Microarray gene signatures have the potential to improve disease diagnosis and prognosis, but current documentation standards hinder their application in clinical practice due to ambiguity. Analysis of eight publicly available clinical microarray studies revealed discrepancies between study-internal and study-external diagnoses, with frequencies as high as 30% in the worst case and 18% median. Documenting a signature is conceptually different from reporting a list of genes, and even exact specification of a classification rule does not define it unambiguously. A proposed documentation strategy that includes quantitative preprocessing information reduced the discrepancy to 1%. The process of evaluating microarray expression signatures can be improved by better documentation. Eight clinical studies involving different diseases and diagnostic problems were analyzed, showing that consistency of diagnoses depends on signature documentation. Optimal consistency was obtained using the proposed documentation strategy. Evaluation of signature performance is difficult and requires proving it holds complementary information to existing markers. Unambiguous documentation is necessary for external evaluation and clinical use, but currently receives insufficient attention. The proposed approach reduces ambiguity to a minimum, enabling reliable application in clinical practice.
Researchers have determined the crystal structures of amyloid-forming segments from the major curli subunit CsgA, revealing steric zippers of tightly mated β-sheets, demonstrating a structural link between curli and human amyloids. D-enomeric peptides, originally developed to interfere with Alzheimer's disease-associated amyloid-β, inhibited CsgA fibrillation and reduced biofilm formation in Salmonella typhimurium. Csg fibrils cross-seeded fibrillation of amyloid-β, providing support for the proposed structural resemblance and potential cross-species amyloid interactions. The findings provide insights into amyogenic regions important for curli formation and suggest a novel strategy for disrupting amyloid-structured biofilms. Curli proteins mediate host adhesion, lead to immune activation, and scaffold bacterial communities as biofilms. Functional amyloids have been identified in all kingdoms of life, demonstrating a role in physiological processes. The key players in curli fibril formation are Csg and Csg, with Csg nucleating Csg fibrillation via interactions with soluble unstructured Csg monomers. Identified compounds also inhibited conversion of yeast protein to the prion state, prompting investigation into anti-amyloid therapeutics as antivulence agents targeting amyloid-structured biofilms. Amyloid folding patterns are conserved through evolution and appear in all life, with curli biogenesis secreting, nucleating, and elongating extracellular amyloid fibrils for biofilm stability. The study elucidated atomistic features of Csg spine segments, offering a strategy for disrupting cur amyloid formation and hypothesizing self-propagating prion-like species from microbial sources influencing neurodegenerative diseases.
Japanese encephalitis virus is a significant cause of encephalitis in Asia, with high fatality rates and neurologic sequelae among survivors. In the Philippines, its epidemiology is not well-defined, prompting a systematic review to support vaccine introduction into the national schedule. A review of literature and surveillance data from 2011-2014 identified 29 reports on Japanese encephalitis, including serologic surveys, clinical cases, and animal studies. Japanese encephalitis virus was the causative agent in 7-18% of meningitis and encephalitis cases and 16-40% of encephalitis cases, predominantly affecting children under 15 years, with 6-7% resulting in death. Surveillance from 2011-2014 identified 73 laboratory-confirmed cases out of 497 tested. The review demonstrates the endemicity and geographic range of Japanese encephalitis in the Philippines, supporting vaccine use. Continued surveillance is needed to quantify the burden, prioritize high-risk areas, determine vaccine introduction age and schedule, and measure immunization impact. Japanese encephalitis constitutes a public health burden, with estimated 68,000 annual cases worldwide, 40,000 in the Western Pacific, mostly among children under 15, with 30% fatality and 30-50% long-term neuropsychological sequelae in survivors. The review supports inclusion of Japanese encephalitis vaccine in the national immunization program.
The evolutionary origins of genetic robustness in bacteria are still debated, with possible factors including environmental conditions, metabolic requirements, and adaptive selection for genes that endure perturbations. A large-scale computational study of metabolic networks across hundreds of bacterial species and diverse environments found that variations in robustness reflect ecological adaptations. Robustness can be decoupled into environmental-dependent and independent components, with the former accounting for 20% of non-essential reactions and associated with species lifestyle, and the latter correlating with metabolic capacities, such as growth rate and secondary metabolite production. Environmental-dependent robustness is linked to species' ability to thrive in various habitats, while environmental-independent robustness is higher in fast growers and producers of secondary metabolites. Reactions susceptible to perturbations in human pathogens were identified as potential novel drug targets. Genetic robustness can be studied at various biological levels, from molecular to organism, with environmental robustness varying greatly across species. The evolution of new metabolic pathways contributes to environmental robustness, and modularity of metabolic networks correlates with environmental robustness. Adaptive and non-adaptive origins of genetic robustness have been proposed, with evidence supporting the driving force of increased metabolic capacities in evolution.
Schistosoma mansoni infection is associated with immune modulation that can influence responses to non-schistosome antigens, potentially impairing vaccine responses in infected individuals. A randomized trial, the Immune Modulation and Childhood Immunisation study, investigated the effects of S. mansoni infection on childhood measles catch-up immunization and praziquantel treatment in Entebbe, Uganda. 193 S. mansoni-infected and 61 uninfected children aged 3-5 years were enrolled. Infected children were randomized to receive prazantel 2 weeks before, at the time of, or 1 week after measles immunization. Anti-meas IgG levels were measured at enrollment, 1 and 24 weeks post-immunization. S. mansoni-infected children had lower anti-meas Ig levels at 1 week postimmunization compared to uninfected children. Praziquant treatment improved anti-meas Ig levels among S. mansoni-infected children. At 24 weeks postimmunization, Ig levels did not differ between groups, but tended to be lower in previously infected children still S. mansoni-positive. The findings suggest S. mansoni infection reduces antibody response to catch-up measles immunization and prazantel treatment improves response. Effective schistosomiasis control may be beneficial for vaccine efficacy.
The evolution of bacterial populations has become better understood through large-scale sequencing of population samples, revealing the need for DNA sequences from multiple genes and broad coverage to obtain an unbiased view of genetic structure and ancestry. Traditional statistical methods, such as phylogenetic analysis, face difficulties with extensive sampling and recombination. To address this, new statistical tools for detecting recombination and representing population structure have been introduced, including a model-based description of sequence space in terms of molecular variability and affinity. These tools, available in BAPS 5.2 software, were applied to Neisseria genus data, demonstrating potential when combined with phylogenetic analysis. BAPS captures distinct biological signals, requiring careful interpretation with complementary methods and strain knowledge. A sample of 508 Neisseria meningitis and Neia lactam species illustrates complexity, with assumptions based on a simplified evolutionary model of common ancestors. Traditional genetic tools are inapplicable due to molecular data, while phylogenetic analyses may distort relationships with recombination. The introduced tools enable large-scale analysis, overcoming computational limitations of standard Bayesian methods, applied to databases with complex admixture patterns, validated with Neisser species due to frequent homologous recombination and horizontal gene flow.
Cortical rhythms, particularly in the beta frequency band around 20 Hz, play a crucial role in cognitive abilities and attention. A computational model of sensory areas was built to elucidate the functional roles of beta rhythms and underlying mechanisms, showing top-down beta rhythms activate synaptic projections from L5 to L4 and L2/3, responsible for biased competition in superficial layers. Slow-inhibitory interneurons resonate to the 20 Hz input and modulate activity in superficial layers in an attention-related manner, providing a potential mechanism for cholinergic drive to support selective attention. Top-down beta projected to L5 interneurons modulate superficial activity by generating ascending projections to upper layers, with exclusive roles for excitatory and inhibitory synaptic projections. The model shows top-down beta rhythms enhance gamma in L2/3, reduce beta in L2/3, and enhance spiking activity of L2/3 cells when associated with attention inside the receptive field. Excitatory interne connections give rise to biased competition, consistent with lateral connections in the model, supporting the proposal that interlaminar interaction regulated by top-down rhythms supports selective attention. The study used a computational model to address whether top-down rhythms can bias competition, reproducing neurophysiological findings that stimulus presentation generates gamma rhythms and elevated spiking, and attention enhances neural responses. Bottom-up inputs simulated by 100 Hz asynchronous trains of EPSCs introduced to L4 E and FS cells of columns test whether top-down rhythms can reproduce these findings, indicating top-down beta can support attentional modulation through interlaminar interaction.
Stochastic transmission models are useful for studying the emergence of novel pathogens, but methods for parameter estimation and prediction remain limited. A new framework, Multiple Shooting for Stochastic systems (MSS), applies a linear approximation to describe size of fluctuations and updates the belief about the epidemic state with each new observation. Using simulated outbreaks, the method evaluates accuracy of real-time estimation and prediction during epidemics with weekly counts of diagnosed cases as a proxy for incidence. Results show accurate estimates of key parameters, including infectious duration, R0, and Reff, and unobserved infectious individuals. The method also predicts future hospitalizations and attack rates. Compared to benchmark methods, including likelihood approximation, particle filtering, and ensemble Kalman filter, MSS outperforms in most scenarios. The method addresses challenges in estimation and prediction when the epidemic state is partially observed and behavior is stochastic. The posterior distribution is updated with new observations and used for prediction. Simulation experiments compare performance in estimating parameters, predicting behaviors, and inferring the state, testing sensitivity to noise and model misspecification. Estimating epidemic parameters is challenging due to stochastic dynamics and complex processes, requiring tools for inference from imperfect observations.
Human visual perception is shaped by two contrasting forces: sensory adaptation and past decisions. Research using multilevel modeling and cross-validation approaches investigated the impact of previous stimuli and decisions on behavioral reports during forced-choice tasks, revealing each perceptual reports are permeated by biases from a hierarchy of serially dependent processes. Low-level adaptation repels perception away from previous stimuli, whereas decisional traces attract perceptual reports toward the past. The findings support a two-process model of serial dependence where persistence of readout in decision compensates sensory adaptation, leading to attractive biases in sequential perception. Two forces interact at any moment, shaping perception, biasing appearance toward or away from past, with repulsive forces dominating after stimuli requiring no perception. The history of decisions represents a source of perceptual bias combining or outweighing previous stimuli impact. A hierarchical view of serial dependence shows decisional affects current perceptual decisions even with new stimuli. A unified account of concatenated perceptual and decisional processes presents a model where adaptation and decision inertia interact, shaping experience and reactions to environmental stimuli. Serial dependence is regulated by two mechanisms: repulsive after sensory exposure and attractive after perceptual reports.
Researchers investigated the role of transcription in circadian timekeeping in Drosophila by analyzing the effects of a CY-VP16 fusion protein, which combines the circadian protein CY with the potent viral transcriptional activator VP16. The CLK-CY-VP complex showed enhanced transcriptional activity compared to the normal CLK-CY complex in both in S2 cells and flies expressing CY-VP. Flies with CY-VP had increased levels of CLK-CY target mRNAs, including per and tim, and exhibited a short period, implicating circadian transcription in period determination. Reporter gene expression in CY-VP-expressing flies suggested the short period was due to rapid transcriptional phase. The behavioral effects required a per promoter, indicating increased transcription was responsible for the observed effects. The timing of transcriptional activation, not the activation itself, was key to the behavioral effects in CY-VP-expressing flies. The results suggest circadian transcription contributes to core circadian function in Dophila. The increased activity was manifested in reporter genes and transgenic flies had increased levels of CLK-CY direct mRNAs, including per and tim. CY-VP-expressing flies had a short period, implicating circadian transcription in period determination. Overall, the findings indicate circadian transcription plays a role in period determination in Drosila, with the timing of transcriptional activation being crucial for behavioral effects.
Horizontally acquired genes typically function as autonomous units conferring new abilities when introduced into species, but preexisting proteins in an organism can constrain their functionality if they operate on ancestral pathways. The horizontally acquired pmrD gene activates the ancestral Pmr/Pmr two-component system in Salmonella but not in Escherichia coli. Salmonella PmrD binds phosphorylated Pmr protein, protecting it from dephosphorylation by PmrB, resulting in transcription of Pmr-dependent genes, including polymyxin resistance. E. coli PmrD can activate the Pmr/PB system in Salmonella but not in E. coli, suggesting differences in controlling Pmr-P levels. E. coli PmrB displays higher phosphatase activity towards Pmr-P than Salmonella Pmr. Replacement of E. coli pmrB with Salmonella homolog renders E. coli resistant to polymyx B under Pmr-inducing conditions. Findings show quantitative differences in biochemical activities of ortholog ancestral proteins dictate the ability of horizontally acquired genes to confer species-specific traits and suggest horizontally acquired genes potentiate selection at ancestral loci. The inability of E. coli to activate Pmr/PB and resist polymyx B has been attributed to divergent Pmr protein. Replacement of E. coli pmD by Salmonella enabled activation of E. coli Pmr/PB. Pmr was acquired by lateral transfer and divergent E. coli Pmr gene rescues Salmonella mutant to activate Pmr/PB. Salmon and E. coli differ in controlling Pmr-P levels, with E. coli requiring Salmon Pmr for transcription of Pmr-activated genes.
Researchers have developed a novel statistical approach to identify differentially expressed genes during the early stages of embryonic stem cell differentiation. This method analyzes gene expression data without separating cell types, providing a more accurate detection of causal genes that promote or inhibit differentiation. Applying this approach to murine embryonic stem cells, they identified Smad1 as a novel regulator of pluripotency and self-renewal. The DifferentiationTest assumes a homogeneous initial cell mixture progressing into a heterogeneous mixture with divergent gene expression levels. Mouse embryonic stem cells differentiate into embryoid bodies, with subsets showing expression changes towards different lineages. The search for marker genes is crucial, but a principled approach was missing. Smad1 and Pias2 were detected and studied using short hairpin RNA, separating regulators into upregulated and downregulated modules. The upregulated module is the differentiation module and the downregulated is the pluripotency module. Smad1 has lower expression in differentiated cells and is detectable in 4-day embryoid bodies. The DifferentiationTest can identify uncharacterized regulators of pluripotency and self-renew and is applicable to other differentiation processes.
Researchers have developed a method to unbiasedly cluster gene variants with a phenotypic-link network, addressing confounding bias in coding sequence length that leads to false positives in functional studies. The method integrates diverse data types and assesses phenotypic agreement of inferred links, controlling for unexplored bias in coding sequence length. Genes implicated by de novo variants are biased in coding sequence length, with longer genes clustering together, resulting in exaggerated p-values. The phenic-link network outperforms other networks in identifying disease-associated gene clusters. Over 100,000 mammalian genotype-phenotype relations and bio-ontologies enhance the network through semantic similarity. The tool identifies functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease, accounting for sequencing bias, and demonstrates suitability for polygenic disorders. Functional associations between genes are inferred from large-scale omics data, including protein-protein interactions and gene-expression networks, due to unknown gene functions and limited pathway classification. Statistical significance is assessed by comparing interconnectedness of mutated genes to random sets, but interconnectedness can be biased, resulting in false positives. The phenic-link network shows superior power to identify functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease after accounting for sequencing bias and demonstrates suitability to functionally cluster variants underlying polygenic disorders.
Mexico implemented an 8% tax on non-essential foods with energy density ≥275 kcal/100g and a peso-per-liter tax on sugar-sweetened beverages in 2014 to prevent increases in obesity and diabetes. This study examined changes in volume of taxed and untaxed food purchases in response to these taxes, using data from 6248 households participating in Nielsen's Consumer Panel from 2012-2014. Results showed a 5.1% decline in taxed food purchases beyond expected pre-tax trends, with no change in untaxed food purchases. Low socioeconomic households purchased 10.2% less taxed foods, medium households 5.8% less, while high households showed no change. The decline was significant among low and medium households for subcategories like salty snacks and cereal sweets, with smaller-than-expected increases in sugar and sugar substitutes. Lower households were more responsive to the tax than middle households, while higher households showed no significant change. Overall, taxed food purchases declined 2.5g per capita per month, a 5.1% change from pre-tax trends, indicating households reduced purchases of non-essential energy-dense foods in the first year after tax implementation.
Researchers have developed a biophysically plausible model to explain the properties of collision-sensitive neurons, such as the Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LG) neuron, which responds to objects approaching on a direct collision course. The model assumes each information channel is noisy and has a response threshold, resulting in an approximate power law through pooling of these channels. This mechanism successfully predicts many characteristics of the LG neuron, with results depending critically on noise in the inhibitory pathway but being robust against noise in the excitatory pathway. The LG neuron integrates information across a large part of the visual field and responds best to objects approaching with constant velocity, with noise playing a key role in approximating a power law in the inhibitory pathway through threshold smoothing. A simple model, "n-ψ", based on an equation describing the membrane potential of the LG neuron, receives input signals and integrates them through a process that could be carried out by the dendritic tree, requiring only noise and a threshold for each channel. The model provides an alternative to previous power law-based models, addressing limitations such as predicting distorted response curves to approaching objects.
Buruli ulcer is endemic in Cameroon, with institutional control efforts beginning in 2002, 33 years after the first reported cases in 1969. The national control programme aims to detect cases early, confirm 70% by PCR, treat according to guidelines, and heal 95% without limitation. From 200 to 2014, 370 cases were notified, with detection rates dropping from 3.89 to 1.45 per 100,000 inhabitants. The number of endemic districts increased from 2 to 64. Five diagnostic and treatment centers are functional, with two more planned. The health system has been strengthened and research has gained interest. Despite progress, reduction in resources led to a drop in performance since 2010. The programme objectives have evolved to reduce suffering, ensure accessibility to quality services, and reduce morbidity. Significant milestones have been achieved, providing a foundation for improvement if resource allocation challenges are addressed.
Researchers investigated the effect of outcome valence on confidence in human learning, where participants learned stimulus-outcome associations by trial-and-error, and found that individuals were more confident in their choices when learning to seek gains compared to avoiding losses, despite equal difficulty and performance between the two contexts. Computational modeling revealed this bias is driven by context-value, a dynamically updated estimate of the average-value of options, necessary to explain equal performance in gain and loss domains. The biasing effect of context-value on confidence is domain-general with important consequences, particularly in volatile environments where individuals' learning strategies differ when outcomes are framed as gains or losses. Confidence is crucial in mediating strategies in changing environments and biases could have critical consequences on learning, revealing features of flexibility and decision-making in contexts. Individuals exhibit lower confidence in choices while learning to avoid losses compared to seeking gains, generated by learned-value, a latent variable in reinforcement models. Young adults perform equally in gain-seeking and loss-avoidance contexts, but confidence is employed as a meta-cognitive variable enabling comparisons and decisions to adjust strategies. The study shows profound asymmetries between learning to avoid losses and learning to gains despite similar behavior.
Alphavirus non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) plays a crucial role in viral replication, with a conserved aminoterminal domain involved in RNA synthesis and a poorly conserved carboxterminal region. A carboxterminal proline-rich motif in many alphaviral ns3 proteins serves as a target for Src-homology 3 (SH3) domains of amphiphin-1 and -2. ns3 proteins from Semli Forest, Sindbis, and Chikunya viruses show SH-dependent binding to amphiphins. Upon infection, intracellular amphiphin distribution is altered, colocalizing with ns3. Mutations in ns3 disrupting amphiphin SH binding and RNAi-mediated silencing of amphin-2 result in impaired RNA replication in HeLa cells infected with Sindbis or Semli Forest virus. Infection of Balb mice with Semli Forest virus carrying SH binding-defective ns3 is associated with decreased mortality. The PPR motif in ns3 is a conserved amphiphin docking site, with R426 mutation creating an amphin binding-defective derivative of Sindbis ns3. Disrupting amphiphin SH sites in Semli or Sind ns3 results in impaired RNA synthesis, revealing a positive role for ns3/amphin interaction in replication. Mutations in ns3 SH motifs abolish interaction with amphins, reducing replication in cell culture and pathogenicity in mice, indicating SH domain-mediated recruitment of host amphiphins by alphavirus ns3 promotes viral replication.
Chromoblastomycosis is a mutilating disease caused by melanized fungi of the order Chaetothyriales. Analysis of 123 clinical strains from Brazil revealed three clusters within the family Herpotrichiaceae, primarily comprising Fonseea, with Fonsecaea pedroei being the most prevalent at 80%, followed by Fonseea monophora at 13%, Fonsea nica at 3%, and a single isolate of Fonsea pugnigius. Additional agents, including two novel species, belonged to Rhinocladiella and Cyphellophora at 3% and 1% respectively. Phylogenetic analysis showed polyphyletic distribution of chromoblastomycosis agents within Chaetothyales, dispersed in three clades: jeansmei, antiana, and europaea. Rhinadiella and phialophora-like species, considered rare in the Americas, were identified, with Rhinadi nested in jeansi-clade and phialophora in europ-clade. All four Fonsea species associated with chromoblastomycosis were found in Brazil, with Fonsea pedro and nica strictly associated with the disease. Two novel species of fungi causing chromoblastomycosis were identified among the isolates, with no Cladophora carr found, likely due to Brazil's humid climate.
Listeria monocytogenes infection induces DNA breaks in host cells, activating the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway, but surprisingly, the response to these breaks is only moderately activated. The bacterial toxin listeriolysin O (LLO) plays a crucial role in blocking the signaling to DNA breaks through degradation of the sensor Mre11. Deletion or inactivation of proteins involved in the DDR promotes bacterial replication, highlighting the importance of this mechanism for controlling infection. The study demonstrates that dampening the DDR is critical for successful listerial infection. Listeria monocytes provokes DNA breaks in its host while controlling the host DDR, with wild-type bacteria modestly inducing DDR and a Δh mutant lacking LLO inducing it to a higher level. LLO dampens DDR through degradation of host protein Mre11. Extracellular listeria induces DNA breaks during infection, leading to investigation of the role of secreted toxin LLO, a known virulence factor. Deletion or inhibition of proteins implicated in DDR leads to higher levels of infection, demonstrating DDR as a negative regulator of bacterial infection. Overall, the study uncovers subversion of DDR during listeria infection and a role for DDR in blocking bacterial proliferation.
Researchers have identified bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) as a critical player in HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection through a chemical library screen of epigenetic regulation. Treatment with pan-BD inhibitors enhanced infection, and J1, a defined BD1 inhibitor, acts through BR4, as knockdown of BR4 expression ablated J1's effect on infection. BR4 regulates replication through a complex involving CDK9 and RNAP, while J1 promotes infection by allocating the complex to viral gene promoters. Suppression of BR4 expression or inhibition of CDK activity impedes infection. Data supports a model where J1 enhances infection by switching BR4 to transcription of viral expression from chromatin. Transient expression of BR4 BD1 or BD1/2 domains had a similar effect to J1 treatment. BR4 is a modulator for J1 action on infection and has an essential role in infection. J1 promotes infection by diverting BR4 function due to BD blocking, and BR4 regulates transcription of cellular genes by recruiting positive elongation factor PTEb and transcription activators. Bromodomain inhibition enhances infection by promoting transcription factor association with viral promoters. Treatments annulled the effect of J1 on infection, demonstrating BR4 regulates infection by recruiting transcription factors for viral expression. BD inhibitors augment infection by devoting factors to sites of viral transcription, and BD domains function similarly to J1 on infection by competing with BR4 for acetyl lysine interactions.
Researchers investigated the microbial ecology of noma, a devastating illness causing facial disfigurement in malnourished children, by sequencing 16S rRNA gene fragments from sixty gingival fluid samples. Samples were taken from twelve healthy children, twelve with noma lesions and healthy sites, and twelve with Acute Necrotizing Gingivitis lesions and healthy sites. Results showed lesions in diseased mouths were enriched with Spirochaetes and depleted Proteobacteria, while healthy sites in diseased mouths had similar proportions to healthy individuals. Noma samples did not have a higher abundance of Fusobacterium, casting doubt on its role as causative agent. Microbial communities from noma and Acute Necrotizing Gingitis lesions were dominated by Prevotella intermedia, less abundant in healthy sites. Multivariate analysis confirmed bacterial communities in healthy and lesion sites were different. Orders Erysipelotrichales, Clostridiales, Bacteroidales, and Spirochaeta were identified as indicators of noma, suggesting one or more microbes within these are associated with noma development. The study aimed to catalog bacteria in noma lesions and identify candidate noma-triggering organisms, revealing distinct microbial communities in noma-affected children. Samples from noma and Acute Necizing Gingivitis were compared to healthy gingival from same children and healthy controls, providing insights into noma etiology.
Bacillus thuringiensis uses quorum sensing to coordinate adaptation and cell fate, including sporulation, during its infectious cycle in insect hosts. The Npr regulator, part of the RNPP family, acts as a transcription factor in the presence of its signaling peptide Npr, regulating genes for survival in the insect cadaver. However, in the absence of NX, Npr negatively controls sporulation by inhibiting expression of Spo0-regulated genes and preventing KinA-dependent phosphorylation of phosphotransferase SpoF. This function is similar to Rap proteins, which indirectly control gene expression via protein interactions. The structure of Npr displays a flexible Rap-like structure, suggesting a common inhibition of the sporulation phosphorelay. The bifunctional regulator Npr is involved in two functions, with Npr binding switching Npr from a dimer inhibitor of sporulation to tetrameric transcription activator in necrotrophic lifestyle. Npr coordinates sporulation and necrotism, ensuring survival and dissemination during infection. Quorum sensing in Gram-positive bacteria involves secretion of diffusible peptides recognized by responders, eliciting a response by binding to effector proteins or triggering phosphorelay. The Npr-NX system functions as a typical Gram-positive quorum-sensing system, modulating SpoA phosphorylation and ensuring SpoA concentration for sporulation initiation in bacteria engaged in necrotism. This coupling of necrotism with spore formation ensures survival and dissemination during infection, revealing new properties of Npr and NX in developmental programs of B. cereus group bacteria.
Researchers have developed proteochemometric models to predict the efficacy of HIV inhibitors by combining chemical and protein properties in a single bioactivity model, utilizing a large clinical database of genotypic and phenotypic information with over 300,000 drug-mutant bioactivity data points. The models achieved a prediction error below 0.5 Log Change and outperformed previously published sequence-derived models in resistance prediction and classification. Known and unpublished resistance-conferring mutations of HIV Reverse Transcriptase and Protease were confirmed and identified. The models were applied prospectively to the HIV database from Stanford University, obtaining a correct prediction rate of 84% compared to 80 in previous work. Proteochem models accurately predict phenotypic resistance based on genotyp data, including novel mutants and mixtures, and provide applicability to prediction, informing the user about reliability. The models can estimate which drugs will be least influenced by resistance and predict activity of antiretroviral drugs on untested in the dataset, corresponding to a patient with a new, unseen genotype that needs to be treated in the clinic. The approach takes into account chemical similarity between drugs, providing valuable information for identifying related structures that show activity against a target.
A computational model of cell movement and chemotaxis based on pseudopod autocatalysis has been developed to test the explanatory and predictive powers of pseudod-based models in predicting complex cell behavior in chemotaxis. The model reproduces a wide range of existing data on cell movement and chemotaxis, simulating polarization and persistence without stimuli and selection of pseudopods when chemoattract gradients are present. It predicts bias of pseudod position in low chemoattract gradients and lateral pseudod initiation in high gradients. The angle between successive pseudods at the front of the cell increases in proportion to the difference between the cell's direction and the direction of the gradient, which was experimentally confirmed in chemotaxing Dictyostelium cells. The model and data suggest an intrinsic pseudod cycle lies at the heart of cell motility, with chemotaxis relying on modification of intrinsic pseudod behavior rather than generation of new pseudods or actin polymerization by chemoattracts. The model's simplicity and robustness to changes in parameters produce emergent properties of complex cell behavior, indicating a need for a change in experimental approach to understanding chemaxis, focusing on internal dynamics rather than external signals and pathways.
Fleas can transmit Yersinia pestis through two mechanisms, early-phase transmission and biofilm-dependent transmission, with varying efficiency among species. The source of rodent blood used for the infectious meal is a complicating variable. Fleas fed bacteremic mouse, rat, guinea pig, or gerbil blood showed that 10-28% of those fed rat or guinea pig blood refluxed a portion of the infected meal into the esophagus within 24 hours, termed post-infection esophageal reflux. This correlated with accumulation of Y. pestis, red cell stroma, and oxyhemoglobin in the proventriculus. Fleas with post-infection esophage reflux were 3-25 times more likely to appear blocked with fresh blood at the next feeding. Oropsylla montana transmitted more CFU after feeding on bacteremic rat blood than mouse blood, with enhanced transmission being biofilm-dependent. The data supports a model where early-phase transmission results from regurgitation of Y. pest from a partially obstructed foregut and can overlap with biofilm transmission. The insolubility of hemoglobin in rat and Sciurid blood and slower digestion promotes regitative transmission, making them prominent in plague ecology. Post-infection esophage reflux occurred in fleas using rat red blood cells in PBS, indicating coagulation factors are not essential. Different rodent blood sources modulate early infection of the flea foregut by Y pest, with poorly soluble hemoglobin being digested slowly.
Researchers have found that positive correlations in neuronal activity can significantly enhance coding performance by suppressing error probability and increasing the number of stimuli that can be encoded. This effect can occur in populations with as few as tens of neurons and does not require unrealistic correlation values. Heterogeneity in population activity can also contribute to error suppression and capacity enhancement. A specific pattern of correlation can lead to a 'lock-in' of response, eliminating variability and allowing for perfect coding. The study demonstrates that positive correlations can have a profound effect on coding fidelity, modulating how it scales with the number of neurons, resulting in massive enhancement. This challenges previous findings that correlations are detrimental or marginally favorable to independent codes, instead showing they can suppress errors by orders of magnitude and boost capacity more than tenfold. The phenomenon, referred to as high-fidelity coding, exploits the idea that correlations can relegate variability into non-informative modes of population activity, reducing ambiguity between stimulus distributions. The findings suggest that tuning parameters can yield a limit of perfect coding and propose experimental tests to identify this pattern, highlighting the importance of considering true population effects in understanding the role of correlations in coding.
Researchers have developed a conjugate vaccine against Vibrio cholerae, the cause of cholera, by combining the O-specific polysaccharide of the V. cholerae O1 Inaba strain with a recombinant fragment of tetanus toxin heavy chain. The vaccine induced serum and lamina proprial responses against the polysaccharide and provided protection in mice. Immunized mice developed anti-polysaccharide and anti-tetanus toxin IgG responses and vibriocidal antibody and memory B cell responses following vaccination. Intestinal lamina proprial IgA responses occurred after intradermal vaccination. The vaccine was effective with or without adjuvant and showed 55% efficacy in a mouse cholera challenge model. The development of this conjugate vaccine could provide long-term immune responses against cholera, particularly beneficial for young children who respond poorly to polyschar antigens. Various vaccine preparations, doses, and immunization routes were assessed, with intradermal administration inducing responses in intestinal tissue. The vibriodal response largely targets V. cholera lipopolysaccharide and vaccination resulted in production of vibriodal antibodies, although lower than those induced by available oral cholera vaccines. This Inaba conjugate vaccine induces functional and protective anti-polysacchar responses and memory, offering potential for improved cholera control.
A cross-sectional study was conducted in 42 villages across three regions of Cameroon to assess the prevalence and intensity of Wuchereria bancrofti, Loa loa, and Mansonella perstans. Immunochromatographic test positivity was strongly associated with high L loa microfilaria intensity, with 21 subjects having more than 8,000 L loa microf/ml. A strong association was observed between the prevalence of L loa and ICT positivity by area, with a rate of 1% or more of positive results found in areas with L loa microf prevalence above 15%. No association was found between ICT positivity and Mansonella perst prevalence or microfilar density. The study confirms the association between ICT positivity and L loa intensity, suggesting that high levels of L loa are a confounding factor for positive test results. The findings indicate Wuchereria bancft is less prevalent in Central Africa where L loa is highly endemic than previously assumed, and re-mapping the region would be useful for shrinking the lymphatic filariasis distribution map. Overall, 219 individuals participated, with 24 tested positive by ICT and 20 diagnosed with lymphedema, mostly in the North-west region, but none were positive for Wuchereria bancft microf.
Researchers have used electron tomography to study the three-dimensional structure of coronavirus-induced membrane alterations in infected cells, revealing a reticulicular network of modified endoplasmic reticulum that supports SARS-coronavirus replication. The network consists of convoluted membranes, double-membrane vesicles, and vesicle packets, with viral replicase subunits primarily localized to the convoluted membranes and double-stranded RNA to the interior of double-membrane vesicles. The double-membrane vesicles, previously thought to be isolated, are integrated into this network and lack connections to the cytosol, raising questions about their formation and role in RNA synthesis. The virus reorganizes host membranes into a network for replication, potentially hiding RNA from antiviral mechanisms. The study provides ultrastructural description of the replication network, aiding in understanding the early stages of the coronavirus life cycle and virus-host interactions. Double-membrane vesicles had been observed in coronavirus-infected cells, but their origin and role were debated, now shown to form a reticulicular network with viral replicase subunits and double-stranded RNA associated. The findings suggest the double-mane vesicles are closed and their morphogenesis is unresolved, with virus budding observed from outer membranes, indicating convergence of replication and assembly compartments.
Researchers have found that suberin forms an extracellular barrier in Arabidopsis roots, affecting water relations and mineral nutrition. Using the suberin1 mutant, a connection was established between suberin in roots and water movement through the plant and solute accumulation in the shoot. Mutants with increased suberin had reduced transpiration rates and increased water-use efficiency during growth. Changes in suberin and water transport were associated with decreased accumulation of Ca, Mn, and Zn, and increased accumulation of Na, S, K, As, Mo in the shoot. The study provides genetic evidence that suberin controls water and ion uptake and transport to leaves, and radial transport of Ca, Mn, Zn occurs in the apoplast. Elevated suberin enhances the barrier, reducing water movement to the shoot and water loss from the root to soil. Peak daytime transpiration in mutants was 15% of wild-type plants. The findings support the model that suberin acts as an extracellular barrier limiting apoplastic transport of water and solutes. Elevated root suberin is associated with increased time to wilting during water stress due to reduced stomatal aperture and daytime transpiration. The study suggests suberin may aid in developing drought-resistant crops with improved water-use efficiency.
Researchers investigated the kinetics of rhodopsin deactivation and its role in regulating the recovery and reproducibility of rod photoresponse in vertebrate phototransduction. A Continuous Time Markov Chain model based on the biochemistry of rhodin activation and deactivation was interfaced with a spatio-temporal model of phototransduction to analyze the parameters extracted from photoresponse data of wild-type and mutant mice with variable phosphorylation sites. The results showed that the randomness of sojourn times in each phosphorylated states contributes to the Coefficient of Variation of the response, whereas the randomness of the number of R* turnoff steps has negligible effect. The study found that rhodopsin shutoff is responsible for variability of photoresponse, while diffusion of second messengers acts as a suppressor. The prevailing view that larger number of decay steps leads to more stable photoresponse was countered. The model reproduced both wild-type and mutant responses with the same set of parameters and dissected sources of variability into components. Rhodin deactivation with one or several phosphorylation sites was simulated and mutant rhodins with fewer sites generated SPRs of extended durations. Initial deactivation is attributed to rhin phosphorylation preserved in arrestin knockout mice.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework to analyze stochastic reaction networks in fluctuating environments by decoupling the network from its environment and incorporating environmental effects into a new model. This approach allows for the marginalization of fluctuating extrinsic components, such as chemical species, to obtain a decoupled model, enabling the derivation of corresponding process and master equations and stochastic simulations. The framework provides a self-contained stochastic model summarizing system behaviors under possible realizations of extrinsic fluctuations, facilitating uncoupled analysis of reaction networks subject to extrinsic noise. The decoupled dynamics offer a tool to study environmental stochasticity propagation in coupled networks, splitting total noise into suppressed and sensed noise terms. This approach reduces computational effort in Monte Carlo simulations, especially for costly environmental networks, highlighting its role in splitting biochemical networks into easier-to-simulate parts. The reaction network's time-evolution is described by a continuous-time Markov chain with chemical species and reaction channels, with the system state denoted at time and its random path on intervals. The framework demonstrates significance through case studies, providing a general tool for analyzing stochastic networks in fluctuating environments, accounting for both intrinsic and extrinsic noise caused by intracellular variations.
Researchers have developed a novel brain-machine interface architecture that enables robust control and adaptation using spike events, extending to various tasks. The architecture incorporates an infinite-horizon optimal-control model of the brain's behavior and a point process model of spikes, allowing neural processing, control, and decoder adaptation with every event. The model infers user intention during closed-loop decoder adaptation and designs autonomous dynamic training. Experiments in non-human primates showed improved performance with optimal-control intention estimation, consistent control with assisted training, and faster convergence with spike-based adaptation. Results have implications for clinically-viable neuroprosthetics. The architecture consists of two components: a unified control-theoretic framework for intention estimation and training, and dynamic spike-based adaptation. Optimal-control models brain behavior as an infinite-horizon feedback controller, inferring velocity during adaptation. Spike-based adaptation resulted in faster and consistent convergence compared to batch methods and was robust to parameter initialization. The architecture extends control to tasks beyond training and has significant implications for neuroprosthetic development. The novel closed-loop training enables subjects to control at the time-scale of spike events and adapts parameters dynamically with every event, outperforming current decoders and methods.
Researchers investigated the effect of stimulus structure on redundancy in the retina by measuring simultaneous responses from populations of retinal ganglion cells presented with natural and artificial stimuli varying in correlation. The results showed that responding to spatio-temporally structured stimuli, pairs of ganglion cells were modestly correlated, but less than predicted by a non-adapting functional model of retinal response. In contrast, responding to stimuli with purely spatial correlations, pairs showed increased correlations consistent with a static non-adap receptive field nonline. The retina removes redundancies in spatio-temporally correlated stimuli but the output is not completely decorrelated, with correlations reduced to a level similar to those in responses to white noise checkerboards. The mammalian retina maintains a moderate level of output correlation across a range of spatio-temporally correlated stimuli. The amount of correlation varies between stimuli but changes less than predicted by a non-adting linear model. The gain of retinal gang cells responding to correlated stimuli changes with effective contrast and the standard deviation of the input to nonline in a linear model. Properties of individual cells, including faster temporal kernels and stronger surrounds, explained the pattern of pairwise correlations across stimuli where receptive measurements were possible. The retina never fully decorrelated its input, even for the least correlated white noiseboard stimuli, some correlations were present between pairs of retinal ganglion cell trains, suggesting the retina dynamically adjusts its coding strategy to represent the stimulus efficiently.
Researchers have developed an integrative multi-network and multi-classifier approach to predict genetic interactions, specifically synthetic lethal interactions, in yeast. This approach utilizes a large set of features characterizing relationships between gene pairs from various data sources, independent of known interactions, to improve prediction performance. A non-parametric multi-classifier system enables simultaneous use of multiple classification procedures, demonstrating improved results compared to current methods. The approach was used to derive the first yeast transcription factor genetic interaction network, supported by literature, and predict interactions between non-essential gene pairs in yeast. Features from physical interactions and functional annotations were most discriminative, consistent with previous findings. Comprehensive experiments showed improved performance on several datasets, particularly for gene pairs not connected to known interactions. The method extends previous approaches, such as MND, and is expected to be effective in uncovering new interactions in yeast and higher organisms like mouse and human, where few interactions have been identified. A dataset of predicted yeast genetic interactions is available. The synthetic lethal network comprised 999 interactions covering 250 genes, with each having 8 connections on average. The overall dataset, SGD-SL, consisted of 135,503 interactions.
The BRCA Challenge is a global data-sharing project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health to aggregate BRCA1 and BRCA data, aiming to understand the impact of genetic variation on cancer risk. Over 20,000 variants have been aggregated, with approximately 7,250 expert classifications, from public databases such as ClinVar, Leiden Open Variation Database, and population databases. The BRCA Exchange provides a reliable and accessible record of variants for high-penetrance phenotypes. The project has brought together international experts, clinicians, diagnosticians, researchers, and database providers to advance understanding of BRCA and BR2 variation. Ongoing work includes data sharing, development of methods for extraction of genetic variation, and engagement with communities to understand clinical significance. The BRCA represents a step in sharing and collaborative annotation of BR1 and BR2 variants to advance human health. The BR Exchange is an open-access portal delivering a solution to improve data sharing and classification, improving care for clinicians, patients, and families. The BR1 and BR2 variant set includes data from participating groups, academic sources, ClinVar, Exome Aggregation Consortium, 1000 Genomes Project, and others. The BR Challenge demonstrates a model of data sharing, bringing together clinicians, researchers, scientists, patients, and advocates.
Malaria, caused by the apicomplexan parasite Plasmodium, remains a significant threat to human health, resulting in approximately one million deaths annually. To maintain redox balance and pathogenicity, Plasium relies on adequate antioxidant and redox processes. A comprehensive study mapped the subcellular localization of major antioxidant and redox proteins in Plasium falciparum, revealing the first complete picture of redox compartmentation. Two plasial peroxiredoxins and a putative glyoxalase were targeted to the apicoplast, a non-photosynthetic plastid. The compartmentation of thiorexin and glutaredin-like proteins was also obtained. Notably, Plasium utilizes alternative-translation-initiation to achieve differential targeting of glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase. The apoplast harbors plant-like metabolic pathways, including fatty acid and haem biosynthesis, but lacks catalase and genuine glutathione peroxidase, offering potential for chemotherapeutic development. The study demonstrates the existence of two NADPH-dependent redox systems with broad antioxidant mechanisms in Plasium. The findings provide a tool to understand cellular functions and interactions of the redox network, showing alternative-translation-initiation in apicomplex parasites translates protein isoforms with differing subcellular localization from one gene, opening avenues for therapeutic intervention.
Researchers investigated the role of non-native electrostatic interactions in the coupled folding and binding of PUM, an intrinsically disordered protein, with its partner Mcl-1. Using a structure-based coarse-grained model with an explicit Debye-Hückel charge, they probed the importance of electrostatic interactions in this process. The model was calibrated with experimental data on helical content and affinity and shown to be consistent with published data on binding rate changes with respect to ionic strength. Results indicate that intramolecular electrostatic interactions marginally influence the unbound state of PUM, while intermolecular electrostatic interactions, particularly non-native electrostatic interactions, are involved in the formation of the initial complex. The study reveals the binding mechanism in detail, highlighting the importance of electrostatic interactions for describing reactions of intrinsically disordered proteins. Simulations without electrostatic interactions and at different ionic strengths were performed, showing that association rates decrease at higher ionic strengths where charges are more screened and electrostatic interactions are weakened. The findings portray an induced binding process with PUM being relatively disordered at the transition state, accelerated by electrostatic interactions. The results suggest that electrostatic interactions play a crucial role in the binding of PUM to Mcl-1, consistent with experimental data showing association rates affected by salt concentrations. This approach could provide predictions for results of mutational studies, offering insights into coupled folding and binding processes of intrinsically disordered proteins.
Polycomb group proteins are conserved chromatin factors that maintain silencing of key developmental genes outside their expression domains. Recent studies have shown Polycomb distribution with discrete binding to Polycomb response elements. Within the nucleus, Polycomb proteins localize in structures called Polycomb bodies that contain silenced genes. Researchers studied the nuclear distribution of two Polycomb proteins, Polycomb and Polyhomeotic, using immunostaining, immuno-FISH, and live imaging of GFP fusion proteins to analyze formation and mobility during fly embryogenesis. Results show Polycomb bodies correspond to 3D counterparts of linear genomic domains identified in genome studies, accumulating on euchatin domains containing histone H3 tri-methyl on K27. Time-lapse analysis indicates two types of motion, long-range and fast, with Polycomb bodies moving within volumes larger than condensed chromatin. Both move within smaller volumes than chromosome territories, restricting interaction with other structures. The fast motion decreases in late developmental stages, indicating chromatin dynamics contribute to stable silencing. Polycomb enrichment in bodies after homolog pairing suggests they are nuclear counterparts of genomic domains rather than structures for silencing. Polycomb accumulates in discrete spots in Drosila and mammals, with motion less sensitive to temperature than chromatin, possibly buffering environmental effects for Polycomb-dependent silencing stability.
Researchers utilized ultra-deep sequencing to study genome-wide mitochondrial DNA mutation load in the liver of normally and prematurely-aging mice, finding that mice with a proof-reading-deficient mtDNA polymerase have 10 times higher point mutation loads than their wildtype siblings. The mtDNA mutator mice also have increased levels of truncated linear mtDNA molecules, resulting in decreased sequence coverage in the deleted region, but circular DNA molecules with deletions occur at extremely low frequencies and do not drive premature aging. Sequence analysis shows most mutations in heterozygous mt mutator mice and wildtype are inherited from their mothers, consistent with germline transmission. No increase in point mutations or deletions were found in wildtype mice with age, questioning their causative role in aging, and no frequency of transversion mutations increased with time, arguing against oxidative damage as a major cause. Results indicate most somatic mtDNA mutations occur as replication errors during development, not accumulation in adult life. The mt mutator mice display high levels of point mutations and linear mtDNA, but not impaired translation in heart or liver, and deleted mtDNA levels are lower than in respiratory deficient strains, suggesting circular mtDNA deletions are not the causative factor in aging.
Researchers have discovered a novel Na+-driven ATP synthase membrane rotor with a two-carboxylate ion-coupling motif in the anaerobic bacterium Fusobacterium nucleatum, which generates a transmembrane gradient of Na+ through glutamate decarboxylation. The ion-motive force is directly coupled to ATP synthesis via an F1Fo-ATP synthase with a Na+ recognition motif shared by other human pathogens. Molecular modeling and simulations indicate Na+ specificity in physiological settings, and activity measurements show Na+ stimulation of the enzyme, either membrane-embedded or isolated, with ATP synthesis sensitive to the Na ionophore monensin. Na+ has a protective effect against inhibitors targeting ion-binding sites in both the complete ATPase and isolated c-ring. Crystal structures of the c11 ring at 2.2 and 2.6 Å resolution reveal Na ions occupying all binding sites, each coordinated by four amino acids and a water, with two carboxates mediating ion binding instead of one. Simulations demonstrate a proton concurrently bound to all sites, although Na+ drives the rotary mechanism. The structure reveals a new mode of ion coupling in ATP synthases, providing a basis for drug design against opportunistic pathogens. The c-ring features two glutamate residues in each ion-binding site, a motif observed in other Na+-binding proteins, with implications for ion transport and specificity unclear. Biochemical studies show Na+ protects the enzyme from inhibition, particularly at lower pH, consistent with DCC modification of Glu65, indicating a specific Na+ binding site in the c-ring of F. nucleatum ATPase.
Researchers investigated the influence of T cell receptor (TCR) and major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule interactions on T cell responses in vivo, tracking CD4 T cell activation, effector, and memory responses to immunization with peptides exhibiting varying TCR/pMHC half-lives and in vitro cell activation potencies. Contrary to in vitro studies, optimal in vivo T cell responses occurred with ligands of intermediate TCR/pM half-lives. Diminished in vivo responses to the ligand with the longest TCRM half-life were associated with attenuation of intracellular signaling, expansion, and function over time. The findings reveal a level of control over T cell activation in vivo not seen in vitro, highlighting the importance of considering in vivo efficacy of TCR ligands in vaccine design. Activation of T cells by peptides bound to pMHC molecules initiates adaptive immunity, characterized by low-affinity interactions between TCR and pHC. Studies using peptides varying TCR contact residues advanced understanding of biochemical requirements for cell activation, with affinity and half-life of T/pM interactions as determinants of cell potency. However, results showed diminished T responses to strong TCR ligands in vivo, with optimal responses in the middle of the avidity spectrum, suggesting reconsideration of vaccination strategies aiming for maximum-avid TCR recognition with engineered ligands.
The genome of Nectria haematocca, also known as Fusarium solani, has been analyzed, revealing a large genome size of 54.43 Mb and 15,707 predicted genes, among the largest reported for ascomycetes. Optical mapping showed 17 chromosomes ranging from 530 kb to 6.52 Mb, with two classes of genes contributing to expansion: unique genes not found in other fungi and genes with multiple copies in N. haematocca. Supernumerary chromosomes 14, 15, and 17 contain repeat sequences, unique and duplicated genes, and lower G+C content. The origin of extra genes and supernary chromosomes is unknown, but the expansion is consistent with the species' diverse habitats. The presence of unique genes on supernary chromosomes may account for individual isolates having different environmental niches. Members of the Fusarium solani complex, including N. haematocca, can colonize over 100 plant genera and cause opportunistic infections in humans, with conditionally dispensable supernary chromosomes controlling habitat colonization. Over 50% of proteins encoded genes on chromosome 17 have no similarity to other fungi, suggesting enrichment of ancient or horizontally transferred genes. Gene families in N. haocca are larger than in other ascomycetes.
Researchers developed a live-cell fluorescence microscopy method to visualize the final transport and exocytosis of pseudorabies virus particles in non-polarized epithelial cells, elucidating the location, dynamics, and mechanisms of alpha-herpesvirus egress. The method uses total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to image virus particles near the plasma membrane and a virus-encoded pH-sensitive probe to visualize the moment and location of particle exocytosis. Individual virus particles travel to the plasma membrane inside acidified secretory vesicles containing Rab GTPases, Rab6, Rab8, and Rab11, key regulators of the plasma-directed secretory pathway. These vesicles undergo fast, directional transport to the site of exocytosis, often near LLβ, part of a complex anchoring microtubules to the plasma membrane. After docking, membrane fusion occurs, displacing the virion a distance across the plasma, and particles remain confined on the outer surface. The findings contradict earlier studies suggesting plasma membrane invaginations as sites of egress and cytoskeleton-depleted exocytosis sites. The study proposes an integrated model linking intracellular pathways and exytosis mechanisms mediating alpha-herpesvirus egress. Rab proteins spatially and dynamically associated with viral exytosis were identified, and no evidence of specialized cytoskeleton-depleted exytosis sites was found.
A study examined the impact of Enterius vermicis infection and mebendazole treatment on intestinal microbiota and host immune response in 109 primary school children. Enterobis infection was associated with increased gut microbiota diversity, which peaked after mebazole administration. At the phylum level, infection and mebazole deworming decreased Fusobacteria and increased Actinobacteria. At the genus level, probiotic Bifidobium increased after enterias and mebazole treatment. Intestinal SIgA was lower in pinworm-infected individuals and elevated in half of mebendazole-treated. Childhood exposure to pinworm plus mebendale is associated with increased bacterial diversity, Actinobacteria, and decreased Fusobacteria. Enterobis and mebendale altered intestinal composition, consistent with previous helminth-infected microbiota studies. Metabolomics studies are needed to evaluate pinworm and mebendale effects on commensal bacteria and host immune system. Animal studies are required to understand causal relationships between pinworm, meendale, gut composition, and immune responses. The immunomodulatory effect of pinworm may depend on interaction with individual intestinal microbiota. A large cohort study in Denmark found no association between enterias and reduced risk of asthma, type 1 diabetes, arthritis, or inflammatory bowel disease, but lacked mechanistic studies on pinworm and microbiota interaction.
A genome-wide association analysis of root length in Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that the narrow-sense heritability for this trait was statistically zero, indicating low additive genetic variance, which explains why no associations were found using standard additive-based genome-wide association approaches. However, broad-sense heritability was significant, primarily due to epistasis, and epistatic genome-wide association analysis identified four interacting pairs of loci involving seven chromosomal loci that passed the significance threshold. The genotype-phenotype maps showed epistasis cancelled additive variance, explaining why loci were not detected in additive analysis. Estimated false-positive risk suggested half of associated pairs were true, and experimental evaluation of candidate genes within loci identified functional genes affecting root development in four loci. Statistical epist analyses confirmed known and identified candidate genes for root length, illustrating epatic cancellation of additive variance explains insignificant narrow-sense and significant broad-sense herability. Seven loci involved in epistatic pairs explained a large fraction of phenic variance, with one pair highly significant and two possibly false-positives due to small population size. The findings contrast the view that most genetic variance for complex traits is additive and highlight the importance of utilizing genome-wide analysis accounting for additive and non-additive variance to detect contributing loci.
Mitochondrial DNA mutations are a common cause of human disease, with certain mutations occurring multiple times in the population. The presentation of pathogenic mtDNA mutations is associated with mtDNA haplogroups. Analysis of 30,506 mtDNA sequences globally showed the mean pathogenic score for disease-causing mutations differed between mtDNA macrohaplogroups. Some mutations were observed across all haplogroups, while others were specific to certain clades. Sequence diversity indicated disease-causing mutations were more frequent in younger sequences and genomes with two or more disease-causing mutations were more common than expected. The mtDNA background influences the likelihood of acquiring or retaining disease-causing mutations. Statistical evidence of haplog clustering was found for 29.4% of recurrent disease-causing mtDNA mutations, suggesting some 'disease-causing' mutations are rare sub-haplog markers, not directly pathogenic. The association between disease-causing mt mutations and mtDNA haplogroups is not restricted to known disease-causing mt mutations. The findings implicate mtDNA background in recurrent mutation events purified through natural selection in older populations, explaining the low frequency of mtDNA disease in specific ethnic groups.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study collective cell migration, focusing on contact inhibition of locomotion, where cells interact and change direction upon collision. Using micropatterned substrates, cells migrate in linear paths and collide, resulting in outcomes such as reversing direction, sticking, or passing each other. The model incorporates cell shape mechanics and a minimal chemical model for contact inhibition, reproducing observed cases in two-cell collisions. A balance between cell polarization, inhibition, and adhesion governs collision outcomes, with parameters controlling transitions including adhesion, propulsion, and inhibition rates. Different cell types exhibit distinct behaviors due to variations in these parameters, and interventions can modulate outcomes. The model reproduces heterogeneity in neural crest cell collisions by adjusting parameters or assuming cell-to-cell variation in adhesion. The study highlights the importance of detailed modeling cell interactions over generic mechanisms, revealing unintuitive effects like non-monotonic adhesion. The model describes crawling and collision dynamics on micropatterns, reproducing distinct phenotypes in neural crest and epithelial cells, demonstrating the need for biochemical and dynamic modeling to understand cell interactions. Collective migration is crucial for immune function, development, and cancer, with cell interactions creating new dynamics not seen in isolated cells.
The dissociation mechanism of thioredoxin (Trx) mixed disulfide complexes has been debated for over twenty years, with opposing arguments regarding the activation of nucleophilic cysteine as thiolate during dissociation. Using the complex between Trx and its endogenous substrate arsenate reductase (ArsC) as a model, researchers studied Trx mixed disulfide dissociation through theoretical reactivity analysis, molecular simulations, and biochemical experiments with Cys-mutants. The results show conformation changes around the intermediate disulfide bring C32Trx in contact with C29x, activating C32x for nucleophilic attack via hydrogen bonds. C32x is more reactive than C82 and directs its nucleophil attack on susceptible C29, not C89. This multidisciplinary approach provides insights into a universal thiol/disulf exchange mechanism resulting in reduced and oxidized Trx. In the Tr-Ars complex, C29x nucleophilically attacks C89 of C82-C89 disulf, forming the Tr-Ars mixed disulf intermediate between C29 and C89. C32 performs a nucleophil attack on C29 of the C-C89 disulf, releasing C82. The deproton mechanism of C32 thiol has been debated, with both C82 and C32 considered possible nucleophiles, but C32 favored. C29 must be stabilized as thiol to attack exposed C82-C89 disulf in oxidized Ars, with the α-helix and C-S—NH bond stabilizing C as thiol in reduced Trx active site.
Researchers investigated how people use social information to determine their preferences, specifically in the context of intertemporal choices, and found that personal tastes are not fixed but rather plastic and can align with others even without reward. The study hypothesized that people are uncertain about their tastes and can learn through evidence, such as others' preferences, and Bayesian updating. Temporal discounting coefficients, which quantify impulsivity, were examined in a large study of 14-24-year-olds, assessing discounting behavior and variability before and after observing others' choices. Results showed evidence for taste uncertainty and Bayesian updating, with decision variability better explained by a random-taste model and taste shifts described by a Bayesian model accounting for uncertainty and social information relevance. The taste-uncertainty model captured subjects' uncertainty, reflected in choices before learning others' preferences, and updated distribution over their taste to make decisions. The study provided novel contributions, including evidence that social information leads to Bayesian updates on preferences and that choice variability reflects uncertain taste rather than noise. The findings have neuroscientific, clinical, and developmental significance, suggesting that uncertainty about preferences is a basis for subsequent shifts and that taste does not necessitate behavioral variability.
Researchers investigated how multiple signaling pathways integrate to regulate filamentous growth in budding yeast, a complex response that occurs under specific environmental conditions. Using a novel screening approach called secretion profiling, they measured the release of the extracellular domain of Msb2, a signaling mucin that functions at the head of the filamentous growth MAPK pathway. The results showed that many pathways regulating filamentous growth, including RAS, RIM, O1, PI, and RTG, were also required for FG pathway activation, sensitizing the pathway to multiple stimuli and synchronizing it to the global signaling network. Several regulators were required for MS2 expression, identifying the MS2 promoter as a hub where multiple signals converge. The histone deacetylase Rpd3 positively regulated FG activity and filamentous growth by controlling accessibility to the MS2 promoter. The study found connections between RIM, O1, PI, and RT pathways to FG regulation, and that RAS and other pathways converge on the MS2 promoter. The findings indicate a global hierarchy among pathways controlling filamentous growth and suggest systems-level integration of signaling circuitry coordinating complex behaviors. The discovery of multiple pathways impinging on the FG pathway implies coordination between pathways regulating filamentous growth.
Researchers investigated the role of gene expression changes in the evolution of divergent morphologies in filamentous fungi, specifically examining fruiting body morphology in five Sordariycetes species. They cultured the fungi in a common environment and profiled genome-wide gene expression at five developmental stages, reconstructing ancestral gene expression phenotypes and identifying genes with increased expression across development. Knockout and phenotypic analysis in two divergent species demonstrated altered fruiting body development in species with increased expression. This approach proved more efficient than whole-genome or gene family targeting studies. Combining expression measurements with knockout phenotypes refined Bayesian networks of fruiting body regulation, a poorly understood process in multicellular development. Fruiting body development stages are morphologically comparable across species, providing an ideal system to analyze common and divergent sources of homologous phenotypes and novelty. Key genes were identified in Neurospora and Fusarium, relevant to sexual development and lability in regulating reproduction. Mapping variational properties associated with developmental processes is critical to understanding evolution. Estimation of ancestral gene phenotypes identified putative changes in expression key to morphological innovation. Changes in morphology map to changes in gene regulation, refining understanding relationships among genes controlling morphological processes and their evolution.
Researchers investigated the use of square wave electroporation to deliver transgenes and macromolecules into Schistosoma mansoni eggs, a developmental stage with a high ratio of germ to somatic cells. Eggs incubated in Cy3-labeled siRNA with electroporation showed fluorescence in eggs and hatched miracidia. Electroporation introduced mRNA encoding firefly luciferase into eggs, with luciferase activity detected three hours later. Schistosome eggs exposed to Moloney murine leukemia virus virions pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein showed proviral transgenes in hatched miracid, with electroporation resulting in 2-3 times more copies than soaking. Quantitative PCR analysis indicated 20 copies of proviral luciferase per 100 copies of endogenous cathepsin. Square wave electroporation facilitates transgene introduction into schistosome eggs and is more effective for pseudotyped MLV transduction than soaking. Findings underscore the potential for targeting schistosome eggs for germ line transgenesis. Electropated Cy-siRNA entered eggs through cribriform pores and miracid within the eggshell. Luciferase activity was detected after electropation of mRNA but not soaking. Collectively, square wave electoration efficiently delivered exogenous nucleic acids into S. mans eggs. Miracid from virion-exposed eggs showed strong fluorescence foci at the posterior where germ cells are located, suggesting germ cells can be reached by reporter transgenes.
Researchers have developed a novel approach called Perturbation-based Markovian Transmission (PM) model to study the dynamic responses of large macromolecular assemblies. This method involves probing the assembly with an initial perturbation and monitoring the transmission of responses across all residues over time, from the initial perturbation until equilibrium is reached. The PM model can identify key residues important for macromolecular movement, signaling, and binding interactions based on quantitative measurements of relaxation time, amplitude, and oscillation dynamics. The approach was applied to the GroEL-GroES chaperone system, yielding predictions with 71-84% accuracy compared to experimental studies. This method can be applied to other large macromolecular machineries such as virus capsid and ribosomal complexes. The PM model enables monitoring of time-dependent responses of all residues simultaneously and can be modified to study signal pathways by applying perturbation to local regions. The study characterizes functionally important residues and signal transduction mechanisms in large macromolecular assemblies, addressing the challenge of following precise trajectories of thousands of residues over decades of time. The approach requires relatively small computational time, making it effective for large macromolecular assemblies.
Researchers investigated the physiological role of fungal galectins, specifically the mushroom galectin Coprinopsis cinerea C2, and its effect on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Feeding C2 to C. elegans resulted in inhibited development, reproduction, and ultimately killing, while a carbohydrate-defective C2 variant showed no toxicity, suggesting C2-mediated nematotoxicity depends on interaction with fucose-containing glycojugate. A screen for C2-resistant mutants identified the glycojugate as Galβ1,4Fucα1,6 modification of C. elegans N-glycan cores. Analysis of N-glycan structures confirmed this and identified a putative glycosyltransferase required for its biosynthesis. The X-ray crystal structure of C2 and Galβ1,4Fuc1,6Glc trisaccharide revealed the biophysical basis for interaction. Results indicate fungal galect plays a role in defense against predators by binding specific glycojugates. C. elegans mutants with defective GDP-fucose biosynthesis were resistant to C2, while other mutants showed sensitivity. The ligand of C2, Gal1,4Fuc1,6 modification of proximal GlcNA of N-glycan, sheds light on its distribution and function. A putative glycosyltransferase required for this modification was identified, encoded by the M03.8.4 gene, a type II membrane protein with a glycosyltransferase GT domain, potentially involved in biosynthesis of N-gly core modification. The study demonstrates C. cinerea galect C2 exhibits toxicity towards C. elegans, supporting the hypothesis of fungal galects role in defense against fungal-feeding nematodes.
The existence of long-lived reservoirs of latently infected CD4 T cells is a major barrier to curing HIV and affects the evolutionary dynamics of the virus. A within-host quasis model incorporating a long-lived reservoir nested into an epidemiological model of HIV dynamics shows that the presence of a reservoir can delay evolutionary dynamics within a host, with longer delays associated with larger reservoir sizes and homeostatic proliferation. This delay can change the dynamics at the epidemiological scale, allowing the virus to evolve intermediate viral loads that maximize transmission, rather than high loads previously predicted. Results depend on within-host characteristics, such as relative reservoir size, with evolution of intermediate loads observed when within-host dynamics are delayed. The latent reservoir has important roles in both within and between-host evolution. Models show latently infected cells impact the evolution of the virus, determining within-host rate and population level evolution of virulence. Delays in within-host dynamics caused by the reservoir can explain evolution towards intermediate levels of virulence that maximize transmission under certain conditions. A large reservoir delays within-host evolutionary dynamics, but caution is needed due to confounding factors such as APOEC induced mutations affecting set-point load and evolution rates.
Coxsackievirus B3 inhibits antigen presentation in vivo, exerting a profound and selective effect on the MHC class I pathway. The virus almost completely inhibits antigen presentation via the MHC I pathway, thereby evading CD8 T cell immunity. In contrast, presentation of CVB-encoded MHC II epitopes is relatively unimpeded, and CV3 induces in vivo CD4 T responses that are phenotypically normal, displaying an effector phenotype and mature into multi-functional CVB-specific CD4 cells. These cells expand following infection and differentiate into secondary effector cells capable of secreting multiple cytokines. CV3-specific CD4 cells display a Th1 cytokine profile and are enriched among CD4 cells in peripheral sites of infection, major targets of CV3 pathogenesis. The study used epitope-specific transgenic CD4 and CD8 T cells and recombinant CV3 to evaluate CV3-specific cell responses, assessing the virus' ability to inhibit MHC I and II presentation in vitro and in vivo. Results show CV3 induces no detectable primary CD8 cell response and profoundly inhibits MHC I antigen presentation, while MHC II presentation is relatively uninterrupted, inducing primary and memory CD4 responses. The findings have implications for the efficiency of antigen cross-presentation during coxsievirus infection.
A randomized controlled trial compared the efficacy of high-dose intravenous methylprednisone and oral prednisone versus intravenous saline and oral prednisone in individuals with leprosy Type 1 reactions and/or nerve impairment. Forty-two individuals were randomized to receive either methylprednisone followed by prednisone or prednisone alone. Results showed no significant differences in adverse events or clinical improvement, but those treated with methylpredone were less likely to experience deterioration in sensory function between day 29 and 113. The study found that 50% of individuals required additional prednisone despite 16 weeks of corticosteroid treatment, supporting the use of prolonged corticosteroid courses to treat Type 1 reactions. High-dose intravenous methylpredone did not have a larger therapeutic effect than predone alone on symptoms and signs of lepro Type 1 reactions. The study aimed to confirm safety before proceeding to a larger trial of efficacy, as high-dose intravenous methylone had not been previously used in lepro Type 1 treatment. Additional predone was prescribed to 47.6% of individuals due to deterioration of nerve function, recurrence of Type 1 reaction, or both, with a mean dose of 125.5mg and 143.7mg for methylone and predone groups respectively.
Researchers investigated the effects of regulatory T cells on CD8+ T cell responses in chronic HIV infection, comparing regulatory cells from HIV-infected patients to those from HIV-negative controls. Results showed that regulatory cells from HIV patients did not inhibit polyclonal autologous CD8 T cell function, indicating a defect in suppressive capacity or lack of sensitivity. However, they did inhibit IFN-γ expression of autologous CD8 cells stimulated with CMV/EBV/Flu antigens but not HIV-Gag-specific CD8 T cells. Cross-cultures showed that regulatory cells from HIV-negative controls inhibited differentiation of both CEF and Gag-specific CD8 cells from HIV patients. Expression of PD1 and PD-L1 was higher on Gag-specific CD8 cells and unchanged after regulatory cell depletion or co-culture, unlike CEF-specific CD8 cells. The study found a defect in regulatory cells modulating differentiation and PD1/PD1 molecules on HIV-specific CD8 cells, contributing to exhaustion of HIV-specific T responses. Regulatory cells suppressed differentiation of effector-memory CD8 cells in HIV patients and HIV-specific CD8 cells were less sensitive to suppressive effects. HIV effector CD8 cells were resistant to regulatory modulation of PD1/PD-L1. Regulatory cells from ART-HIV patients inhibited differentiation of naive CD8 cells and favored accumulation of CM cells with CD45RA+CCR7 phenotype. The study provides evidence of subset and clonally-specific inhibitory effects of regulatory cells on CD8 cells in chronic HIV infection, resulting from impairment of regulatory function and decreased responsiveness of effector clones associated with high PD1/PD1 expression.
Researchers evaluated the potential of Wuchereria bancrofti glutathione-S-transferase (GST) as a vaccine candidate for lymphatic filariasis. The GST gene was cloned from the third-stage larval cDNA of Wucherria bancroft and recombinant GST (rWbGST) was expressed and purified. Serum samples from individuals in an endemic area showed significant levels of anti-WGST IgG antibodies, predominantly IgG1 and IgG3. The rWGST retained enzymatic activity and antibodies inhibited this activity. Similar results were obtained with anti-WGST antibodies raised in mice. Brugia malayi GST and WGST showed sequence similarity. The vaccine potential of rWGST was evaluated using Brugia malayi L3 challenge, confirming the role of human and mice WGST antibodies in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Approximately 61% protection was achieved against Brugia malayi L3 infection in jirds immunized with rGST. The study showed WGST retained enzymatic activity, critical for parasite survival in the host. Immunization with GST from helmin parasites, including schistosomes and fasciola, has been established, with schistosome 28 developed into a vaccine. The mechanisms of protection appear due to inactivation of GST activity. The findings suggest WGST may be a vaccine candidate, with 61% protection achieved following immunization. Neutralization of GST activity not critical for antibody-dependent cytotoxic function, binding specific antiGST antibodies promoting cell cytotoxicity critical for WGST-induced protection. Putatively immune individuals carry antibodies against WGST, neutralizing parasite activity and killing infective larvae of Brug malayi expressing GST.
CRISPR-Cas9 technologies have transformed genome editing of experimental organisms and have immense therapeutic potential, but concerns remain over potential off-target effects. Recent studies used whole-genome sequencing of gene-edited embryos or animals to search for de novo mutations, which may represent changes introduced by poor editing. However, these studies used strain-matched, not pedigree-matched controls, unable to distinguish generational or colony differences from true mutations. This study used a trio design, whole sequencing 8 parents and 19 embryos, 10 mutagenised with characterised gRNAs targeting the coat colour Tyrosinase locus. Detailed analysis concluded CRISPR mutagenesis causing SNV or indel off-target mutations in treated embryos is statistically indistinguishable from background rate of de novo mutations due to other processes. The study assessed impact of colony variation on detection of off-target CRIS editing and compared data to MiSeq from 324 mice mutagenized using Tyr2 gRNA, revealing concordance of targeting efficiency and mosaicism. The results support further development of CRIS-C9 as a therapeutic tool, indicating off-target effects are not statistically distinguishable from background mutations occurring due to other processes under described conditions.
Researchers have identified two new players, Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 (HRB1) and Protein Phosphase 7 (PP7), involved in the control of stomatal aperture in Arabidopsis. Mutations in HR1 or PP lead to misregulation of stomatal aperture and reduced water loss under blue light. Both HR1 and PP are expressed in guard cells in response to light-dark or dark-light transitions, with HR1 interacting with PP through its N-terminal zinc finger motif and requiring functional PP for stomatal response. HR1 is phosphorylated in vivo, and PP can dephosphorylate HR1, with blue light increasing the size of the HR1 complex from 193 kDa to 285 kDa. In the PP mutant, this shift is impaired, and HR1 is predominantly phosphorylated. The study suggests modification of HR1 by PP under blue is essential for proper conformation and assembly of the HR1 complex. Guard cells control stomatal opening in response to environmental stimuli, and this study may provide strategies for plants to balance constitutive and ABA-induced protection under water-limiting conditions. HR1 and PP co-localize in the nucleus of guard cells, consistent with their interaction in vivo. The hrb mutant has a defective light response under blue and red, while phototropins regulate blue-induced plant movements such as phototropism, chloroplast movement, and stomatal opening. The findings implicate HR1 and PP in the control of Arabidopsis stomatal aperture, shedding light on the signal transduction cascades linking light perception to stomatal response.
The Mediator subunit MDT-15 plays a crucial role in conferring metabolic adaptation to ingested materials in Caenorhabditis elegans. Depletion of MDT15 or mutation of the mdt-15 gene abrogates induction of detoxification genes in response to xenobiotics or heavy metals, rendering animals hypersensitive to toxin exposure. MDT15 integrates metabolic responses to ingested materials, including nutrients and xenobiotic compounds, by interacting with regulatory factors such as NHR49 and SBP1. The subunit affects stress responses related to ingestion but not other stress responses like thermotolerance. MDT15 contributes to at least two detoxification pathways and integrates transcriptional response to environmental stressors like xeniotics and heavy metals. The subunit impacts expression of select genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and detoxification genes that respond to environmental contaminants, both linked to eating. Expression of MDT targets is affected by mutations that alter life span and stress tolerance contributes to life extension in C elegans. MDT15 is part of a regulatory system coordinating systemic adaptation to ingestion-related stress ensuring health and longevity, integrating transcriptional pathways to monitor availability and quality of ingested materials.
Researchers have proposed a topological paradigm for hippocampal spatial map formation using persistent homology, suggesting that the temporal pattern of neuronal firing, particularly co-firing, is key to decoding spatial information and that co-firing implies spatial overlap of place fields, resulting in a map based on connectivity and adjacency. A computational model of hippocal activity varying parameters such as firing rate, place size, and number of neurons in simulations of rat trajectories in distinct environments was used to test this hypothesis. The results showed that patterns of neuronal co-firing can convey topological information about the environment in a biologically realistic time frame. Simulations revealed a "learning region" highlighting the interplay between parameters combining to produce hippocal states more or less adept at map formation, where a lower number of neurons can be compensated by adjustments in firing rate or place size, but beyond a point map formation fails. The study proposes this learning region provides a lens to view conditions impairing spatial learning by altering cell rates or specificity. The hippocampus creates a connectivity map from place co-firing patterns using tools from algebraic topology, with requirements for firing to produce a stable map and experimentally observed characteristics satisfying these.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) production involves assembly on lipid droplets, envelopment at the endoplasmic retic reticulum (ER), and egress via the secretory pathway. However, the cellular requirements and mechanistic understanding of HCV secretion are incomplete. RNA interference (RNAi) analysis identified components of the secretory pathway, including ER to Golgi trafficking, lipid, and protein kinases regulating budding from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), VAMP vesicles, and adaptor proteins, and the recycling endosome. Results support a model where HCV is enveloped at the ER and exits via the secretory pathway. Infectious HCV with a tetrystine (TC) tag insertion in core (TC-core) monitored dynamics of HCV trafficking in association with cellular cofactors. TC-core traffics to the cell periphery along microtubules and localizes to the Golgi and co-traffic with components of the recycling endosome. Silencing the recycling component Rab11 results in accumulation of HCV core at the Golgi. The majority of core traffics in association with apolipop E (ApoE) and VAMP vesicles. This study identifies host cofactors of HCV egress, presenting dynamic studies of HCV core trafficking in infected cells, suggesting HCV egress through the secretory pathway from TGN to recycling endosomes to the plasma membrane. Nascent VLD particles undergo lipidation and maturation in the Golgi followed by ER to Golgi trafficking dependent on SAR1. RNA screen implicated SAR1 in production of extracellular HCV, suggesting HCV transport from ER to Golgi with COPI secretory vesicles. The Golgi is associated with HCV secretion by genes CYTH, ARF, AP1, PIKB, and PRKD.
Researchers investigated the role of imprinted genes in tumorigenesis, specifically the Grb10 gene, in a mouse model of Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) tumor suppressor gene. Expression analysis of tumor cell lines from irradiated NF1+/- mice showed Gr10 expression was widely absent, and polymorphism analysis demonstrated the expressed allele was commonly lost in diverse NF1 mutant tumors. Functional studies revealed that restoring Gr10 in NF1 mutant tumors decreased proliferation and downregulated Ras signaling, while silencing Gr10 in untransformed mouse fibroblasts increased cell proliferation and Ras-GTP levels. Expression of constitutively activated MEK rescued cells from Gr10 reduction in colony formation, indicating Gr10 loss promotes Ras pathway hyperactivation and hyperproliferation, a feature of tumor development. The study identified Gr10 as a negative regulator of Ras signaling, contributing to dysregulation in NF1-mediated tumorigenesis, and suggests mutations in imprinted genes should be considered with regard to parental origin. Gr10 loss promotes oncogenic signaling through hyperactivation of Ras and the MAPK pathway, functioning as a negative regulator of growth receptor signaling. Restoring Gr10 suppressed tumor growth in a MAP-dependent mechanism, while silencing promoted Ras signaling and hyperproliferation. The findings demonstrate a previously undescribed role for an imprinted gene in disease and suggest Gr10 loss may have tumor-promoting consequences in other oncogenic contexts, shedding light on cellular responses to Gr10 loss alone and combined with NF1.
Learning to predict threats from environmental cues is a fundamental skill found in many species, exemplified by Pavlovian fear conditioning, which involves associative learning between neutral and aversive events. Despite numerous studies, the computational understanding of this process is fragmented, with different models giving opposing predictions for trial-by-trial dynamics. Researchers investigated human autonomic nervous system responses to conditioned stimuli during Pavian fear conditioning using a statistical framework for psychophysiological modeling, comparing non-probabilistic, probabilistic, and non-learning models. Across three experiments, a probabilistic model best explained skin conductance and pupil size responses, with skin conductance tracking a mixture of expected outcome and uncertainty and pupil size tracking expected outcome alone. The study provides evidence that Pavian threat predictions in humans rely on probabilistic inference and estimation of uncertainty, informing theories of neural implementation of aversive learning. Pavian conditioning involves the presentation of predictive cues and aversive events, engaging associative learning, with many models historically capturing behavioral and neural phenomena in reward learning. The study used a Bayesian model assuming a probabilistic representation of threat predictions, analyzing autonomic activity through skin conductance and pupil size responses, common quantifying fear in humans.
Researchers have identified a novel suppressor of Cdc7/SepH kinase, PomA, which regulates fungal asexual reproduction by affecting the phosphorylation of MAPK-Hog in the filamentous fungus A. nidulans. The septation initiation network, composed of a conserved SepH Cdc7 kinase cascade, plays an essential role in fungal cytokinesis and conidiation, while the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway depends on successive cascade phosphorylation to sense and respond to environmental factors. PomA negatively regulates septation and coniation, and its mutation cures defects in sep1 septation and coniation, while overexpression suppresses septation. Under normal conditions, SepH positively regulates phosphorylation of MAP-Hog, whereas PomA reversely affects this process. In the absence of Pbs, a putative upstream member of Hog, Pom and Sep are unable to affect Hog phosphorylation. Under osmotic stress, phosphorylated Hog bypasses the requirement of Sep for septation but not the whole SIN. Findings demonstrate crosstalk between the SIN and MAP pathways, where Pom and Sep indirectly regulate Hog phosphorylation through Hog upstream kinases. Phosphorylation of Hog induced by osmotic stress bypasses the requirement of Sep to fulfill septation and coniation. Data suggest Sep and Pom coordinately regulate phosphorylation of Hog, playing a key role in septation and coniation, and sept defects in sep1 may be due to reduced expression of Hog-P. Results imply Mob and Sid are required for septation, and Hog-P may be an upstream member of Mob/Sid for septation. Overall, Sep and Pom retroregulate phosphorylation of Hog for septation and coniation under non-osmotic conditions.
Tegumentary Leishmaniasis is a disease endemic in Latin America, with approximately 20,000 cases reported annually in Brazil. The pathogenesis of the disease is not fully understood and clinical manifestations vary from cutaneous leishiasis to more severe forms such as mucosal leishias. Recent studies suggest the presence of Leishmania RNA virus 1 is associated with the severity of mucosal leishias in animal models. This study investigated 156 patients with leishmanias diagnoses and detected five Leishmania species, with L. braziliensis being the most frequent. The virus was detected in 71.1% of mucosal lesions and 36.7% of cutaneous lesions. The ratio of mucosal to cutaneous leishias with the virus was 2.93, indicating an association between Leishmania RNA 1 and mucosal leishias, corroborating previous findings in animal models. The study aimed to identify Leishmania species and investigate the presence of Leish RNA 1 in patients with cutaneous and mucosal leish to provide new evidence on the relationship between virus frequency, Leish species, and clinical manifestations. The findings indicate Leish RNA 1 contributes to disease outcome but is not the sole factor.
Type I interferon (IFN-I) plays a crucial role in protecting against pneumocococcal disease by inhibiting bacterial transmigration from the lung to the blood. Mice lacking the type I interferon receptor (Ifnar−/−) or treated with a neutralizing antibody exhibited enhanced development of bacteremia following intranasal pneumococcal infection while maintaining comparable bacterial numbers in the lung. Treatment with IFβ or IF-inducing double stranded RNA (poly I:C) reduced development of bacteremia following intranas infection with S. pneumonia. IFβ led to upregulation of tight junction proteins and downregulation of pneumoccal uptake platelet activating factor (PAF) receptor, reducing pneumoccal invasion and transmigration across epithelial and endothelial layers. Ifnar−/− mice showed enhanced lung permeability. IF-I regulates two mechanisms in pneumoccal invasion: PAF receptor-mediated transcytosis and tight junction-dependent peric migration, limiting progression from site-restricted lung infection to invasive disease. IF-I signaling neither affected bacterial numbers in lung nor blood titers but reduced pneumoc appearance in blood upon intranas infection, indicating lung barrier function as IF-I target. IFβ administration protects mice against systemic disease following intranas infection with pneumocci by controlling tissue-specific functions that counteract bacterial invasion and multiplication during primary S pneumonia infection.
Researchers have developed a multi-layer neural network that utilizes spike-timing dependent plasticity to learn foraging tasks, expanding on previous single-layer models. The network combines rewarded and non-rewarded spike-timing dependent plasticity and incorporates mechanisms for homeostatic regulation of synaptic efficacy, including heterosynaptic plasticity, gain control, output balancing, activity normalization, and limits on synaptic strength. The addition of a hidden layer with non-rewarded spike-timing dependent plasticity neurons enables classification of input patterns, while a subsequent layer with rewarded spike-timing dependent plasticity allows the network to learn and discriminate between rewarding and punishing patterns without labeled training data. Synaptic noise facilitates trial-and-error learning to identify effective goal-oriented strategies. The study demonstrates the network's ability to solve complex foraging tasks involving pattern classification and decision-making. The model consists of one-to-many connections from the input layer to the middle layer and all-to-all connections from the middle to output layer, with spike-timing dependent plasticity rules applied between layers. Rewarded spike-timing dependent plasticity is implemented between hidden and output layers, and non-rewarded spike-timing dependent plasticity between input and hidden layers. The network achieves high performance in learning and decision-making tasks by combining unsupervised and rewarded spike-timing dependent plasticity.
The ETS transcription factor ELF5 plays a crucial role in establishing the milk-secreting alveolar cell lineage during pregnancy and is a key determinant of tumor subtype in breast cancer, implicated in the development of insensitivity to anti-estrogen therapy. In the mouse mammary tumor-Polyoma Middle T model of luminal breast cancer, increased ELF5 levels enhance leukocyte infiltration, angiogenesis, and blood vessel permeability, leading to increased tumor size and lung metastasis. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells, a group of immature neutrophils, are recruited to the tumor in response to ELF5, driving vasogenesis and metastasis. Depletion of these cells prevents ELF from driving vasogenesis and metastasis. In luminal breast cancers, increased myeloid cell invasion and inflammation correlate with ELF expression, and ELF immunohisto staining predicts shorter metastasis-free and overall survival. ELF5 drives metastasis by co-opting the innate system, implicating it as a factor in the acquisition of lethal phenotype in luminal breast cancer. High ELF levels in luminal ER+ tumors show higher intratumoral lymphocytes, but reduced cytotoxic T-CD8 population, suggesting ELF creates a tumor permissive environment. These findings confirm the role of ELF5 in human breast cancer, coupled with immune system effects in the PyMT model and lum A breast cancer.
The interaction between chromatin loops plays a crucial role in determining cell-to-cell variability in gene expression, characterized by three factors: connection pattern, distance between regulatory elements, and communication. A stochastic model mapping three patterns of interacting DNA loops into a 4-state model of transcription reveals that nested loops enhance mRNA expression and reduce noise, while alternating loops have opposite effects. Facilitated looping performs better than direct looping in controlling mean expression and tuning noise, but this control is distance-dependent, with a limit to the difference between communication forms for moderate loop lengths. Experimental evidence supports the influence of loop pattern, distance, and communication on gene expression, with looping rates depending on the distance between regulatory elements and other pairs. Complexity of transcription arises from interactions among regulatory elements, including DNA loop formation and interactions, leading to stochastic transcription and cell-cell variability. The model shows that nested loops promote expression and reduce noise, while alternating loops reduce expression and enlarge noise compared to side-by-side loops. Transition rates between active and inactive states depend on loop lengths, with different lengths leading to varying expression levels, justifying the chromatin-looping hypothesis.
Researchers have developed a framework for designing de novo post-transcriptional riboregulators, referred to as translation inhibiting RNAs, which repress gene expression by blocking translation initiation. A design of experiments analyzed the influence of 12 structural and thermodynamic features attributed to post-transcription gene modulation, retaining six after removing correlations from an in silico generated library. Eighteen riboregulators were constructed and co-expressed with target regions, showing repression down to 6% of original protein levels. A partial least squares model linked properties of translation inhibiting RNAs to repression, indicating both structural and thermodynamic features are important for efficient repression. This approach enables reliable forward engineering of effective riboregulators, expanding the RNA toolbox for expression modulation. Pure riboregulators avoid coexpressed proteins, reducing metabolic burden and genetic instability, and are preferred for gene modulation systems solely relying on RNA. Previous approaches simplified RNA structures, neglecting complex energy landscapes, whereas this workflow improves de novo development through guided exploration of sequence space. Various riboregulator types were created, indicating a lack of consensus, but this study provides a predictive framework for designing riboregulators, overcoming limitations in availability and development.
Researchers investigated transient associations among neurons underlying memory and behavior by recording local field potential activity in the cortex of awake monkeys and organotypic cultures. When a neuronal group's composite activity exceeds a threshold, its pattern is reflected in the local field potential without distortion at other sites via fast synaptic transmission, resulting in large-amplitude local field potentials called coherence potentials. These extend up to hundreds of milliseconds, marking loss-less spread of temporal and amplitude information, and have an additional degree of freedom in waveform diversity, allowing high-dimensional encoding and identification of associations. Coherence in local potential reflects similarities in neuronal activity, synchronization, and has been used to identify functionally associated groups during responses to stimuli. Evidence shows coherence propagation across cortical areas, raising questions about interaction between potentials from different regions. Aggregate firing patterns at sites with similar waveforms suggest coherence propagation preserves temporal characteristics of underlying activity. Temporal properties of waveforms predict behaviors better than spikes, indicating coherence represents transfer of meaningful information in the network. The study found preservation of spike activity patterns associated with coherence, supporting the idea that coherence propagation represents transfer of information in the cortical network.
A systematic genetic screen of fission yeast deletion mutants has identified 25 essential factors that alter nuclear size, implicating RNA processing and LINC complexes in nuclear control. The study revealed low and extreme nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio phenotypes and identified global processes and structural components important for size control. Fission yeast, with a constant nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio across a 35-fold range of cell volumes, was used to probe nuclear control mechanisms. Genetic and nutritional mutations generated varying cell volumes, with nuclear volume increasing steadily during the cell cycle and maintaining a constant ratio throughout interphase. Previous screens implicated nucleocytoplasmic transport and lipid biosynthesis in size control, suggesting regulation of global processes and structural components is crucial. Nuclear volume correlates with cell volume across cell sizes in yeasts, and in multicellular organisms, the nucleocytoplasm ratio varies between cell types but is restricted within a narrow range. Evidence indicates nuclear volume is determined by cell volume or a related factor, not DNA content. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of nuclear size control, highlighting the importance of balancing nucleoplasm transcription, cytoplasm translation, and structural components.
Researchers have developed a coupled oscillator model to predict the effects of deep brain stimulation on neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease and essential tremor. The model describes how brain oscillations change when stimulation is applied at a particular state of the system. Using a reduced form of the Kuramoto model, the study analyzes how patients respond to stimulation when neural oscillations have a given phase and amplitude. The results predict that the best stimulation strategy should be phase-specific and have a greater effect when the amplitude of brain oscillations is lower. This prediction is compared with data from essential tremor patients. The study proposes a hybrid strategy combining phase-locked and adaptive deep brain stimulation, two closed-loop approaches found in literature. Phase-locked stimulation applies according to the instantaneous phase of oscillations, while adaptive stimulation applies high frequency when oscillations exceed a threshold. The model's phase-dependent effects generalize to other models and have been observed in biologically realistic models of neural circuits related to Parkinson's disease. The study aims to describe an underlying system of neural oscillators giving rise to oscillations, such as those in local field potentials and tremor, using classic coupled models where neural oscillators correspond to individual neurons producing spikes.
Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease affecting over 230 million people worldwide, with Schistoma mansoni being the main cause of intestinal and hepatic schistomiasis. Biomphalaria glabrata snails are intermediate hosts of the parasite. A new LAMP assay, Biom-LAMP, has been developed to detect S. mansoni in experimentally infected snails. The assay uses six primers targeting S. mansoni ribosomal intergenic spacer 28S-18S rRNA and has a detection limit of 0.1 fg of S. mansoni DNA at 63°C for 50 minutes. Biom-LAMP evaluated S. mansoni DNA in B. glabrata snails exposed to miracidia at different times and detected infected snails in pooled samples. DNA extraction was done using a commercial kit or simple NaOH method. The assay is specific, sensitive, rapid, and potentially cost-effective for screening individual and pooled snails. Biom-LAMP could be suitable for large-scale field surveys in endemic areas for schistosomias control. The development of field-applicable diagnostic assays for large-scale screening of snails has been listed as important for snail interventions. Prior studies used RT-PCR or oligochromatographic dipstick assay for detection, but no LAMP has been evaluated for S. mansoni. Validation of Biom-LAMP using other samples from Biomphalaria and Schistoma species is needed. Detection of S. mansoni DNA in snails can evaluate transmission risk in suspected areas and inform disease control measures.
Dengue has been a significant public health problem in Sri Lanka since the 1960s and a priority for health authorities. The Ministry of Health controls dengue and provides medical care, placing a financial burden on the public sector. The study estimated public costs of deng control and hospitalizations in Colombo in 2012 from the Ministry's perspective. Total cost was US$3.45 million, with personnel costs accounting for 79% of deng control and 46% hospitalizations. Per capita cost for deng control was US$0.42. Hospitalization costs ranged US$216-609 for pediatric and US196-866 for adult cases. This analysis shows deng poses a major economic burden on the public sector. Total public cost of deng control in Colombo was US$971,360, with 79% personnel costs and 16 consumables. Estimated US0.42 per capita for deng control corresponds to a monthly US0.03 per capita. Resources used for deng prevention and care are substantial, representing an opportunity cost that can be reallocated to other services. The study highlights the need for country-specific evidence to set health priorities and deploy technologies, indicating deng control is a significant economic burden in Sri Lanka's public sector.
The origin of European paternal lineages has been debated, with previous studies suggesting a Paleolithic origin for haplogroup R1b1b, the most common European Y-chromosomal lineage. However, the geographical distribution of its microsatellite diversity is best explained by a spread from a single source in the Near East via Anatolia during the Neolithic. This indicates most European Y-chromosomes originate from the Neolithic expansion. Haplogroup R1b1b, carried by 110 million men, increases in frequency from east to west. Other lineages, such as E1b1b and J, also show evidence of Neolithic expansion. The majority of European Y-chromosomes have Neolithic origins. Mitochondrial DNA presents a different picture, with no east-west cline and Paleolithic signatures. The predominance of Neolithic Y-chromosomal lineages is linked to technological and cultural change, suggesting a unique role for males in the transition. The distribution of haplog R1b1b is best explained by its spread from a single source in the Near East during the Neolithic, contrasting with previous suggestions of a Paleolithic origin. This reinterpretation makes Europe an example of how technological and cultural change is linked to Y-chromosomal lineage expansion.
The relationship between movement variability and motor learning speed is complex, with variability having both positive and negative effects on learning. Computational modeling of motor adaptation shows that increased variability does not typically enable faster learning and sometimes slows it down. A meta-analysis of published papers reveals no statistical relation between movement variability and learning rate across various experiments. Simulations highlight that the relation between variability and learning varies widely in motor adaptation, depending on the factor dominating performance in a task. Studies demonstrate reduction of variability as a characteristic of learning, while others suggest initial variability can predict the learning rate in reinforcement and motor tasks. Factors can simultaneously affect learning and variability, leading to positive, negative, or zero relations. Motor learning is a complex process that can be modeled, but further research is needed to understand the relative importance of involved factors. The relation between variability and learning is task-specific, depending on which factor affects performance, and can be influenced by sensory uncertainty or observation noise. Overall, movement variability poses a problem for neural control and has received significant attention, with studies showing divergent results on its effect on motor learning.
NF-κB plays a vital role in cellular and immune and inflammatory response, survival, and proliferation by regulating gene transcription. RelA, a prominent NF-κB member, interacts with transcriptional coactivators like CBP and p300 to activate transcription. The Rel:CB/p300 complex has two components: DNA binding of RelA interacting with KIX of CB/p300 and transcription activation domain of Rel binding TAZ of CB/p300. Phosphorylation of RelA Ser276 is prerequisite for the interaction. The structure of Rel:CB complex by NMR spectroscopy reveals folding of Rel-TA2 upon binding to TAZ through conserved hydrophobic sites. Mutational and calorimetric analyses allowed design of Rel-mutants that abrogated distinct components of Rel:CB/p300 interaction. Studies of Rel mutants showed a set of Rel-activated genes affected by this interaction. The Rel:CB/p300 interaction controls nuclear response of NF-κ through negative feedback of NF-κ pathway. Chromatin analysis of Rel target promoters showed constitutive recruitment of CB/p300, indicating a possible role in recruitment of Rel to target sites. Disrupting Rel-TA2:TA1 interaction disturbs temporal profile of nuclear Rel activity and deregulates NF- dependent genes. Genes like nfk and ptgs are dependent on Rel:CB/p300 interaction, explaining regulation of NF temporal profile following TNF stimulation.
Time-Course Gene Set Analysis (TSA) is a method for analyzing longitudinal gene expression data that extends gene set analysis to consider predefined groups of genes. It relies on random effects with maximum likelihood estimates, allowing the use of all available measurements while dealing with unbalanced data due to missing at random measurements. This hypothesis-driven method identifies a prior defined gene sets with significant expression variations over time, taking into account potential heterogeneity within gene sets. When comparing biological conditions, it indicates if time patterns of gene sets differ significantly according to these conditions. The method was applied to two real datasets, an HIV therapeutic trial and influenza and pneumoccal vaccine study, revealing significant changes in gene expression within 69 sets during vaccination and identifying 4 gene sets linked to the influenza vaccine. Simulation studies showed good statistical properties and increased power compared to other approaches. The method is available through an R package, providing a solution for full exploitation of repeated measurements of gene expression data based on gene analysis with sensitivity to detect subtle changes while controlling false discovery.
Researchers have created the first global map of Plasmodium vivax endemicity, a neglected parasite that causes malaria, to inform control and elimination strategies. The map was developed using 9,970 geopositioned parasite rate surveys from 1985 to 2010 and a spatiotemporal Bayesian-based geostatistical approach, estimating endemicity standardized to 1-99 year age range within 5x5 km grid squares. Endemicity was predicted within a narrow range, rarely exceeding 7%, with the Americas contributing 22% of global area at risk but only 6% of 2.5 billion people at risk due to sparse population. Africa had limited transmission due to Duffy negativity, contributing 3.5% global risk, while Central Asia had 82% with high endemic areas in India and Myanmar. South Asia had highest endemic areas in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea, contributing 9% global risk. Model validation showed minimal bias with a mean error of -0.41 in predicted endemicity. The map provides a detailed depiction of spatially varying endemicity to guide geographically stratified and evidence-based planning for Plasium vivax control and elimination.
Staphylococcus aureus expresses cell wall-anchored proteins that mediate adhesion and invasion of host cells and tissues, contributing to its virulence. Clumping factor B (ClB) has been shown to facilitate S. aureus nasal colonization through interactions with the cornified envelope in the nares. This study reveals a novel role for ClB in skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs), where ClB is crucial in determining abscess structure and bacterial burden early in infection, dependent on interaction with ligand loric expressed in abscess tissue. Targeting ClB with a vaccine induces protective humoral and cellular responses, leading to protection during S. aureus skin infection, identifying ClB as an important antigen for future STI vaccines. Previous studies attributed ClB function to facilitating S.aureus nasal colonization due to binding ligands loric and cytokeratin in nares. Results demonstrate ClB has an important function during S.aure STIs, exerting its effect early in infection, with loric a critical ligand for ClB in vivo. ClB affects abscess structure and formation, interacting with loric playing a role in pathogenesis, specific to skin, with no difference in systemic S.aureus STI. ClB is expressed in exponential growth phase and absent in late stationary phase, promoting nasal colonization in rodents and humans through high affinity with cornified envelope. This study identifies ClB as a candidate antigen for next-generation vaccines targeting S.aureus STI, providing proof-of-concept for its role in pathogenesis and vaccine potential.
Researchers have developed a hybrid stochastic framework to predict the efficacy of pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV, using dolutegravir as an example. The goal is to achieve the 90-90-90 targets set by UNAIDS, reducing new infections to approximately 500,000 by 2020, with pre-exposure prophylaxis as one of the key strategies. Current medication Truvada has limitations, being costly and requiring daily adherence. The new framework integrates pharmacological, viral, and host factors determining prophylactic efficacy, predicting plasma concentrations of 145.18 and 722.23nM to prevent 50 and 90% transmissions. Simulations show once-daily 50mg dolutavir prevents 99-100% infections and 85% with 50% missed dosing, while on-demand prophylaxis prevents 79-84% and post-exposure prophylaxis over 80% when initiated within 6 hours. The framework can be adapted to other candidates, indicating oral 50mg dolutavir is non-inferior to Truvada. Predicted concentrations can guide release kinetics of dolutavir nanoformulations. The framework elucidates the importance of pharmacological and viral factors, such as onset and offset of prophyl protection, sensitivity to missed dosing, virus inoculum size, and timing of exposure, allowing intelligent design of once-daily, episodic, and long-acting prophylaxis regimens.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces autophagy to enhance its replication. HCV infection induces the expression of Rubicon and UVR, which inhibit and stimulate the maturation of autophosomes, respectively. The induction of Rubicon by HCV is prompt, whereas the induction of UAG is delayed, resulting in accumulation of autophagosomes in the early points of infection. Rubicon inhibits the maturation of autophosomes in HCV-infected cells and plays a positive role in HCV replication. Over-expression of Rubicon enhances HCV replication, while suppression reduces it. In contrast, over-expression of UAG facilitates maturation of autosomes and suppresses HCV replication. The HCV subgenomic replicon induces expression of Rubicon and accumulation of autagosomes. HCV NS4 protein is sufficient to induce Rubicon and autag. HCV differentially regulates expression of Rubicon and UAG to temporally regulate autophagic flux to enhance replication. Autophagosomal membranes serve as sites for HCV RNA replication. Rubicon enhances HCV replication by increasing the pool of autagosomes in infected cells. Over-expression of UAG reduces the pool of autagosomes, facilitating maturation, and reduces HCV replication. The delayed induction of UAG leads to efficient maturation and autophagic degradation at 48 hours post-infection. HCV induces expression of both Rubicon and UAG to temporally regulate autophagic flux and enhance replication.
Cyclin-like 1 (CCl1) is a newly identified member of the cyclin family, highly similar to Cyclin Y (CNY), but its function is poorly characterized. CC1 is abundantly expressed in mouse testis, seven times higher than CNY. Male CC1-/- mice are infertile, while CNY-/- mice display normal fertility, indicating CC1 is essential for male fertility. Spermatozoa from CC1/- mice show impaired motility, thinned annulus, and bent heads. CC1 interacts with cyclin-dependent kinase 16 (CDK16), increasing stability and activity, and altering phosphorylation of CD16. Phosphorylation sites on the N-terminal of CD16 are crucial for CC1 binding and modulating CD16 activity. The CC1-CD16 complex is essential for spermatogenesis and fertility in mice. CC1 is specifically expressed in testis, making it a potential target for male contraceptive development by inhibiting CC1 expression or CC-CD16 activity. CC-/- mice are sterile but healthy, with normal testosterone and mating ability. Genetic deletion of CC1 leads to male infertility, not female, by cooperating with CD16 and maintaining enzymatic activity at the plasma membrane of spermatogenic cells. The structural and motility defects of CC- spermatozoa may prevent fertilization, but other uncharacterized defects may also be involved.
Enterohemorrhagic Escheria coli (EHE) strains cause diarrhea and hemolytic uremic syndrome through toxin-mediated microvascular endothelial injury. EHE hemolysin (EC-Hly), a member of the RTX toxin family, is increasingly recognized as an important virulence factor. EC-Hly exists as free and associated with outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) released by EHE during growth. While free toxin is lytic towards human endothelium, OM-associated EC-H effects on microvascular endothelial and epithelial cells are unknown. Microscopic, biochemical, and flow cytometry analyses demonstrate OM-associated EC-H triggers apoptosis in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBME) and Caco-2 cells via dynamin-dependent endocytosis of OMVs and trafficking into endo-lysosomal compartments. Upon acidification, EC-H separates from OMVs, escapes lysosomes, and targets mitochondria, decreasing transmembrane potential and translocating cytochrome c to cytosol. Activation of caspase-9 and casp-3 leads to apoptotic cell death. OM-associated EC-H ability to trigger mitochondrial pathway in microvascular endothelial and epithelial cells indicates a novel mechanism in EHE pathogenesis. OM-mediated delivery represents a new mechanism for bacterial toxin entry into host cells targeting mitochondria.
Researchers investigated the relationship between histone H2 ubiquitylation and the positive transcription elongation factor P-TEFb/Cdk9 in fission yeast, revealing a bidirectional communication between the two. Lowering Cdk activity or preventing phosphorylation of its substrate Spt5 reduces H2ub1 levels, while mutations in the H2ub pathway impair Cdk recruitment to chromatin and Spt phosphorylation. An Spt phosphorylation-site mutation combined with deletion of histone H3 Lys methyltransferase Set1 phenocopies morphologic and growth defects due to H2ub loss, suggesting partially redundant roles for Cdk and Set downstream of H2ub. Surprisingly, mutation of the histone H2 ubiquitin-acceptor relaxes the Cdk requirement and cdk mutations suppress cell-morph defects in H2ub-deficient strains. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses demonstrate opposing effects of Cdk and H2ub on transcribing RNA polymerase II distribution. Mutual dependence of H2ub and Spt phosphorylation indicates positive feedback, while mutual suppression by cdk and H2 pathway mutations suggests antagonistic functions that must be kept in balance to regulate elongation. Loss of H2 disrupts this balance, leading to deranged expression and aberrant morphologies, revealing a novel function of conserved co-transcription histone modification. The study strengthens the notion that P-TEb activity is required to overcome repressive histone modifications and uncovers mutual dependence of H2 and PTEb function in fission yeast, with H2 acting independently of histone methylation to regulate elongation by RNA polymerase II at select genes.
Yellow fever virus remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South America and Africa. Phylogenetic analysis of 133 viral isolates from 22 countries reveals that currently circulating strains arose in Africa within the last 1,500 years and emerged in the Americas approximately 300-400 years ago, following the slave trade. The virus spread westwards across the continent and persists in the jungles of South America. The analysis shows two geographic groups with distinct lineages in Africa and the Americas, with no difference in evolutionary dynamics among viruses in South America and Africa. The virus established a sylvatic cycle in the Amazon, Aragua, and Orinoco river basins, vectored by Haemagogus and Sabeth mosquitoes after urban outbreaks in port cities. The slave trade introduction hypothesis is supported by gene data and phylogenetic techniques estimating divergence times. Yellow fever originated in Africa, with the deepest phylogenetic split among viral genotypes between East and West Africa, and is a member of the Flavivirus family containing vector-borne pathogens like dengue, Japanese encephalitis, and West Nile viruses.
Researchers studied the pathogenesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae in an infant mouse model with and without influenza A virus co-infection to identify vulnerable points in the disease process. The findings reveal that in the setting of influenza co-infection, the organism must pass through single cell bottlenecks during bloodstream invasion from the nasopharynx within the host and transmission between hosts. Passage through these bottlenecks was not associated with genetic adaptation by the pathogen. The bottleneck in transmission occurred between bacterial exit from one host and establishment in another, explaining why the number of shed organisms in secretions is critical to overcoming it. The study utilized an infant mouse model that recapitulates key features of pneumoccal pathogenesis and found that influenza increases the burden of colonizing pneumocci. Sampling at 12 days prior to onset of bacteremia, detection of pneumonia by culture of lung homogenates was unusual, indicating a tight bottleneck. The bottleneck could be due to selection of a subpopulation of pneumocci or require pre-existing variants. The study employed a type 6 clinical isolate of S pneumonia and mouse-adapted influenza strain to examine the effect of co-infection. The results demonstrate how viral infection and TLR-dependent immune responses stimulate and control bacterial contagion, highlighting the importance of understanding population bottlenecks in pneumoccal pathogenesis.
Phlebotus orientalis is a vector of Leishmania donovani, the causative agent of life-threatening visceral leishmaniasis in Eastern Africa. During blood-feeding, sand fly females salivate into the skin of the host, and their saliva contains proteins that elicit specific antibody responses. To evaluate exposure to sand fly bites, researchers tested human sera against recombinant Phlebotus orientalis salivary antigens. Recombinant proteins derived from Phbotus orientalis secreted salivary proteins were produced and tested as antigens for detection of anti-Phbotus IgG in human sera. Sera from Sudan and Ethiopia were screened by ELISA and immunoblot to identify potential markers of exposure to Phbotus bites. Two recomant proteins, m5 and mY1, were identified as promising antigens with high correlation and specificity compared to whole sand fly saliv gland homogenate. The combination of both proteins increased correlation and predictive values of Phbot exposure. This study identified m5 and m1 as valid antigens for screening human sera from Sudan and Ethiopia for exposure to Phbot bites. The utilization of equal amounts of these proteins increased the capability to detect anti-Phbot antibody responses. The study found 52% of sera from Sudan and 34.5% from Ethiopia as anti-Ph positive. The level of exposure to sand can be affected by variables including closeness to breeding sites.
Salmonella genomic island 1 (SGI) is frequently associated with multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of pathogenic Enterobacteraceae and is mobilized by IncA and IncC conjugative plasmids. Although SG1 is not self-transmissible, it carries genes traNS, traHS, and traGS, coding for homologs of predicted mating pore subunits TraNC, TraHC, and TraGC, encoded by A/C plids. Expression of traNS and traGS is inducible by the transcriptional activator Aca, and these genes play a crucial role in the transmissibility of SG1. TraNS, TraHS, and TraGS are functional proteins that can replace TraNC and TraHC in the mating pore encoded by Inc plids and are required for optimal transfer of SG1. The remodeling of the Inc-encoded mating pore by SG1 enhances the transfer rate of SG1 over the helper plasmid. TraGS is essential for DNA transfer between cells bearing IncC plasmids, suggesting that SG1 disables an Inc-encoded exclusion mechanism. The tra genes facilitate the invasion of SG1 into cell populations bearing Inc plasmids. SG primes the bacterial cell to accumulate TraGS and TraHS subunits. Inc plasmids are often recovered from clinical isolates of major pathogenic bacteria, conferring resistance against multiple drugs, including carbapenems, and share a common scaffold of genes necessary for replication, stability, conjugative transfer, and regulation. The expression of conjugative transfer genes of Inc plasm is controlled by repressors Acr and Acr. The tra genes of SG1 are important for its mobilization and alter the mating apparatus of Inc plasm to promote self-propagation.
The Saccharomyces cerevisiae polo kinase Cdc5 promotes adaptation to DNA damage by inhibiting the hyperphosphorylation of checkpoint kinase Rad53, allowing cells to escape cell-cycle arrest imposed by the DNA checkpoint. Overexpression of Cdc5 leads to faster adaptation, indicating high levels of Cdc modulate the ability of the checkpoint to inhibit downstream cell-cycle machinery. Cdc acts by attenuating the DNA checkpoint through loss of Rad53 hyperphorylation, enabling cells to adapt to DNA damage. The early steps of checkpoint activation, including sensor localization, Mec1-phosphory of Rad9, and formation of the Rad9-Rad53 complex, remain unaffected by Cdc overproduction. However, damage-induced hyperphosphory of Rad53 is significantly reduced, resulting in loss of cell-cycle arrest. Polo kinase homologs have been shown to inhibit the ability of Claspin to facilitate activation of downstream kinases, suggesting this function is conserved in vertebrates. Adaptation begins after 6-8 hours of cell arrest if cells are unable to repair damage, correlating with loss of Rad53 activity. Cdc does not inhibit formation of Rad9-Rad complex but blocks ability of Mec-primed Rad molecules to produce hyperphosphorylated Rad53 in vivo, allowing cells to reenter cell division.
Researchers have developed the 3-D Kirchhoff-Nst-Planck framework to model large-scale extracellular electrodiffusion surrounding morphologically detailed neurons, enabling the exploration of electrodiffusive effects on large spatiotemporal scales. This framework is crucial for understanding pathological conditions like seizures, stroke, and depression associated with changes in ion concentrations in the extracellular space of the brain. By assuming electroneutrality, the framework circumvents charge-relaxation processes, making simulations feasible on millimeter and second scales on a standard computer. The 3-D framework simulates ion concentrations and electrical potential surrounding a morphologically pyramidal cell, demonstrating efficiency and elucidating single neuron contribution to electrodiffusive effects. It predicts ion concentrations in all directions, applicable to broader biological problems, addressing diffusion potentials due to concentration gradients. The framework handles 3-D electrodiffusion in neuronal tissue at large scales without excessive computing power, running long-term ion-concentration dynamics within a day on a desktop. Developed for hybrid setup with NEON simulator, it computes ion concentrations and electrical potential with KNP and neurodynamics with NEUR, sharing limitations in handling intracellular dynamics. Future applications to complex biologically realistic systems will explore pathological conditions with large concentration variations in extracellular space.
A proposed budget cut to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention funding for mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue and West Nile virus could leave the country ill-prepared to handle new and existing diseases. A study evaluated the impact of delayed responses to deng epidemics in an economically developed environment using a mathematical model of delayed response to deng introduction in Cairns, Australia. The results showed halting mosquito surveillance can increase epidemic management costs up to an order of magnitude compared to sustained surveillance and early detection. Cumulative costs of a strategy with active surveillance were $0.15 and $1.1 million for 200 and 2009 epidemics. Delaying control translates to exponential increase in human cases and costs, with accrued controlling costs surpassing sustained surveillance costs by the 9th week of outbreak, resulting in escalated costs up to $382 million. Total preparedness through surveillance costs are lower than responding to vectorborne pathogens introduction, even excluding human life and wellbeing costs. The analysis justifies reassessing the proposal to slash the CDC vectorborne program budget and emphasizes the need for improved vectorborne disease surveillance, highlighting the need for more funding to ensure early detection and interruption of outbreaks.
Dengue is an emerging infectious disease of global significance, and its unsuspected cases among children and adults with undifferentiated fever have not been well-documented in Nicaragua. A prospective study in semi-urban and rural Nicaragua collected epidemiologic and clinical data, as well as acute and convalescent sera from 740 patients aged ≥1 years presenting with acute febrile illness. Paired sera were tested for deng IgG and IgM, and serotyped deng virus using reverse transcriptase-PCR, revealing 63.5% were seropositive for deng at enrollment, increasing with age and reaching >90% in people over 20 years. Acute deng serotypes 1 and 2 were identified in 5.1% of patients, with only 8.1% clinically suspected. The seroprevalence was 22% in <5 years, 57 in 5-9 years, 77 in 10-14, 86 in 15-19, 91 in 20-24, 95 in 25-29, and ~100 in ≥30 years. Patients with acute deng presented early, with similar clinical features to other febrile illnesses. Among 37 patients with acute deng, 24.3% were PCR positive, with 3 DENV-1 and 6 DENV-2. The median duration of illness was shorter for PCR-positive patients. Dengue is an important and largely unrecognized cause of fever in western Nicaragua.
Plant-parasitic nematodes cause significant economic losses annually, and plant defense against them relies on recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns by surface-localized receptors, leading to activation of PAMP-triggered immunity. Researchers have identified a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase, NILR1, which is specifically regulated upon nematode infection and essential for PAMP-triggered immunity responses initiated by nemodes. NIL1 loss-of-function mutants are hypersusceptible to a broad category of nemodes. NILR is the first example of an immune receptor involved in induction of basal immunity in plants or animals in response to nemodes. Nematode-derived proteinaceous elicitors induce PAMPed immunity in Arabidopsis in a manner dependent on the common immune co-receptor BAK1. Silencing of BAK orthologs in tomato increases susceptibility to nemodes due to defects in activation of basal defense. Nematode infection triggers PAMP responses in Arabidopsis in B1-dependent and B1-independent manners. Ascarides, conserved nemode-secreted molecules, elicit plant defense responses reducing susceptibility to various pathogens. Manipulation of NILR may provide new options for nemode control in crops. Identification of NIL1 is a major step forward in understanding molecular mechanisms of plant-nematode interactions.
Miltefosine, an anti-cancer drug repurposed for Leishmania treatment, has shown promise against Schistosoma spp. targeting all life stages. Treating Schistosoma mansoni adult worms with milfosine in vitro enhances serological recognition of defined worm surface antigens. Indirect immunofluorescence assays using rabbit anti-S. mansoni worm homogen and anti-S. mans infection sera showed strong immunofluorescence on the S. mans adult surface after miline treatment. Antibodies recognizing surface antigens exposed on miline-treated worms identified four proteins: fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, Sm22.6, alkaline phosphatase, and malate dehydrogen. These antibodies bind to 3-hour schistosomula surfaces and induce agglutination, suggesting a role in immune protection. The study reveals a novel mode of action of miline as an anti-schistosome agent, where treatment unmasks surface antigens not normally exposed to the host. Antigens involved could be targets for intervention and antibodies may increase the drug's anti-parasite efficacy and be involved in resistance to re-infection. Anti-SAP antibodies eluted from miline-treated worms probed S. mans worm extracts, showing reactivity at 120-130 kDa comparable to precursor antiserum. Indirect immunofluorescence assays on 3-hour schosomula showed antigenicity with anti-SI and anti-SWH antibodies from miline and PZ-treated worms. Schosom-agglutination occurred with anti-SWH antibodies from miline-treated parasites.
Bacillus cereus, a human opportunistic pathogen, has evolved multiple systems to acquire iron from various sources, including heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin. The surface protein IlsA binds heme, hemoglobin, and ferritin in vitro and is involved in virulence. IlsA acts as a ferritin receptor, causing ferritin aggregation on the bacterial surface, and binds several types of ferritins through direct interaction with the shell units. The presence of IlsA enhances iron release from ferritin, indicating a bacterial protein can alter the stability of the ferritin core. Disruption of siderophore bacibactin production reduces the ability of B. cereus to utilize ferritin for growth and results in attenuated bacterial virulence. A model of iron acquisition in B. cereus involves the binding of Ils to host ferritin followed by siderophore-assisted iron uptake. The Ils-ferritin interaction enhances the rate of iron release from ferritin, a major finding since no direct effect of microbial protein on iron mobilization from ferritin has been reported. This strategy is important as iron homeostasis disorders affect innate and acquired immune responses, and pathogenic bacteria acquire iron via siderophore systems or surface proteins interfering with host iron-containing proteins. Ferritin is a source of iron for microbes and the bacterial protein IlsA directly interacts with ferritin, altering its integrity and amplifying iron release from the nanocage.
Researchers have developed a thermodynamically consistent statistical-mechanical model of the post-translational Kai circadian clock in cyanobacterium Synechoccus elongatus, which is driven by a protein phosphorylation cycle consisting of three proteins: KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC. The model proposes that ATP hydrolysis in the CI domain provides the thermodynamic force for the clock, switching KaiC between an active and inactive conformation state, while phosphorylation of the CII domain provides the timer for hydrolysis in CI. The model explains how KaiA stimulates phosphorylation of KaiC and generates the temporal order of KaiC phosphorylation. As phosphorylation level in CII rises, release of ADP from CI slows, stabilizing the inactive state of KaiC, which binds KaiB, leading to sequestration of KaiA and dephosphorylation. The model simulates a system of over a billion reactions using a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm, describing a wealth of experimental data. The circadian clock combines a protein synthesis and phosphorylation cycle, with the latter reconstituted in vitro in 2005. The model builds on the hexamer developed by Van Zon and coworkers, tracking phosphorylation sites and nucleotide states. The clock is driven by ATP turnover, with phosphorylation driven by hydrolysis and dephosphation via phosphate release from threonine and serine residues.
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppresses innate immune signaling to establish persistent infection by evading interferon-β (IFNβ) synthesis despite activation of the RIG-I-MAVS axis by its pre-genomic RNA (pgRNA). HBV-induced parkin recruits the linear ubiquitin assembly complex (LAC) to mitochondria, abrogating IFβ synthesis by interacting with MAVS, accumulating unanchored polyubiquitin chains on MAVS via LAC, disrupting MAVS signalosome, and attenuating IRF3 activation. Parkin interacts with MAVS and HBV potentiates this interaction, leading to the enrichment of M1-linked polyubiquitin chains on MAVS, disrupting its interaction with downstream TRAFs and abrogating IR3 activation. Park silencing restores IFβ synthesis in HBV expressing cells upon stimulation with RIG agonist pI:C. The study highlights the novel role of parkin in antiviral signaling involving LAC recruitment to mitochondria, providing avenues for investigations on the role of mitochondrial dynamics in innate immunity. HBV cripples R-I-MA signaling and recent studies implicate mitochondrial dynamics and mitophagy in the modulation of antiviral signaling. Parkin modulates LAC activity and LAC abrogates MAV signaling via disruption of MAV-TRAF or TRIM. The findings establish the molecular mechanism of HBV suppression of innate immunity.
Researchers have identified a novel T-cell superantigen, pfi, encoded by the pfi gene of Pseudomonas fluorescens, associated with human Crohn's disease. The crystal structure of pfi at 1.7Å resolution reveals it belongs to the TetR-family of DNA-binding regulators and represents a new family of T-cell superantigens. Functional analysis shows pfi and its homolog PA5 bind to mammalian cells, stimulating human lymphocyte proliferation, which is inhibited by anti-class II MHC HLA-DR antibodies. pfi directly interacts with HLA-DR and competes with superantigen Mycoplasma arthidis mitogen for binding, indicating overlapping sites. Immune activity to pfi is a biomarker for Crohn disease state and phenotype. pfi and PA5 specifically bind class II MHC, primarily HLA-DR, and stimulate murine CD4 T cell proliferation. Colonization by pfi-expressing microorganisms may provide a superantigen stimulus pertinent to Crohn disease pathogenesis. The discovery of pfi as a pathogenic and serological marker suggests a role in Crohn disease, but its biological function and role are unknown. GST-pfi precipitates endogenous and purified HLA-DR molecules, confirming direct interaction with HLA-DR. Anti-HLA antibodies reduce pfi and PA5 binding, with greatest inhibition by anti-HLA-DR, indicating class II MHC-specific binding.
Researchers investigated the role of allelic patterns of Nanog expression in embryonic stem cell heterogeneity, considering allelic control, gene noise, and random partitioning at cell division. The distribution of Nanog exhibited three distinct states due to allelic expression and became bimodal when combined with transcriptional noise. Initially uniform populations of stem cells gave rise to the same Nanog heterogeneity within ten cycles, regardless of allelic pattern. Depletion of NANOG was slower than accumulation after turning on at least one Nan gene copy, indicating Nan-dependent dynamics. Allelic transcription raises concerns for using stem lines with reporter genes knocked in single allelic locus, showing divergence in reporter and native profiles. Allelic regulation facilitates maintenance of self-renewing cells with sufficient Nan content to prevent aberrant loss of pluripotency. The study underlines the role of allelic control as a determinant of stem population heterogeneity, warranting further investigation in contexts of cell specification and reprogramming. A multiscale stochastic balance framework was developed, accounting for allelic regulation, asynchronous proliferation, and stochastic partitioning of NAN with or without transcription noise. Results illustrate allelic regulation as pivotal for observed heterogeneity in ESCs with respect to Nan content, potentially influencing diverse presentation of other markers in stem populations.
Researchers have quantified and classified unused protein expression in Escherichia coli across various environments, finding that nearly half of the proteome is unused in certain environments, accounting for over 95% of variance in growth rates across 16 distinct environments. Unused protein expression incurs quantifiable costs on cellular growth, with reduction in unused expression being a common mechanism to increase growth in adaptive evolution. Classification reveals unused proteins encode nutrient and stress-related functions, potentially conveying benefits in varying environments. The study utilized a genome-scale model and absolute proteomics to compute environment-specific costs and utility of the proteome on a per-gene basis, showing unused expression is a source of large and pervasive costs that may provide benefits against environmental change. Unused protein varies greatly across environments, with synthetic overexpression resulting in predictable reduction in growth rates, and microbes expressing some unused protein in any environment, reducing growth. The study provides a baseline understanding of the percentage of microbial proteome unutilized in a given environment and its variability, addressing the challenge of determining environment-specific proteome utilization, and sheds light on the costs and benefits of protein expression shaping evolution and regulation of proteome expression in microbes.
Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple loci associated with type 2 diabetes, but most have focused on European populations. This study performed genome-wide scans for type 2 diabetes in 3,955 Chinese, 2,034 Malays, and 2,146 Asian Indians to assess transferability and relevance of previous findings from European populations. Variants at CDKAL and HHE/IDE/K11 showed strongest association with type 2 diabetes in meta-analysis of all three ethnic groups. Consistent direction of effect was observed for many SNPs in this study and those in European populations. Examination of CDK1 and HHE/IDE/K11 loci provided evidence of locus and allelic heterogeneity and variation in linkage disequilibrium between populations, contributing to failure to detect associations across diverse ethnicities. Meta-analysis showed strong associations at CDK1 and H/HE/IDE11 loci, with signals at CDK1 similar or larger in Chinese and Indian populations compared to European studies. Conditional analysis explored additional diabetes-associated SNPs and differences in linkage disequilibrium between populations. The study highlights the value of surveying diverse racial/ethnic groups for fine-mapping causal variants and searching population-specific variants, addressing issues of transferability and consistency of genetic etiology between populations with differing ancestry.
The evolutionarily conserved Aurora kinase Ipl1 localizes to the nucleus upon breakdown of the nuclear envelope during mitosis in Cryptococcus neoformans and is required for timely breakdown of the nuclear envelope. Ipl is essential for viability and regulates structural integrity of microtubules, with compromised cytoplasmic microtubules upon I1 depletion resulting in significant delay in kinetore clustering and nuclear migration. An in silico modeling predicts cytoplasmic microtules and cortical dynein promote atypical division in C neoformans. Introducing additional parameters suggests an effective cortical bias generated by cytosolic B1 and dyin regulates kinetochore clustering and nuclear migration. Alterations in B1 or dyin levels delay nuclear migration. Results indicate Ipl spatio-temporally influences B1/and dyin activity with microtub stability to ensure timely nuclear division. Ipl orchestrates preanaph nuclear movement from mother to daughter cell, maintaining microtub stability for kinet clustering and nuclear migration. Absence of I1 impairs cortical bias and microtub lengths, leading to defects in kinet clustering and migration. Regulating B1/dyne activity, I1 creates a net bias for proper nuclear migration during mitosis, monitoring kinet attachments for high-fidelity segregation. I1 regulates disassembly of nuclear envelope and kinet attachments ensuring high-fidelity chromosome segregation.
Researchers investigated a case of aggressive medullary thyroid carcinoma harboring a somatic RET p.CysArg mutation, a known driver of the disease, and a germ-line RET substitution p.Cys, considered clinically irrelevant due to its synonymous nature. Next-generation sequencing revealed the mutations were in cis with no gene amplification. Expression analysis found increased RET transcript in p.Cys;p.CysArg patient compared to seven medullary thyroid carcinomas with p.Cys mutations. Minigene assays demonstrated the synonymous mutation explained increased mRNA levels. In silico and RNA immunoprecipitation experiments showed the p.Cys variant created new exonic splicing enhancer motifs, enhancing SRp recruitment, leading to more efficient preRNA maturation and increased mature mRNA encoding constitutively active receptor. The findings document a novel mechanism by which synonymous mutations contribute to cancer progression. The study involved a patient with a rare neuroendocrine calcitonin-secreting tumor derived from parafollicular-cells of the thyroid, with written consent obtained for genetic studies. Next-generation sequencing identified the synonymous substitution in cis with the somatic p.CysArg driver, exerting effects on preRNA splicing. No other somatic mutations were found, redirecting attention to the germ-line RET.C mRNA levels in the patient's tumor were higher than in other medullary carcinomas with various RET substitutions, including the p.CysArg mutation.
Metagenomic sequencing is a promising method for diagnosing human infections by capturing all DNA or RNA from pathogenic organisms in a sample. However, accurate characterization depends on available and quality genomes for comparison. Thousands of genomes are available, but recent studies have exposed contamination in published genomes, increasing the risk of false identification. To address this, a bioinformatics system was developed to eliminate contamination and low-complexity genomic sequences in draft eukaryotic pathogen genomes. The system was applied to identify and remove human, bacterial, archaeal, and viral sequences in a comprehensive database of sequenced eukotic pathogen genomes. Low-complex genomic sequences, another source of false positives, were also removed. This pipeline produced a database of "clean" eukotic pathogen genomes for bioinformatics analysis. The new database provides better sensitivity and reduced false positives when identifying eukotic pathogens in metagenomic samples compared to using original genomes. A comprehensive removal process identified human, vertebrate, bacterial, viral, archaeal, and vector contamination in 245 eukotic pathogen draft genomes. Eukotic pathogen genomes underwent a multi-step cleaning process to remove contaminating and non-informative sequences using Kraken and Bowtie classification and alignment programs. The cleaned database is ready for use in bioinformatics pipelines, including NGS diagnostics, with decreased false and false rates.
Trypanosoma brucei is a unicellular protozoan parasite causing human and animal trypanosomiasis in Africa, transmitted by tsetse flies. The parasite has three subspecies: T. b. brucei, T. gambiense, and T. rhodesiense, classified by host specificity, disease, and geography. Researchers genotyped 269 Tryosoma bruce isolates from Uganda and Kenya at 17 microsatellite loci and checked for the SRA gene conferring human infectivity to T. rhodesense. Bayesian and discriminant analysis partitioned isolates into three genetic clusters: Clusters 1 and 3 from central and southern Uganda and cluster 2 from Kenya. These clusters show genetic admixture and long-range dispersal, indicating recent gene flow between them. Expansion of the disease in Uganda occurred from northward spread of T. rhodesense and emergence of human-infective strains from non-infective T. bruce strains. Cattle act as a reservoir, shaping the epidemiology of sleeping sickness in the region. Isolates from humans, cattle, sheep, pigs, dogs, wild animals, and tse were collected between 1959-2011 in 19 sites in Uganda and western Kenya. The study reveals genetic diversity and population structure of Tryosoma bruce in Uganda, with implications for the epidemiology of sleeping sickness and Nagana.
Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXIP) has multiple functions, including tumor suppression and involvement in cell proliferation and apoptosis, but its role in the inflammatory process remains unclear. TXIP deficient mice are significantly susceptible to lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock due to excessive nitric oxide synthesis. In response to lipopolysaccharide, TX deficient macrophages produce higher levels of nitric oxide and inducible nitric oxide synthase, and an inhibitor of inducible nitric oxide synthase rescues TX deficient mice from endotoxic shock. The susceptibility occurs despite reduced IL-1 secretion due to increased S-nitrosylation of NLR3 compared to wild-type controls. Data demonstrate TXIP links nitric oxide synthesis and NLR3 inflamome activation during endotoxic shock. The absence of TXIP induces excessive nitric oxide production, driving endotoxic shock, and regulates NF-κ, affecting the inducible nitric oxide synthase pathway. Excessive nitric oxide inhibits NLR3-dependent IL secretion via S-nitrosylation of the NLR3 inflamome. Results indicate lipopolyscharide-induced inducible nitric oxide activation is mediated by NF-κ in the absence of TXIP. TX plays a critical role as a negative modulator of nitric oxide and inducible nitric oxide expression during lipysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock.
Researchers have identified ZTF-8, a conserved protein from worms to humans, as a novel factor involved in the repair of both mitotic and meiotic double-strand breaks and meiotic DNA checkpoint activation in the C. elegans germline. ZTF-8 mutants exhibit sensitivity to γ-irradiation and hydroxyurea, mitotic arrest at S-phase accompanied by activation of the ATL-1 and CHK-1 damage kinases, and accumulation of both mitotic and meiotic recombination intermediates. ZTF8 partially co-localizes with the 9-1-1 DDR complex and interacts with MRT-2/Rad1, a component of this complex. Impaired meiotic double-strand break repair partially fails to trigger the CEP-1/p53-dependent damage checkpoint in late pachytene, supporting a role for ZTF8 in meiotic DNA damage response. Loss of ZTF8 function results in impaired germ apoptosis, reduced brood size, and accumulation of RAD51 foci, all of which are rescued in transgenic worms expressing human RHINO, suggesting conserved functions between species. ZTF8 plays a role in repair at stalled replication forks and meiotic double-strand breaks as well as meiotic DNA checkpoint via the 9-1 pathway, promoting genomic stability in the germline. The findings define a conserved function for ZTF8/RH in maintaining genomic stability in the germline.
Researchers investigated the mechanism linking progenitor identity and differentiation in the neural tube, where motor neuron progenitors differentiate more rapidly than other progenitors. Using single-cell transcriptomics, they defined transcriptional changes associated with the transition of neural progenitors into motor neurons, revealing a pivotal role for the motor neuron determinant Olig2 prior to differentiation. Olig2 represses expression of the Notch pathway effectors Hes1 and Hes, with Olig repression of Hes appearing direct via a conserved element within the Hes locus that restricts expression from motor neuron progenitors. The findings demonstrate a tight coupling between regulatory networks controlling patterning and neuronal differentiation, with Olig acting as the developmental pacemaker coordinating spatial and temporal pattern of motor neuron generation. Notch signaling controls the transition between distinct phases of Olig expression by restraining Olig in motor neuron progenitors. Inhibiting Notch signaling upregulates Olig and triggers neuronal differentiation. Olig binding and repressing Hes interrupts the oscillator, allowing neuronal differentiation to commence, ensuring motor neuron development proceeds in a spatially and temporally controlled manner. The study establishes a mechanism where neural patterning and neurogenesis intersect, with Olig specifying motor neuron identity and determining the rate of progenitor differentiation, imposing distinctive kinetics of motor neuron production.
Researchers employed a nonhuman primate model to investigate the role of cross-reactive T cells in clearing the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Five rhesus macaques were first infected with a seasonal H1N1 isolate, inducing detectable cellular and antibody responses but no neutralizing antibodies against H1Npdm. Four months later, these "primed" animals and seven naive controls were challenged with H1pdm. Naive animals showed CD8+ T cell activation 5-7 days post-inoculation, peaking at 7-10 days, while primed animals showed activation as early as 2 days post-inoculation, peaking at 4-7 days. Interferon-γ Elispot and intracellular cytokine staining revealed a stronger, earlier response in primed animals involving CD4+ and CD8 T cells. Primed animals cleared H1pdm infection earlier from upper and lower respiratory tracts before H1p-specific neutralizing antibodies appeared. The results suggest cross-reactive T responses mediate early clearance of antigenically novel influenza in primates. Vaccines inducing such cross-reactive cells may protect against severe disease from emerging influenza viruses. Prior infection with seasonal influenza induces strong T responses recalled and boosted in magnitude upon H1p challenge, limiting virus replication. Cross-reactive T cell responses play a key role in rapid H1pdm clearance in macaques.
Q fever is a widespread zoonosis primarily transmitted through domestic animals, but its diagnosis is challenging due to non-specific clinical manifestations in humans and lack of identifiable features in infected animals. Conventional serodiagnosis requires sera from acute and convalescent stages, while nested and real-time PCR require specialized equipment. This study developed a Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP) assay targeting the htp gene of C. burnetii for rapid and sensitive detection. The LAMP assay showed 100% specificity with no cross-reaction among tested bacteria and detected 1 copy per reaction. Compared to real-time PCR, LAMP had higher positive rates in febrile patients (33.3% vs 8.3%) and animals (7.9% vs 0.8%). The LAMP assay confirmed Q fever in the Yi area, Xinjiang Province, and is a potential tool for diagnosis in humans and domestic animals, especially in rural China due to its rapid and sensitive detection without sophisticated equipment. The htp LAMP is specific for C. burnii with no positive results in 26 Rickettsiales members and 18 common pathogens. The study suggests further evaluation of LAMP for epidemiology in domestic animals using genital specimens for accurate C. burnii infection rates.
Researchers have identified a novel class of regulatory epigenetic mutations, designated embryonic stem cell-specific enhancers (ES), which are enriched in hematopoietic cells and prone to DNA methylation changes, indicating their chromatin activity. Methylation of ES is associated with transcriptional activity in cancer, with methylated ES being hypermethylated in cancer and co-localized with silenced genes, and unmethylated ES hypomethylated and associated with reactivated genes. In contrast, constitutive hematopoic stem cell-specific enhancers do not show these trends, suggesting selective reactivation of ES in cancer. Analysis of hypomethylated ES downstream of the VEG gene revealed a regulatory circuit affecting VEG transcript levels across cancers. DNA methylation is closely linked to enhancer states and expression of associated genes, with methylation of ES correlated with VFA expression. Genes proximal to cancer-hypomethyl ES expressed in ES but downregulated in hematopoic lineage tend to be expressed in cancer, participating in developmental pathways. Experimental evidence shows DNA methylation of ES affects its activity as a transcriptional enhancer in leukemia cells, supporting the suggestion that predicted sites are cis-acting regulators that support reactivation of ES genes in cancer, consistent with previous reports that ES-specific chromatin elements are targets for epigenetic reprogramming during development.
Researchers investigated the effect of subdividing an asexual populations on the time it takes to cross fitness valleys or plateaus in a rugged landscape involving epistasis. A generic model with population subdivision into demes connected by global migration was used to determine the optimal speedup of valley crossing. Results show isolated demes must be in sequential regime for subdivision to accelerate crossing. Markov chain theory provided analytical expressions for conditions where valley crossing by subdivided population is as fast as its fastest deme. Simulations verified predictions demonstrating subdivision can accelerate crossing in a wide range of parameters. The effect of varying degree of subdivision and trade-off between magnitude of speedup and parameter range was studied. Findings also apply to weakly beneficial mutations and populations connected to one or several islands. Subdivision with migration can accelerate crossing without additional ingredients and under specific conditions can accelerate whole classes of valleys and plateaus. The study provides conditions under which subdivision accelerates fitness or plateau crossing and has implications for inferring landscape structure from experiments and understanding evolution in natural systems where population subdivision is common.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive analysis of the midgut metabolome of Aedes aegypti, the primary vector for arboviruses such as dengue, Zika, chikunya, and yellow fever viruses, to understand the metabolic environment during arvirus replication. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, they analyzed temporal perturbations following deng virus infection of midgut tissue, identifying metabolites with dynamic profiles across early, mid, and late infection points. A marked increase in lipid content, including glycerophospholipids, sphingolids, and fatty acyls, coincided with viral replication kinetics. Elevation of glyolipid levels suggested diversion of resources from energy storage to synthetic pathways, while elevated acyl-carnines indicated disruptions in mitochondrial function and energy production. A central hub in the spholipid pathway influenced dihydroamide to ceramide ratios was identified as critical for the virus cycle. The study reconstructed the spholipid pathway in Aedes aegypti, highlighting biochemical points that could be targeted to disrupt transmission of multiple pathogens by mosquitoes. DENV infection altered the lipid repertoire at the initial site of replication, the midut of the mosquito. The findings provide insight into the metabolic environment during arvirus replication in Aedes aegypti and potential targets for disrupting transmission of multiple flaviviruses transmitted by this vector.
A parsimonious model of the rabbit action potential has been developed to elucidate the minimal physiological requirements for alternans and spiral wave breakup, integrating electrophysiological experiments, models, and theory. The model combines a novel Hodgkin-Hux formulation of the sodium current with a phenomenological model of repolarization similar to the voltage-dependent, time-independent rectifying potassium current. It was calibrated using experimental data from rabbit ventricular myocytes under physiological conditions, including dynamic-voltage relationships, recovery of excitability, and steady-state inactivation via voltage clamp. Simulations reproduced emergent phenomena such as alternans, reentrant waves, and spiral breakup. The simplicity and physiological meaning of the model's parameters make it ideal for generating mechanistic insight and a building block for more detailed ionic models of rabbit electrophysiology. The kinetics of sodium inactivation and non-linear rectification of potassium current were found to be crucial for alternans and wave breakup. The model addresses limitations of existing complex and overparameterized models derived from non-physiological conditions, providing a solid foundation for understanding cardiac arrhythmia mechanisms. The isolated rabbit heart shares electrophysiological characteristics with humans, including repolarization reserve and fibrillation dynamics, making the model relevant for translational research.
During the sexual cycle of the ciliate Parameium, the assembly of the somatic genome involves the precise excision of tens of thousands of short non-coding germline sequences, or Internal Eliminated Sequences (IES), each flanked by TA dinucleotides. This process is initiated by developmentally programmed DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that depend on the domesticated transposase PiggyMac, resulting in 4-base 5' overhangs centered on conserved TA. The molecular steps involved in the final assembly of somatic genes have remained unknown until now. Research demonstrates that Ligase IV and Xrccp, core components of the non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHE), are required for repair of IES excision sites and circularization of excised IES. Transcription of LIG and XR4 is induced early in the sexual cycle, with Ligp-GFP accumulating in the developing somatic nucleus by the time IES excision takes place. RNA-mediated silencing of either gene results in persistence of free DNA ends, while controlled removal of 5-terminal nucleotides occurs normally in L4-silenced cells, but nucleotide addition to 3' ends is blocked. Data indicates IES excision is a "cut-and-close" mechanism involving introduction of double-strand cleavages followed by DSB repair via precise joining. The Lig4-Xccp complex carries out DSB repair during developmentally programmed IES excision, with joining precise at the nucleotide level, critical for assembly of functional reading frames in the somatic genome.
The REMHE prospective trial analyzed the mode of death in patients with heart failure caused by Chagas disease compared to non-Chagas cardiomyopathy. Of 342 patients, 185 (54.1%) died, with death occurring in 56.4% of Chagas and 53.7% non-Chagas patients. The cumulative incidence of all-cause and heart failure mortality was higher in Chagas patients, but there was no difference in cumulative sudden mortality between groups. Chagas etiology, left ventricular diameter, creatinine clearance, and amiodarone use were associated with heart failure mortality, while ventricular diameter and beta-blocker use were associated with sudden mortality. Severe Chagas disease progressive heart failure is the most common mode of death, challenging the understanding of Chagas disease and impacting treatment choices. The study aimed to understand the natural history of patients with systolic dysfunction to plan adequate health policies and improve survival, as 47,000 T cruzi-infected persons live in Spain and 300,000 in the US. Sudden death was previously considered the main cause of death in Chagas patients, but this data is outdated due to introduction of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors changing heart failure history.
The NS-interacting kinase 1 (NIK) receptor-mediated defense pathway has been identified as a target of the geminivirus nuclear protein (NSP) to counter plant defense. Researchers identified ribosomal protein rpL10 as a partner and substrate of NIK, functioning as an immediate effector of NIK-mediated antiviral response. Phosphorylation of cytosolic rp10 by NIK redirects the protein to the nucleus where it modulates viral infection. Loss of rp10 function enhances susceptibility to geminivirus infection, resembling the phenotype of nik null alleles. Geminivirus infection interferes with NIK-mediated nuclear relocalization of rp10 as a counterdefensive measure by suppressing NIK activity through NS binding to the activation-loop and preventing autophosphorylation of regulatory threonine residue. This prevents activation of N1 and subsequent translocation of rp10 to the nucleus, trapping rp10 in cytoplasmic punctate corpuscles. NIK-mediated signaling does not activate RNA silencing or hypersensitive response but inhibits plant growth and development. The virulence of geminivirus overcomes this defense in Arabidopsis but NIK-mediated response may restrict the host range of other viruses. Mutant rp10 defective for NIK phosphorylation is not redirected to nucleus and ectopic expression of normal or hyperactive NIK mutant promotes accumulation of phosphorylated rp10 within nuclei.
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is a human pathogenic fungus that survives inside hosts by adapting to various conditions, including oxidative stress imposed by immune cells. The role of alternative oxidase (AOX) in intracellular redox balancing during host-P. brasiliensis interaction was evaluated. A mitotically stable P. brasili AOX antisense RNA strain with 70% reduced gene expression was generated. Interaction with IFN-γ activated alveolar macrophages induced higher PbAO gene expression in conidia than yeast cells. PbAO-aRNA conidia and yeast had decreased viability after interaction with macrophages. In a mouse model, absence of wild-type PbAO resulted in reduced fungal burden at 8 and 24 weeks post-challenge and increased survival. In H2O2 presence, Pb yeast increased PbAO expression and presented higher viability compared to PbAO-aRNA cells. Data support PbAO importance in defense against oxidative stress and virulence of P. brasensis. INF-γ activated alveolar macrophages produce ROS, effecting infecting fungi, and PbAO is required for pathogenicity. Fungal burden in mice with PbAO-a conidia was lower, suggesting PbAO is crucial for infection establishment and temperature-induced morphological shift to yeast form while interacting with immune cells. Results implicate PbAO in resistance to oxidative burst by alveolar macrophages, consistent with AOX requirement for A fumatus pathogenicity.
Episodic memory is thought to be supported by attractor dynamics in the hippocampus, with rate remapping in the spatial map of place cells encoding contextual information through firing variability. Recent experiments morphing one familiar context into another observed average population activity in CA3 transitioning gradually rather than abruptly, suggesting a lack of attractive forces associated with stored representations. However, individual CA3 cells showed a mix of gradual and abrupt transitions and hysteresis, a signature of attractor dynamics. A neural model of CA3 with attractors for position and discrete contexts found memories stored in overlapping ensembles within a single spatial map, position-dependent attractors made transitions at different points along the sequence. Smooth transitions arose from averaging the population, while a heterogeneous set of responses was observed on the single level. Orthogonal memories led to abrupt and coherent transitions on both population and unit levels as experimentally observed when remapping between independent maps. Strong recurrent feedback entailed a hysteretic effect which diminished with memory overlap. Results suggest context-dependent memory can be supported by overlapping attractors within a spatial map of CA3 place cells. Similar mechanisms may be found in other cerebral cortex regions.
Entamoeba histolytica, a microaerophilic protozoan parasite, causes amebic colitis and extra intestinal abscesses in millions of inhabitants of endemic areas. The parasite lacks key components of canonical eukaryotic anti-oxidative defense systems, such as catalase and glutathione. Researchers investigated global metabolic responses in E. histolytica to H2O2 and paraquat-mediated oxidative stress using capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Oxidative stress caused drastic modulation of metabolites in glycolysis, chitin biosynthesis, and nucleotide and amino metabolism, inhibiting glycolysis and redirecting metabolic flux towards glycerol production, chitin biosynthesis, and the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. The repression of glycolysis resulted in accumulation of glycolytic intermediates and reduced ethanol production, decreasing nucleoside triphates. A functional glycer biosynthetic pathway was identified, producing glycer 3-phosphate and glycer upon oxidative stress. The glycer biosynthetic pathway is proposed as a metabolic anti-oxidative defense system in E. histolytica. Metabolomic analysis and enzyme activity evaluation revealed correlations between metabolome and posttransational inactivation of key enzymes, highlighting unanticipated oxidative-mediated metabolomic changes relevant to oxidative stress in E histolytica.
IKAROS is a critical regulator of hematopoietic cell fate and its dynamic expression is required for proper hematopoies. It collaborates with the Nucleosome Remodeling and Deacase complex to promote gene repression and activation. IKOS binds the Positive-Transcription Elongation Factor at gene promoters and recruits the NuRD-PTEb complex to specific genes. The expression level of IKOS influences recruitment of the Nu-PTEb complex to regulatory regions and facilitates transcription elongation by transferring Phosphatase 1 to CDK9. An IKOS mutant unable to bind PP1 cannot sustain gene expression and impedes hematietic progenitor differentiation. Knockdown of the Nu subunit Mi2 reveals occupancy of the Nu complex at transcribed regions favors relief of POL II promoter-proximal pausing and promotes elongation. IKOS is the DNA-binding subunit of the Nu-PTEb multifunction complex containing chromatin remodeling and transcription activities. IKOS is important for CD9 and Mi interaction and recruitment to actively transcribed genes in hematiet cells. The IKOS-PP interaction is required for hematiet differentiation of primary cells. Results suggest Nu can assist POL II elongation throughout the ORF of IKOS target genes providing mechanistic cues to IKOS role as transcription activator during hematiet lineage differentiation.
Rabies is a significant public health concern in the Americas, with the Caribbean island of Trinidad experiencing periodic outbreaks in its livestock population. Molecular characterization of Trinidadian rabies virus (RV) and phylogeographic analysis revealed that outbreaks are a result of both in situ evolution and importation from the South American mainland. Trinidadian RV sequences were confirmed as bat variant and clustered with Desmodus rotundus (vampire bat) related sequences, falling into two lineages: Trinidad I and II. Lineage I was closely related to RV from Ecuador, French Guiana, and Venezuela, while Lineage II was related to sequences from Brazil and Uruguay. Phylogeographic analysis supported three separate RV introductions from the mainland, with estimated dates suggesting periods of in situ evolution following each introduction. Co-circulation of Lineages I and IIa occurred in 2000. The findings indicate a vampire bat origin of Trinidadian RV, suggesting further studies should investigate the relationship between RV spatiotemporal dynamics and vampire bat ecology, particularly movement between the mainland and Trinidad. Lineages descended from Brazilian and Uruguayan lineages, but introductions may have occurred via bats from undersampled countries like Venezuela or Guyana. Monitoring non-vampire bat species with migratory habits may also be necessary to detect introduced RV variants.
The development of functionally distinct areas in the cerebral cortex during neural development is dependent on the expression of several genes, including Fgf8, Emx2, Pax6, Coup-tf1, and Sp8, which play a crucial role in specifying areal identity along the anterior-posterior axis. To understand the regulatory interactions between these genes, a computational model was used to determine which interactions and combinations of interactions occur in networks that reproduce the anterior-posterior expression patterns observed experimentally. The model treated expression levels as Boolean and simulated all possible networks containing the five genes of interest. Only a subset of networks reproduced the experimentally observed patterns, lacking certain interactions and combinations, including auto-regulation and inductive loops. Analysis of the probability of each interaction indicated that repressive interactions are more likely than inductive, but mutually repressive loops are not critical for correct network functioning. The results illuminate the principles of the gene network regulating cortical development and make novel predictions that can be tested experimentally. The model suggests Fgf expression at the anterior pole may drive correct patterning of transcription factors Emx2, Pax6, Coupf1, and Sp8 with simple interactions, demonstrating how a transient signal can be converted into a durable change in the brain. Experimental evidence indicates the genes regulate each other's expression but the network structure is unconstrained, thus a systematic screen identified common features in networks that perform well, providing insight into the design of the gene network regulating cortical development.
Genome-wide analysis of Bmi1-dependent ubiquitination of histone H2A (uH2) in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells reveals a peak of uH2 near the transcription start site of well-annotated genes, which is enriched at promoters containing the H3K27me3 mark and represents the least expressed genes. Genes with promoter peaks of u2 exhibit lower expression compared to those without, and increased expression upon B1 knockout. Local enrichment of u2 is not limited to regions containing H3K27me3 and is found at high-density CpG promoters, suggesting DNA methylation may be linked to u2 at these regions. B1-dependent H2 ubiquitylation is enriched at genes containing H3K27me, but not limited to these regions, indicating different mechanisms in differentiated and embryonic stem cells. DNA methylation may be upstream of B1-dependent H2 ubiquity and contribute to H2 ubiquilation. B1-dependent u2 is a general indicator of transcriptional repression, with u2 levels correlating with low gene expression, and increased expression upon B1 loss. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns reveal a link between u2 and DNA methylation at high-density CpG promoters, and transcription profiling indicates B1-dependent u2 is enriched at genes with low de novo expression.
Pregnancy-induced noncoding RNA (PINC) and retinoblastoma-associated protein 46 (RAP46) are upregulated in alveolar cells of the mammary gland during pregnancy and persist in regressed lobules following involution. INC is enriched in luminal and alveolar progenitors in the post-pubertal mouse mammary gland, with levels increasing throughout pregnancy and declining in early lactation when alveolar cells undergo terminal differentiation. Overexpression of INC blocks lactogenic differentiation, while knockdown enhances differentiation in HC11 mammary epithelial cells. INC interacts with RAP46 and other members of the polycomb repressive complex 2, identifying potential targets differentially expressed following INC modulation. INC inhibits terminal differentiation of alveolar cells during pregnancy, preventing milk production until parturition. The polycomb repressive complex, including INC and RAP, confers epigenetic modifications maintaining a population of mammary epithelial cells committed to the alolar fate in the involuted gland. INC is highly expressed in alolar cells during pregnancy, downregulated in lactation, and declines upon lactogenic-induced differentiation of HC11 cells, supporting a role in maintaining mammary epithelial cells in an undifferentiated state. INC plays a functional role in regulating alolar development and interacts with RAP, a member of the chromatin-modifying polycomb repressive complex, elevated in alolar cells of the pregnant and involuting mammary gland.
Promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML), also known as TRIM19, plays a role in antiviral defense and forms dynamic structures called PML nuclear bodies that recruit proteins such as Sp100 and Dax. HIV-1 and other retroviral infections trigger the formation of PML cytoplasmic bodies, peaking at 2 hours post-infection, which is blocked by reverse-transcription inhibitors. PML knockdown increases reverse-transcription efficiency, indicating interference with an early step of retroviral infection. However, PML does not directly inhibit retroviral infection but acts through stabilization of Dax, which is found in the vicinity of incoming HIV-1 capsids and inhibits reverse-transcription. Dax also inhibits retrotransposition of endogenous retroviruses, identifying it as a broad inhibitor of reverse-transcription. PML relocalization is correlated with decreased HIV-1 transduction and other retroviruses trigger P cytoplasmic localization with increased transduction in PML absence. Dax colocalizes with HIV-1 p24, knockdown enhances HIV-1 transduction, and overexpression inhibits HIV-1 transduction in HeLa cells and propagation in PBMCs. PML knockdown enhances infection by HIV-1, EIAV, Mo-MLV, and SIV. The study reveals a novel antiviral function for PML and PML-associated protein Dax in restricting retroviral infections.
The Matt program, Multiple Alignment with Translations and Twists, is a fragment chaining algorithm that allows local flexibility between fragments, enabling small translations and rotations to bring sets of aligned fragments closer, even if physically impossible under rigid transformations. Tested against other multiple structure alignment programs on Homstrad and SAB benchmark datasets, Matt's performance is competitive on Homad and outperforms others on SAB, a benchmark of multiple alignments of proteins with distant homology. Matt demonstrates an ability to align ends of α-helices and β-strands, important for constructing a structural library for threading approaches to the inverse-folding problem. A p-value score based on the length of the common core and RMS of Matt alignments separates decoys from homologous structures in the SAB dataset. Matt's strong performance is attributed to its ability to model proteins in different conformation states and backbone distortions in distantly related proteins. The program is available at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cb/matt and http://matt.cs.tufts.edu for computing alternate quality scores. Matt addresses the alignment problem where input is a set of k proteins with a conserved structural core and captures similarity for biological and mathematical reasons.
Researchers investigated the regulation of Greatwall and Ensa dephosphorylation during mitotic exit, focusing on the roles of PP2A/B55 and Fcp phosphatases. Greatwall kinase inactivates PP2/B55 via substrates Ensa and ARPP, and both are regulated by phosphorylation. Using mathematical modeling and phospho-specific antibodies, the study monitored Greatwall, Ensa/ARPP, and Cdk substrate phosphorylation during mitotic entry and exit. Results showed PP2/B55 is required for Gwl dephosphorylation at the essential Cdk site Thr194, while Ensa/ARPP dephosphorylation is mediated by RNA Polymerase II carbox terminal phosphatase Fcp. Inhibition or depletion of Fcp or PP2 did not block dephosphorylation of bulk mitotic Cdk substrates during mitotic exit, suggesting a hierarchy of phosphatases coordinating Greatwall, Ensa/PP, and cdk dephosphorylation. Mathematical modeling indicated mutual antagonism between Gwl and PP2/B55 accelerates mitotic entry and exit with CycB synthesis and degradation. Data showed PP2 is responsible for Gwl inactivation, while other phosphatases regulate additional sites and contribute to Gwl inactivation. The network of phosphatases counteracting Gwl, Ensa/PP, and cdk phosphorylation during mitotic exit remains to be determined, but reactivation of phosphatases is crucial during mitotic exit. Current models propose PP2/B55 is required for cdk activation and dephosphorylation of mitotic substrates during mitotic exit. Overall, the study provides insight into the regulation of Greatwall and Ensa dephosphorylation during mitotic exit and the roles of PP2/B and Fcp phosphatases.
Researchers investigated how the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) escapes from autologous neutralizing antibodies during acute and early subtype C infection. Despite the development of high-titer autologous neutralizing antibodies, viral escape occurred in two subjects with acute/early subtype C infection through multiple pathways. In one subject, escape was driven by changes in the gp120 region extending from the V3 to V5 domain, while in the other, escape was driven by changes in V1 and V2. The V1-dependent pathway was retained over time, allowing the virus to evade two monoclonal antibodies by introducing a potential N-linked glycosylation site in V2. Spatial representation of sequence changes in gp120 showed selective pressure on the same regions in both subjects, though different domains drove escape. Findings suggest a single mutational pathway is insufficient for escape in early subtype HIV-1 infection and support a model where multiple strategies, including glycan shifts, epitope sequence alteration, and cooperative domain conformation masking, are used to evade neutralization. Temporal studies demonstrated HIV-1 undergoes cycles of escape from autologous neutralizing antibodies, with incomplete knowledge of specific molecular events leading to escape. Recovering individual monoclonal antibodies with specificities is necessary to derive a complete picture of autologous neutralization and escape, showing HIV-1 subtype Env responds to the host immune response by adjusting escape pathways. Cycles of viral escape occur despite potent neutralizing antibodies, involving multiple mechanisms and regions of Env, with shifting carbohydrate moieties and hyper-variable domains proposed as general mechanisms to alter neutralization epitopes.
Researchers sequenced the genomes of 13 Capsella grandiflora individuals to quantify the extent of positive and negative selection across the genome. They found strong selection in coding regions, but weak selection in most noncoding regions, except for 5' and 3' untranslated regions. However, conserved noncoding regions across the Brassicaceae family showed strong signals of selection. Neutral diversity was reduced around functional substitutions in both coding and conserved regions, indicating recent selective sweeps. Highly expressed genes experienced stronger negative selection but comparable levels of positive selection to lowly expressed genes. The results show widespread positive and negative selection in coding and regulatory regions, but suggest both types of selection on noncoding sequences are rarer in plants than animals. The study used population genomics to quantify selection in coding and noncoding regions, identifying conserved noncoding sequences as candidates for functional noncoding subject to selection. The findings indicate a large proportion of noncoding DNA may evolve neutrally, with stronger negative selection in highly expressed genes driving differences in molecular evolution rates. Comparing to other plant genomes, regulatory evolution may occur more through gene duplication than cis-regulatory change, leading to lower functional constraint and selection on noncoding DNA.
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) transforms resting B-lymphocytes into proliferating lymphoblasts, establishing latent infections that can lead to malignancies. The EBV-encoded transcriptional regulator EBNA2 drives cooperative and combinatorial genome-wide binding of master regulators of B-cell fate, EBF1 and RBP-j. EB2 induces formation of new binding sites for RBP-j and E1, many in close proximity to cellular and viral genome, correlating with transcriptional activation of genes important for B-lymphoblast function. Conditional expression or repression of EB2 leads to alteration in RBP-j and E1 binding. Biochemical and shRNA studies provide evidence for cooperative assembly at co-occupied sites. EB2 facilitates combinator interactions to induce new patterns of transcription factor occupancy and programming necessary for B-lyoblast growth and survival. EB2 colocalizes with E1 and R-j at enhancer and super-enhancer regions in EB positive lymphoid cell lines, reprogramming chromosome patterns of host regulatory factors. EB2 increases stability and probability of R-j and E1 binding to specific genomic sites and regulatory elements. Genome-wide studies reveal complex functions of EB-encoded transcription modulators on the genome. ChIP analysis shows high colocalization of EB2 with predicted sites of R-j and E1. Findings demonstrate EB-encoded coactivator EB2 reprograms binding patterns of master transcription factors R-j and E1, promoting B-cell marginal developmental program.
The Neovolcan Axis acts as a barrier to gene flow among Aedes aegypti populations in Mexico, differing in vector competence for Dengue 2 virus. Population genetic studies revealed substantial genetic structure and differences in the ability to transmit Dengue viruses in Ae aegypti populations. The intersection of the Neovolcan axis with the Gulf coast in Veracruz separates Ae aegpti populations north and south, with differing vector competence for Dengue serotype 2 virus. The average vector competence rate for Ae aegpti north of the Neovol is 0.55, while south is 0.20, mainly due to midgut infection and escape barriers. In Ae aegi north, 21.5% failed midgut infections and 30.3% failed disseminated infections, whereas south 45.2% failed midut and 62.8% failed disseminated. Barriers to gene flow impact epidemiologically relevant traits such as vector competence. Further studies are needed to determine why Neovol is a barrier and if differences in competence are stable and significant. Ae aegypt from southern Veracruz differed in competence, with Yucatan most competent and Nuevo least competent. Low vector competence south of Neovol correlates with zero seroprevalence in some cities. Human trafficking and commerce may be the principal barrier, but further investigation is required. The study aimed to define the geographic barrier and characterize vector competence in southern Verruz, obtaining 10 Ae aegypt collections and archiving DNA for future testing of candidate genes for vector competence. Results need confirmation with additional Dengue serotypes and genotypes circulating in Mexico and Latin America.
The DnaA protein plays a crucial role in the initiation of replication in Escherichia coli, cycling between active ATP-bound and inactive ADP-bound forms, and is thought to control initiation frequency when enough ATP-Dna accumulates. However, increasing ATP-Dna concentration by over 50% showed no changes in replication timing, suggesting that although Dna drives initiation, its accumulation does not control timing. Other factors are required for exact timing in response to the cell environment. The in vivo roles of datA dependent Dna inactivation and Dna-binding protein Dia were investigated, with loss of DDA affecting cell machinery during slow growth, making it sensitive to Dia concentration. The results indicate compromised cell machinery performs less robustly. The replication cycle is driven by Dna levels, with initiation occurring when sufficient ATP-Dna is present at the origin, and signals govern timing based on the cell environment. Extra Dna does not lead to a shift in timing, with cells insensitive to a 50% increase in ATP-Dna, indicating timing is controlled similarly to wild-type cells, not by Dna amount. Dna is key to the cell motor but not the limiting factor for precise initiation, with mechanisms preventing extra events but less known about timing, which must match growth rate to maintain DNA concentration.
Oscillatory activity plays a critical role in regulating biological processes at various levels, from subcellular to whole organism, involving numerous interacting elements. A novel approach called partial Granger causality is introduced to reveal interaction patterns in multivariate data with exogenous and latent variables in the frequency domain. The method is tested with toy models and applied to experimental datasets, including gene array data of HeLa cell cycle, in vivo multi-electrode array local potentials from sheep's inferotemporal cortex, and in vivo LFP from macaque's right hemisphere. The aim is to demonstrate ad hoc definition of causality limitations, yielding contradicting results between time and frequency Granger causality. LFP data collected during GO/NOGO visual task shows oscillatory potential in beta frequency range in sensorimotor cortex during prestim period. Partial Granger causality in time and frequency is depicted in figures, illustrating complete causal relationships. A toy model with exogenous and latent variables demonstrates frequency decomposition of partial Granger causality, defined with transparent statistical meaning based on conditional variance, addressing central statistical topic of handling exogenous and latent variables.
Researchers have developed a new method for inferring local ancestry in recently admixed individuals, such as Latino Americans, using continent-specific variants to improve performance in sequenced genomes. The approach incorporates admixed genomes with public datasets like 1000 Genomes to enhance accuracy and achieves comparable results to computationally intensive haplotype-based methods with decreased runtime. Simulations demonstrate the method's accuracy and its ability to recover local ancestries similar to 100 Genomes consensus calls in real individuals. It can also account for low-coverage sequencing and determine sub-continental ancestry for chromosomal segments using sub-continental-specific variants. The method leverages alleles found only in individuals from a given continental group and utilizes real data from 100 Genomes to enable fast and accurate inference. It iteratively re-estimates continent-specific variants by incorporating information from inferred regions in admixed samples, first using external reference panels and then re-calling confidently called segments. This approach models variants within hidden Markov models to achieve accurate and efficient local inference, accounting for errors from low-coverage and finite sample size reference panels. The method is advantageous as sequencing costs decrease and genetic studies increase, making the tradeoff between runtime and accuracy critical for local inference.
Researchers have discovered that the majority of mammalian genes exhibit circadian oscillation, challenging the previously accepted notion that only 10-15% of genes oscillate in a daily rhythm regulated by an intrinsic molecular clock. By applying digital signal processing algorithms to groups of genes oscillating in the same phase, combined with statistical tests for periodicity, the study found circadian baseline oscillation in almost 100% of expressed genes. This suggests that circadian oscillation in gene expression should be evaluated in any study related to biological pathways. Changes in gene expression caused by mutations or environmental factors, such as photic stimuli or feeding, should be considered in the context of changes in amplitude and phase of oscillations. The commonality of oscillation in gene expression indicates it is a natural and important feature of nearly all biological pathways. Genes displaying daily variation in expression may or may not be directly linked to the circadian molecular clock, but their oscillation affects the system as a whole. Digital signal processing reduces noise and enhances the signal, allowing identification of circadian oscillation patterns with confidence. The amplitude of core circadian genes does not stand out from the majority of expressed genes and shows no significant variation among tissues, implying perturbations' effects depend on circadian time and wave-guiding properties of biological pathways.
Researchers utilized whole-genome resequencing to map crossover and non-crossover recombination events in a three-generation pedigree of collared flycatchers with high resolution, identifying 325 crossovers at a median of 1.4 kb and 267 non-crossovers. Observed crossover rates were higher in males than females, increasing towards chromosome ends in males but not females. Crossover events were non-randomly distributed with hotspots concentrated in genic regions, particularly in promoters and CpG islands. Non-crossover locations were associated with crossover locations and showed a transmission bias favoring'strong' G,C over 'weak' A,T alleles, providing evidence for GC-biased gene conversion. The study found 86% of crossover events localized to intervals less than 10 kb, agreeing with data from linkage mapping. The recombination landscape showed distinct hotspots and concentration in genic regions, with the highest density in promoters and CpG islands. This approach can be applied to any species to provide a comprehensive portrait of the recombination landscape across organisms. The study provides insight into recombination in avian systems, localizing recombination events with high resolution, and analyzing characteristics and consequences of recombination.
Repeat-proteins, composed of repeated 20-40 amino acid stretches, fold into non-globular elongated architectures stabilized by interactions within and between repeats, lacking distant residue contacts. Their symmetries in sequence and structure reflect a folding landscape analyzed as a quasi-one-dimensional problem. A general description of repeat-protein energy landscapes is presented based on an Ising-like treatment of interaction energetics between foldons, with collective ensemble treated as spin variables. The one-dimensional model implies simple relations for experimental observables, folding free-energy and cooperativity of denaturation, not applicable to globular proteins. Parameters for coarse-grained description can be extracted from detailed simulations on funneled landscapes. A case-study of tetratricptide repeat proteins relates results to experimentally observed transitions, showing dramatic effects of single mutations on folding behavior. Natural proteins are poised at ratios of inter and intra-element energetics allowing structural transitions under physiological conditions, potentially related to biological functions. The periodicity of repeat proteins enables a general description of their energy landscape, appreciating biological function through coarse-graining architecture to a linear array of interacting units. Comparison to molecular dynamics and experimental results pin down parameters for natural repeat-proteins, with Ising description obtained from fundamental models on funneled landscapes and protein topology.
The stress-regulated transcription factor CHOP promotes hepatic inflammatory gene expression, fibrosis, and oncogenesis. Viral hepatitis, obesity, and alcoholism are major risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and lead to integrated stress response (ISR) or unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. CHOP expression is upregulated in liver tumors in human HCC and mouse models. Chop-null mice are resistant to hepatocarcinogenesis, exhibiting attenuation of apoptosis and cellular proliferation, and are also resistant to fibrosis, a key factor for HCC. Global gene profiling shows deletion of CHOP reduces basal inflammatory signaling in the liver. CH contributes to hepatic carcinogenesis by promoting inflammation, fibrosis, cell death, and compensatory proliferation. CH is a common factor in the development of HCC in chronic liver diseases. CH expression is associated with hepatocyte injury and upstream of fibrosis activation. Chop-null mice show suppressed pro-inflammatory gene expression and are protected from fibrosis and tumorigenesis. The progression from CH to liver tumors occurs in a stepwise fashion. Understanding CH mechanisms will have implications for other cancers. CH is a molecular link between hepatarcinogenesis and predisposing stimuli. CH induction and promotion of tumorigenesis suggest therapeutic intervention points for HCC. CH characterizes HCC tumors and impacts inflammatory expression and fibrosis relevant to human HCC.
A systematic review of clinical studies on the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania aethiopica identified 24 records reporting 506 treatment episodes, with antimonials, pentamidine, and cryotherapy being the most commonly used. Cure rates were 60-80% with cryotherapy and 69-85% with antimonials, while pentamidine appeared effective against complicated cases non-responsive to antimonials. However, all studies had methodological limitations and data on miltefosine, paromycin, and liposomal amphotericin B were scarce. For diffuse cutaneous leishmanis, antimonials with paromycin or pentamidine may be effective but lack proper evaluation. The evidence base for treatment of complicated cutaneous leishmanis due to Leishmania aethopica is extremely limited. Antimonials remain the most available treatment in Ethiopia but their efficacy and safety should be better defined. Alternative treatments such as miltefosine or paromycin should be explored and high-quality trials are urgently needed to evaluate sequential options. Laboratory studies found antimonials effective in vitro at high doses and miltefos was effective against diffuse cutaneous leishis in a small study but most relapsed. Combination therapy has been safe and effective against visceral leishmanis. Prospective studies are warranted to define efficacy and safety of antimonials and explore alternative treatments preferably topical or oral.
Researchers have reconstituted a biochemical oscillator in vitro using three purified proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which displays self-sustained 24-hour periodicity and temperature-compensated circadian rhythms. Analysis of time-dependent interactions between the proteins using electron microscopy and native gel electrophoresis revealed the formation of various macromolecular assemblies and rhythmic patterns of KaiC phosphorylation. A dynamic model was derived to elucidate the in vitro oscillator, accurately reproducing KaiABC complexes and KaiC phosphorylation rhythms, consistent with biophysical observations of individual protein interactions. Fluorescence energy transfer confirmed monomer exchange among KaiC hexamers, suggesting its function in maintaining synchrony and sustaining high-amplitude oscillation. Perturbation experiments using temperature pulses reset the phase of the KaiABC oscillator, demonstrating its resetting characteristics. The study provides an unprecedented molecular-level analysis of the circadian clock, showing a mixture of Kai complexes at every phase with oscillating proportions. The data derived model predicts the rhythm of KaiABC complexes, confirming KaiA, KaiB, and Kai interactions modulate KaiC phosphorylation status. The findings demonstrate the oscillator can be reset by stimuli known to entrain circadian clocks, providing insight into the biochemical basis of circadian rhythms.
Research has shown that trial-to-trial variability in brain activity and behavioral output exists even under identical conditions. Most studies investigating the relationship between trial-to-trial fluctuations in brain activity and performance have only tested a monotonic relationship. However, recent findings suggest that across-trial variability can correlate with performance independent of trial-averaged activity, predicting a U or inverted-U shaped relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and behavioral output. Using a visual detection task and electrocorticography, evidence supports an inverted-U brain-behavior relationship where fluctuations in broadband activity closer to the across-trial mean result in higher hit rates and faster reaction times. This relationship is present in both post-stimulus task-evoked and pre-stimulus spontaneous brain activity, suggesting anticipatory dynamics. The findings are consistent with stochastic noise in the brain and attractor network theories, which propose the brain settles into a confined state under performance and proximity to the targeted trajectory is associated with better performance. Across-trial variability can be modulated independently from trial-averaged brain activity and behaviorally relevant information can be encoded within variability, not trial-averaged activity. The existence of both monotonic and inverted relationships between trial-to-trial activity and performance accord with deterministic and stochastic sources of brain variability. The study provides evidence for an inverted-U relationship between trial-to-trial brain activity and performance in human brain using electrocorticography in patients undergoing invasive monitoring for neurosurgical treatment.
Sexual development is a key evolutionary innovation in eukaryotes, with mating compatibility in fungi governed by mating-type loci. In basidiomycetes, the ancestral state is hypothesized to be tetrapolar with two unlinked loci, homeodomain transcription factor and pheromone/pherone receptor genes. However, some basidiometes have bipolar systems through genomic linkage of these loci. Analysis of 24 Trichosporales species shows fused MAT loci with a single gene in each mating type, similar to pathogenic Cryptococci, but with different allele combinations. This suggests convergent evolution towards fused regions, as seen in other fungal groups. Unlike other basidiomycete lineages, Trichporales' fused loci have conserved gene content and order, with no apparent suppression of recombination to adjacent regions, indicating unique mechanisms for evolution. The findings support the hypothesis of independent fusion of HD and P loci in Trichporales and pathogenic Cryptocci. The conserved gene content and order in Trichporales is distinct from other basidiomycetes, such as pathogenic Cryptocci and Microbotryum, which have different mechanisms for evolution of MAT loci. Suppression of recombination is common in sex chromosomes of animals, plants, and fungi, but not observed in Trporales. The study provides insight into evolution of genomic regions involved in mating type determination in fungi.
Chagas disease is a significant vector-borne disease in Latin America, with non-domiciliated vectors posing a major transmission risk. A mathematical model was developed to predict temporal variations in non-domic vector abundance inside houses in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, using demographic parameters estimated from two years of field data. The model accurately predicted field data with and without insecticide spraying. Pyrethroid spraying at 50mg/m2 yearly during a two-month matching immigration season reduced bug abundance by over 80%, but larger doses or more frequent interventions did not improve results. Insect screens consistently reduced bug abundance proportionally to immigration rate reduction. Insecticide spraying has a short-lived effect on house infestation due to recurring immigrating bugs. Control of non-domic vectors is challenging with insecticide, requiring yearly application and understanding of immigration patterns. Insect screens offer an effective and sustainable alternative, potentially part of multi-disease interventions for neglected vectorborne disease control. A low dose of 10mg/m2 at the start of infestation reduced bug population by 50% for a year, but single spraying did not achieve sustainable control, prompting evaluation of repeated spraying and optimal frequency.
The patterning of feathers in avian skin relies on a coupled system of fibroblast growth factor and bone morphogen protein signalling, along with mesenchymal cell movement, acting in a reaction-diffusion-taxis system. This periodic patterning is partly mechanochemical, with mechanical-chemical integration through a positive feedback loop centred on FGF20, inducing cell aggregation and compressing the epidermis to intensify F20 expression. The travelling wave of feather formation is imposed by expanding expression of Ectysplasin A, initiating FGF expression and spreading across a mesenchal cell density gradient, triggering pattern formation by lowering the threshold of mesenchal cells required to begin a feather bud. In flighted birds, the EDA/EDAR pathway activates this process in a quasi-1-dimensional manner, imposing highly ordered formation. The absence of F20 in scaleless mutants leads to failure of feather primord formation, demonstrating the role of epidermis in avian patterning. High-cell dependence for development likely rests on rapid mesymal condensation and stabilisation of F20 expression. The skin of chicken, duck, ostrich, and emu embryos show differences in feather arrangements, with F20 expression elevated in contracted tissue, supporting cell aggregation in activation of F20 production. The reaction-diff-taxis system integrates with mechanical processes to generate the feather array, with BMP and WNT identified as inhibitors and FGF as stimulators of primord formation. The initiation of feather begins with condensation of dermal mesenchal cells beneath epidermal placode, forming a feather primord that grows into a filament within a follicle and produces a feather.
A systematic review of published evidence on the presence of filoviruses in body fluids of infected people and survivors was conducted to determine the likelihood of infectious virus in human fluids. The review included 33 eligible studies on Marburg and Ebola viruses, with laboratory-confirmed infections or clinical history and positivity for filovirus antibodies. Results showed that body fluids taken more than 16 days after onset were usually negative, and RT-PCR tests gave positive results about 4 times more often than tissue culture. Filovirus was reported in most types of body fluids, but not every sample from every confirmed patient. Non-blood RT-PCR positive samples, apart from semen, are likely to be culture-negative and of low risk. Contact with blood and blood-stained fluids remains the major risk for transmission due to high viral loads in blood. Twenty-nine studies reported filovirus detection in blood and 22 in non-blood fluids, with varying positivity proportions. The latest date for virus detected in blood was day 20, and post-disease markers in body fluids were not deemed eligible to confirm disease due to widespread antibodies in the population. The review highlights the need for further research to determine infectiousness of body fluids during and after illness.
Researchers have developed a fractional leaky integrate-and-fire model to describe neuronal spike adaptation, which captures power-law behavior and long-range correlations in neuronal activity. The model uses a fractional derivative to represent non-local processes where the value of the variable is determined by integrating a weighted temporal voltage trace, or memory. By varying the exponent of the derivative, the model reproduces upward and downward spike adaptations found in neocortical pyramidal cells and tect neurons. The model generates spikes with longer first-spike latency and high inter-spike variability with power-law distribution and produces reliable patterns in response to noisy input. The spiking activity deviates from Markian models, reflecting temporal intrinsic membrane dynamics that affect response to external stimulation. The fractional model simplifies complicated details in other models, exhibiting adaptation with power dynamics by integrating past voltage values without additional currents. Power functions describe scale-invariant spike adaptation, generalizing exponential processes. Results suggest low-order values reproduce experimentally observed spike timing, with continuous dependence on power dynamics causing nonlinear effects. The model provides a unified framework to describe power-law dynamics and long-range correlations, capturing relationships between conductances complicated to model using explicit techniques, representing spike-triggered mechanisms causing adaptation.
Paracoccidioides species have developed mechanisms to defend against reactive oxygen species produced by host cells to survive. The fungus expresses antioxidant enzymes, including superoxide dismutases, to counteract these radicals. This study identified six superoxide dismutase isoforms encoded by the Paracoccidioides genome and analyzed their expression in different phylogenetic lineages. Expression of PbS1 and PbS3 increased during mycelia-to-yeast transition, exposure to oxidative agents, and interaction with phagocytic cells, suggesting a role in combating superoxide radicals. Knockdown strains showed Pb1 and PbS3 involvement in responding to host effector cells and oxidative stress. PbS3 is linked to extracellular activity, while PbS1 is related to intracellular requirements. The fungus responds to endogenously generated radicals and counteracts the oxidative burst of immune cells by inducing superoxide dismutase isoforms expression. Sequence and functional analysis identified six conserved superoxide dismutase homologs in Paroccidioides genomes. Differences in metabolic profiles among Paroccidioides members may underlie distinct capabilities to survive phagocytic microbicidal attack. The antioxidant system prevents ROS-damaging effects, and understanding the dual role of ROS is crucial for defining components of the fungal response and adaptation to internal or external stimuli.
Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are sensitive to proteolysis in vitro but show no enhanced degradation in vivo, suggesting they may be protected by chaperones. However, analysis of high-throughput interaction data reveals a negative correlation between predicted disorder and chaperone binding in E. coli, S. cerevisiae, and metazoa species. IDPs tend to avoid chaper binding, with non-chaper-binding proteins having twice the median disorder of chaper-binding proteins. Chaper binding is primarily required for folding globular proteins, with a preference for proteins containing at least one Pfam domain. IDPs that bind chaperones tend to also bind other proteins, suggesting chaper binding promotes assembly rather than folding assistance. The median disorder of non-chaper-binding proteins is higher than chaper-binding proteins across taxonomic groups. Chaper binding to disordered proteins is often accompanied by binding to other proteins, indicating IDPs use chaper for association rather than folding. Proteins with globular domains are more likely to bind chaperones, and IDPs binding chaper are more likely to bind other partners than ordered proteins. Overall, the data suggests IDPs do not preferentially associate with chaperones, contradicting the idea that chaper binding protects IDPs from degradation, and instead chaper binding may facilitate interactions with other proteins.
Researchers investigated the role of Spalt transcription factors in regulating the transcriptional landscape of the Drosophila melanogaster wing pouch central region. The Spalt major and Spalt-related genes, encoded by sal and sal, are Zn-finger transcription factors regulated by the Decapentaplegic signaling pathway in the wing imaginal disc, crucial for cell survival, proliferation, and patterning. To identify direct target genes, microarray experiments compared expression profiles of sal/sal knockdown and control discs. In situ hybridization analysis revealed a complex transcription landscape regulated by Spalt, including genes positively and negatively regulated by Spalt/Sal. Loss-of-function phenotypic analysis showed a requirement for some genes in wing growth and patterning. The identification of Sp/Sal target genes opens a new avenue to reconstructing the genetic structure of the wing, linking Dpp pathway activity to epithelial tissue development. Spalt proteins regulate transcription through interaction with heterochromatic regions and histone deacetyl complexes, playing a central role in mediating Dpp effects during wing development. The study identified a collection of candidate genes regulated by Spalt mediating functions in the wing disc, revealing unsuspected transcriptional complexity involving repression and activation of gene expression. The work reconstructs the genetic cascade initiated by Dpp signaling controlling growth and patterning of the central wing disc region through Spalt transcription factors, uncovering complexity in the transcriptional landscape consisting of activated and repressed genes.
Perturbations of centriole number are associated with tumorigenesis and microcephaly, making regulation of centriole duplication critical. The C. elegans homolog of Plk4, ZYG-1, is required for centole duplication, but its regulation remains incomplete. Researchers identified PP1 orthologs G-1 and G2 and regulators I2 and SDS22 as key regulators of ZYG1 protein levels. Downregulation of PP activity rescues loss of centriole duplication associated with zy-1 hypomorphic allele through increased ZYG1 levels, indicating PP regulates ZYG1 post-translationally. Moderate PP inhibition restores centri duplication in zy-1 mutants, while strong inhibition in wild-type leads to centri amplification. PP1 regulates centri duplication by restraining ZYG accumulation, similar to Plk4 regulation by SC-mediated degradation and autophosphorylation. PP, I2, and SDS22 cooperate to regulate ZYG levels, with downregulation leading to excess ZYG and centri overduplication. Reducing I2 function suppresses zy1, and modulating PP activity impacts centri duplication. I2 is conserved from yeast to humans, acting as PP inhibitor and activator. PP1G2 and PP1G1 isoforms show high identity and are expressed in early embryos, with putative null allele not suppressing zy phenotype.
Visceral leishmaniasis is a rapidly expanding zoonosis with increasing urbanization, and concern exists regarding the role of wildlife in transmission due to environmental changes that facilitate contact between humans and pets. In the municipality of Campinas, southeastern Brazil, the first autochthonous case was confirmed in a dog in 2009 in an environmentally protected area. Since then transmission remains restricted to dogs in two geographically contiguous condominiums. A cross-sectional study investigated Leishmania infection in domestic dogs, wild mammals, and sand flies using molecular and serological techniques. Canine seroprevalences of 1.5% and 1.2% were observed in 201 and 2015. Six species of vectors or potential transmitters were identified, including Lutzia longipalpis. Natural infection by L. infantum was recorded in one Expillata and Pintia, and two white-eared opossums, a known reservoir of VL. Geographical coordinates of infected animals were plotted demonstrating proximity to human residences and forest. The area has an active VL focus, with risk of establishing and maintaining transmission foci in similar scenarios. Epidemiological profiles of VL must be included in prevention and control measures considering particularities of each area. Natural infection in sand flies and mammals provides evidence of sylvatic Leish transmission in the area.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic virus associated with multiple diseases, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly metastatic tumor common in Asia. The EBV-encoded microRNA miR-B9 is highly expressed in EB-positive NPC tissues and promotes tumor metastasis by targeting E-cadherin, a protein crucial for cell junctions and epithelial phenotype. Gain- and loss-function approaches showed miR9 enhances migration and invasiveness of NPC cells in vitro and in vivo. Computational analysis revealed miR9 targets E-cadherin, inducing a mesenchymal-like phenotype. Biochemical and functional assays confirmed mi9 inhibits E-cadher to promote NPC migration. High mi9 levels in EB-positive cells may contribute to tumor aggressiveness. The abundance of mi9 and down-modulation of mi200 family in EB-positive NPC drives epithelial cells to mesymal with enhanced motility. mi9 shares the same seed sequence as mi200, critical for interaction with targets. Depletion of mi9 increased lucifer activities, demonstrating ectopic expression promotes migration and invasion of EB-negative cells. mi9 is consistently detected at high levels in all NPC, unlike LMP1 and LMPA proteins, indicating it is a significant contributor to migratory capability of EB-infected cells.
gashimi is a command-line tool for visualizing splicing events across multiple samples, creating Sashimi plots for individual RNA-seq experiments and aggregated plots for groups. It uses popular bioinformatics formats, is annotation-independent, and visualizes splicing events for large genomic regions by scaling down segments between splice sites. gashimi is available at https://github.com/guolab/gash, implemented in Python, generating R code for plotting. Current Sash plot tools have limitations, including dependence on specialized formats and lack of dynamic integration in genome browsers. gash addresses these issues, allowing aggregation of samples and shrinkage of intron lengths, enhancing visualization. Sash plots represent splicing events with connective elements illustrating junctions between splice sites, combining read coverage and RNA-seq data. Comparison with existing tools, such as Integrative Genomics Viewer, shows gash improves visualization, especially for large regions and multiple samples. gash eliminates the need for specialized formats, supporting views for hundreds of samples, making it a valuable tool for exploratory data analysis of RNA-seq and splicing events.
A novel probabilistic model of cis-regulatory module evolution has been proposed to improve alignment and prediction of cis-regulatory modules across species. The model captures modes of evolution of functional transcription factor binding sites and background sequences, including gains and losses of transcription factor binding sites. A computational framework uses this model to solve alignment and prediction problems, utilizing conserved binding sites to improve alignment and addressing uncertainties in binding annotations and sequence alignment. The method demonstrates improved alignment and prediction over existing state-of-art methods in simulated and real data. Application to genome-wide binding data in Drosophila blasterm reveals factor-bound sequences are under evolutionary constraints even if neighboring genes are not expressed and distal binding sites are more conserved than proximal sites. The approach is implemented as software, Evolutionary Model cis-regulatory Analysis, for broad biological context. The model integrates binding site evolution with insertions and deletions, essential for simultaneous alignment and regulatory inference, extending statistical alignment to cis-regulatory sequences. It aligns regulatory sequences using conservation of transcription factor binding sites and treats alignment and annotation as random variables, minimizing uncertain impact. The framework solves existing approach limitations, enabling efficient likelihood-based inference for cross-species analysis of cis-regulatory sequences.
Mutations in the Drosophila piRNA pathway genes, including armi, aub, ago3, and rhi, lead to extensive fragmentation of the zygotic genome during cleavage stage embryonic divisions. The aub and arm genes show defects in telomere resolution during meiosis and cleavage divisions, while mutations in lig-IV, which disrupt non-homologous end joining, suppress these fusions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies reveal aub and arm mutations disrupt telom binding of HOAP, a component of the telere protection complex, and reduce expression of 19-22nt telom-specific piRNAs. In contrast, rhi and ago3 mutations do not block HOAP binding or piRNA production. The aub, arm, rhi, and ago genes silence transposons and maintain chromosome integrity during cleavage-stage embryonic divisions, while aub and arm have an additional function in assembly of the telere protection complex. The piRNA pathway has separable functions, with aub and arm required for TPC recruitment, and ligation of chromosome ends in mutant embryos. Terminal deletions accumulate additional copies of teleric He-A and TART elements when passaged in animals heterozygous for aub or pi pathway spn. Studies reveal a novel function for piRNA genes in assembly of telere complex, directed by 19-22nt piAs, requiring aub, arm, rhi, and ago for wild type piRNA production, and a novel function for aub and arm in telere protection mediated by short RNAs binding Piwi.
A newly discovered ebolavirus, named Bundibugyo ebol, has been identified as the cause of a hemorrhagic fever outbreak in Bundibugyo District, Western Uganda, with a case fatality rate of approximately 36%. Laboratory investigations using antigen capture, IgM and IgG ELISA and random-primed pyrosequencing approaches confirmed the presence of this new ebolavirus, which is distantly related to Côte d'Ivoire ebol. The divergence of Bundugyo ebol from previously recognized ebolaviruses has significant implications for the design of diagnostic assays and development of antivirals and vaccines. Evidence of acute ebol infection was detected in eight specimens, and the Ugandan Ministry of Health was notified in November 2007. Current prototype ebol vaccines include Zaire and Sudan ebolaviruses, and cross-protection studies are needed to assess whether vaccine designs need to incorporate Bundugyo ebol. The outbreak resulted in 149 suspected cases and 37 deaths, and continued through December 2007. Retrospective analysis of case description, epidemiologic and laboratory data is ongoing, and studies in non-human primates are needed to compare pathogenicity of these viruses. The unique nature of Bundugyo ebol has implications for screening of potential antirals and pathogenic studies.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression rates vary significantly among patients, with no quantitative measure of heterogeneity previously established. The Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) and Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) procedure characterize seven stages from normal aging to severe dementia, with each stage having a mean duration but unknown variance. Statistical analysis of 648 AD patients with 4.78 years follow-up revealed standard deviations in GDS/FAST stages 4-6 comparable to mean durations, indicating large variations in progression. High heterogeneity in AD progression is consistent with subgroups of patients differing in decline patterns. Longitudinal dataset analysis showed significant variation in GDS/FAST stages 4-6 lengths, with standard deviations similar to mean durations, indicating varying cognitive and functional decline among patients. Temporal progression of AD shows variability, with stage transition times ranging from months to decades. Combination of factors may be responsible for variability, with biological correlates investigated but reasons uncertain. The study used a 23-year longitudinal dataset, representing GDS/FAST stages 4-7, and found large heterogeneity in stage durations, consistent with previous reports but using different methods. FAST describes 16 successive stages from normal to severe AD, concordant with GDS but with differences demonstrated.
Researchers extended a hippocampal memory model to include spatially driven firing patterns in the form of grid cells in the entorinal cortex, comparing network performance across environments using synaptic plasticity, neuronal turnover, and additive neurogenesis. Additive neurogenesis was confirmed as a superior adaptation strategy, allowing the network to respond to changing input statistics while preserving representations of earlier environments. A biologically plausible neurogenesis rule incorporating cell death and enhanced plasticity of new granule cells showed better performance than individual strategies alone and can be tailored for short or long-term memory. The model predicts distinct growth profiles of adult neurogenesis under different rearing conditions. Place cells emerge and refine in a realistic manner due to sparsification by the dentate gyrus layer. Theoretical arguments support additive neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus, enabling adaptation not possible with conventional plasticity or turnover. A sophisticated neurogenesis rule incorporating cell death and enhanced plasticity of immature granule cells outperforms individual strategies, suitable for long-term memory if cell death occurs randomly. The dentate gyrus encodes input, forming a sparse representation of continuous non-sparse entorhinal cortex input.
African trypanosomes express three identical glutathione peroxidase-type enzymes, Px I, II, and III, which detoxify lipid-derived hydroperoxides. Bloodstream Trypanoma brucei lacking mitochondrial Px III display a weak proliferation defect, while those lacking cytosolic Px I and II undergo rapid lipid peroxidation and cell lysis, rescued by supplementing with α-tocopher derivative Trolox. The lysosome is the origin of cellular injury, with feeding Px I-II knockout parasites with Alexa Fluor-conjugated dextran or LysoTracker showing discrete lysosomal staining that spreads upon Trolox withdrawal. T. brucei acquire iron by endocytosis of host transferrin, and supplementing medium with iron or transferrin induces lysis, while iron chelator deferox and apo-transferr attenuate it. Immunofluorescence microscopy reveals disintegration of lysosome precedes mitochondrial damage. In vivo experiments show negligible role of mitochondrial peroxid, with mice infected with Px III knockout displaying delayed disease development. Data demonstrate the lysosome, not mitochondrion, is primary site of oxidative damage, and cytosolic tryothione/tryparedin peroxidases protect lysosome from iron-induced peroxidation, linked to high endocytic rate and distinct iron mechanisms of T. bruce. Cytosolic Px I-II knockout in procyclic form results in viable cells in Trolox-free medium.
Researchers have created a mouse line with the Pmel gene inactivated, resulting in mice that are viable, fertile, and display no developmental defects, but have spherical melanosomes instead of the typical oblong shape found in wild-type animals. The inactivation of Pmel has a mild effect on coat color in different genetic backgrounds, with the clearest effect in mice carrying the brown/Tyr1 mutation, similar to the silver mutation in mice. Despite the mild effect on visible pigmentation, inactivation of Pmel led to substantial reduction in eumelan content in hair, demonstrating PMEL's critical role in maintaining epidermal pigmentation. The study shows PMEL is essential for normal development of rod-shaped melanosomes in eelan-producing cells, but not for general survival of pigment cells. The Pmel knockout has a mild effect on visible pigmentation, while amyloid fibrils formed by proteolytic fragments of PMEL play a role in generating characteristic melanos shape. The phenotype of Pmel mice is similar to the silvering described for the silver allele, caused by premature stop codon truncating the last 25 amino residues of PM. Mutations in Pmel homologs have been identified in various species, but only one in mice, suggesting PMEL may have unknown functions or complete loss-of-function mutations have mild effects not detected in screens.
A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of environmental methods for dengue vector control, including container covers with insecticides, waste management, and clean-up campaigns, and elimination of breeding sites. Nineteen studies were eligible for the review and sixteen contributed to the meta-analysis. The results showed a weak effect of interventions on larval populations with no differences between individual methods. Container covers with insecticides and waste management achieved the strongest reductions in Breteau index, while container covers with insecticides and elimination of breeding places showed the strongest effects on pupae per person index. Each environmental method showed effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp mosquitoes. However, high-quality studies are needed to strengthen the evidence. Study quality was a major issue with most assessed as low or medium, only five studies were of high quality. Environmental interventions can be effective in controlling immature stages of Aedes sp mosquitoes. Most studies showed an effect on larval populations with no differences between results of each method. Overall, environmental deng vector control interventions showed effectiveness in reducing larval and pupal densities of Aedes sp mosquitoes.
Researchers have identified small molecules that inhibit protein synthesis by selectively stalling the ribosome, which constitutes a new strategy for therapeutic development. Compounds that inhibit the translation of PCSK9, a regulator of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have been identified and reduce LDL cholesterol in preclinical models. A genome-wide CRISPR screen was used to identify proteins and pathways that modulate cell growth in the presence of high doses of a PCS9 translational inhibitor, PF-06303. The most potent genetic modifiers of cell fitness, ubiquitin binding ASC2 and helicase ASC3, bind the ribosome and protect cells from toxic effects of high concentrations. Translation control proteins Pelota and HBSL sensitize cells to treatment. Genetic experiments show ASC3 acts with ASC2 and functions downstream of HSL. Results identify connections between ribosome control pathways and provide insights into selectivity of compounds that stall human translation, aiding development of next-generation compounds to treat disease. Ribosome profiling shows PF3 inhibits translation of overlapping proteins compared to PF64, with distinct off-target proteins. CRISPR screen identified proteins that suppress or enhance toxicity, associated with translation and ribosome control pathways. Targeted CRISPR validated involvement of proteins in cell fitness during treatment and genetic interactions between pathways.
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) promotes widespread destruction of cellular messenger RNA to block host gene expression and evade immune detection through the activity of its SOX protein. The mechanism of SOX-induced mRNA turnover has remained unknown due to its lack of intrinsic ribonuclease activity. Research reveals that KV SOX stimulates transcript turnover via a unique mechanism involving aberrant polyadenylation, where transcripts exhibit extended poly(A) polymerase-generated poly(A) tails and polyadenylation-linked mRNA turnover. SO-induced polyadenylation correlates with RNA function and inhibition of poly(A) tail formation blocks SO activity. Both nuclear and cytoplasmic poly(A) binding proteins are critical cofactors for SO function, with the latter undergoing nuclear relocalization by SO. This represents a novel mechanism of host shutoff and a model to probe poly(A) tail-stimulated mRNA turnover in mammalian cells. The study demonstrates that SO engages in aberrant mRNA polyadenylation, the first example of enhanced RNA coupled to hyperadenylation by PAPI in metazoans. Polyadenylation plays an integral role in SO-mediated turnover, with alterations in mRNA processing rendering nascent RNAs targets of cellular control machinery. Despite no intrinsic ribonuclease activity, SO modulates one or more RNA pathways, controlling message stability to regulate gene expression.
Researchers investigated the role of type III interferon (IFλ) receptor IL-28 in the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. They found that IFλ is induced in the course of bacterial airway infection, resulting in downregulation of microRNA miR21, sustained expression of PDC4, and increased proinflammatory cytokine production. Mice lacking the IFλ receptor IL28 or PDC4 had improved clearance of airway pathogens and less pulmonary pathology with reduced levels of inflammatory cytokines. IFλ inhibited miR21 via STAT3, resulting in upregulation of PDC4, promoting inflammatory signaling. Infection of PDC4 null mice resulted in improved clearance, reduced pathology, and inflammatory cytokine production. The study suggests that during bacterial pneumonia, IFλ promotes inflammation by inhibiting miR21 regulation of PDC. The selective expression of IL28, abundant on epithelial cells, may be important in specific cytokine responses. Loss of IFλ signaling resulted in increased mi21 expression and decreased PDC4 levels, correlating with reduced inflammation. Overall, inhibiting IL28 dependent signaling reduces lung inflammation and improves bacterial clearance.
A retrospective study analyzed mortality trends and risk factors in 781 cases of advanced-stage 2 human African trypanosomiasis admitted between 1989 and 2012 at the National Center for Human African Trypanosomis in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Death proportions varied by treatment regimen, with 17.2% in the standard melarsrol schedule, 12.1% in the short melarsrol, 5.4% in first-line eflornithine, 9% in the NECT regimen, and 36% in severely affected patients given eflithine. Adjusted odds ratios for death were 10.40 for clinical dysfunction, 2.14 for high protachy, 1.99 for parasites in CSF, and 1.70 for high cyach. Multivariable analysis retained clinical status and protach as significant predictors of death. The study highlights the importance of clinical manifestations in disease severity assessment and the need for an objective test to assess HAT severity. The algorithm for clinical assessment may serve as a basis for standardized tools for HAT management and epidemiological reports. The study included patients with confirmed parasitological diagnosis, stage-2 disease, and complete records, and considered stage-2 HAT when tryosomes were found in CSF or WBC count and protein concentration exceeded thresholds.
Researchers have developed a computer pipeline to study the effects of isolation on social dynamics in Drosophila melanogaster, a model organism used to investigate small-scale, temporally-transient social behavior. The pipeline involves a new imaging arena and improved tracking algorithm to follow large numbers of flies simultaneously, automatic classification of touch and graph-based social network analysis, and quantification of changes in social networks in response to prior isolation. Results show isolation significantly enhances individual and local network parameters, depicting near-neighbor relationships. Genome-wide analysis reveals changes in gene expression occur largely on the first day of isolation, primarily in metabolic genes, and verified by increased lipid content in isolated flies. Behavioral changes persist throughout six days, while gene expression changes are transient. The pipeline provides a reliable tool to study the behavioral, molecular, and physiological impact of isolation on social dynamics in Drosila, showing strong effects on social dynamics, metabolic expression, and physiology. Isolation alters fly physiology and behavior to promote interactions with neighboring flies after a single day, with changes in walking distance persisting. This study differs from previous approaches in classification strategy and dataset extraction, contradicting findings that isolation has no effect on social networks.
A clinical pilot study was conducted in rural Bangladesh to evaluate the impact of a smartphone adaptation of the World Health Organization's diarrheal disease management guidelines, including a modality for age-based weight estimation. The study consisted of 6-week pre-intervention and 6-week intervention periods with a 10-day post-discharge follow-up, enrolling 841 patients. The primary outcome was adherence to guidelines for prescriptions of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, and zinc. During the intervention, the proportion of prescriptions for IV fluids decreased at district and subdistrict hospitals with risk ratios of 0.5 and 0.2, respectively. However, when IV fluids were prescribed, the volume adhered to recommendations. The proportion of prescriptions for the recommended azithromycin increased with risk ratios 6.9 and 1.6, while prescriptions for other antibiotics decreased, and zinc adherence increased. Limitations included an absence of a concurrent group and no dehydration assessment during pre-intervention. Despite limitations, opportunities were identified to improve care, including assessment, weight estimation, and fluid/antibiotic selection. The findings demonstrate a smartphone-based tool can improve guideline adherence, supporting the hypothesis technology-enabled decision tools promote evidence-based practice in resource-limited settings.
Researchers investigated the temperature dependency of within-host dynamics of parasites using a mechanistic model based on the metabolic theory of ecology. Experimental data from Daphnia magna and its microsporidian parasite were used to fit the model, which included parameters for host aging, mortality, parasite growth, virulence, and abundance. The model effectively predicted host survival, parasite growth, and infection costs across temperatures using fewer parameters than discrete modeling approaches. Results showed that linking metabolic models with mechanistic host-parasite frameworks can predict temperature responses of parasite population dynamics at the within-host level. The study analyzed host survival and parasite burden across a temperature gradient, capturing thermal dependencies of host and parasite traits. Accurate predictions of climate change impacts on host-parasite dynamics require models integrating thermal dependencies for host and parasite traits, such as development and survival, which can be described by metabolic theory relationships. The framework provides a valuable approach for predicting infection outcomes and consequences in light of climate change due to its simplicity and generality. The study demonstrates the predictive power of linking metabolic theory-based relationships for host and parasite traits in mechanistic models to understand temperature impacts on disease.
GABAergic interneurons play a crucial role in shaping the activity of excitatory pyramidal cells, but the contribution of various inhibitory cell types to neuronal processing is not fully understood. A network consisting of parvalbumin, somostatin, and vaso intestinal peptide-expressing interneurons is proposed to have a functional role in this process. Parvalin-expressing interneurons target perisomatic regions and basal dendrites of pyramidal cells, while somostatin-expressing neurons target apical dendrites and inhibit other interneurons. Vaso intestinal peptide-expressing neurons connect to dendrite-targeting somatin neurons, providing disinhibition for distal dendrites. The interplay between these interneurons, particularly mutual inhibition between somatin and vaso intestinal peptide, translates weak inputs into large changes in somato-dendritic inhibition of pyramidal cells. A computational model supports this hypothesis, demonstrating that the somatin-vaso intestinal motif allows transient inputs to switch the circuit between processing modes, integrating or cancelling top-down inputs onto apical dendrites of pyramidal cells. The network can act as an amplifier, with mutual inhibition enabling switch-like shifts in somatoendritic inhibition, and compartment-specific inhibition represented by population firing rates of respective interneuron types, reflecting dendritic and somatic inhibition strengths.
Microbiome-wide association studies aim to link specific microbes to phenotypes by comparing microbial abundances between sample groups, but abundance differences can reflect indirect effects due to microbial interactions, not just direct associations with the phenotype. Researchers found that microbial interactions can generate numerous spurious associations lacking mechanistic insight and developed a method to remove indirect associations using techniques from statistical physics. Applying this method to a large dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease, they corrected inflated p-values in standard tests, revealing only a subset of associations directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had higher accuracy in separating cases from controls, pointing to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as key factors in inflammatory disease. Microbial interactions produce spurious associations between microbiome members and phenotypes, many of which can be removed using a procedure based on maximum entropy models from statistical physics, dubbed Direct Association Analysis. Studies have shown that anxiety, obesity, and colitis can be transmitted between hosts by transplanting intestinal flora, triggering a wave of association studies between microbiomes and host phenotypes, but non-trivial cause relationships give rise to spurious associations in synthetic and real microbiome data.
Researchers compared the effect of Wolbachia infection on the replication and transmission of Dengue virus and West Nile virus in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using stable and transient infection models. The results showed that Wolbach had similar blocking effects in both models, but the magnitude of the effect was significantly lower in transiently infected mosquitoes. No evidence was found for enhancement of either virus infection in mosquitoes infected with Wolbach, supporting its role in restricting transmission. Wolbach has been shown to inhibit various pathogens, including Dengue, Chikungungunya, West Nile, and Plasmodium when stably transfected into hosts. However, some studies have demonstrated that Wolbach can lead to enhanced pathogen replication under specific conditions. The density of Wolbach correlated with the degree of pathogen blocking in infected hosts and lower densities in transiently infected mosquitoes explained the reduced blocking observed. Experiments using West Nile virus Kunjin strain showed similar results, with lower Wolbach densities in transiently infected females compared to stably infected. The findings support the use of Wolbach as an effective means to restrict the transmission of these viruses, with no evidence of enhancement in Aedes aegypti infected with Wolbach.
Cilia are microtubule-based cellular organelles that mediate signal transduction and are organized into structurally and functionally distinct compartments. In C. elegans, the cilia shaft of amphid and phasm sensory cilia are subdivided into two regions defined by different microtule ultrastructure: a proximal doublet region and distal singlet region. The Inversin compartment, a region adjacent to the transition zone, is conserved and distinct from the doublet region. nphp-2, the C. elegans Inversin homolog, and doublet region genes arl-13, klp-11, and unc-119 are redundantly required for ciliogenesis. These genes can be sorted into modules, nphp2+klp11 and arl13+unc119, antagonized by hdac deacetylase, modulating the sizes of NPHP2 and ARL13 regions. Glutamylation, a tubulin post-translational modification, is not required for ciliary targeting but modulated by nphp2, ar13 and unc119. NPHP2 requires its calcium binding EF domain for targeting to the Invers compartment. The C elegans Invers compartment is distinct from the double region and components interact to regulate ciliogenesis via cilia placement, microtubule ultrastructure, and protein localization. Ciliary targeting of NPHP2, ARL13 and UNC119 does not require transition zone or double region genes. The relationship between mammalian Invers compartment and C elegans In compartment may be similar, independent of microtule ultrastructure, with cilia composition defining the Invers compartment.
The polarity protein Scribble plays a crucial role in myelination and remyelination in the central nervous system by regulating changes in cell shape that lead to myelin sheath formation. Scribble is expressed throughout oligodendroglial development and is upregulated in mature oligodrocytes, localizing to developing and mature myelin sheaths. Knockdown of Scribble in oligodroglia disrupts morphology and myelination, while conditional elimination in myelinating glia of transgenic mice disrupts myelin initiation during development and following demyelination. Scribble regulates myelin thickness by suppressing the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway and localizes to non-compact myelin at the node of Ranvier for paranodal axo-glial adhesion. The absence of Scribble results in failure of oligodrocytes to initiate myination, not due to a failure of differentiation, and small-diameter axons lack myelin sheaths in Scribble knockout CNS. Increased myelin thickness is seen in developed tracts, but not following remyination, indicating differing functions of Scribble in regulating cell signaling. Overall, Scribble is essential for intracellular polarity in myination and remyination, with critical roles in morphological differentiation, myelin initiation, and regulation, and regeneration.
Researchers have identified a novel peptide, Listeriolysin, associated with a subset of lineage I Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive pathogen responsible for outbreaks of listeriosis. Listerin is a bacteriocin-like haemolytic and cytotoxic virulence factor similar to Streptolysin S, previously thought to be exclusive to Group A Streptococcus. Expression of the Listerin gene results in a haolytic and cytotoxic factor contributing to the pathogen's virulence in murine and human polymorphonuclear neutroph-based studies. The distribution of the L monocytogen cluster is exclusive to a subset of lineage I strains responsible for the majority of listeriosis outbreaks. In silico analysis reveals gene clusters encoding S-like factors are present in notorious Gram-positive pathogens, including Listeria monocytogen, Staphylococcus aureus, and Cloidium botulin. Each cluster contains a gene encoding an S-like peptide, designated Listerin, Stolys, and Botys. The study establishes an extended family of S-like modified virulence peptides and reveals the genetic basis for enhanced virulence in a proportion of lineage L monocogen. The discovery provides insights into the pathogenesis of important Gram-positive pathogens and highlights the role of Listerin in the survival and virulence of the pathogen.
Mycetoma is a persistent granulomatous inflammatory disease caused by fungi or bacteria, characterized by the formation of macroscopic structures called grains surrounded by a massive inflammatory reaction. The expression of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and matrix metalloproase-9 (MMP-9) in mycetoma granuloma was studied to determine their correlation with disease severity. Surgical biopsies from 100 patients were evaluated immunohistochemically for IL-17 and MP9 expression. IL17 was mainly expressed in Zones I and II, while MP9 was detected in Zones II and III. MP9 was highly expressed in Actinomadura pelletii and Streptomyces somaliensis biopsies compared to Madurella mycetatis biops. MP9 levels were directly proportional to IL17 levels. The only association between MP9 and patient characteristics was disease duration. No correlation was found between IL17 levels and patient demographics. Results demonstrated IL17 and MP9 expression in granoma of different causative agents, with IL17 more extensively in lesions with longer disease duration. A positive correlation between IL17 and MP9 expression was found. Further studies are needed to determine the roles of IL17 and MP9 in granoma formation and provide insights into mycetoma immunogenesis.
Molecular recognition by intrinsically disordered proteins often involves specific contacts and target-induced order transitions, but some remain disordered in the bound state, known as "fuzziness", characterized by polyvalency, sequence insensitivity, and dynamic disordered conformations. The Ewing Sarcoma oncoprotein family's transcription activation domain is an intrinsically disordered protein exhibiting features of fuzziness with multiple aromatic chains driving recognition. Cation-π interactions are prevalent at protein interfaces, suggesting EAD binding involves polycation-π contacts between disordered EAD and basic residues on the target. Experimental and theoretical evaluation of EAD variants support the cation-π model, with trends captured by a coarse-grained EAD chain and analytical model. E-target binding is driven by a balance between EAD conformation entropy and favorable EAD cation-π contacts, offering a framework for promiscuous target recognition by polyvalent IDPs. The significance of disorder in the bound state has emerged, with theoretical modeling in its infancy but providing tools for understanding dynamic ensembles. A disordered target enabling cation-π contacts with EAD is possible, and many proteins implicated in cancer have significant disordered regions. Molecular recognition by IDPs typically involves target-induced folding, but certain IDPs engage without coupled binding, remaining disordered when bound to a globular target.
Borrelia burgdorferi, the etiologic agent of Lyme disease, codes for two putative ATP-dependent Lon homologs, Lon-1 and Lon-2, which serve different functions. Lon-1 is upregulated transcriptionally by exposure to blood in vitro, while Lon-2 is not. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Lon-1 and Lon2 cluster separately due to differences in NH2-terminal binding domains, suggesting differences in substrate specificity. Recombinant Lon1 manifested properties of an ATP-dependent chaperone-protease but did not complement an E. coli mutant, while Lon2 corrected characteristic Lon-mut phenotypes. This indicates that B burgdorferi Lons-1 and -2 have distinct roles, with Lon2 functioning in a manner consistent with canonical, engaged in cellular homeostasis. Lon1, by virtue of its blood induction, may be important in host adaptation from arthrop to warm-blooded host. The ability of Lon2 and not Lon1 to complement HDB filamentation and dysregulation of cps implies differential capacity to degrade Rsc and SulA, supporting a Lonc-like role for Lon2 in Boriae. Overall, B burgdferi Lons1 and2 have characteristics in common with canonical Lon, with each displaying features of ATP and Mg2+-dependent chaperoneprotease. The presence of two Lon homologs is rare in eubacteria but appears to be a characteristic of the genus Borrelia.
Researchers investigated the role of antibody-dependent phagocytosis in controlling Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infection. They measured the ability of HIV-specific polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to mediate internalization of HIV-1 virions and HIV-1-coated cells by phagocytes. Surprisingly, minimal or no antibody-dependent phagocytosis of virions was found with any antibodies, but coating virions with gp41 or gp-derived peptides enabled efficient phagytosis. A minimum of a hundred gp41 molecules were needed for successful phagocytosis, similar to the number of envelope spikes on readily phagocytosed viruses. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed an association between virus aggregation and antibody-dependent phagytosis. In contrast, virion-coated cells were targets for antibody-dependent phagocytosis or trogocytosis in the presence of HIV-specific antibodies. Findings indicate that antibody-dependent phagytosis of virions may not play a role in preventing infection due to the paucity of trimers and inability of virion-bound antibody to cross-link Fc receptors on phagocytes. However, antibody-dependent phytosis could play a role in clearing infected cells on the verge of infection. Results suggest FcR-dependent functions other than antibody-dependent phytosis of free virions may be critical for maximal prevention or control of HIV-1 infection by antibody.
The global economic and health burden of hookworm infection is significant, with an estimated 2,126,280 to 4,087,803 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost worldwide. Total productivity losses range from $7.5 billion to $138.9 billion annually using gross national income per capita and $2.5 to $43.9 billion using minimum wage. Hookworm infection's economic burden exceeds that of diseases receiving more attention, such as rotavirus. Large countries transitioning to higher income, like Brazil and China, still face considerable hookworm burden. The Global Burden of Disease study reports 3,230,800 DALYs lost to hookworm among all ages in 21 regions, excluding cognitive impairment. Assuming median anemia, 200 disability weights, and GNI per capita, 89,765,729 hookworm infections result in $11.1 billion productivity losses using one method and $87.9 billion using another. Using minimum wage, the global burden is $3 billion. Regional DALs vary with anemia probability, with China's 35,917,360 hookworm infections resulting in $6.7 billion losses using GNI per capita and $1 billion using minimum wage. Overall, hookworm's economic and health impact is substantial, necessitating investment in control measures.
Developmental hypoxia disrupts pathfinding of forebrain neurons in zebrafish, leading to errors where commissural axons fail to cross the midline. The pathfinding defects result from activation of the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (hif) pathway and are mimicked by chemical inducers of the hif pathway or expression of constitutively active hifα. Blocking transcriptional activation by hifα helps prevent the defects. EphrinB2 is identified as a target of hif activation, and knock-down of ephB2 rescues the guidance errors. The receptor ephA4 is expressed in a pattern complementary to the misrouting axons. Targeting a constitively active form of ephB2 to specific neurons shows ephB mediates pathfinding via reverse signaling. Magnesium sulfate protects against pathfinding by preventing upregulation ephB. Results demonstrate evolution conserved pathways regulate connectivity changes in CNS in response to hypia, supporting a neuroprotective role for magnesium. Hypia specifically disrupts vertebrate axon pathfinding through an evolution conserved mechanism by hif activation and ephB expression. The Eph-ephr system has conserved roles in axon pathfinding, controlling commissural axon path. Hypia upregulates eph receptor vab, while knockdown of ligand efn prevents defects, eB is zebfish gene with sequence to efn, expressed telencephalic neurons embryonic CNS.
Human paracoccidiomycosis (PCM) is a fungal disease that primarily affects the lungs and can disseminate to other sites. Researchers studied pulmonary abnormalities in mice with PCM using high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and histopathology. Mice were infected with Paracoccidioides brasiliensis conidia and evaluated at 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks post-infection. Three patterns of lesions were identified: nodular-diffuse, confluent, and pseudo-tumoral, mainly around the hilus and more frequently in the left lung. At 4 weeks, 80% of infected mice had peri-bronchial consolidations with increased lung density compared to controls. Histology revealed consolidation as confluent granulomatous reaction and nodules as compact granulomas. By 16 weeks, confluent granulomas formed pseudotumoral masses obstructing bronchi with discrete fibrosis around granomas. Conventional HRCT was useful for evaluating and quantifying pulmonary damage in experimental PCM, reducing the need for animal sacrifice and enabling monitoring treatment efficacy. The study demonstrated HRCT as a precise non-invasive technique to evaluate pulmonary damage in mouse paracidiomycosis, allowing histological and immunological evaluation of tissue responses during active and residual stages of the disease. The model showed primary infection in lungs causes chronic granulomatous inflammation leading to fibrosis and severe respiratory restriction.
A proof-of-concept study investigated the use of an interferon-gamma release assay (IFN-RA) as a marker for latent Leishmania donovani infection. The QuantiFERON kit was modified to evaluate five leishmania-specific antigens: H2, H2-PS2, H2-Le12, crude antigen, and soluble leishmania antigen (SLA) from L. donani to detect cell-mediated immune response in visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The study included 13 active VL patients, 15 cured patients, 11 non-endemic controls, and 19 healthy controls. The assay based on SLA showed 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity. The whole-blood SLA-based QuantiON assay can measure cell-mediated response in L. donani infection. Positive IFNγ response to leishmania antigen stimulation in active VL was observed, contradicting conventional findings of non-proliferative antigen-specific peripheral mononuclear cells. All antigens tested showed positive IFNγ responses in active VL, with the highest with SL (84.6%). Antigen-specific IFN levels were determined by subtracting background levels in non-stimulated samples. IFNγ levels were measured using the QuantiON-ELISA kit. Le12 showed low sensitivity and specificity (53% and 82%) and 10.5% EC was IFNγ positive with Le12. The results suggest the whole-blood SL-based QuantiON assay can be used as a marker for latent L donani infection.
Researchers have investigated how the bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis establishes persistent infections in the gut, evading the host's immune response. The CNFY toxin, which enhances translocation of antiphocytic Yop effectors, induces inflammatory responses, leading to tissue destruction, alteration of the intestinal microbiota, and bacterial clearance. However, suppression of CNFY function increases interferon-γ-mediated responses, comprising non-inflammatory activities and tolerogenesis, allowing the pathogen to reprogram its transcriptional response towards persistence. This gives the bacteria an edge against host responses, facilitating a commensal life style. Removal of the CNFY toxin dampens inflammation and evades the host's defense, favoring Yersinia persistence. CNFY has a double-edged effect, accelerating pathogen access to deeper tissues and facilitating systemic infections in strains with reduced invasion properties. Suppression of CNFY shifts the balance towards immune suppression, promoting asymptomatic infection. The study demonstrates that CNFY constitutively activates Rho GTPases, improving Yop translocation and enhancing inflammation, while its suppression promotes immune suppression. The findings provide insight into how enteric pathogens, including Yersinia, persist in the intestinal tract, promoting chronic conditions like arthritis and ileitis, determined by complex pathogen-triggered immune reactions during the acute phase.
Researchers have identified a novel pathogenic gene, DES1, in the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryze, which plays a crucial role in suppressing the host plant's basal defenses, enabling successful colonization and reproduction. The DES1 gene encodes a serine-rich protein with unknown biochemical properties, conserved in filamentous Ascomycetes. Targeted deletion of DES1 resulted in hypersensitivity to oxidative stress, reduced activity of extracellular enzymes, and ferrous ion leakage. Inoculation of the Δdes mutant in rice cells triggered strong defense responses, including reactive oxygen species accumulation and autofluorescent material generation. The mutant displayed reduced infectious hyphal extension and pathogenicity. Treatment with diphenyleneiodonium, an NAD oxidase inhibitor, reduced plant defense responses and restored the mutant's infectious growth. DES1 functions by scavenging extracellular reactive oxygen species, compromising plant defense. Loss of DES1 leads to host colonization failure, inducing strong plant responses, and is related to extracellular peroxidase activity. DES serves as a pathogenic factor countering plant defenses by restraining oxidative signaling. Treatment with a defense inhibitory chemical recovered the development of Δdes and DES1-DNA mutants. DES1 is essential for colonization in planta, involved in suppressing innate immunity, originally identified as a pathity-defective mutant by T-DNA mutagenesis.
Researchers evaluated the accuracy of model-based geostatistics predictions for Schistosoma haematobium infection in Ghana by comparing predicted values with empiric prevalence from 79 school surveys. The results showed that using predicted values alone would have led to undertreatment of 21 of 25 high-risk schools requiring praziquantel and unnecessary treatment of 20 of schools with no infection. This translates to 28 of children being undertreated and 12 receiving unnecessary treatment. The current predictive map was inadequate for guiding the national program, but assessing each school in endemic areas is not feasible. The study suggests predictive mapping should be an iterative process incorporating empiric testing and refining to create updated versions for disease control managers. The analysis revealed the predictive map had acceptable capacity to distinguish areas of high prevalence, but aggregating estimates to district level was not sufficient. WHO guidelines were not followed as treatment was based on district level rather than school level. The study highlights the importance of improving understanding predictive maps to guide treatment decisions and techniques for schistosiasis control, emphasizing the need for complementary empiric assessments to predictive models.
Researchers have identified a heterogeneous mixture of F-series prostaglandins that promote sperm guidance in the Caenorhabditis elegans reproductive tract, synthesized from polyunsaturated fatty acid precursors in yolk lipoprotein complexes. Using genetics and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, they found that omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are converted into over 10 structurally related F-series prostaglandins, which function redundantly promote sperm guidance. Disruption of omega-3 fatty acid synthesis triggers compensatory upregulation of prostaglandins from omega-6 fatty acids. The synthesis of F-series prostaglandins in C. elegans involves distinct biochemical mechanisms from mammalian cyclooxygen-dependent pathways, yet PGF2α stereoisomers are still synthesized. A conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme, whose human homolog is implicated in Biet's Crystine Dystrophy, negatively regulates prostagland synthesis. The results support the model that multiple cyclooxygen-independent prostaglandins function together promote sperm motility for fertilization, suggesting a conserved cyclooxygen-independent pathway for F-series synthesis. The study reveals that C. elegans oocytes secrete a blend of F-series prostaglandins to guide sperm to the fertilization site, and identifies a conserved cytochrome P450 enzyme that inhibits prostagland metabolism by diverting precursors into alternative pathways.
Researchers have developed algorithms to optimize proteins for reduced T cell epitope content and high function, revealing a spectrum of designs that trade off between immunogenic potential and molecular function. The Pareto frontier, the set of undominated variants with no single better performance in both criteria, has been constructed and evaluated experimentally for a therapeutic enzyme. Eighteen Pareto optimal variants were produced and analyzed, providing insights into tradeoffs between enzyme sequence, function, and immunogenic potential. Computational analysis correlated with experimental results, showing incremental T cell epitope deletion leads to relative loss of function. The study outlines a design-based approach to deimmunization of biotherapeutic candidates, integrating immunoinformatic epitope prediction with in silico analysis of functional consequences. Advanced protein engineering technologies enhance the efficiency and utility of T cell epitope deletion methodology, enabling global protein deimmization on a compressed time scale. Results demonstrate an inverse relationship between deimmunization and function, where greater deimmunization is achieved at the expense of reduced function. Recombinantly produced enzymes were characterized for stability, activity, and immunoreactivity with human MHC proteins, assessing practical implications of predicted tradeoffs. This systematic assessment represents the first rigorous evaluation of the penalty for pursuing deimmunized biotherapeutic candidates, potentially augmenting and accelerating de-risking experimental deimmization efforts.
Elevated temperature increases meiotic crossover frequency via the Type I interference pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. Meiosis, a fundamental process in eukaryotes, requires reciprocal DNA exchange between homologous chromosomes, known as crossover, to ensure proper segregation. The frequency and distribution of crossovers are regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Research shows that elevated temperature induces meiotic hyper-recombination in Arabidopsis thalian, with extra crossovers derived from the major Type I interference pathway. Heat-induced crosso are not a result of increased DNA double-strand breaks and the hyperrecombinant phenotype is specific to thermal stress. Temperature modulation mimics hyper-recombination phenotypes of Type II anti-crossover factors and temperature-dependent crosso act with Type II perturbations, resulting in enhanced hypercombination. Thermal stress increases somatic homolog recombination via non-homolog end-joining or somatic homolog recombination. The increase in meiotic frequency in response to temperature is not universal and can be replicated by other factors such as salt stress. Temperature-dependent modulation provides a means of plant breeding without editing the genome or working in mutant backgrounds, but pollen viability reduction at high temperatures may require modest increases.
A novel computational approach has been developed to navigate the vast and rapidly evolving terrain of biomedical research, combining reading, reasoning, and reporting methods to facilitate analysis of experimental data. This knowledge-based system extracts information from external resources, enriches the knowledge through reasoning, and combines sources into a network representing relationships between genes, and calculates a reliability score. The implementation, called Hanalyzer, was demonstrated on a large-scale gene expression dataset relevant to craniofacial development, creating hypotheses on four previously uncharacterized genes, which were validated experimentally confirmed. A plugin, Cytoscape, allows tracing provenance links in the network and access to underlying data and publications. The approach identifies functional explanations by exploiting inferences not available in individual sources and presents relevant network aspects in a comprehensible way. Combining the knowledge network with experimental data highlights linkages supported by existing knowledge and generates novel hypotheses. Over 10 million publications have been indexed by the National Library of Medicine, reflecting a 4.8% annual growth rate, and structured knowledge in molecular biology databases has grown impressively. The system facilitates analysis of data, creating quantitative networks based on experimental data and combining them with knowledge networks, demonstrating its effectiveness in craniofacial development research.
Researchers have investigated the surface molecules of extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by the helminth pathogen Fasciola hepatica, which are internalized by host cells, resulting in modulation of host immunity. Using a membrane-impermeable biotin reagent, 380 surface proteins were identified on two EV subpopulations, including virulence factors, membrane proteins, and molecules involved in EV biogenesis and trafficking. Proteomics and immunohistochemical analysis revealed the 120k EVs have an endosomal origin and are released via the protonephial excretory system, while 15k EVs are released from gastrodermal epithelial cells. Lectin microarray profiling showed surface oligosaccharides on 15 and 120 EVs are identical but distinct from the parasite tegument, with high mannose sugars predominant. F. hepatica EVs were resistant to exo- and endo-glycosidases, but PNGase F treatment remodelled surface oligosaccharides and blocked uptake by macrophages. Pre-treatment with antibodies from infected hosts or against EV surface proteins enhanced internalization. This study highlights the diversity of EV biogenesis pathways and sheds light on molecular interactions between parasite EVs and host cells, revealing potential targets for interventions to prevent EV-host interaction.
The Arabidopsis CDF2 transcription factor plays a crucial role in the regulation of microRNA (miRNA) transcription and processing, which is essential for eukaryotic development. CDF interacts with Dicer-like 1 (DCL1) and regulates the accumulation of a population of miRNAs by binding directly to the promoters of some miRNAs, acting as a transcriptional activator or repressor. CDF preferentially binds to primary miRNAs regulated by itself and affects D1-mediated processing of these pri-miRNAs. Genetically, C2 works in the same pathway as miR156 or mi172 to control flowering. CDF regulates a group of pri-miAs at both transcriptional and post-transcription levels to maintain proper levels of mature miAs to control plant development. C2 regulates expressions of components involved in miRNA biogenesis, affecting miRNA biogenesis through regulating levels of these components. Several C2-regulated miAs are involved in flowering, including mi156, mi160, mi167, mi172, mi165/mi166, and mi319. The cdf mutant exhibits early flowering phenotype due to decreased mi156 and increased squamosa promoter binding-like proteins, and increased mi172 and decreased AP2. C2 regulates biogenesis of miAs indirectly by regulating expressions of miRNA processing proteins, in addition to direct roles in transcription and post-transcription of pri-miAs. Overall, C2 maintains proper levels of mature miAs to control plant development through coordination of transcription and processing of pri-mAs.
Folliculogenesis, a highly regulated process essential for reproductive life, requires bidirectional communication between oocytes and granulosa cells, conveying signals and metabolites for proliferation and biosynthesis. The mechanism of establishing this communication is largely unknown. Research shows oocyte geranylgeranyl diphosphate, a metabolic intermediate in protein geranylgeranylation, is required for oocyte-granulosa communication. Levels of geranyl diphosphate and geranyl diphosphate synthase increase in oocytes during early follicular development. Selective depletion of geranyl diphosphate in oocytes impairs granulosa cell proliferation, primary-secondary follicle transition, and female fertility. Mechanistically, geranyl diphosphate depletion inhibits Rho GTP geranylgeranylation and GTP activity, accumulating cell junction proteins in oocyte cytoplasm and failing to maintain oocyte-granul cell connection. Geranyl diphosphate ablation blocks Rab27 geranylanylation, impairing oocyte material secretion. Administration of geranyl diphosphate restores oocyte-gran cell contact, granul cell proliferation, and primary follicle transition in depleted mice. The study provides evidence that geranyl diphosphate-mediated geranylgeranylation contributes to oocyte-gran communication, regulating primary follicle transition, essential for female reproductive function. Geranyl diphosphate regulates Rho Gase cell adhesion and Rab Gase secretion, impacting oocyte-gran communication and follicle transition. Geranyl diph depletion inhibits Rho-mediated oocyte-gran cell contact and Rab-directed secretion, arresting granul cell proliferation and primary follicle transition. Bidirectional communication relies on junction protein localization to the cell membrane. Geranyl d depletion inhibits geranylanylation of specific Rabs, blocking Smad signaling and granul cell proliferation.
RNA polymerase II is a eukaryotic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of messenger RNA using a DNA template. Despite numerous studies, it remains unclear whether the secondary channel is the only route for NTP to reach the active site or if the main channel could be an alternative. A structural model of Pol II with a complete transcription bubble was built based on existing data and molecular dynamics simulations to shed light on NTP pathways. Results show both channels have space for NTP loading, but the percentage of conformations with space for NTP through the secondary channel is twice that of the main channel. Energetic study revealed diffusion through the main channel is disfavored by electrostatic repulsion between NTP and negatively charged nucleotides in non-template DNA. The secondary channel is the major route for NTP entry during Pol II transcription. The model contains 47 nucleotides in both template and non-template strands and nascent mRNA extended to 18 nucleotides length, equilibrating after 15ns in simulations with root mean square deviation of C atoms 3Å. The downstream region of the bubble overlaps with the proposed NTP accommodation region, crucial for investigation of NTP routes.
Dengue is a significant public health problem in Thailand and Cambodia, particularly affecting children under 15 years old. Despite being a reportable, the true disease burden is underrecognized. Prospective cohort studies in Thailand and Cambodia estimated average annual laboratory-confirmed deng incidence at 23/1,000 and 25/1,000 and 41/1,000 respectively. Age-specific multiplication factors were applied to national data, indicating 229,886 and 111,178 deng cases occurred annually in Thailand and Cambodia. Underreporting of total and inpatient deng cases was 8.7 and 2.6-fold in Thailand and 9.1 and 1.4-fold in Cambodia. In 2007 over 95,000 children in Thailand and 58,000 in Cambodia were hospitalized due to deng. Calculating multiplication factors by comparing cohort data to surveillance is an approach to assess disease burden, showing national data significantly underrecognize the true burden. Country-specific factors can be applied to national data to estimate true burden and economic assessments. The study highlights the high burden of deng in Southeast Asia, particularly in children under 15, and the need for accurate reporting to guide public health interventions.
Natural killer cells promote early CD8 T cell responses against cytomegalovirus by accelerating the generation of effector antiviral CD8 cells during infection in vivo. This is achieved through the ability of NK cells to limit IFN-α/β production to non-immunosuppressive levels, controlling cytomegalovirus replication, reducing plasmacytoid dendritic cell activation, preserving conventional dendritic cells, and promoting antiviral CD8 cell responses. Exogenous IFNα administration ablates conventional dendritic cells and delays CD8 cell activation despite NK control of viral replication. Efficient NK responses prevent high immunosuppressive cytokine levels and promote adaptive immunity. NK cells serve as regulators of immune function, controlling plasmacytoid dendritic cell functions, modulating cytokine production, and accelerating effector antiviral CD8 cell generation. The ability of NK cells to dampen cytokine production promotes conditions for antiviral dendritic and CD8 cell responses, resulting from their capacity to control viral replication. Efficient NK responses accelerate development of effector antiviral CD8 cell responses. The study demonstrates NK cells contribute to immunity by controlling innate responses, preventing cytokine shock, and promoting adaptive immunity, extending their role beyond direct antiviral effects.
Researchers investigated the role of nucleolin in regulating rRNA gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana, where 45S rRNA genes are arranged in tandem arrays. Disruption of the nucleolin-like gene AtNU-L led to changes in transcription of specific rRNA variants, with one variant reactivated and others repressed or unaltered. The highly represented rRNA variant, inactive in wild-type plants, was reactivated in AtNU-L mutants. Accumulated pre-rRNAs originated from RNA polymerase I transcription and were accurately processed. Disruption of AtNU-L resulted in loss of symmetrical DNA methylation without affecting histone epigenetic marks at rRNA genes. AtNU-L co-localized with approximately half of rRNA loci in wild-type plants, suggesting association with potentially active rRNA genes at one of two nucleolar organizing regions. Accumulation of preRNA in At-L mutants was likely due to increased RNA polymerase I transcription from intergenic spacers. The study reveals a novel mechanism for rRNA transcriptional regulation where nucleolin controls active and repressed rRNA variants in Arabidopsis, playing a major role in homeostatic rRNA expression. Nucleolin binds rRNA promoter sequences and directs transcription from the intergenic spacer, indicating its importance in regulating rRNA gene expression.
Human cytomegalovirus UL28 protein interacts with components of the NuRD complex to promote accumulation of immediate-early RNA. Histone deacetylation plays a pivotal role in regulating human cytomegalovirus gene expression. Researchers identified HDAC1-interacting proteins in the context of infection using a method for immunoisolation of epit-tagged protein coupled with mass spectrometry, including multiple cytomegalovirus-coded proteins. The interaction of p38 and UL28 with HD1 was confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitations. HD1 is present in numerous complexes, including the HD1-containing nucleosome and deacetyl protein complex NuRD. p38 and UL28 associated with the MTA component of NuRD, and shRNA-mediated knockdown of RBP4 and CHD4 constituents of Nu inhibited HCMV immediate-early RNA and viral accumulation. The growth of UL28 or 38 deficient viruses could not be rescued by treating cells with deacetyl inhibitor trichostatin A. Transient expression of UL28 enhanced activity of HCMV major immediate-early promoter in a reporter, regardless of p38 expression. Induction of major-early reporter by UL28 required functional Nu components, consistent with inhibition of immediate-early RNA within infected cells after RBP and CH4 knockdown. UL28 modifies the Nu complex to stimulate accumulation of immediate-early RNAs.
Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a major cause of pneumonia in infants, and understanding the antibody response to primary RSV infection is crucial for developing effective countermeasures. Researchers used whole-genome-fragment phage display libraries to elucidate the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection and its evolution through adolescence and adulthood. The study found modest changes in anti-F epitope repertoires post-RSV infection, while anti-G epitopes increased 100-fold, spanning the N- and C-terminus of the ectodomain, with increased reactivity to the conserved domain. Panels of F and G antigenic sites were evaluated in young children, adolescents, and adults, showing a steady increase in RSV-F epitope repires from children to adults. Novel epitopes were identified in pre-fusion F and an immunodominant epitope in F27, with antibody binding to pre-fusion 2-3 folds higher than post-fusion. RSV-G antibody responses were high in early infection but declined in adults. The study identified unlinked evolution of anti-F and anti-G responses and evidence for immune-driven evolution of RSV-G. The findings support the development of effective countermeasures, including vaccines, and highlight the importance of understanding pre-existing antibodies in infants and their responses to primary RSV infection to identify protective antibody responses.
Emodepside has sex-dependent immobilizing effects on adult Brugia malayi due to differentially spliced binding in the RCK region of the SLO-1 channel. Filarial diseases, including lymphatic filariasis and river blindness, affect millions of people worldwide and current treatments are ineffective against adult filaria. Emodeide, a veterinary anthelmintic, has macrofilaridal effects and its mode of action was explored using Brug malayi. Whole-parasite motility and patch-clamp measurements show empside inhibits motility by activating voltage-gated potassium channels, with males more sensitive than females. RNAi knockdown suggests emide targets SLO1 channels, specifically slo1 isoforms with alternatively spliced exons at the RCK domain. The slo1 isoform in male muscles is more sensitive to emide than the slo1 isoform in female muscles. Onchocerca volvulus has two isoforms with homology to Bma-SLO-1 and Bma-SLO-1 at the RCK domain. In silico modeling identified an emide binding pocket in the R1 region affected by splice variations. Emide has potent macrofilaridal effects and alternative splicing in the R1 binding pocket affects potency. Evaluation of sex-dependent effects of anthelmintic compounds is crucial to prevent underdosing one gender of nematodes given to patients.
The Global Program to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis relies on rapid diagnostic tests to determine where mass drug administration is required and when it can be stopped, but Loa loa cross-reactivity with these tests is a serious obstacle to elimination in Loa-endemic areas. To understand this cross-reactivity, researchers used the DH5 antibody to immunoaffinity purify Loa antigens from individuals with positive diagnostic test results due to Loiasis. Immunoblot analysis revealed multiple AD12/DH5-reactive antigens and proteomic analysis identified multiple L loa proteins, including secreted and somatic proteins that may be released by dying L loa worms or microfilariae. Unlike Wuchereria bancrofti, L loa antigens are transiently present in the blood of a subset of persons with Loias. The likely mechanism for Loa cross-reactivity is death of L loa worms with release of multiple AD glycoproteins into circulation and imbalance between release and clearance accounts for detection in some Loias patients. The study identified L loa antigens responsible for false-positive results in diagnostic tests and demonstrated a method for distinguishing lymphatic filariasis and loias based on patterns of AD-reactive antigens in human sera by western blot, which may lead to improved diagnostic tests for both diseases.
Primary cilia are specialized sensory and signaling devices extending from the surface of eukaryotic cells, and defects in these organelles cause human disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa and Bardet-Bied syndrome. To identify new cilium-associated genes, researchers employed the nematode C. elegans, where ciliogenesis occurs during late embryogenesis. Whole-organ RNA-Seq libraries revealed a signature profile enriched for transcripts of known ciliary proteins, including FAM161, CC104, and RPI1. A list of 185 candidate ciliary genes uncovered orthologues of human MAP9, YAP, CC149, and R28 as conserved cilium components. R28, a small GTPase associated with autosomal-recessive cone-rod dystrophy, is exclusively expressed in ciliated neurons, dynamically associates with intraflagellar transport trains, and concentrates at the periciliary membrane in a Bome-dependent manner. Functional analyses show cilium structure, sensory function, and intraflagellar transport are normal in rab-28 null allele, but overexpression of GDP or GTP variants perturbs cilium and sensory poreogenesis. The findings present a new approach for identifying ciliary proteins and unveil R28, a GTP closely related to B protein RABL/IFT, as intraflagellar transport cargo with Bome-dependent functions at the ciliary base. R28 has cell-autonomous and non-autonomous roles in maintaining structural and functional integrity of cilia and sensory-supporting cells.
Researchers investigated how the brain represents the outside world using neural responses with no independent access to external stimuli. Using hippocampal place cells as a model, they found that global features of the environment and an accurate representation of space can be extracted from action potentials of cells with stereotyped receptive fields. The study showed that knowing which groups of cells fire together reveals structure in the underlying space, enabling the brain to construct internal representations. The knowledge of groups of hippocal cells firing is enough to extract topological features and reconstruct physical space, allowing the animal's position to be tracked. This is achieved without knowing place fields or prior measurements of position, assuming only that place fields exist and have a stereotypical form. The findings demonstrate that spiking activity of place cells alone can infer global features and geometric reconstruction of space, including the animal's position. This contrasts with previous approaches requiring place fields to reconstruct position. The study identifies minimal aspects of neural activity yielding information for space construction, showing coarse population activity provides a great deal of information about the environment.
Viral fulminant hepatitis is a severe disease with high mortality resulting from excessive inflammation in the liver. Research using murine hepatitis virus-3, a model for viral fulminant hepatitis, shows significant elevation in IL-1 expression in serum and liver, associated with severe disease and high mortality. However, IL-1 receptor deficient or IL-1 antagonist treated mice exhibit reduced virus replication, disease progression, and mortality. IL-1 deficiency debilitates virus-induced fibrinogen-like protein-2 production in macrophages and CD45+Gr-1 neutrophil infiltration in the liver. The release of reactive oxygen species by infected macroages suggests NLR3 inflamome activation. Mice deficient in p47phox, a nicinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase subunit, show reduced NLR3 inflam activation and IL-1 secretion, acquiring resilience to viral fulant hepatitis. Viral infected NLR3 and Casase-1 deficient mice have reduced IL-1 induction and ameliorated hepatitis. The ROS/NLR3/IL-β axis is an essential pathway activated during viral infection, causing severe liver disease. IL-1 receptor deficient or IL-1 antagonist treated mice show attenuated pathologies with reduced macroage F2 expression and liver infiltration. NLR3 and Casase1 deficient mice display resistance to MH-3 induced IL-1 production. Administration of IL-β reinstates disease severity in pphox deficient mice, indicating the ROS/NP3/ILβ axis plays a critical role in pathogenesis of viral fulant hepatitis.
Hookworm infections are a significant cause of severe anemia and iron deficiency in children in tropical regions. A study in Malawi used multiplex real-time PCR to evaluate hookworm species prevalence, infection load, and contribution to severe anemia and iron deficiency in pre-school children. Hookworm infections were found in 34.1% of severely anemic cases and 27% of non-anemic controls, with Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus prevalence at 26.1% and 4.9%, respectively. Moderate and high A. duale infections were associated with severe anemia and iron deficiency, with adjusted odds ratios of 2.49 and 9.04, and 3.63, 16.98, and 44.91 for low, moderate, and high loads, respectively. The study revealed a higher than expected prevalence of A. duale and its load-dependent association with severe anemia and iron deficiency, demonstrating the need for quantitative species-specific screening. Real-time PCR identified 29.2% hookworm infections, significantly higher than 5.6% detected by microscopy, indicating underestimation of hookworm impact. A. duale infections were associated with increased risk of severe anemia, suggesting a significant contributor to unexplained anemia prevalence in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic methods to combat anemia and iron deficiency in resource-poor settings.
Researchers have identified COM-1, a homolog of CtIP/Sae/C1, as a crucial regulator of DNA double-strand break repair during Caenorhabditis elegans gametogenesis. COM-1 promotes homologous recombination by antagonizing Ku-mediated non-homolog end joining, ensuring interhom crossovers necessary for meiotic segregation. Without COM-1, meiotic double-strand breaks are repaired via error-prone non-homolog end joining, resulting in chromosomal aggregation and near-complete embryonic lethality. COM-1 acts parallel to nuclease EXO-1 to promote interhom recombination at the pachytene stage of meiotic prophase, but is dispensable for RAD51 recruitment at late pachytene when hom-independent pathways predominate. COM-1 is not required for Spo11 removal and initiation of meiotic double-strand break repair, unlike its yeast counterparts. Animals deficient in both COM-1 and Ku are viable and proficient in crossover formation. The study reveals the lethal properties of non-homolog end joining during meiosis and a critical role for COM-1 in inhibiting non-hom end joining and ensuring crossovers in germ cells. COM-1 prevents Ku activity at meiotic double-strand breaks, preventing chromosome aggregation and crossover failure. A COM-1-independent mechanism exists to convert Spo11-induced breaks into chiasmata, and COM-1 is not required for Spo11 removal in Caenorhabditis elegans. The absence of COM-1 results in nearly all meiotic double-strand breaks being blocked by Ku, leading to a lack of crossovers and chromosomal abnormalities in diakinesis nuclei of maturing oocytes.
Burkholderia pseudomallei causes melioidosis, a severe disease prevalent in Southeast Asia and Northern Australia, resulting in high mortality rates. A caprine model of aerosol infection was used to characterize the humoral immune response, identifying potential immunogenic proteins for diagnostics and vaccine candidates. Outbred goats were infected with B. pseudallei via intratracheal aerosol, and antigen profiling was generated from the infecting strain MSH511. Results demonstrated a greater humoral response with IgG antibodies compared to IgM, with pre-infection sera showing multiple immunogenic proteins reactive for IgG and IgM despite no previous exposure. The number of IgG reactive proteins increased as the disease progressed, with early infection showing reaction to chaper proteins GroEL, EF-Tu, and DnaK. Seven antigens were selected for analysis, with heat shock protein Gro1 eliciting the strongest immune response. Most antigens showed peak IgM reactivity at day 14, while IgG reactivity increased as the disease progressed. A proteomic comparison between goat and human sera showed common immune proteins between humans and goats with meloidosis. The B. pseudalle aerosol challenge induced an increasing and diverse antibody response over the disease in goats, with IgG and IgM responses characterized using electrophoresis and western blots, indicating a complex immunological response to multiple antigens similar to human meloidosis.
Researchers investigated the activation of cyclin B-cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) in human cells, a key event that initiates mitotic entry. Using a novel approach, they quantified dephosphorylation of Cdk and phosphorylation of the anaphase-promoting complex, disclosing cyclin B-Cdk continues activation after centrosome separation. Cytoplasmic cyclin B-Cdk activity is maintained even when cyclin B translocates to the nucleus in prophase. Experimental data fitted a model describing cyclin B-Cdk activation, revealing a bistable circuit. Cyclin Bdk levels required to enter mitosis are lower than needed for mitotic progression. Gradually increasing cyclin Bdk activity after centros separation is critical to coordinate mitotic progression. Results indicate mitotic cycl Bdk needs to increase after mitotic entry and pass a threshold before metaphase for efficient mitotic progression and exit. Distinct thresholds for cycl Bdk activity control successive mitotic events. Cycl Bdk is activated in late G2, increasing between centros separation and prometaphase. Partially reducing Cdk levels affects mitotic progression, with a threshold autocatalyzing rapid activation and entry into mitosis. Active cycl Bdk contributes to centros separation in late G2 and detected on centros before migration. The activation during early mitosis and passage of thresholds assists coordinating early and late mitotic events, with bistability and oscillations depending on cellular context.
Researchers examined neutralizing antibody responses in 21 Kenyan women with HIV-1 superinfection, defined as sequential infections from different sources, to understand the development of a strong cross-reactive response. The study focused on four main epitopes on the HIV-1 envelope, including the CD4-binding site, V1/V2 glycan, N332 site in V3, and membrane proximal external region of gp41. Epitope mapping and computational analyses showed that superinfection did not induce a dominant response to these epitopes in the women, with 20 out of 21 responses unable to be ascribed to a single specificity. The findings suggest superinfection with diverse subtypes promotes a broad polyclonal response, supporting vaccine designs using multivalent immunogens to elicit diverse neutralizing antibodies. This contrasts with singly infected individuals, where 72-94% develop antibodies targeting one of the four main epitopes. The study indicates exposure to diverse HIV-1 antigens drives a broad and potent response mediated by polyclonal antibodies targeting multiple epitopes, providing insight into developing a neutralizing antibody-based vaccine protective against diverse HIV-1 subtypes. The results support vaccine designs using multivalent immunogens to elicit a diverse repertoire of neutralizing antibodies.
Congenital human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a leading cause of neurological disabilities in children, but the underlying mechanisms are not well-defined. Research has shown that CMV infection dysregulates the Notch signaling pathway in human neural progenitor cells (NPCs). The transcription regulator Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (Hes1) is essential for governing NPC fate and fetal brain development. CMV infection downregulates Hes protein levels in NPCs through the 72-kDa immediate-early 1 protein (IE1), which assembles a ubiquination complex and promotes Hes ubiquination as a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, followed by proteasomal degradation of Hes. The C-terminal region of IE, spanning amino acids 451 to 475, is required for IE/Hes interaction and IE-mediated Hes ubiquination. Sp100, a component of PML nuclear bodies, is also a target of IE-mediated ubiquination. The study suggests a novel mechanism linking Hes downregulation to neurodevelopment disorders caused by CMV infection and identifies IE as the first potential CMV-encoded E3 ubiquitin ligase. CMV infection disrupts Notch signaling by targeting Notch1 and its ligand Jag1, and regulates Hes expression in NPCs. The findings indicate IE-mediated Hes downulation is linked to direct interaction between the proteins, requiring the AA451-475 region within the C-terminal of IE, contributing to fetal brain maldevelopment caused by congenital CMV infection.
A study of transcription factor binding and gene expression in Drosophila embryos from four species, D. melanogaster, D. yakuba, D. pseudoobscura, and D. virilis, revealed extensive divergence in transcription factor binding despite highly conserved gene expression. mRNA levels were found to be more conserved than individual transcription factor binding events, and changes in gene expression were poorly explained by changes in adjacent transcription factor binding. Highly bound sites, regions bound by multiple factors, and sites near genes were conserved more frequently, suggesting considerable transcription factor binding is weak or non-functional. The conservation of sites decreased with increasing phylogenetic distance between species, with few regions bound by any factor in all four species. Sequence divergence explained only 3-7% of variance in transcription factor binding between species. mRNA levels were highly correlated between species, with correlation decaying with phylogenetic distance, and overall divergence of mRNA was lower than transcription factor binding. Two genetic sources of binding divergence were identified: alterations of BCD, HB, GT, and KR-specific motifs and phylogenetic inertia. Transcription factor binding has diverged within the Drosila genus with little effect on downstream gene expression.
A large-scale epidemiological study was conducted in two primary health centers in Thanjavur district, India, endemic for bancroftian filariasis, after eight rounds of mass drug administration. The prevalence and intensity of microfilaria were 0.2% and 0.004, respectively, in a survey covering over 70% of 50,363 population. Antigenemia prevalence ranged from 0.7 to 0.9% in children and 2.7 to 3.0% in adults. Despite low microfilaria and antigen levels, seven residual and 17 transmission hotspots were identified. Antigenemic persons were clustered at household and site levels. An antigen prevalence of 1% in children, equivalent to 0.4 community microfilaria prevalence, was identified as a possible threshold for stopping mass drug administration. The study highlights the need for surveillance strategies to detect hotspots, evidence-based sampling, and unit size for transmission assessment surveys. Eight rounds of mass administration reduced transmission to less than 1 antigen prevalence in children, supporting the decision to stop mass drug administration, but several sites showed potential for resurgence and clustering of filarial infections. Clustering was observed at household and site levels, indicating the need for site-specific interventions to eliminate hotspots.
The application of the organophosphate larvicide temephos to water containers is a commonly employed deng vector control method. This systematic review assesses the community-effectiveness of temos in controlling vectors and deng transmission when delivered as a single or combined intervention. 27 studies were included, with 11 single intervention studies consistently showing temos led to a reduction in entomological indices. 11 of 16 combined studies showed temeph application with chemical control reduced entomological indices, but was not sustained over time or failed to reduce immature stages. Community-effectiveness of temos was dependent on delivery quality, water turnover, type, organic debris, temperature, and sunlight. Timing of deployment, reapplication, reluctance, cost, supplies, and labor were limitations. As a single intervention, temos was effective at suppressing entomological indices, but not when combined with other interventions. There is no evidence temos use is associated with deng transmission reductions. The review highlights temos effectiveness can vary greatly and lack data relating entomological reductions to deng transmission remains a knowledge gap in deng epidemiology and control. Temos has been used since 1966 in ponds and swamps at 0.1-0.5kg/ha for vector control and can be safely used in potable water at 56-112g/ha.
The cohesin complex plays a crucial role in holding sister chromatids together from the time of their duplication in S phase until separation during mitosis, with the highest abundance found at the centromere and surrounding pericentere region. The Ctf19 kinetochore subcomplex and replication-associated factor C3 are key mediators of perentromeric cohesion but act through distinct mechanisms. Components of the Ctf19 complex direct increased association of cohes with the perentere, while C3 is dispensable for cohes enrichment but essential for its functionality in holding sister centrom together. Cells lacking C3 show cohesion defects in combination with Ctf complex mutants. Delaying DNA replication rescues cohesion defects in cells lacking Ctf components but not C3. The Ctf complex ensures cohes loading at centrom prior to replication fork passage, ensuring incorporation into functional linkages requiring C3. Ctf proteins Iml and Ch4 direct cohes association with perentere during mitosis and meiosis. Absence of Iml and Ch4 reduces cohes binding, impacting sister chromatid cohesion and segregation. C3 ensures replisome integrity and cohesion establishment as it traverses centrom protein-DNA barrier, enhancing cohesion near centrom for chromosome segregation fidelity. The Ctf complex plays roles in perentrom cohesion during mitosis and meiosis.
Dengue virus infection causes significant changes in the serum metabolome and lipidome of adult patients, with 60 differential metabolites identified across three stages of infection, including febrile, defervescence, and convalescence. The main metabolite classes affected were free fatty acids, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids, with major perturbed pathways including fatty acid biosynthesis and β-oxidation, phospholipid catabolism, and steroid hormone pathways. Analysis of phospholipids and sphingolids revealed temporal trends and associations with lymphocytes and platelets, suggesting their potential as prognostic markers. The study found temporally distinct serumome and lipidome changes, with many metabolites involved in acute inflammatory responses, and anti-inflammatory processes modulating pro-inflammatory processes to prevent excessive inflammation. The findings provide a detailed description of metabolome changes in acute deng infection, offering insights into disease progression and mechanisms. Identified metabolites may be used to monitor disease progression and evaluate therapeutic efficacy. A large population of 44 patients and 50 controls with repeated sampling at multiple time-points captured dynamic changes in metabolites and reliable differentialites associated with deng pathiology. Lipid metabolism plays a crucial role in Fliviridae viral infection, particularly entry, replication, and release. The study redefines the understanding of complex virus-host interactions in deng infection in vivo, capturing global changes rather than isolated ones.
Researchers analyzed bibliometric data to map neglected tropical disease research with German affiliations, identifying 1,187 publications with at least one German author out of 26,833 worldwide between 2000 and 2012. The majority of co-authors outside Germany were from high-income countries, with collaborations with African partners scattered. German research was distributed among 220 institutions, with strong performers identified using parameters such as number of publications and betweenness centrality. The share of neglected tropical disease publications with German affiliations is approximately half of its share in other medical research fields, highlighting the need to identify barriers and expand research. Spatial analysis of collaborations can support decisions to strengthen capacity, particularly in low and middle-income countries, which were less involved than high-income countries. The study used free tools to analyze research output, facilitating data-driven policies, and contributing to prioritization of German research efforts at a time of policy decisions. Findings showed 4.4% of worldwide neglected tropical disease publications involve a German institution, with African countries among top collaborators in one disease, but few active collaborations across the continent.
Haiti's neglected tropical disease program has made significant progress in controlling lymphatic filariasis and soil-transmitted helminths since 2000 through a mass drug administration program led by the Ministry of Health and international partners. By 201, the program reached national scale with consistently good epidemiological coverage, allowing treatment to stop for lymphatic filariasis throughout most of the country. Key elements contributing to success include community awareness campaigns, trust in distributors, direct observed treatment, easy access, and quality data-driven strategies. High coverage was achieved with 100 geographical coverage in 201 and significant infection reduction, with 45 communes reaching the threshold to stop treatment for lymphatic filariasis. Sustained financial and technical support led to steady progress toward lymphatic filari elimination and a strong foundation for ongoing soil-transmitted helminth control. Factors influencing treatment uptake include community knowledge, perceived risk, and access to treatment posts. Directly observed treatment increased community participation. As mass administration nears its end, Haiti focuses on morbidity control, including hydrocele surgery and lymphedema support. The program established a portfolio of best practices for disease control, addressing future challenges in maintaining soil-transmitted helminth control and morbidity management for lymphatic filari patients.
Sinorhizium meliloti, an alphaproteobacterium, forms a symbiosis with legume hosts, undergoing cellular differentiation within root cells, resulting in genome amplification, cell branching, and loss of reproductive capacity. The master regulator CtrA is key to cellular differentiation in Caulobacter crescentus and may also play a role in S. melilot. Depletion of Ctr in S. meli causes cell elongation, branching, and genome amplification, similar to nitrogen-fixing bacteroids. The cell cycle regulates proteolytic degradation of Ctr, suggesting a mechanism for Ctr depletion in differentiated bacteroids. ChIP-Seq and gene microarray analysis show S. meli Ctr regulates similar processes as C. crescent Ctr but through different genes. Ctr does not control Fts complex expression but negatively regulates septum-inhibiting Min system. The model of Ctr cell regulation in S. meli provides insight into how conserved networks evolve to fit diverse lifestyles. S meli thrives as free-living or nitrogen-fixing symbiont with legume, involving developmental stages coordinating cell proliferation with host development. Differentiation is key, involving cell regulatory networks, with Ctr governing cellular programs in alphaproteobacteria. Global analysis of Ctr transcription network provides insight into evolution of conserved networks in diverse bacteria. Findings elucidate how S meli cell cycle is modulated by plant factors during symbiosis and provide understanding of symbiotic interactions with legume hosts.
Francisella tularensis, a highly infectious bacterium causing tularemia, relies on its ability to multiply and survive in macrophages for virulence. Researchers identified a gene, FTL_076, encoding a putative γ-glutam transpeptase (GT), which allows the bacterium to utilize glutathione and γ-glutyl-cysteine dipeptide as cystine sources for intracellular growth. The ggt mutant showed impaired intracellular multiplication and attenuated virulence in mice, demonstrating the essential role of this nutrient system in intracellular multiplication. Glutathione is the most abundant cystine source in the host cytosol, and the bacterium's capacity to utilize it as a cystine source constitutes a paradigm of bacteria-host adaptation. FTL_076 encodes a genuine GT involved in γ-glutyl peptide metabolism, allowing utilization of γ-glutyl peptides as cystine during intracellular multiplication and critical for virulence. The ggt mutant's growth defect can be relieved by adding cystine to the culture medium, indicating GGT provides cystine by degrading internalized γ-glutyl-cystine peptides. Glutathione and γ-glutyl-cystine can replace cystine to support Francis growth, requiring GGT activity to cleave the γ-glutyl-cystine linkage. F.tularensis GGT complements an E.coli GGT-deficient strain, cleaving the γ-Glu bond of dipeptide γ-Glu, using γ-glutyl-cystine dipeptide and GSH as primary cystine sources. The ggt mutant, unable to cleave the bond, requires free cystine addition to compensate its deficiency.
Researchers investigated the fusion of parasitophorous vacuoles (PVs) containing Leishmania amazonensis and Leishmania major parasites in coinfected macrophages. Macrophages were infected with non-fluorescent L. amazonensis amastotes and then superinfected with fluorescent L. major amastotes or promastigotes. No fusion of PVs containing L. amazonensis and L. major amastotes was observed, but PVs containing L. major promastotes fused with pre-established L. amazonensis PVs. In these chimeric vacoles, L major promastotes remained motile and multiplied but did not differentiate into amastotes. In doubly infected cells with unfused PVs, metacyclic L major promastotes differentiated into amastotes. The results indicate PVs customized by L major amastotes or promastotes differ in ability to fuse with L amazonensis PVs and species-specific PV required for L major differentiation. Live imaging and colocalization of parasites in the same PVs showed L major PVs closely apposed to L amazonensis PVs hours after superinfection. The findings suggest isolation of amotes in species-specific PV could restrict genetic exchange in mixed populations of promastotes in insect vectors. Characterization of macromolecules involved in PV fusion will require in vitro reconstitution of isolated Leishmania PVs.
Researchers investigated the ability of native membrane-expressed JR-FL Env trimers to elicit broad tier 2 neutralizing antibodies, a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine research. Potent neutralizing antibody titers developed in 2 of 8 rabbits immunized with virus-like particles expressing trimers and 1 of 20 immunized with DNA expressing native trimer followed by protein boost. All sera neutralized via quaternary epitopes exploiting gaps in glycan defenses near the conserved region of JR-FL gp120, specifically targeting areas proximal to the CD4 binding site. Removing glycan residue 197, present in 98.7 of Envs, rendered 50 of clade B tier 2 isolates sensitive to trimer sera, showing neutralization via surface masked by N197 glycan. Neutralizing sera overlapped with CD4 binding site, suggesting N197 glycan limits access to this region. Bioinformatics analysis showed shared features with monoclonal antibody PG9, consistent with trimer dependency. Neutralizing DNA serum targeted absence of glycan residue 230, proximal to CD4 site, similar to monoclonal 8ANC. Data show strain-specific holes in glycan allow development of tier 2 neutralizing antibodies to native spikes and cross-neutralization can occur without protecting glycan, providing insights for future vaccine development.
Researchers investigated immunohistochemical markers to monitor wound healing in Buruli ulcer patients treated with antibiotics. Tissue specimens from eight patients were analyzed for markers associated with connective tissue neoformation, tissue remodeling, and epidermal activation before, during, and after chemotherapy. α-smooth muscle actin positive myofibroblasts emerged during healing, producing extracellular matrix proteins such as pro-collagen 1, tenascin, and fibronectin. Antibiotic treatment activated myofibroblasts showed ribosomal S6 phosphorylation, indicating translation initiation. Healing wounds revealed dermal remodeling by apoptosis and increased cytokeratin 16 expression in the epidermis. Markers identified include αMA, fibronin, pro-coll 1, tenasc, and CK16. Activated myofibroblasts produce ECM proteins and are involved in wound contraction and granulation tissue formation. Enhanced CK16 expression is a consequence of dermal inflammation and mycolone clearing. Tissue remodeling by apoptosis is important as proliferation. The presence of activated myofroblasts and ECM deposition indicates successful wound healing. The study suggests the mTor pathway plays a role in wound healing and may help discriminate between healing and non-healing wounds. Identified markers can monitor wound progression and help understand healing delays in some patients.
Researchers investigated mitochondrial transport in adult mammalian peripheral nerves in vivo, focusing on the relationship between impulse conduction and mitochondrial trafficking. Using confocal imaging and electrical stimulation of myelinated and unmyelinated axons in anaesthetized mice, they found low-frequency activity increased anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial traffic, while higher frequencies within a physiological range dramatically increased antergrade traffic. Topical capsaicin application increased mitochondrial traffic in both types of axons. Stationary mitochondria in high-frequency conducting axons became shorter, supplying additional mitochondria to the trafficking population through fission. Mitochondria recruited to the mobile population traveled anterograd, not accumulating near Nodes of Ranvier. The findings suggest peripheral sensory axon terminals are sites of high metabolic demand during high conduction. Increased antergrade traffic may ensure uniform mitochondrial density along axons during high impulse load, supporting metabolic demand. The study demonstrates a physiological relationship between impulse activity and mitochondrial trafficking in normal adult mammalian peripheral axons, with no difference in membrane potential between anterograd and retrograd mitochondria. Capsaicin exposure increased moving mitochondria in myelinated axons, peaking at 30 minutes post-application, consistent with satisfying increased energy demand from ionic imbalance.
Spondylocarpal synostosis is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive vertebral fusions caused by loss of function mutations in Filamin B. Research employing a Fln knockout mouse found morphologic and molecular evidence that intervertebral discs undergo rapid degeneration during postnatal development due to abnormal cell changes, particularly in the annulus fibrosus. The cells lose fibroblast characteristics and acquire molecular phenotypic signature of hypertrophic chrocytes with hallmarks of endochondral ossification. Conversion of cells into chrocytes is coincident with upregulated TGF signaling via Smad2/3 and BMP induced p38 as well as sustained activation of canonical and noncanonical genes. Findings indicate FLNB is involved in attenuation of TGF/BMP signaling and influences cell fate. IVD disruptions resemble aging degenerative discs revealing insights into molecular causes of vertebral fusions and degeneration. Loss of FLNB increases TGF and BMP signaling in vitro and vivo demonstrating FL is required for attenuation of TGF/BMP signaling. Mutant AF undergoes ectopic differentiation toward chrogenic lineage leading to abnormal endral ossification. Elevated pSmad2 and 3 observed in chrocy prior IVD degeneration suggests increased TGF and BMP signaling initiates cascade of cell changes including differentiation and IVD degeneration and bony fusions.
The orthomyxovirus Thogoto virus (THOV) targets the host's antiviral response by engaging the general transcription factor TFI, creating a TFI-depleted nuclear environment by relocalizing it into the cytoplasm. This leads to altered expression of a limited number of genes, particularly those requiring de novo recruitment of RNA polymerase II. TFI is crucial for de novo recruitment of Pol II to promoter sites but not necessary for regulated gene expression from paused promoters. Many immune genes require de novo recruitment of Pol, making targeting TFI a mechanism to affect immune responses while keeping other transcriptional activities intact. Interference with TFI activity may be a site for therapeutic intervention to control undesirable inflammation. The innate immune system is comprised of cytokines and antiviral molecules, and targeting TFI perturbs this system at a broad scale with minimal influence on other transcriptional processes. Mimicking THOV's inhibitory domain to target TFI modulates pro-inflammatory cytokines and effector molecules requiring de novo recruitment without affecting general expression and genes for homeostasis, growth, and metabolism. Viral targeting of TFI is beneficial for infection, inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines while expressing negative regulators and tissue repair factors. Genes loaded with Pol II can still be transcribed even if TFI is dissociated, but those requiring de novo recruitment are dependent on TFI, including inflammatory cytokines and antiviral molecules. THOV's ML targets polymerase through association with TFI, impairing type-I interferon expression through IRF3 without general inhibition of gene expression or toxicity.
Human parvovirus B19 (B19) infection of primary erythroid progenitor cells arrests cells at late S-phase and G2, containing 4N DNA. The B19 NS1 protein induces cell cycle arrest at G2 by activating the ATR-CHK1-CD25-CDK pathway. The C-terminal transactivation domain (T2) within NS1 is responsible for G2 arrest. The NS1 T2 domain plays a pivotal role in NS-induced G2 arrest by transactivating cellular expression, leading to ATR activation. Activated ATR phosphorylates CDC25 at serine 216, inactivating cyclin B/CD1 complex without affecting nuclear import. The ATR-CHK1-CD25-CD1 pathway is activated during B19 infection of erythroid progenitor cells and ATR plays a role in B19-induced G2 arrest. Expression of B19 NS1 alone induces true G2 arrest, characterized by 4N content without Brd uptake. The blockage of nuclear import of cyclin B/CD1 complex is not the cause of G2 arrest in B19-infected cells. No G1 arrest is observed in NS1 or NSmT2-expressing cells or B19-infected erythroid progenitor cells, despite increased p21 levels. B19 infection induces DNA damage response essential for viral replication but dispensable for cell arrest at G2. The NS1 T2 domain dysregulates the cell cycle and ATR activation is crucial for B19-induced G arrest.
Dengue virus (DENV) is a prevalent mosquito-borne virus that causes disease ranging from uncomplicated dengue to life-threatening conditions characterized by endothelial dysfunction and vascular leakage. Research has shown that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) induces endothelial hyperpermeability by disrupting the endothelial glycocalyx layer and triggering inflammatory cytokine release. This study examined the contributions of inflammatory mediators and endothelial cell-intrinsic pathways, demonstrating that DENV NS1 triggers localized vascular leak in mice, independent of inflammatory cytokines. Human endothelial cells exposed to DENV NS1 did not produce cytokines, and blocking these cytokines did not affect DENV1-induced hyperpermeability. DENV1-induced vascular leak occurred in mice deficient in TLR4 or TNF receptors at similar to wild-type animals. Inhibitors targeting glycocal disruption blocked DENV1-induced vascular leak, indicating that NS1-induced endothelial leak is dependent on glycocal components. These results suggest potential targets for therapeutics inhibiting glycocal degradation for deng disease treatment. Disruption of glycocal components is responsible for vascular leak in murine dermis by DENV NS1, contributing to the critical role of NS1 in deng pathogenesis. The findings highlight the importance of endothelial glycocal in vascular leak, suggesting targets for therapeutics in DHF and DSS treatment.
Budding yeast proteins Dma1 and Dma control septin dynamics and the spindle position checkpoint by promoting the recruitment of the Elm1 kinase to the bud neck. The integrity of the septin ring is crucial for cytokinesis, proper spindle positioning, and the spindle checkpoint, which delays mitotic exit and cytokinesis until the anaphase properly aligns with the division axis. Dma1 and Dma, redundant ubiquitin-ligases, regulate septin dynamics and the spindle checkpoint by promoting efficient recruitment of Elm1 to the bud. Dma1 Dma mutant cells show reduced Elm1 levels at the bud and Elm-dependent Kin4 activation. Artificial recruitment of Elm1 to the bud rescues septin ring, spindle positioning, and checkpoint response in Dma mutant cells. Septin dynamics and checkpoint function are linked, supporting the idea that neck integrity is crucial for checkpoint signaling. Elm1 and PP2A2 phosphatase regulate septin stability and contribute to the checkpoint by regulating Kin4 activity. Constitutive recruitment of Elm1 rescues septin defects and checkpoint failure in Dma mutant cells. Dma proteins contain FHA and RING domains, typical of E3 ubiquitin ligases, and contribute to septin stabilization and checkpoint by regulating Elm localization. Disrupted septin dynamics and checkpoint defects are linked in Dma mutant cells, consistent with septin serving as a platform for signaling mechanisms inhibiting mitotic exit in response to mispositioning. The proposed model depicts Dma regulating septin and checkpoint by promoting Elm recruitment, Elm stabilizing septin and activating Kin4 through phosphorylation.
Humans have adapted to a wide range of environments through natural selection, enabling them to survive and thrive in extreme climates. A genome-wide scan identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with strong correlations between allele frequencies and climate across 61 worldwide populations, revealing an enrichment of genic and nonsynonymous SNPs relative to non-genic SNPs. The strongest signals overlap with genome-wide association studies include SNPs associated with pigmentation and autoimmune diseases. Gene sets related to UV radiation, infection, and immunity, and cancer show enrichment of strong signals, indicating climate-shaped spatial variation in humans. Many signals coincide with SNPs associated with immune response diseases, suggesting climate-influenced selective pressures. Common themes include genes and variants in pigmentation, UV response, immune response, autoimmune, and cancer with strongest selection signals. A subset of SNPs with large Bayes factors for climate variables were associated with traits from 106 genome-wide association studies, implicating pigmentation and autoimmune disease. The study used allele frequency data to test adaptations to continuous climate variables, identifying genetic loci underlying adaptations, with significant enrichment for genic SNPs in all population subsets.
Short QT syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous condition characterized by abbreviated QT intervals and increased susceptibility to arrhythmia and sudden death. This study investigates arrhythmogenic mechanisms in the rapid-delayed rectifier K+ current-linked SQT1 variant. Markov chain models were superior to Hodgkin-Huxley models in reproducing experimental data regarding the N588K mutation on KCNH2-encoded hERG. In single cell models, the N588 mutation abbreviated ventricular action potential duration and decreased transmural voltage heterogeneity, resulting in decreased transmural heterogeneity of effective refractory period. However, in tissue models, the N588 mutation led to QT shortening, increased T-wave amplitude, and augmented transmural heterogeneity, predisposing to reentrant excitation. 2D and 3D tissue models showed the N588 mutation facilitated reentrant waves due to reduced substrate size necessary for sustaining re-entry. The study substantiates the causal link between N588 mutation and QT shortening, providing explanation for increased susceptibility to reentry and perpetuation of reentrant arrhythmia in S1. The N588-hERG mutation facilitates initiation and maintenance of ventricular reentry, increasing lifespan of reentrant waves and stability in 3D tissue, increasing vulnerability to unidirectional conduction block and predisposing formation of reentrant waves.
Researchers utilized deep attention networks to model collective behavior in zebrafish, achieving a balance between predictability and insightfulness. The model was applied to simulated and experimental trajectories of 60-100 Danio rerio, revealing interactions between pairs can be described as repulsive, attractive, or alignment, but only when moving slowly. At high velocities, interactions correspond to alignment or mixed repulsion at close distances. Each zebish decides where to move by aggregating information from the group as a weighted average over neighbors, with higher weights for those close, in collision, or moving in frontal and lateral locations. The network extracts the number of interacting individuals is dynamic, typically 8-22, with 1-10 being more important. The model recovers ground-truth rules used to generate simulated data, including repulsion, attraction, and alignment. Pair-interaction subnetworks describe interaction with closest neighbors, while aggregation subnetwork aggregates outputs to provide a single number. Trained deep network extracts attraction, repulsion, and alignment notions from pairwise interactions. Results suggest each animal decides by dynamically selecting information from the collective, aggregating from a weighted average of neighbors.
Researchers employed a phylodynamic approach to quantify the fitness costs of major HIV-1 drug resistance mutations using data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study and associated resistance database. The study modeled transmission dynamics using stochastic birth-death-sampling processes with two types: hosts infected by sensitive or resistant strains, allowing quantification of fitness as the ratio of transmission rates between resistant and sensitive strains. Major mutations in reverse transcriptase and protease genes were analyzed, including 41L, 67, N70, R, 184, V, 210, 215, D, 215, and 219, and 103, 108, I, 138, 181, 190, and 90. Only the 90 mutation in the protease gene showed higher fitness than sensitive strains, while 67, 70, 184, and 219 were less fit. Remaining mutations had no significant effect on transmissibility within the Swiss cohort. This novel phylodynamic approach estimates transmission cost of resistance and sheds light on HIV evolution dynamics, potentially useful in assessing transmitted drug resistance risk in resource-limited settings where testing is possible but epidemiological and clinical data are missing. The study demonstrates a method to quantify population-level costs of HIV mutations from sequence data, essential for understanding transmission fitness between hosts.
The Elongator complex, including histone acetyl transferase Sin3/El3, plays a crucial role in modifying tRNAs, which modulates translation efficiency. In fission yeast, Sin3/3p is essential for oxidative stress survival. Cells lacking Sin3/3p cannot modify the uridine wobble nucleoside of certain tRNAs, and other tRNA modifying activities such as Ctu-C2 are essential for normal tolerance to H2O. Overexpressing tRNALysU complements the stress-related phenotypes of Sin3/3p mutant cells. H2-dependent genes, including those coding for transcription factors Atf and Pcr, are highly expressed mRNAs containing a biased number of lysine-coding codons versus AAG. These mRNAs are poorly translated after stress in cells lacking Sin/3p or C2. The lack of functional Elong complex results in stress phenotypes due to its contribution to tRNA modification and translation inefficiency of certain stress-induced mRNAs. Transcriptional defects in these backgrounds may be a consequence of deficient expression of transcription factor Atf-Pcr and other components of the transcriptional machinery. Sin3p mutant does not display significant alterations in transcriptional events to explain sensitivity to peroxides. The absence of mcm5U modification could be the cause of stress sensitivity in cells lacking Sin3p. Strains lacking Sin3, C1, or C2 have similar tolerance to perox lower than wild-type cells. Overexpression of tALUU suppresses growth-related Sin3 defects. Elong mutants result in phenotypes unrelated to stress, including thermosensitivity, cell elongation, and misplaced septa, common in cell-cycle progression.
Researchers have discovered a novel function of the lentiviral protein Nef, which renders HIV-1 virions resistant to the broadly neutralizing antibodies 2F5 and 4E10. Nef confers up to 50-fold resistance to these antibodies, which target the membrane-proximal external region of TM41, but has no effect on neutralization by other Env-specific agents. This activity is conserved among Nef proteins from diverse HIV-1 and SIV isolates and is genetically separable from other Nef functions. Nef myristylation is required for this activity, and glycosylated-Gag from MoMLV can substitute for Nef in conferring resistance. The data suggests Nef alters membrane-proximal external region recognition in the context of the virion membrane, as it decreases the efficiency of virion capture by 2F and 4E, but not other antibodies. This discovery has implications for anti-HIV immunity and AIDS pathogenesis, as Nef protects lentiviruses from one of the most broadly acting classes of neutralizing antibodies. The effect is specific and not a result of a global decrease in neutralization sensitivity, with Nef having no effect on nine other well-characterized Env neutralizing agents. The study used quantitative virion immunoprecipitation assays and a panel of HIV-1 entry inhibitors to explore the link between Nef and Env, and found Nef modifies retroviral glycoprotein, altering susceptibility to Env-specific neutralizing agents.
Researchers used high-throughput Illumina sequencing and bioinformatic analyses to characterize the transcriptomes of uninfected and Opisthorchis viverrini-infected Bithia siam gomphos, the snail host of the liver fluke causing cholangiocarcinoma in the Greater Mekong region. Comparative analysis identified 7,655 differentially expressed genes associated with 43 biological pathways, including immune defense mechanisms against parasites. Infected snails showed downregulation of protease-encoding transcripts and upregulation of heat-shock proteins and actins. The study provides a foundation for understanding immune-molecular mechanisms involved in parasite colonization of the snail host. The dataset is a resource for discovering molecular pathways underlying susceptibility and resistance of B. siamphos to O. vivini and comparative analyses with other platyhelminth snail hosts. The study found 90% of molecules were upregulated in uninfected snails, suggesting a role of O. vivini in immune suppression. The dataset is a basis for investigating snail-parasite interactions at the molecular level, enabling future studies on gene expression changes following experimental infection and identifying key molecules associated with invasion and survival of the parasite in the snail host.
Researchers investigated the role of Complement Receptor 1 (CR1, CD35) in susceptibility to leprosy, a significant public health issue in Brazil, by analyzing CR1 polymorphisms, gene expression, and soluble CR1 levels in a case-control study with 213 leprosy patients and 297 controls. Individuals with the most common recombinant haplotype harboring rs3846*T and rs3732 presented twice higher susceptibility to lepro. Paucacillary patients with these variants had lower sCR levels, reducing the anti-inflammatory response. The most ancient haplotype increased susceptibility to the multibillary clinical form and presented the intronic rs12083G allele, associated with higher gene expression, likely increasing parasite internalization. There was an inverse correlation between sCR and mannose lectin levels. The results suggest a regulatory role for CR polymorphisms on mRNA and sCR levels, with haplotype-specific effects increasing lepro susceptibility by enhancing phagocytosis and inflammation. The study found an association of recombinant haplotypes with two-fold higher susceptibility to lepro, with rs3846 located in a regulatory region bound by CTC and other proteins. Complement Receptor 1 was identified as a mediator for Mycobium leprae entry into phocytes over two decades ago, but only one study on missense mutations has been conducted. This study is the first to analyze CR1 haplotypes, mRNA, and sCR levels in lepro susceptibility.
A study investigated sex-specific differences in serum metabolite concentrations and their underlying genetic determination using over 3,300 individuals with metabolite measurements of 131 metabolites. Linear regression revealed significant concentration differences between males and females for 102 of 131 metabolites. Sex-specific genome-wide association studies showed genome-wide differences in beta-estimates for SNPs in the CPS1 locus for glycine. The study found metabolite profiles of males and females are significantly different and specific genetic variants in metabolism-related genes depict sexual dimorphism. A meta-analysis revealed 113 metabolites with a significant effect of sex. The study shed light on sex-specific architecture of the human metabolome and provide clues on biochemical mechanisms that explain differences in susceptibility and course of common diseases in males and females. Sex-stratified genome-wide analysis adjusted for age and BMI showed significant effects of gender in 102 of 131 metabolites. At least one metabolite of each subgroup including amino acids, acylarnines, phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidchol and sphingelins showed sex-specific differences. The study provides new insights into sex-specific cell processes and underscores the importance of considering sex effects in study design and interpretation.
Genome-scale metabolic networks provide a framework for modeling genotype-phenotype relationships through simulations, but optimization approaches are necessary due to predict the active metabolic state under specific conditions. The objective function used in these algorithms is linked to the biological hypothesis and is crucial for successful modeling. However, current methods using linear combinations of fluxes are sensitive to stoichiometry representation, leading to different results with numerically different but biochemically equivalent representations. A new method, Minimization of Metabolites Balance (MiM), decouples stoichiometry from the objective function by using metabolite turnovers rather than fluxes. MiM simulates perturbed networks, demonstrating the need for stoichiometry-independent algorithms for unambiguous results. It expands metabolic modeling, elucidating genetic interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Current methods lead to inherent biological inconsistencies with alternative stoichiometry representations. MiM accounts for reaction stoichiometry by mapping flux into metabolite space. The objective is formulated as a linear combination of metabolite turnovers, the sum of all fluxes producing or consuming a metabolite, multiplied by stoichiometric coefficients. Minimization of intracellular flux leads to inconsistent predictions with different stoichiometry, illustrating the need for a new approach like MiM for biologically meaningful and mathematically robust results.
Researchers investigated the relationship between plague distribution and population genetic structure of the black rat, Rattus rattus, the main reservoir of plague in Madagascar. A comparative study of plague seroprevalence and genetic structure in rat populations from four geographic areas differing in topology was conducted, covering 150-200 km within the Madagas plague focus. Seropvalence levels in rat populations mimicked those reported for humans, with marked genetic structure increasing with relief. However, the relationship between seropvalence and genetic structure differed between areas, suggesting plague distribution is not solely related to rat dispersal. Genetic diversity estimates indicated epizootics had a weak impact on rat population sizes. In highlands, plague dissemination cannot be accounted for solely by reservoir dispersal, and human activities may be involved in spreading the disease in rat and human populations. Topographic relief influences gene flow in many species, including rodents, and the study aimed to investigate its role in plague spread. Significant genotypic differentiation of Rattus subpopulations was observed over a small spatial scale between habitats and villages. Distribution of plague seropvalence in rat populations differed between plateau and mountain areas, similar to humans, with more marked genetic structure in mountains. Human activities may contribute to plague spread in rat and human populations, in addition to population structure of the reservoir.
Researchers investigated the Schistosoma mansoni Ly6 family, a group of proteins on the surface of the schistosome parasite, and the immune responses they elicit during infection. The study identified eleven members of the Ly6 family, including three novel proteins, and found that all are likely surface-bound due to the presence of cysteine residues, signal peptides, and GPI-anchor sites. In a cohort of S. mansoni-infected Ugandan males, IgG1, IgG4, and IgE responses were detected against two surface-bound representatives, Sm6A and Sm6, before and after praziquant treatment. Pre-treatment IgG prevalence for Sm6A and Sm6 was 7.4% and 25.3%, higher than sub-surface antigen SmT1 at 2.7%. Post-treatment IgG levels against Sm6A and Sm6 significantly dropped, p=0.020 and p<0.001, while IgG levels against SmT1 rose. These results expand the number of Sm6 proteins within S. mansoni and demonstrate surface Sm6A and Sm6 elicit immunological responses during infection in endemic communities. The findings are consistent with vaccine candidates on or near the parasite surface such as Tetraspan-2 and Glyeraldehyde 3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase. IgG-specific Sm6 and Sm6 titers dropped after prazantel treatment, reflecting differential abundance throughout the schistosome lifecycle.
Researchers have developed a quantitative model to study the role of cadherin-dependent cell morphology in epithelial tissue, specifically in the Drosophila retina, where cells have well-defined morphologies attained during tissue morphogenesis. The model minimizes global interfacial energy between cells and explains experimental data from normal and mutant cells lacking or misexpressing adhesion protein N-cadher. Simulations reproduce geometries of wild-type and mutant cells and highlight the importance of adhesion protein biogenesis and its timing with respect to cell remodeling. The results indicate N-cher protein is recycled from inactive to active interfaces, modulating adhesion between cells. Cell adhesion plays a crucial role in cell sorting and morphogenesis, with cadins determining geometric shapes in tissues like the Drosila retina. The model describes characteristic changes in mutants, distinguishes mechanisms of cadin levels, and incorporates dynamical features such as temporal cadin expression and cell contact remodeling. Key features include recycling and redistribution of unpaired N-cadher molecules, temporal dynamics of N-cadher expression, and cell contacts. The study applies considerations of cadin distribution and dynamics to a mechanical model, testing fits with experimental data from mutants producing altered N-cadher levels. Cells in the retina express E-cadher and N-cher, with Nher localized in a thin band of lateral membrane corresponding to adherens junctions, the major site of adhesion between cells.
Researchers investigated the role of MT1-MMP, a membrane-bound protease involved in cancer cell invasion, in degrading the extracellular matrix (ECM) at invadodia. Using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments, they found rapid recovery of MT1-MMP at invodia, approximated by double-exponential plots with time constants of 26 and 259 seconds, primarily dependent on vesicle transport. A computational model was constructed, simulating the observed kinetics and reproducing experimental results. Inhibiting vesicle transport blocked ECM degradation experimentally and in simulations. The degree of reduction in ECM degradation depended on the reduction in MT1-MMP turnover. The study established the importance of rapid MT1-MMP turnover in ECM degradation at invodia and suggested synergetic contributions of proteolytic activity and MT1-MMP. The computational model provides a tool to design and evaluate intervention strategies in cancer invasion. MT1MP is critical for maintenance of invodia's ECM-degrading activity, delivered to the surface by vesicle transport. Continuous supply of active MT1MP is necessary for ECM degradation. Knockdown of MT1MP abolished invodia-mediated degradation. MT1MP localization and turnover at invodia were analyzed using phorin-tagged MT1MP, showing rapid recovery and dependence on vesicle transport. The results indicate the importance of MT1MP in cancer cell invasion and provide a basis for designing intervention strategies.
Researchers investigated the spatial and temporal evolution of simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) within infected macaques to understand how drug-resistant HIV-1 arises and spreads. Serial sequences from four macaques infected with RT-SHm027, a simian immunodeficiency virus encoding HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, were examined after treatment with RT inhibitors. Viral DNA and RNA were isolated from blood, lymph nodes, gut, and vagina at multiple time points and characterized via single-genome sequencing. Results reveal a dynamic system where vRNA rapidly acquires resistance across compartments through independent mutations, with fast migration of viral genotypes but not immediate equilibration of frequencies. Blood and lymph nodes were compartmentalized, differing from mucosal tissues. The study suggests oft-sampled blood does not capture viral dynamics in other body parts, especially the gut, where vRNA turnover was faster and retained fewer wild-type viruses. Findings indicate transient compartmentalization across tissues, explaining varied results in previous HIV-1 studies. The research used RT-SIV as a model for HIV-1 due to similarities and ability to sample intensively, including longitudinal biopsies. Estimated effective population size was similar to HIV-1, indicating similar dynamics. Understanding HIV genetic variation across the body may aid in reconstructing transmission chains, tracking resistance, and potential eradication.
Researchers investigated the role of feedback regulation of cell lineage progression in tissue morphogenesis, using mathematical modeling to explore the effects of positive and negative diffusible signals on stem and progenitor cells. The results showed that a specific feedback architecture leads to bistable or bimodal growth behaviors, ultrasensitivity to external cues, local growth-driven budding, self-sustaining elongation, and self-organization in the form of lamellar fingers. This occurs through control of stem or progenitor self-renewal rather than regulation of cell cycle speeds. Spatial patterns arise from interactions between diffusible factors with antagonistic effects, but morphogenesis is not a consequence of Turing-type instabilities. The study found that simultaneous positive and negative feedback of cell renewal by diffible signals leads to spontaneous emergence of spatially dynamic behaviors, manifesting as localized growth differences. Conditions for bistability, ultrasensitivity, and self-organization were mathematically defined, showing how they drive formation of bulges, buds, and fingers in morphogenesis. The patterns that arise are not Turing patterns, and final models may better represent lineage dynamics during morphogenesis in self-renewing tissues due to rapid occurrence of tissue morphogenesis relative to cell lifespans. The effects of mixed feedback in final-state systems were also explored.
A genome-wide association study of 45,771 European participants identified 22 significant associations with myopia, a common eye disorder characterized by excess eye elongation, with 20 being novel and two replicating earlier associations with refractive error. Ten novel associations were replicated in a separate cohort of 8,323 participants who developed myopia before age 10, explaining 2.9% of variance in myopia age onset. Associations were found in genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, visual cycle, and neuronal development, including PRSS56, LAMA, GR, RDH5, ZIC, and SP1. Multiple genetic factors contribute to myopia development, suggesting interactions between extracellular matrix remodeling, neuronal development, and retinal signals underlie its development in humans. The study analyzed age of myopia onset rather than refractive error, revealing genetic factors affecting age independently of severity. Associations with age of onset were stronger than those with refractive error, including near GJD and RGR1, with RGR1 failing to replicate in a recent meta-analysis. The findings point to complex mechanisms behind myopia development, involving extracellular matrix, neuronal development, and visual signals from the retina.
Researchers investigated the role of curvature feedback in the energetics and dynamics of lamprey swimming using a closed-loop model, where a central pattern generator circuit activates muscles for locomotion and adjusts to sensory inputs from the environment. The model consists of coupled oscillators representing the left and right sides of the lamprey body, activating muscles that flex the body and move it through a fluid simulated environment, with emergent curvature serving as input to the oscillators. Two forms of feedback were considered: directional, exciting or inhibiting oscillators on the same side, and having the opposite effect on the opposite side, and magnitude, providing symmetric excitatory or inhibitory effects to both sides. Results show directional feedback does not affect beat frequency but changes muscle activity duration, while magnitude feedback increases frequency and reduces energetic cost when gain is high and positive. Both types of feedback produce similar body curvature magnitude, indicating different forms of curvature-based feedback can cause distinct swimming performance differences. The study used a multiscale computational model of the lamprey closed-loop neuromechanical system, integrating sensory information from proprioceptors sensing body movement and adapting muscle activation patterns.
Researchers investigated the dynamics of HIV competition over sexual networks, focusing on the concept of "founder effects" where the first strain to colonize a population has an advantage. A stochastic modeling framework was developed to simulate HIV epidemics over contact networks, introducing a second strain into a population where the first strain had established a steady-state epidemic. Simulations showed the second strain spread on a much slower scale compared to the initial expansion of the first, with equal transmission efficiency unable to invade on a relevant time scale for the pandemic history of HIV. To become dominant over decades, the second strain needed a 25% advantage in transmission efficiency over the resident strain. Inhibition was weaker when introduced during the first strain's growth phase. Mechanisms of interference, such as superinfection and depletion of highly connected hubs, contributed to the effect. The study confirmed a strong first-comer advantage in HIV competition at the population level, explaining the global phylogeography and influencing the pandemic's evolution. Virus variants with higher transmission potential spread at the expense of less efficient strains, with epidemics expanding as original variants are replaced by "fitter" lineages. The model was parameterized based on data from generalized heterosexual epidemics in Africa, adaptable to other routes and concentrated epidemics.
Researchers investigated the self-organization of muscle cell structure and function, focusing on the multiscale problem of muscle organization from sarcomere to muscle bundle. They hypothesized that boundary conditions in the extracellular space potentiate the organization of cytoskeletal scaffolds for sarcomgenesis and developed a quantitative model of the cytoskeleton of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. Numerical results and in vitro assays indicated distinct cytoskeletal architectures arise from temporally-ordered processes, including interaction between actin fibers, premyofils, and focal adhesions, and cooperative alignment and bundling of nascent myofils. The study suggests a hierarchy of mechanisms regulate the self-organization of the contractile cytoskeleton, with a positive feedback loop responsible for initiating break symmetry, potentiated by extracellular conditions, required to polarize the contractile cytoskeleton. The computationally model recapitulates the protein choreography of sarcom assembly, where an ensemble of proteins assemble along the actin template. Myofils mature in a force-dependent manner, suggesting contractility plays a role in polarizing the myofillar network. A computational model of myofill patterning showed sensitivity of intracellular architecture to extracellular space, guiding experiments to understand critical events in global assembly and organization of contractile apparatus in cardiac myocytes. Muscle cells depend on extracellular cues to efficiently organize myofils and contraction, with a hierarchy of mechanisms responsible for myofill organization, including fiber-force dependence and parallel coupling of fibers.
The symbiotic bacterium Wolbachia is being trialled as a biocontrol agent to reduce dengue transmission and can invade and spread to infect wild mosquito populations with high maternal transmission, strong cytoplasmic incompatibility, and low host fitness costs. Researchers examined the wMel Wolbach strain in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with a Brazilian background and found it causes strong cytoplasm incompatibility, high transmission, and no effect on fecundity or fertility. Mark-release experiments in Rio de Janeiro characterized mosquito populations in relation to socio-demographic conditions and constructed mathematical models to describe the influence of urban conditions on Wolia infection frequency. Results predict successful invasion at five sites but varying conditions influenced by local mosquito population size. The wMel strain possesses characteristics to spread in different urban environments, including Eliminate Dengue Program release sites. Strong cytoplasm incompatibility and no fecundity decrease promote invasion and daily survival differs at sites with better-developed areas less hospitable. Characterizing field sites prior to release determines optimal strategy and results provide a framework for w-infected Ae aegypti releases. Field sites in Rio support varying mosquito populations affecting Wolia dynamics but inter-site differences do not impede invasion. Local mosquito abundance is the key factor influencing spread and releasing Wolia-infected mosquitoes in higher numbers is necessary at larger wildtype populations.
Researchers have identified a Jmj domain-containing protein, JMJ703, as a histone lysine demethylase that specifically reverses all three forms of histone H3 lysine 4 methylation in rice. Loss-of-function mutation of the gene affected stem elongation and plant growth, which may be related to increased expression of cytokinin oxidase genes in the mutant. The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of the protein revealed a general similarity with mammalian and yeast JMJD proteins, but with specific features including key residues that interact with cofactors and the methylated H3K substrate essential for demethyl activity. These residues are conserved in known H3K demethylases, suggesting involvement in specificity for H3 demylation. J703 is essential for plant cell division and stem elongation, demethylating mono, di, and trimethyl H3K in vivo and vitro, implying importance for gene expression. The phenotype caused by T-DNA insertion and RNAi and increased expression of CK genes suggest J703 regulates hormone metabolism in rice, differing from J14 that functions in floral transition, DNA methylation, and silencing in Arabidopsis. J703 displays an overall similar structure to JM2 H9 and H36 demethylases but exhibits conserved features within JID and plant H3 demethylases.
Researchers have identified a shared interface on the HIV-1 capsid where host cofactors and pharmacologic ligands bind, which is lost when the capsid disassembles into monomers. The interface, formed exclusively within hexamers, mediates binding to linear epitopes of cellular cofactors NUP153 and CPSF, and is competed by antiretroviral compounds PF74 and BI-2. Each ligand binds via a phenylalanine-glycine motif to a pocket within the N-terminal domain of one monomer, with BI-2 also interacting across the N-terminal-C-terminal domain interface to a second monomer. Dissociation of hexamer into monomers prevents high-affinity interaction with CPSF and PF74 and abolishes binding to NUP. The interface is conformationally dynamic, accommodating NUP or CPSF peptides in one conformation. N153 and CPSF have overlapping sites but unique interactions, with mutations perturbing cofactor dependency. Crystal structures of assembled HIV-CA hexamers with NUP, CPSF, PF74, and BI-2 reveal a larger protein-protein interface with common and ligand-specific contacts. NUP, CPSF, and PF utilize distinct residues within the site, providing a basis for associations with capsid and effects on HIV-1 infection. Mutations may affect capsid stability, cofactor binding, or interactions with unidentified cofactors. The antiviral PF74, CPS, and NUP bind an interface including helices 8 and 9, previously shown to be flexible in capsid structures and NMR studies.
The Aedes aegypti, a primary vector of diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, and chikunya viruses, has a large and complex genome with many repetitive sequences, resulting in a poorly assembled genome with 4,758 scaffolds, few assigned to chromosomes. To improve this, researchers used SNPs from recombinant progeny of two Ae. aegypti strains to generate a genetic map, revealing high misassemblies where sequences from different chromosomes were on the same scaffold. After correction, 60% of the genome was assigned to chromosomes and scaffolds ordered. Large regions of suppressed recombination were found around centromeres, extending up to 47% of the chromosome. The new assembly was used to map a gene making Ae. aegypt resistant to Brugia malayi and identify candidate genes affecting the trait. At 1.38 Gigabases, the Ae. aegypt genome is the largest among sequenced mosquito genomes, previously organized into 4,758 scaffolds with 31% preliminarily assigned to chromosomes. Synteny between Ae. aegypt and An. gambiae chromosomal arms helped correct the assembly. The new chromosomal scaffolds mapped Ae. aegpti resistance to the filarial nematode B. The assembly facilitates mapping genes affecting disease transmission, demonstrated by re-mapping susceptibility to B. malayi.
A multicentric entomological survey was conducted in five mid-sized cities with varying tropical climates to compare the effectiveness of four traps, including BG-Sentinel, Adtrap, MosquiTRAP, and ovitraps, with traditional household larval surveys in detecting Aedes aegypti mosquito density. The study found that trap positivity and density indices were more sensitive in detecting mosquito presence than the House Index, which was consistently low in most cities. All traps performed better than the House Index in measuring seasonal variation in mosquito abundance and should be considered complements or alternatives to larval surveys. Mosquito seasonality was associated with temperature rather than precipitation, even in areas with small temperature variation. The traps were capable of detecting large mosquito variations throughout the year consistently. Household surveys are necessary for identifying breeding sites, while traps are useful for monitoring adult infestation and control impact. Used together, they optimize surveillance and control. The results support the development of trap-based surveillance programs in dengue endemic countries, suggesting all traps are valuable tools that could be used in combination with vector control strategies to improve response to deng and other diseases transmitted by Aedes aegypti.
The human cytidine deaminase APOBEC3 (A3) is a potent inhibitor of retroviruses and transposable elements, able to deaminate cytidines to uridines in single-stranded DNA intermediates. Research has identified residues within A3 that mediate oligomerization of the protein, specifically tyrosine-124 and tryptophan within the enzymatically inactive N-terminal CDA domain, which coincides with packaging into HIV-1 virions. A3 oligomerization is also shown to be RNA-dependent, with homology modeling indicating an accumulation of positive charge in a pocket formed by a putative dimer interface. Substitution of arginine residues at positions 24, 30, and 136 within this pocket resulted in reduced virus inhibition, virion packaging, and oligomerization. The oligomer-deficient A3 proteins associated less efficiently with several cellular RNA molecules, suggesting occupation of the positively charged pocket by RNA promotes A3 oligization, packaging into virions, and antiviral function. Hydrophobic residues in A3, equivalent to those that mediate A2 oligization, are required for RNA-dependent oligization, packaging into HIV-1 virions, and inhibition of HIV-1 infection. The structure of A3 is of interest regarding the binding of the HIV-1 Vif protein and efforts to manipulate this interaction therapeutically, with evidence presented for RNA-dependent oligomerization of A3 via its NDA domain.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of quantitative trait variation in Drosophila melanaster, focusing on the bric-a-brac locus, which affects cuticular pigmentation. They sequenced the 148 kb bric-brac genomic region from 94 inbred lines and found that natural alleles with large effects on pigmentation reflect a cumulative impact of polymorphisms in three functional regions: a promoter, tissue-specific enhancer, and Polycomb response element. Analysis of allele-specific expression confirmed these polymorphisms modulate transcription at the cis-regulatory level. The results show a single quantitative trait locus can act through multiple molecular mechanisms and sequence variation in flanking functional elements can have significant effects on transcriptional activity and phenotype. Multiple polymorphisms in a single regulatory element contribute to pigmentation differences between populations, suggesting accumulation of mutations at the same locus may be a common mechanism of micro and macroevolutionary change. The study found 107 SNPs associated with phenic variation, polarized using the genome of D. simulans, and identified derived alleles associated with darker phenotypes. The findings have implications for understanding the identity, distribution, and nature of nucleotide polymorphisms making up quantitative trait loci and highlight the complexity of genetic variation underlying phenotypic differences. The bric-brac locus, composed of anciently duplicated paralogs bab1 and bab2, is involved in patterning the adult abdomen, legs, and ovaries, with Bab expression in pupal epidermis responsible for sex-specific pigmentation of adult cuticle, and evolutionary changes in regulation contributing to macroevary diversification of Drosila color patterns.
Streptococcus pneumoniae remains a persistent cause of invasive and mucosal disease in humans due to its capacity for adaptation through uptake and incorporation of new genetic material from the surrounding microbial community. The competence system, controlled by a quorum sensing triggered by extracellular accumulation of competence stimulating peptide (CSP), regulates DNA uptake and recombination. This study demonstrates that SP stimulates production of diverse bacteriocins through increased production and secretion of bacteriocin pherone BlpC, requiring a functional competence regulatory system. A conserved motif in the Blp operon promoter mediates upregulation by SP, resulting in augmented activation of the Blp locus. Biofilm-grown organisms show DNA exchange is enhanced by bacterin secretion, suggesting co-stimulation of bacterins with competence provides an adaptive advantage. The Blp and com pathways diverged and specialized in a remote pneumococcus ancestor but maintained a regulatory connection promoting competition and adaptation by targeting a wide array of competitors while providing means for DNA incorporation. Bacterin expression increases transformation efficiency in dual culture biofilms, with liberation of DNA through pneumin predation contributing to pathogen adaptability. Neighboring pneumoccal strains likely communicate through shared induction of competence, producing fratric immunity, while the Blp locus is characterized by diversity in signaling peptides and effector proteins, limiting DNA exchange between co-colonizing strains.
Poliovirus infection triggers the relocalization of cellular protein SR20 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected neuroblastoma cells, where it partially co-localizes with protein PCBP. The interaction between SR20 and PCBP plays a crucial role in recruiting ribosomes to the viral RNA for translation initiation. SR20 associates with PCBP bound to poliovirus RNA, indicating this interaction occurs on the viral RNA. A mutated version of SR20 lacking the RNA recognition motif, SR20ΔM, localizes similarly to full-length SR20, co-localizes with PCBP, but results in a 100-fold decrease in virus yield when expressed, suggesting a dominant negative effect. The co-sedimentation of SR20 and PCBP with 40S ribosomal subunits in infected cells supports their role in translation complex formation for poliovirus IRES translation. These findings suggest a model where PCBP, bound to viral RNA, interacts with SR20 to recruit the translation complex. The localization of SR20 to the cytoplasm during infection allows its availability for poliov translation. The study provides evidence for SR proteins linking nuclear splicing and export with translation and their role in cap-dependent and viral RNA translation. The interaction between SR20 and PCBP on poliov RNA functions to recruit translation machinery for IRES-mediated initiation. The significance of SR20 for poliov infection is underscored by decreased virus yield when SR20 lacks functional domains. This work provides insights into ribosome recruitment mechanisms for picornavirus IRES translation and the role of non-canonical factors bridging translation to RNA.
Researchers utilized a whole-genome N-ethyl-Nitrosourea mutagenesis screen to identify genetic pathways regulating neural crest development, using a mouse model sensitized for neural crest defects, Sox10Lac/+. Out of 71 pedigrees analyzed, four heritable loci, modifier of Sox10 pattern 1-4, showed altered neural crest patterning. The m1 mutation resulted in the absence of Sox10Lac expression in cranial ganglia, cranial nerves, and sympathetic chain. Linkage analysis confirmed m1 is a new allele of the receptor tyrosine kinase Erbb3, carrying a single amino acid substitution in the extracellular region. The mutation impairs ERBB signaling, causing embryonic defects resembling Erbb null alleles. Biochemical analysis showed ERBB is expressed on the cell surface but ligand-induced phosphorylation is reduced. The study highlights the importance of the mutated residue for ERBB function and the utility of ENU mutagenesis in identifying pathways regulating neural crest development. The neural crest gives rise to various cell types, including glia, neurons, and melanocytes, and mutations lead to neurocristopathies. Sox10, a transcription factor, plays a crucial role in neural crest development, with expression initiated in stem cells emerging from the neural tube and maintained in melanocyte and glial lineages. The findings contribute to understanding gene function in cellular and developmental settings.
A study investigated factors influencing Schistosoma mansoni infection in a rural Ugandan fishing community, examining the impact of age, sex, and ethnicity on susceptibility to reinfection after anti-helminthic treatment. Individual cercarial exposure estimates and multivariable methods were used to account for environmental and behavioral heterogeneities. Results showed ethnic and sex-related variations in S. mansoni reinfection were due to variations in cercarial exposure, not biological differences in susceptibility. Age-related differences in infection were not explained by exposure, but linked to the balance of IgE and IgG4 to the tegal antigen SmAL1, which was related to resistance to reinfection. The study utilized data from a multidisciplinary reinfection study in a Ugandan community highly endemic for schistosiasis, using individual-level cercarial scores to adjust for variations in exposure. Age-infection profiles were typical of schistosiasis-endemic communities, with infection greatest in children and lower in adults. Schistosome-specific IgE immune responses were found to account for variations in susceptibility to reinfection. The study highlights the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in understanding population ecology and making robust conclusions. The findings are consistent with other studies identifying genes associated with relative susceptibility or immunity to infection and the value of deriving exposure indices to accurately reflect exposure.
A study investigated the correlation between fecal egg counts and worm burden in human clonorchiasis, a parasitic infection caused by Clonorchis sinensis. Sixty residents in Sancheong, Korea, 50 egg-positive and 10 egg-negative, participated in a worm collection trial from 2006-2009. Egg positivity was diagnosed using the Kato-Katz method, and after praziquantel administration, adult worms were collected from feces. Fecal egg counts ranged from 0 to 65,544, and adult worms were collected from 17 egg-positive cases, with 1-114 worms per individual. A positive correlation between egg counts and worm numbers was found, with worm recovery rates of 9.7% in low egg counts and 73.7% in high counts. No worms were detected in egg-negative subjects. The maximum egg count per worm per day was estimated at 3,770 in a subject with 2,664 eggs and 106 worms. The results show a significant correlation between worm numbers and egg counts, estimating at least 110 worms in a human with 3,000 egg counts and 4,000 egg productivity per worm per day. The study confirms the use of fecal egg counts as a reliable method to estimate worm burden in human clonorchis.
Researchers have developed a novel approach to combat antifungal drug resistance by harnessing synthetic lethal interactions in a model organism. An unbiased genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing Candida glata PDR1 gain-of-function allele identified eighteen synthetically lethal mutants, including histone acetyltransferase Gcn5. Deletion or inhibition of Gcn5 caused a lethal phenotype in C. glata cells expressing PDR+ alleles and inhibited the emergence of fluconazole-resistant C. glata isolates in evolution experiments. The synthetic interaction was conserved in C. glata, where loss of G5 function was lethal in cells expressing the P1L280 fluazole-resistant allele. Chemically inhibiting G5 prevented growth of C. glata strains harbouring P1 mutations. The study demonstrates targeting G5, a synthetically interacting partner of P1L280, renders both species inviable, supporting the proposition that targeting synthetic interactions offers a new paradigm for treatment of drug-resistant infections. C. glata Δg5 mutants in the presence of fluconazole inhibits the emergence of gain function mutations in P1. The identification of synthetic genetic interactions with alleles conferring antifungal resistance is valuable to identify pathways that could be targeted to prevent resistance. Addition of 2M γ-butyrolactone, a G5 inhibitor, prevented growth of C glata strains expressing P1L280. The findings provide proof of concept that synthetically lethal screens can identify candidate proteins for therapeutic targeting to treat drug-resistant infections, offering a new approach to combat antifungal resistance.
Poliovirus infection induces the formation of distinct membranous structures, including tubules and vesicular clusters, which are suggested to serve as separate organelles for genome replication and virus assembly. Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) is induced early in infection and localizes to these structures, with changes in the PIP pool observed as early as 30 minutes post-infection. PIP remodeling occurs even in the presence of replication inhibitors and is accompanied by formation of membrane tubules throughout the cytoplasm. Vesicular clusters appear in the perinuclear region at 3 hours post-infection, too late to be responsible for genome replication. Mutants with aberrant proteolytic processing of the P3 precursor exhibit delays in genome replication and impaired virus assembly, consistent with PIP serving as a marker of genome-replication organel. The inability of one mutant to convert virus-induced tubules into vesicular clusters may explain reduced infectious virus production. Results suggest temporally distinct membranous structures for replication and assembly, with the pace and efficiency of replication-to-assembly conversion set by the rate of P3 polyprotein processing and capacity to yield 3AB and/or 3CD proteins.
Researchers employed a multi-step strategy combining ligand and target-based virtual screening to identify non-peptidic cruzain inhibitors with trypanidal activity, selecting 23 compounds from the ZINC database. Twelve non-covalent binding cruzain inhibitors with affinity values in the low micromolar range were identified, acting through a competitive mechanism confirmed by X-ray crystallographic studies. Cruzain, a therapeutic target for Chagas disease, shares similarity with mammalian homolog cathepsin, and inhibitors were assayed against it, yielding poor selectivity but potential for investigating effects on cell proliferation. The most potent cruz inhibitors were assayed against T. cruzi-infected cells, with two showing tryocidal activity. A structure-activity relationship study established the 2-acamidothiophene-3-carbox group as essential for enzyme and parasite activities. Compound Nequ42 had an IC50 value of 10.6 ± 0.1 µM against the trypomastote form of the Tulahuen lac strain, lower than benznidazole. A smaller compound, Nequ176, was identified as a novel nonpept, noncoval cruz inhibitor with lig efficiency of 0.33 kcal−1mol−1. Five cruz inhibitors showed tryocidal activity against the trypastigote infective form, and a newly identified fragment may advance the search for noncoval cruz inhibitors. Chagas disease is a neglected trypanosomias with significant social and economic impact in Latin America, and developing new effective drugs is crucial, with cruzain as a promising target.
Researchers have developed two non-viral DNA-based vaccine formulations against yellow fever, encoding the full-length envelope protein (p/YFE) or the full-length protein fused to lysosomal-associated membrane signal LAMP-1 (pLFE), to divert antigen presentation through major histocompatibility complex II compartments. The formulations were evaluated in H2 and H2 backgrounds, corresponding to C57/BL/6 and BALB/c mice strains. Both constructs induced strong T-cell responses against epitopes generated by the YF17 vaccine, with pFE performing best. Additionally, pFE stimulated high titers of anti-yellow fever neutralizing antibodies comparable to the 17DD vaccine. The pFE vaccine conferred 100% protection against yellow fever in intracerebrally challenged mice, indicating it is an excellent candidate for further studies. Immunization of C57/6 mice with DNA expressing the whole protein resulted in recognition of extra peptides not produced by the Y17 vaccine. The T-cell response against peptide E169-183 generated by pFE and pFE was significant, and responses to peptides E413-427 and E417 were higher in mice immunized with pFE. Both DNA constructs protected mice against lethal challenge, although Y17 vaccine produced higher neutralizing titers. The study expanded C57/6 epitope mapping for the envelope of the yellow fever virus.
The nucleoid occlusion protein SlmA is a direct transcriptional activator of chitio utilization in Vibrio cholera. Chitin utilization by Vibrio cholera is required for its persistence and evolution in the marine environment, with genes involved in chitin uptake and catabolism encoded by the chb operon. The sensor kinase ChiS regulates this locus, but the mechanisms of its activation are poorly understood. An unbiased transposon mutant screen identified SlmA as a regulator of the chb operon, which binds directly to the chb promoter and is required for transcriptional activation and chobio utilization. SlmA is a member of the TetR family, generally transcriptional repressors, but here acts as a transcriptional activator. DNA-binding, not nucleoid occlusion, is critical for transcription activation. This study identifies a novel role for SlmA in Vibrio cholera, in addition to its established role as a cell division factor. Vibrio-chitin interactions are important for persistence, transmission, and evolution of this human pathogen in its reservoir. Expression of genes for chitin degradation, uptake, and utilization are regulated by ChiS, repressed by chitin binding protein. SlmA's effect on gene regulation at Pch was only uncovered by deletion of cb or growth on chitin, suggesting additional cues may be required to uncover its role at other loci. SlmA is conserved between E. coli and Vibrio, with 67% identity and 83% similarity, and its function primarily characterized in E. coli. The exact mechanism of SlmA activation is unclear, but it does not phenocopy Chi mutant, which is unable to grow on GlcNA2 as sole carbon source.
A nonlinear programming framework is presented for scalable solution of parameter estimation problems in dynamic biological systems, which are computationally challenging due to nonlinear and stiff differential equations and multiple experimental data and parameters. The framework uses cutting-edge tools, efficient, robust, and easy-to-use, with a time discretization approach that avoids repetitive simulations, enables algebraic model and derivative computation, and utilizes nonlinear interior point solvers. It solves estimation problems for human gut microbiome models with 156 parameters, 144 equations, and 1,704 data points in under 3 minutes, outperforming off-shelf simulation-based solutions. Large instances with 2,352 parameters, 2,304 equations, and 20,352 data are solved in under 15 minutes. The framework is flexible, applicable to dynamic models, enabling estimation techniques for uncertainty, observability, model selection, and outlier handling. Dynamic modeling is essential for understanding biological systems, including microbial communities, gene networks, and pathways, with parameter estimation a key task for validation against experimental data. Challenges arise from dimension, nonlinearity, stiffness, incomplete observation, multiple parameters, and data, addressed by the proposed framework, enabling kinetic modeling of complex systems and high-fidelity models of whole-cells or microbiomes.
Researchers utilized the nCounter high-throughput digital gene expression system to investigate the inflammatory response to West Nile virus (WNV) infection in the Swiss Webster mouse model. The nCounter Mouse Inflammation expression kit analyzed 179 inflammation-related genes in multiple tissues over a nine-day infection course following intraperitoneal injection with NV. Expression analysis of spleen, lung, liver, and brain revealed differential expression of Cx10 and Il12 in all tissues except kidney. Stratification of infected and non-infected tissues differentiated systemic and tissue-specific responses. Significant changes included decreased C3 in noninfected spleen, upregulated Il23 and downregulated Il10 in noninfected lung, and downregulated Il3 and M2 in noninfected liver. Infected livers showed upregulation of Stat1, Tlr, chemokines, and cytokines. Noninfected brain showed upregulation of Csf and Cx10. Similar gene and protein kinetics correlated with viral presence. The study demonstrated the utility of the nCounter platform for rapid identification of gene expression changes associated with NV infection, enabling differentiation between general and specific responses in infected and noninfected tissues. High-throughput analysis validated gene expression and protein kinetics, providing insight into immune responses elicited by infection and viral replication kinetics. The study successfully analyzed dynamic expression profiles of inflammatory response over the course of NV infection in outbred mice.
An outbreak of rabies in Maputo and Matola cities, Mozambique in 2014 prompted an investigation into the epidemiology, clinical features, and risk factors of human rabies and animal bites. Fourteen cases of human rabies were detected, all with a history of dog bites, and only one of the rabid dogs was immunized. 819 animal bites were registered, with 97.8% caused by dogs, but only 27% were immunized. Factors associated with human rabies included age <15 years, bites by stray dogs, deep wounds, bites to the head, bites by unimmunized dogs, no use of soap and water, and no post-exposure prophylaxis. Implementation of control measures for rabies is poor in Maputo and Matola, with cases strongly associated with bites by stray and unvaccinated dogs and irregular post-exposure measures. The study aimed to determine clinical and epidemiological features of human cases, risk for developing rabies, and epidemiological features of animal bites to formulate recommendations for rabies control in Mozambique. Lack of reliable data on burden and risk factors hinders policy formulation and investment in control measures, with Mozambique ranking high in rabies burden in sub-Saharan Africa.
Researchers identified a new febrile seizure gene, SCN9, encoding Nav1.7, in a large Utah family with significant linkage to chromosome 2q24. A mutation in a highly conserved amino acid, p.N641, in the cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane domains I and II, was found in 21 affected members but absent in 586 ethnically matched controls. Functional analysis using murine Scn9 orthologs showed homozygous Scn9aN641/N641 knockin mice had reduced thresholds to electrically induced clonic and tonic-clonic seizures and increased corneal kindling rates, supporting SCN9 p.N641 as disease-causing. Further analysis of 92 unrelated patients with febrile seizures identified Nav1.7 missense variants in 5% of patients. One patient developed Dravet syndrome and had a heterozygous frameshift mutation in SCN1. Analysis of 109 Drav syndrome patients yielded Nav1.7 missense variants in 8% of patients, often with SCN1 mutations. This study provides evidence for SCN9's role in human epilepsies, both as a cause of febrile seizures and partner with SCN1 mutations, associated with a wide spectrum of phenotypes including simple feile, self-limited febrile seizures, and temporal lobe epilepsy.
Researchers have developed a framework called the Growing Polarised Tissue (PT) to understand how complex tissue shapes arise through growth, focusing on combinatorial interactions between tissue polarity and growth. The PT framework treats tissue as a continuous material where regionally expressed genetic factors interact and propagate, with polarity established by signals anchored in regions under genetic control. Growth rates parallel or perpendicular to local polarity are specified through a regulatory network, influenced by mechanically connected tissue constraints, leading to emergent features like curvature. Resultant growth influences spatial arrangements and orientations, allowing complex shapes to emerge from simple rules. Asymmetries arise through interactions between polarity fields. The framework is applied to a growing Snapdragon flower, illustrating its value in understanding morphogenesis, with hypotheses testable by simulation. Combinatorial interactions between orientations and growth rates, a feature of polarity-based systems, are proposed to have been exploited during evolution to generate a range of biological shapes. The study explores interactions between tissue polarity and differential growth through models, highlighting specifying orientation independently of stresses in generating complex shapes. The polarity-based system accounts for global changes, growth patterns, and clones without invoking large numbers of organisers, demonstrating flexibility in controlling growth orientations.
Researchers investigated the consequences of interference between multiple CD8+ T cell escape mutations in early HIV infection, where multiple responses are elicited simultaneously, exerting selective pressure on the virus's genome and selecting for beneficial mutations. The study found that interference between equally advantageous mutations can generate the observed pattern of decreasing escape rate, and the number of loci and recombination rates substantially affect this pattern. The observed pattern can be explained by the exponential decline of escape rates over time. Results show that the pattern in HIV-infected individuals is consistent with both independent and interference effects, confirming that interference should be considered when analyzing escape mutations. Interference effects pose challenges in estimating escape rates and mutation-associated coefficients, which cannot be overcome by improved sampling sizes due to shortcomings in current estimation techniques. Novel methodologies based on strain analysis rather than frequencies are needed to account for stochastic competition between mutations. The study utilized a multilocus Wright-Fisher model of HIV dynamics with selection, mutation, and recombination, and an interference-free model assuming neutral evolution before immune response, finding that interference between concurrent mutations affects escape rates in systems with multiple epitopes.
Researchers developed a mechanistic model to estimate the in vivo antitumor efficacy of cisplatin-based doublet therapy in non-small cell lung cancer. The model incorporates cancer mechanisms such as uncontrolled proliferation, population heterogeneity, hypoxia, and treatment resistance, and takes into account tumor microenvironment and cell repopulation effects on treatment outcome. A sensitivity analysis identified volume growth rate and growth fraction at diagnosis as key features for accurate estimates. The model was applied to 13 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received cisplatin with gemcitabine, vinlb, or docetax in the neoadjuvant context, with input values guided by a literature survey on cancer-specific kinetics. The results provide a quantitative framework for estimating the in-vivo cell-killing ability of chemotherapies, which could serve as a basis for personalized predictions when correlated with patient molecular profiles. Tumor volumetric data at two time points, before and after treatment, were used to estimate cell killing efficacy, expressed as the sum of cell kill rates of the two drugs. The model was adapted to 13 clinical cases to determine input parameters corresponding to each case and estimate cell killing efficacy of cisplatin doublet regimens, including cisplatin plus gemcitine, cispl plus docax, and cispl vinlb.
Bacterial biofilms exhibit high levels of antibiotic tolerance, but the molecular mechanisms leading to this tolerance are poorly understood. Researchers used random transposon mutagenesis to identify biofilm-specific mutants in Escherichia coli and found that starved biofilms showed greater tolerance to fluoroquinone ofloxacin than planktonic counterparts. The tolerance was dependent on a functional SOS response upon starvation of amino acids and carbon, and partially dependent on stringent response upon leucine starvation. However, it did not involve SOS-induced toxin-antitoxin systems associated with persister formation. The tolerance increased with biofilm age and was dependent on the SOS response. Biofilm heterogeneity creates specialized niches where bacteria respond to local cues, leading to genetically and metabolically distinct subpopulations exhibiting high tolerance to extracellular stresses. Amino acid auxotroph mutants displayed high antibiotic tolerance and amino starvation increased tolerance in biofilm bacteria. The SOS stress response in heterogeneous and nutrient-deprived biofilm microenvironments is a mechanism leading to biofilm-specific tolerance to fluoroquinone ofloxacin. Carbon starvation also mediates ofloxacin tolerance in biofilm and the SOS appears necessary for ofloxacin tolerance upon amino and carbon starvation.
Plasmodium falciparum malaria pathogenesis is attributed to parasite-infected erythrocytes, with invasion of erythrocytes by P. falciparum meroites requiring specific interactions between host receptors and parasite ligands localized in apical organelles called micronemes. cAMP plays a key role in regulating timely secretion of microneme proteins, enabling receptor engagement and invasion. Exposure of meroites to a low K+ environment activates bicarbonate-sensitive cytoplasmic adenyl cyclase, raising cytosolic cAMP and activating protein kinase A, which regulates microneme secretion. cAMP also regulates meroite cytosolic Ca2 levels via an Epac pathway, with increases in both cAMP and Ca essential for microneme secretion. The identification of cAMP-dependent pathways regulating microneme secretion provides novel targets to inhibit blood stage parasite growth and prevent malaria. Invasion of erythrocytes by P. falcumeroites is a complex, multi-step process mediated by molecular interactions between red cell receptors and parasite ligands, with timely secretion of parasite ligands critical for successful invasion. The bicarbonate-sensitive cyasm adeny cyclase Pfβ and protein kinase A are involved in signaling pathways controlling microneme secretion. Alternative mechanisms, including other members of the PfRH family, may also mediate cytos Ca and microneme release. Understanding cAMP signaling pathways regulating microneme secretion is crucial for developing strategies to prevent malaria.
Strongyloides stercoralis, a soil-transmitted threadworm, is a neglected tropical disease with a global distribution, excluding the far north and south. A review of 354 studies from 78 countries found high infection rates in general populations and risk groups. Bayesian meta-analysis showed associations between HIV infection, alcoholism, and S. stercis infection, with odds ratios of 2.17 and 6.69, respectively. Infection rates are prominent in African, Asian, and South-American resource-poor countries, but information is lacking. Community-based studies comprised 62.4%, hospital-based 34.2%, and refugee/immigrant studies 11% of the total. Strongyloidiasis remains an issue in developed countries for immigrants, tourists, and military returning from endemic areas, necessitating systematic screening before immunosuppressive treatment. Prevalence data is patchy, while incidence data is virtually nonexistent. Further assessments in socio-economic and ecological settings and integration into global helmin control are warranted. Large-scale surveys using sensitive methods are needed to narrow the knowledge gap. The review highlights the need for adequate information on S. stercis infection, underscoring it should not be neglected, with implications for medical services in developed countries and global helmin control.
Stochastic noise at the cellular level plays a fundamental role in circadian oscillations, influencing how groups of cells entrain to external cues and serving as a mechanism by which cell-autonomous rhythms are generated. This study demonstrates that the damping rate of population-level bioluminescence recordings can serve as an accurate measure of overall noise and can be applied to high-throughput circadian screens. Using fibroblast data, higher noise at the single-cell level results in faster damping at the population level. The damping rate of cultured cells can be changed in a dose-dependent fashion by small molecule modulators, explained by single-cell noise using a mathematical model. Applying the method to a genome-wide siRNA screen reveals stochastic noise is altered from period and amplitude. The unperturbed clock is highly optimized for robust rhythms, with few gene perturbations capable of increasing amplitude and lowering noise. Changes to noise can be reliably inferred from population-level bioluminescence recordings of circadian reporters, assuming oscillations in cells are synchronized. Transcription at the single level is affected by intrinsic noise due to low molecular counts of mRNA and protein, resulting in stochastic bioluminescence with variability. Population damping is proportional to single noise, explained by desynchronization due to noise. A computational model predicts changes in damping from small molecules, demonstrating changes to intrinsic noise explain observed rate changes, allowing estimation of stochastic noise from population-level bioluminescence recordings.
The rise of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria necessitates new approaches to drug development, with the bacterial cytoskeletal protein FtsZ emerging as a promising target. Recent work on the allosteric inhibitor PC190 revealed in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus FZ and in vivo antimicrobial activities, but its mechanism and effect on FZ in other species are unclear. Analysis of the PC190 binding pocket using PocketFEATURE, a method scoring similarity between small-molecule sites based on 3D structure and molecular dynamics, showed species and nucleotide state significantly impact binding site properties, with disparate environments for non-Staphylococcus species. Simulations of S aureus FZ bound to GTP with PC190 resistance mutations indicated PC190 prefers Staphylococcus FZ in the nucleotide-bound state. Fts dimer simulations suggested polymerization enhances PC190 binding. Results demonstrate the drug pocket varies across species, genetic perturbations, and polymer states, yielding information for FZ inhibitor development. PocketFEATURE illuminated molecular properties governing drug-protein interactions, predicting PC190 affinity for Staphylococcus FZ but not other species, with implications for therapeutic development. The algorithm distinguished aspects of Fts structures from different species and evaluated resistant mutants, aiding design of alternative mutants with equivalent features.
Researchers have determined the crystal structure of the N-terminal and catalytic domains of HIV-2 integrase in complex with the binding domain of lens epithelium-derived growth factor, revealing charge-charge interactions between the two. A constellation of acidic residues on the N-terminal domain is characteristic of lentiviruses and mutations of positively charged residues on the binding domain affect interaction with lentiviruses. The novel contacts are critical for stimulation of lentiviral DNA integration and function during early HIV-1 replication. The structural details enabled engineering of an HIV-1 mutant that functions only with a complementary lens epithelium-derived factor mutant. The findings provide a basis for high-affinity lentiviral interaction and development of targeting technologies for gene therapy. Lens epithel-derived factor associates with chromatin, regulates gene expression, epigenetic modifications, and apoptosis, and tethers lentiviral integrase to chromatin in the nucleus, directing integration to active genes. Mutations in the N-terminal or zinc coordination reduce interaction with lensel-derived factor, while a homolog hepatoma-derived factor interacts with HIV-1 but its role in lentiral integration remains unclear. Lentiviral integration depends on lens-derived factor, which stimulates strand activity and directs preintegration complexes to active genes.
Researchers investigated the evolution and phenotypic selection of cancer cells, focusing on the role of cell-intrinsic kinetics in determining tumor progression. Cancer cells inherit kinetics from their cells of origin, which can change due to genetic and epigenetic alterations, with favorable changes increasing cellular fitness and accelerating tumor growth. A cellular automaton model was developed to track the evolution of malignant subpopulations of cancer stem cells, exploring traits including migration, cell death, symmetric division, and telomere length. The study found that proliferation potential is the strongest modulator of tumor growth, with early increases yielding larger populations of non-stem cells competing with cancer stem cells and inhibiting division. Reduction in proliferation loosens this inhibition, facilitating cancer stem cell division. The subpopulation of cancer stem cells becomes highly heterogeneous, dictating population dynamics varying from dormancy to progression. Clonal diversity in single tumor samples represents a small proportion of total phenotypes. Orthogonal traits explored include cell migration, spontaneous death, symmetric division, and telere length as mitotic counter for non-stem cell proliferation. Theoretical framework investigates tumor progression in response to cancer cell evolution, identifying cell kinetics including migration, proliferation, death, and division, with increased migration and division leading to accelerated growth. Evolutionary phenic heterogeneity leads to unpredictable distribution of cells with varying aggressiveness, with ancestral phenotypes dominating some regions and evolved clones limited to small pockets.
Researchers investigated the emergence of novel infectious diseases in humans, focusing on the role of spatial heterogeneity within the population and adaptation for sustained human-to-human transmission. Using mathematical models, they derived expressions for the probability of emergence and waiting time to a successful event, as well as the distribution of outbreak sizes. Analytical results showed that for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has a weak effect on outbreak distributions and risk of emergence. Empirical data on commuting patterns indicated most communities are well-interconnected, suggesting effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely dominated by evolutionary biology of host adaptation. Spatial heterogeneity has limited impact on probability of emergence and outbreak size, with only remote communities subject to epidemiological isolation. The biology of the pathogen determines emergence and outbreak sizes according to the average reproductive number. A threshold exists where spatial heterogeneity does not matter, influenced by interconnectivity allowing the pathogen to spread between communities. The study provides new insights into epidemiological parameters of novel diseases adapting to humans, exploring spatial contact structure and validating results with stochastic simulations of village-city models, offering implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections.
Researchers analyzed genomic data from 287 avian influenza A virus samples collected over 34 years from North American migratory birds to understand viral migration patterns and genetic reassortment. Results showed that despite high prevalence of infected Charadriiformes in Delaware Bay, this population does not significantly contribute to North American AIV diversity in Anseres. In contrast, influenza viruses from Anseres in Alberta represent AIV diversity in American Anseres. Long-term analysis revealed that AIV persistence is independent of migratory flyways with gene flow between populations throughout North America. Annual surveillance in Alberta and Delaware yielded 287 sequenced genomes, characterizing reassort dynamics, spatial patterns, and evolutionary genomics of influenza viruses. The study identified 20 discrete regions where influenza has been collected from wild birds, determining population structure according to migratory flyways and gene flow rates. Alberta's convergence of four migratory flyways captures the majority of genetic diversity of the North influenza pool, with breeding birds facilitating spread and generation of virus diversity. Delaware Bay is a hotspot for avian A, but does not significantly contribute to North AIV diversity. Long-term persistence of AIV is independent of migratory flyways, with strong support for lateral diffusion of viral lineages between populations, providing insights for predictive models for pandemic preparedness and livestock protection.
Researchers have generated a novel monoclonal antibody, MAb S1391, which exhibits heterosubtypic cross-reactive neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition of influenza A viruses. MAb S1391 shows broad reactivity to multiple subtypes, including H1, H2, H3, H5, H9, and H13, in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and neutralizes particular strains of H1, H2, and H3 subtypes. Mutant viruses that escaped neutralization by MAb1391 revealed amino acid substitutions at positions 156, 158, and 193 on the globular head of the HA, forming a novel conformational epitope adjacent to the receptor-binding domain. Passive immunization with MAb1391 provided heterosubtypic protection in mice. The study demonstrates that MAb139 binds to a common antigenic site among various HA subtypes, neutralizing viral infectivity in vitro and in vivo by affecting viral attachment. Neutralizing antibodies play a critical role in protection from influenza infection, recognizing hemagglutinin, the major surface glycoprotein with 16 antigenically distinct subtypes. MAb1391 likely neutralizes viral infectivity by blocking receptor binding, inhibiting hemagutination of viruses. The findings support the notion that cross-reactive antibodies contribute to heterosubtyp immunity against influenza and highlight the therapeutic potential of cross-reactive antibodies.
A three-year cohort study of 259 Australian Aboriginal adults in a remote community in northern Australia assessed the effect of ivermectin treatment on Strongyloides stercoralis infection prevalence. Initial prevalence was 35.3%, decreasing to 5.8% after three years, with McNar's chi2 = 56.5, p<0.001, indicating treatment efficacy. A lower ELISA threshold was used for diagnosis and found valid in this setting. Follow-up identified a small group with persistently positive serology despite treatment. Control of S. stercis appears feasible using pharmacological treatment alone, with prevalence falling to 1.4% three years post-treatment. Aboriginal communities in northern Australia have high infection rates of 30-40%. Oral ivermectin is the accepted treatment, but there's disagreement on widespread testing and elimination. The study used commercial ELISA testing for diagnosis due to logistical and sensitivity issues with parasitological studies. The aim was to evaluate case-finding and treatment controlling S. stercis, without characterizing initial symptoms or health improvements. Results suggest control of chronic S. stercis in adult populations may be achieved through case-finding and treatment with current guidelines.
Prion diseases are caused by a misfolded isoform of the prion protein PrP, with prion strains hypothesized to be encoded by strain-specific conformations of PrP. Research has shown that prion interference occurs when a long-incubation strain inhibits the conversion of a short-incation strain, influencing prion dynamics and emergence. However, it was unknown if two long-incation strains could interfere with each other. Co-infection of animals with combinations of longation strains failed to show evidence of interference, and protein misfolding cyclic amplification strain interference (PMCA) indicated both strains amplified independently, suggesting the lack of interference is inherent to the strains. PMCA reactions with longation strains contained higher levels of remaining PrP compared to shortation strains. The abundance of PrP is not limiting, resulting in prion strains with low conversion efficiency amplifying independently. Prion interference occurs when PrP is limiting, with strains competing for PrP, and overexpression leading to emergence of new strains. Interspecies transmission generates new strains, with intraspecies transmission resulting in a dominant strain, and interference between strains competing for PrP affecting this process. Findings suggest diversity in naturally-infected animals may be greater than thought, with subset of PrP convertible by both strains influencing interference, post-translational modifications, and tissue ratios of C1 and C2 fragments affecting convertible Pr and strain emergence.
Researchers have proposed a comprehensive model to compare the roles of ordered and disordered proteins in allosteric regulation, revealing that the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) pathway has a higher probability of allosteric effect than the Ensemble Allostery Model (EAM) pathway. This suggests a complicated role of intrinsically disordered proteins/regions (IDPs/IDRs) in regulatory proteins. An analytic formula for maximal allosteric response shows that too stable or unstable states are unfavorable for allostery, aiding in the design of allosteric drugs. ID/IDRs are prevalent in alloic regulation due to high alloic intensity accompanied by high probability of disordered states. The comprehensive model considers both order-disorder and order transitions, providing a full view of competition between ordered and disordered proteins in alloster effect. Results indicate the order-disorder transition is less competitive than the order transition in affording alloster effects, especially strong allost. The prevalence of ID/IDRs in alloic regulation is determined by their advantage, not just capacity to endow allost. Combining experimental data and bioinformatics can compare ordered and disordered proteins' importance in alloic regulation, but a systematic survey is needed to determine if IDPs/ID are more or less prevalent in allost than ordered proteins.
Researchers investigated the role of β-catenin in prostate development and cancer, finding it is essential for embryonic prostate growth and branching but dispensable in the adult organ. β-caten controls the number of progenitors in epithelial buds and regulates genes, including c-Myc and Nk3.1. Deletion of β-caten in a Pten model of castration-resistant prostate cancer showed it is dispensable for disease progression. Overexpression of β-caten promotes formation of squamous epithelia during development, even without androgens. β-caten overexpression with Pten loss drives invasive carcinoma with squamous metaplasia. Studies demonstrate β-caten is essential for prostate development and high levels drive squamous differentiation. β-caten overexpression promotes invasive cancer in a clinically relevant model, providing novel information on cancer pathways leading to lethal disease. Genetic studies show β-caten is required for prostatic epithelial cell proliferation and duct branching. PTEN null cancer cells have increased β-caten expression, which is suppressed upon re-expression of wild type PTEN. β-caten interacts with Pten to form invasive cancer and squamous metlas, differentiating epithelia into squamous cells in the embryo and adult, suggesting a similar role in developmental stages, highlighting the use of developmental systems to inform gene function and pathways in the adult.
Researchers conducted a study to design an appropriate consent process for a biomedical study in a low-income setting, specifically for a family-based genetic study on podoconiosis in southern Ethiopia. The qualitative study involved focus-group discussions and in-depth interviews with podoiosis patients, non-patients, community fieldworkers, NGO staff, and community leaders. Findings showed that everyday language, addressing expectations, and presentation techniques impacted comprehension of research information. Approaching patients via trusted individuals and community sensitization was considered optimal. Poverty, lack of alternative treatment, and trust in the NGO were barriers to genuine consent. The study highlighted the need for understanding the social and cultural context of the community before informed consent. Locally used terms like 'passed from parents and grandparents' and 'blood' were used to express genetic occurrence. Most participants did not favour written information sheets and consent forms. Ensuring 'kel yone siminet' or voluntariness should be part of the process as willingness to participate does not guarantee genuine consent. Researchers should approach patients through reputable intermediaries like fieldworkers. Community gatherings and group discussions are usual modes of receiving information. The purpose of research, researchers, biological samples, confidentiality, and findings were considered important in the consent process.
Researchers investigated the impact of genetics and aging on the immune system by analyzing the dynamics of T lymphocyte proliferation across differentiation in the thymus and spleen of mice. Using single-cell multicolor flow cytometry and a mathematical model based on Ordinary Differential Equations, they estimated proliferation rates and cell cycle durations in subpopulations. The model revealed T cell proliferation is highly heterogeneous with a specific signature depending on genetic origins, cell stages in thym and spleen, and altered with age. FVB mice had lower proliferation rates than C57BL6 mice in both thym and spleen. The study provided a detailed assessment of proliferation in T cell subpopulations from thym to spleen and through aging, showing genetic origin and age drive a signature of proliferation and cycle durations according to cell stage and lineage. The model estimated proliferation rates and intermitotic time with confidence intervals for G0/G1 and G2 cell cycle durations, allowing comparison of age and genetics effects on lymphocyte dynamics from early thym differentiation to spleen maturation. The results showed recent thymic emigrants in the spleen make 1-2 divisions after thym output, allowing thymic clonal expansion of positively selected cells to at least 24-25 cells per naive clone.
Researchers have generated and characterized the first pathological mitochondrial tRNA mutation in mouse cells, a G to A transition at position 373 within the mt-tRNAI anticodon loop, which recapitulates the molecular hallmarks of a disease-causing mutation in humans. This mutation leads to abnormal folding of tRNA that cannot be charged with isoleucine, resulting in exacerbated mitochondrial biogenesis triggered by increased ROS production as a compensatory response. The pathogenic mechanism, combined with the existence of a compensatory mechanism, can explain the penetrance pattern of this mutation, allowing a scenario for evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs where fixation of two deleterious alleles can proceed in steps. Thirteen mutations affecting mt-ti gene have been reported in humans, and cells harboring mutant mtDNA show higher ROS production, leading to a compensatory response to respiration deficiency by enhancing biogenesis. This response partially compensates the deficiency, demonstrating the implication of ROS-mediated biogenesis in expression of mitochondrial tRNA mutations found in patients. The study highlights the different nature of mutations affecting protein-coding genes versus tRNA genes, with consequences for understanding pathology and evolution of mitochondrial tRNAs, generating an epist-like effect where partial suppression of deleterious mutations in tRNAs is exerted.
Researchers investigated dosage regulation of the active X chromosome in human triploid cells, where dosage compensation is achieved by doubling X-linked gene expression in both sexes and X-inactivation in females. Expression arrays compared X-linked and autosomal gene expression in triploid cells, showing an average X:autosome ratio of 1 in normal diploid cells, 0.81-0.84 in triploid cells with one X and 1.32-1.4 in triploid with two X. X-linked expression in triploid cells does not strictly respond to autosomal factor nor achieve perfect balance. Absolute autosomal levels per gene were similar in triploid and diploid cells, indicating no global effect on autosomal expression. Triploid cells with two X showed doubling of X-linked expression, while triploid with one X showed upward adjustment by epigenetic mechanism sensing X-autosome ratio. A subset of genes had expression proportional to autosomal sets, with 7% having levels proportional to the number of autosomes. Expression per gene copy did not differ between triploid and diploid, suggesting X adjustment prevails in triploid cultures. Distributions of X-linked genes differed between triploid and diploid, with no global change in absolute autosomal levels, indicating adjustments affect X-linked genes. Triploid with one X showed upward adjustment from basic doubling, regulated in a dosage-sensitive manner, with prevalent location on the short arm of the X chromosome. X-linked expression is upregulated two-fold in triploid with two X, but not tripled in triploid with one, indicating global expression does not respond to autosomal counting factor in triploid cells.
The dN/dS ratio, a measure of evolutionary pressures on proteins, is commonly used to quantify substitution rates at non-synonymous and synonymous sites. Originally developed for distantly diverged sequences, it is often applied to sequences from a single population, where differences represent segregating polymorphisms. However, the expected dN/d ratio for samples from a single population under selection is relatively insensitive to the selection coefficient. The signature of positive selection, dN/d>1, is violated within a population, and the relationship between selection and d/d does not follow a monotonic function, making it impossible to infer selection pressures from d/d. The relationship between selection pressure and d/d is qualitatively different for samples from a single population compared to divergent lineages. Standard tests for selection based on d/d are sensitive to the assumption of divergent lineages. Simulations confirm the theoretical analysis, showing the d/d ratio climbs rapidly for positive selection when comparing divergent lineages, but within a population, the expected d/d ratio is insensitive to changes in selection. Results have implications for inferences of positive selection based on d/d among conspecific samples, with low power to detect selection when most sites evolve under purifying selection.
Researchers investigated the effect of natural selection on genetic variation across species, focusing on neutral divergence between closely and distantly related species. They found that neutral divergence between closely related species, such as human-primate, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively correlated with recombination rate, while divergence between distantly related species, such as human-rod, is negatively correlated with functional content and positively with estimates of background selection. These patterns persist after accounting for confounding factors like hypermutable sites, GC content, and biased conversion. Coalescent models indicate that background selection in the ancestral population can explain a large proportion of variance in divergence across the genome, generating observed correlations. The findings suggest natural selection indirectly affects linked divergence between closely and distantly related species, contrary to previous intuition. Although direct purifying selection may drive some patterns, this would require more of the genome under selection than currently believed. The study has implications for understanding genome evolution and interpreting genetic variation, indicating selection contributes to reducing divergence at linked sites even between species with long divergence times, such as human-mouse or human-rat.
Phosphorylation is a crucial regulatory mechanism for protein stability and activity in circadian clocks, determining the speed and strength of molecular oscillations by acting on transcriptional activators and repressors. In Drosophila, the CK2 kinase phosphorylates and destabilizes the PER and TIM proteins, which inhibit CLOCK transcriptional activity. CK2 also targets the CLOCK activator directly, downregulating its activity and inducing degradation even in the absence of PER and TIM. The regulatory subunit of the CK2 holoenzyme is not required for regulation of CLOCK stability. Downregulation of CK2 activity decreases CLOCK phosphorylation and increases per and tim transcription, indicating that CK2 inhibits degradation while reducing activity. Since CK1 promotes degradation, CLOCK stability and transcriptional activity result from counteracting effects of CK1 and CK2. Temporally controlled phosphorylation of clock proteins is key to the transcription-translational feedback loop underlying the Dophila circadian clock, with CLOCK showing robust oscillations of phosphorylation levels. CK2 is involved in control of CLOCK phosphorylation and affects circadian function, defining a role in degradation and hyperphosphorylation. The unstable but active CLOCK acquired by CK inhibition joins other circadian factors with similar properties. CK2 promotes stability and decreases activity, interacting with DBT-dependent activities to set transcriptional activity in the circadian cycle. Circadian oscillations are governed by temporally regulated loops where transcription factors activate their inhibitors, with CLOCK representing the rhythmic component in Drosila, showing oscillations in DNA-binding and transcriptional activity associated with per and tim mRNA levels.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, interacts with its insect host Rhodnius prolix through a complex process involving cysteine peptidases. Researchers investigated the role of cruzain, a cystine peptidase, in this interaction by analyzing the effect of anti-cruzain antibodies and cystine peptase inhibitors on parasite adhesion to Rhodnius prolix midgut. All treatments, except CA074-OM, significantly decreased adhesion, with cystatin showing a dose-dependent reduction. Comparison of adhesion rates among T cruzi isolates revealed that those with low active cruzain levels adhered less than others. Transgenic epastotes overexpressing an endogenous cruzain inhibitor, chasin, adhered 73% less than wild-type parasites, but adhesion was partially restored with exogenous cruzain. In vivo experiments showed low levels of transgenic parasites and increased surface cruzain expression after passage in the insect. These findings highlight cruzain's contribution to T cruzi interaction with the insect host. Transgenic lines overexpressing chasin, with reduced active cruzain, displayed low adhesion rates. Cysteine peptases, including cruzain, have emerged as targets for antiparasitic drugs due to their role in physiological processes, with cruzain being extensively investigated for Chagas disease chemotherapy.
Researchers investigated the regulation of cytoplasmic dynein, a microtubule-dependent motor protein essential for mitotic processes, including centrosome separation, chromosome congression, and segregation, using a conditional Caenorhabditis elegans cyasmic dyin heavy chain mutant. A genome-wide RNA interference screen identified twenty dyin-specific suppressor genes that, twelve of which do not exhibit sterile or lethal phenotypes when reduced in wild-type worms. Many suppressor proteins, including dyin light chains, localize to subcell sites overlapping with the dyin heavy chain. Four putative dyin accessory chains were found to negatively regulate heavy chain function when knocked down. Additionally, twenty-nine genes were identified that suppress conditional mutations in dyin and other essential processes when reduced. The study reveals conserved non-essential genes contribute to dyin function during mitosis, providing insight into mechanisms regulating cytoplasmic dyin. Dyin light chains DYLT-1 and DYRB1 associate with centrosomes and spindle poles, suggesting they are components of cytoplasmic dyin in C. elegans. The localization of suppressor proteins overlapped with the distribution of cytoplasm dyin in early embryo, indicating functional relationship to dyin. Overall, twenty genes were identified that when reduced in function can suppress conditionally lethal C. elegans cytoplasm dyin heavy mutants.
Researchers investigated the coupling of DNA cleavage and repair during programmed genome rearrangements in the ciliate Paramecium tetraelia, a unicellular eukaryotic model. During somatic differentiation, DNA double-strand breaks drive genome rearrangements, and the non-homologous end-joining pathway is mobilized to safeguard genome integrity. The development of the somatic nucleus involves massive rearrangements, including the elimination of at least 45,000 germline sequences through a cut-and-close mechanism. The domesticated transposase PigMac is essential for DNA cleavage, and LigIV is involved in DSB repair excision. Two Ku paralogs, Ku70 and Ku80, are encoded in the genome, with Ku70 and Ku80c produced during sexual processes and localizing in the new somatic nucleus. RNA interference showed the Ku70/K80 heterodimer is essential for recovery of a functional somatic nucleus, and PigMac-dependent cleavage is abolished in Ku80-depleted cells, resulting in sequence retention. PigMac and Ku70/K80 co-purify as a complex, indicating Ku has integrated into the DNA cleavage factory, enabling tight coupling between DSB introduction and repair. The study provides evidence that Ku is required in vivo to introduce programmed DSB during genome rearrangements, with the development-specific Ku70-K80 heterimer participating in Pig-dependent cleavage, upstream of its function in non-homous end-joining DSB repair.
Prion diseases have long preclinical incubation periods where infectious particles propagate in the brain, causing abnormal neuritic sprouting and synaptic deficits before neuronal loss. Researchers used laser microdissection to isolate hippocampal CA1 neurons and determine preclinical transcriptional responses during infection, finding dynamic gene expression characterized by distinct phases. A major cluster of genes altered during preclinical disease returned to basal levels or underwent reversal during clinical disease, containing a signature of synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor signaling and neuroprotective pathways. Genes involved in neuronal projection and dendrite development were altered, culminating in a decline of gene expression for synaptic proteins. Deregulated miRNAs followed concomitant patterns of expression. This study describes the preclinical response of hippocal neurons to early prion replication, suggesting prion replication stimulates a programmed response mediated by NMD receptor activity, promoting cell survival and neurite remodelling. However, this response terminates prior to clinical symptoms, pointing to a critical juncture in disease. Manipulation of neuroprotective pathways may redress degeneration and survival, providing a potential treatment inroad. Genome analysis identified numerous genes and miAs with altered levels in infected mice, many novel to prion pathology, offering avenues for therapeutics.
Researchers have developed an in silico Petri net model to simulate hepatic granuloma development in experimental visceral leishmaniasis, caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. The model was validated by comparison with data from experimental studies in mice and assessed for robustness by sensitivity analysis, recapitulating disease progression and changes in cellular composition within granulomas over time. In silico experiments identified a previously unappreciated level of inter-granoma diversity in terms of anti-leishial activity and suggested a dominant regulatory role for IL-10 produced by infected Kupffer cells at the core of the granoma. The model simulates events within granuloma leading to parasite control and does not account for IL-10 effects outside this environment, such as on T cell differentiation in other tissues. Data from real-time intravital imaging and analysis of disaggregated liver tissue informed model parameterization. Evidence from human, murine, and canine studies indicates T-derived cytokines maintain immunity during subclinical disease, with granulomatous inflammation correlating with protective immunity. T cells mediate cellular immunity against Leishmania, and their depletion in the model led to high parasite burden and non-healing infection, mirroring T cell-deficient mice.
Researchers have demonstrated that transcriptional regulatory machinery can be viewed as a computational device capable of performing arithmetic operations, with transcription factor concentrations as inputs and expression levels as output. A simple kinetic model of transcriptional regulation can approximate standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as equality and inequality operations. The accuracy and precision of these approximations depend on parameter sets and are independently tunable. Networks of "arithmetic genes" can be combined to accomplish more complicated computations, such as detecting statistically significant elevations in time-varying signals. Allowing multiple transcription factor binding sites on the promoter enables approximation of analytic functions. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that such genes can be combined to compute sophisticated functions, including tracking mean and standard deviation of time-vary signals and detecting statistically significant elevations. Simple models demonstrate the possibility of arithmetic computations at the level of transcription regulation, and other functions like exponentiation, logarithms, and trigonometric functions can be computed through combinations of arithmetic operations. Different parameterizations of the model can reproduce binary operations, inequality comparisons, and fractional powers, and unary, ternary operations can be implemented at the biochemical level.
Chikungunya virus, an RNA virus transmitted by mosquitoes, causes a febrile illness known as Chikungunya fever, which can lead to intense and debilitating outcomes. The virus arrived in Brazil in 2014 through two independent introductions, with the Asian/Caribbean genotype entering the North and the African ECS genotype entering the Northeast. Following their introduction, both genotypes established an urban cycle among large human populations, causing outbreaks in the Americas. Genome sequencing of CHV from a recent outbreak in Northeast Brazil revealed both Asian/Caribbean and ECS genotypes are cocirculating in the region, with evidence of simultaneous infection by two genotypes in at least six clinical samples. This suggests coinfection may be more common in highly endemic areas than previously thought. The ECS and Asian/Caribbean genotypes have expanded their ranges, reaching cocirculation in Northeast Brazil. CHV has caused significant health and economic burdens worldwide, spreading rapidly in naive populations since its arrival in Brazil in 2014. Several outbreaks have occurred globally due to geographically restricted genotypes entering new areas, highlighting the need to consider coinfection by different genotypes in understanding CHV epidemiology. Coinfection of ECS and Asian/Caribbean CHV genotypes was found in naturally infected individuals.
The bacterial modulator H-NS regulates both core and horizontally acquired genes, silencing gene expression in response to external stimuli such as osmolarity and temperature. HNS discriminates and differentially modulates core and horizontally acquired DNA, with plasmid-encoded HNS evolving to silence horizontally acquired genes without interfering with core genome regulation. Resident chromosomal HNS requires the helper protein Hha to regulate both lineages, with HNS-Hha complexes silencing horizontally acquired DNA and HNS homomers modulating core genes. The presence of Hha proteins is restricted to Enterobacteriaceae and conjugative plasmids encoding HNS variants have only been isolated from this family. The HNS system in enteric bacteria presents unique evolutionary features, allowing selective discrimination between core and horizontally acquired DNA, potentially maintaining horizontally transmitted DNA in a silent form and giving bacteria a competitive advantage in adapting to new environments. HNS interacts with Hha family members to silence horizontally acquired genes, not core genes, and HNS/Hha complexes modulate gene expression in several enteric bacteria. Plasm-encoded HNS proteins target horizontally acquired DNA, while chromosomally-encoded HNS targets both, using Hha to silence horizontally genes. This enables bacterial cells to control foreign DNA expression, mitigating potential perturbations to core genome regulation and fitness costs.
Genome sequencing of Leishmania species has revealed highly conserved gene content and synteny across the genus, with only a small number of genes differentially distributed between species. Researchers used customized oligonucleotide microarrays to confirm that differentially distributed genes are expressed in intracellular amastigotes, with few subject to regulation at the RNA level. A large-scale study of gene expression in L. braziliensis showed that approximately 9% of genes are regulated during the life cycle, consistent with other Leishmania species. Comparing amastote expression between species confirms Leishmania transcriptomes undergo little regulation but identifies conserved genes regulated differently between species in the host. Host immune influence on parasite expression was investigated by comparing RNA profiles in L major amastotes from wild-type and immunocompromised mice. Results showed parasite dissemination increased in immunocompromised mice but RNA profiles remained unperturbed, supporting the hypothesis that Leishmania amastotes are pre-adapted for intracellular survival and undergo little modulation. Species-specific factors contributing to virulence may be limited to products of differentially distributed genes or conserved genes subject to translational and post-translational controls. Approximately 9% of probed genes were identified as regulated during the life cycle, confirming Leish parasites preadaptation to intracellular survival regardless of host immune state.
Researchers have developed a novel LAMP assay, named LPhus, for detecting Amphimer sp. DNA in human stool samples to improve diagnosis of amphiasis, a fish-borne disease caused by the liver fluke Amphimer. The current diagnosis method, based on stool examination for parasite eggs, lacks sensitivity and can be confounded with other liver and intestinal flukes. The LPhus assay targets the internal transcribed spacer 2 region and was optimized using DNA from adult worms and evaluated for specificity and sensitivity. The limit of detection was 1 pg of genomic DNA. Field testing of 44 human stool samples from endemic areas showed 76.67% sensitivity and 80.77% specificity. The LPhus has potential for field diagnosis and surveillance in amphias-endemic areas with limited resources and can be adapted for diagnosing infected animals and humans. Further studies will assess the applicability of this novel assay on a large scale. The LPhus is the first specific and sensitive LAMP for detecting Amphimer sp in human samples and can be used for effective diagnosis and surveillance after further validation.
Researchers have identified a non-canonical role of the SNARE protein Ykt6 in autophagosome-lysosome fusion, demonstrating its requirement for autophagosome clearance in Drosophila. Loss of Ykt leads to accumulation of autophagosomes unable to fuse with lysosomes, while loss of its partner Sy5 does not prevent autolysosome formation. Ykt localizes to lysosomes and autolysosomes, forming a SNARE complex with Sy17 and Snap29, which can be competed by Vamp7. Overexpression of V7 rescues the fusion defect in Ykt loss-of-function cells. A mutant Ykt with an R amino acid change retains autophagic activity and restores viability, unlike palmitoylation or farnsylation mutant forms. Ykt and V7 are required for autophagosome-lysosome fusion and mutually exclusive subunits in Sy17-Snap complex, suggesting V7 is involved in membrane fusion and Ykt acts as a non-conventional regulatory SNARE. Ykt forms a less stable complex with Sy17-Snap29 than Sy17-Snap-V7 and interacts with HOPS through longin domains. Overexpression of V7 restores autagosome-lysosome fusion in Ykt loss-function cells, indicating Ykt may stabilize Sy17-Snap complex until V7 enters the fusion site. Loss of either V7 or Y6 perturbs autagosome-lysosome fusion, suggesting both are essential for the process.
Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NI) is a commensal inhabitant of the human nasopharyngeal mucosa that can cause opportunistic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. To evade host immune defense, NI employs the Sap sensitivity to antimicrobial peptides ABC transporter to resist antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The periplasmic binding protein SapA binds AMPs and is required for NI virulence in vivo, functioning to counter AMP lethality during infection by delivering AMPs to the inner membrane complex for transport into the cytoplasm. AMPs localize to the cytoplasm of parental NI strains and are susceptible to cytoplasmic peptase activity. In contrast, AMPs accumulate in the periplasm of bacteria lacking a functional Sap permease complex. This supports a mechanism of Sap-mediated import of AMPs, reducing periplasm and inner membrane accumulation of host defense peptides. AMPs are innate immune molecules targeting bacterial membranes, disrupting transmembrane potential, and triggering cytoplasm leakage, resulting in cell death. NI must defend against host immune strategies, including AMP production during transition from commensal to pathogen. Neutralization of native AMPs assessed their contribution to NI colonization, demonstrating SapA contributes to virulence by conferring protection from AMP lethality in vivo. A novel mechanism of inner membrane transport of AMP molecules via the Sap ABC transporter to the cytoplasm results in degradation.
Researchers investigated the role of active degradation in shaping the coordination of downstream targets of the multiple antibiotic resistance activator MarA in Escherichia coli. MarA, a key transcription factor with a short half-life of 1-3 minutes due to Lon protease activity, regulates over 60 targets involved in antibiotic resistance and stress response. By modifying MarA's half-life using CRISPRi or engineering, experiments showed that active degradation impacts both the rate and maximum coordination of downstream genes. Results indicate that perfect fidelity and instantaneous coordination cannot coexist in multi-gene regulation, with trade-offs between these properties. Increasing MarA's half-life increases coordinated diversity between downstream genes, but alters the rate at which coordination is generated. Active degradation may allow for a responsive and agile signaling network by erasing previous protein levels, enabling rapid regeneration of phenotypic diversity in response to antibiotic challenges. The study highlights the utility of active degradation in shaping MarA's coordination of downstream targets and its potential benefits for bacterial populations to establish a spectrum of phenotypes, particularly in the context of antibiotic resistance and stress response.
Researchers investigated the role of MAP kinase phosphatase 2 (MK-2) in the immune response to Leishmania major infection in C57/BL6 mice. Unlike previous findings with Leishmania mexicana, MK-2 deficient mice did not show increased susceptibility to Leishmania major, with similar lesion size and parasite numbers to wild-type mice. Analysis revealed reduced TH1 response in MK-2 deficient mice, with lower IFN-γ and TNFα producing T cells and lower antigen-stimulated IFNγ production. However, TH2 response was also reduced, with lower IL4 production and parasite-specific IgG1 levels, resulting in an unchanged TH1/TH2 balance. Non-stimulated MK2 deficient macrophages were more permissive to infection, but LPS/IF-γ activation controlled parasite growth equally in both MK2 deficient and wild-type macrophages. Despite reduced TH1 response, no change in disease phenotype was observed due to balanced TH1/TH response. Addition of IL4 increased intracellular parasites in both wild-type and MK2 deficient macrophages, highlighting disease-promoting effects of IL4 and alternative macrophage activation. Overall, MK2 deficiency did not alter disease outcome in Leishmania major infection, contrasting with previous findings in Leishmania mexicana.
The mammalian pancreas is a branched organ with a network of ducts that undergoes a transition from unconnected microlumen to a mesh and finally a treelike structure. Researchers have quantified the network properties at different developmental stages, finding stereotypic traits at each stage and changes toward optimized delivery of exocrine products into the duodenum. In silico modeling deconstructs network development into simple rules, with early stages explained by noisy, redundant duct connection as microlens form and later by pruning based on fluid flux into the duodenum. The pancreatic network has stereic properties between E12.5 and E18.5, transitioning from interlinked mesh to treelike, reflected in changing properties. The ductal system has stereic traits at each stage, with remodeling quantifiable by standard measures. The creation of the early network from E10.5 to E12.5 is explained by noisy, redundant duct formation as microlens form. The proposed organ-forming rules differ from deterministic lung branching or random walk in mammary gland and are likely conserved for other glands, such as salivary and fluid-secreting glands. The study reveals previously unknown features of pancreatic development, showing the pancreas is more stereic than believed, with trends in branch patterns.
Kinesin proteins drive intracellular transport by coupling ATP hydrolysis to conformational changes that mediate movement along microtubules. Characterizing these conformations and their interconversion is essential to determining an atomic-level model of kines action. A comprehensive analysis of 114 experimental structures and molecular simulations mapped the structural dynamics of the kines motor domain, revealing three distinct conformation clusters: ATP-like, ADP-like, and Eg5 inhibitor-bound. Group membership correlated with neck-linker orientations, not nucleotide state. Simulations showed all nucleotide states could sample major conformations, with differences in dynamic coupling of distal sites. ATP-bound simulations displayed correlated motions between necker, loop, and α4-α subdomain, absent in ADP simulations. Dissection revealed a network of communication between active site, microtubule interface, and necker loop. Mutations reduced flexibility and disrupted couplings. Results indicate ATP and ADP-like conformations are intrinsically accessible regardless of nucleotide state, supporting a model where necker docking leads to tighter coupling of microtubule and nucleotide regions. Simulations highlighted sites for large-scale conformation changes and allosteric coupling between distal sites. The study employed computational approaches to assess structural and dynamical features of motor conformations, probing coupling between functional sites, and provided insights into kines dynamics.
Researchers have developed a computational approach to infer gene transcription levels from bioluminescent output in Lux reporter assays, addressing limitations in interpreting bioluminescent data due to nonlinear molecular and enzyme dynamics of the Lux system. A new mathematical model of Lux activity includes LuxAB, LuxE, and Fre with improved mechanisms for reactions, synthesis, and turnover of proteins, calibrated with experimental data from Photorhabdus luminescens and literature. The model shows evidence for previously unreported product inhibition of the LuxAB reaction and predicts bioluminescent profiles can differ from gene expression changes. By incorporating the model into a Bayesian scheme, promoter activity can be reverse-engineered from bioluminescence, providing accurate interpretation of gene expression levels. The approach can benefit users of Lux technology, particularly in cases where changes in bioluminescence would be misinterpreted without the model, such as decreases in biolumcence indicating promoter switching off or increases indicating longer gene expression periods. The model associates bioluminescence with promoter activity rather than viability, ensuring minimal loss of viability due to experimental conditions for correct interpretation. This method can be applied to experiments using Lux reporter assays, including antimicrobial resistance genes with sub-lethal doses of antimicrobials.
Researchers have elucidated the structure of coxsackievirus A16 in complex with capsid binder G3, providing insight into key residues involved in interactions with the inhibitor. The study reveals that G3 inhibits replication of enterovirus 71 and coxsievirus A16, major causes of hand, foot, and mouth disease in children. In silico docking was performed to investigate interactions with next-generation capsid binders NLD and ALD, showing potent inhibitors of a panel of enteroviruses with potential pharmacological properties. A meta-analysis of structural information provided insight into features required for capsid binders to interact and confer broad-spectrum anti-enterovirus activity. Structural comparisons correlated features with antiviral activity, reinforcing NLD as a candidate for hand, foot, and mouth disease treatment. Canyon-like depressions encircling the 5-fold axes are sites for receptor attachment, and uncoating process is key to enterovirus infection. Expulsion of the hydrophobic pocket factor is required for infection, and molecules replacing it with higher affinity can serve as antiviral agents. The study presents the crystal structure of C16 in complex with G3 and calculates compound-protein interaction energy using in silico method, showing good antiviral activity for capsid binders with highest EC50 for PV1. The hydrophobic pocket in VP1 proves a target for novel inhibitors targeting early enterovirus infection.
The humoral response to fungal and Gram-positive infections in Drosophila melanogaster is regulated by the serpin-family inhibitor Necrot. Following immune challenge, a proteolytic cascade is activated, signaling through the Toll receptor, resulting in the synthesis of antibiotic peptides in the fat body and export to the hemolymph. Necrot is synthesized in the fat body and removed from the hemolymph by two groups of cells, garland and pericardial athrocytes, through endocytosis. Uptake of Necrot responds rapidly to infection, peaking at 6-8 hours, and is processed through multivesicular bodies and delivered to lysosomes where it co-localizes with ubiquitin-binding protein HRS. Mutations blocking late endosome/lysosome fusion cause accumulation of Necrot-positive endosomes. The Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian LDL receptor, Liporin receptor-1 (LR1), is identified as an enhancer of the immune response, with uptake of Necrot blocked by chromosomal deletion of LR1. In null mutants, the Toll-mediated response is constitutively activated, implying Nec continually restrains the immune response. The study identifies cells and molecules responsible for Necrot uptake and degradation, suggesting scavenging serpin/protein complexes may regulate proteolytic cascades.
Nodal and BMP signals play crucial roles in establishing left-right asymmetry in vertebrates, with Nodal preventing rudiment formation on the right side in sea urchins. However, the opposing pathway to Nodal signaling during left-right axis establishment was unclear. Research revealed BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the veg2 lineage, but not in small micromeres, and is required for left-sided gene expression and structure formation. Conversely, Nodal signals on the right inhibit BMP, controlling asymmetric separation and apoptosis of small micromeres. Findings indicate BMP is a positive signal for left-sided development in sea urchins, suggesting conserved opposing roles of Nodal and BMP in deuterostomes. BMP genes are symmetrically expressed in skeletogenic miceres but asymmetrically activated in left-derived coelomic pouch, supporting the hypothesis that BMP is necessary for proper patterning and expression of left-sided genes in aboral veg2 descendants. The relationship between Nodal and BMP during axis establishment shows Nodal prevents rudiment on the right, while BMP is required for right-sided Nodal expression, similar to observations in vertebrates where BMP4 loss leads to lost Nodal expression in left LPM. The mutual antagonism between Nodal and BMP may be due to competition for the common effector Smad, as no asymmetrical expression of BMP antagonists was detected in the sea urchin embryo.
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) lytic infection is synchronized with the host cell cycle, with infected G0/G1 cells supporting immediate early gene expression and proceeding to the G1 boundary, while S/G2 cells block gene expression until reentry into G1. The block to gene expression during S/G2 can be overcome by genotoxic stress and chemical inhibitors of DNA replication, pointing to checkpoint-dependent pathways controlling repression. p53 is required for checkpoint rescue of expression, and cyclin-dependent kinase (CD) inhibitor p21 suggests a role for CD in controlling gene repression. CD inhibition alleviates repression in S/G cells independently of p53. CD inhibition also overcomes the block to expression during quiescent infection in NT2 cells, indicating a role in preventing latent state establishment. Inhibition of CD activity restores virus permissiveness in S2 and antagonizes silencing of lytic expression during latent infection, suggesting a link between cell cycle and latency-associated repression. The p53 tumor suppressor governs the response to genotoxic stress, inducing p21-dependent cell arrest or apoptosis. CD inhibition rescues gene expression in all cell phases, with S2 cells reacting most sensitive at low concentrations. The rescue relies on p53-dependent checkpoint signaling after genotoxic or replicative stress.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms supporting the evolution of effective HIV-1-specific T cell immunity in HIV-1 elite controllers, who restrict HIV-1 replication through highly functional HIV-1-specific T responses. Exposure of conventional dendritic cells from elite controllers to HIV-1 led to rapid and sustained production of type I interferons and upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes, associated with reduced SAMHD1 and LEDGF/p75 and accumulation of viral transcripts. This cell-intrinsic immune response was inhibited by pharmacological blockade of viral transcription or siRNA-mediated silencing of cytosolic sensor cGAS. Enhanced cell-intrinsic recognition of HIV-1 in dendritic cells translated into stronger abilities to stimulate and expand HIV-1-specific CD8 T cell responses. Data suggest an important role of cell-intrinsic type interferon secretion in dendritic cells for induction of effective HIV-1-specific CD8 cells, potentially helpful for eliciting functional T immunity against HIV-1. Innate cell-intrinsic recognition of HIV-1 in dendritic cells contributes to generation of antiviral T immune responses in controllers, facilitated by upregulation of cGAS, leading to type I interferon secretion, supporting HIV-1-specific CD8 cell responses. Understanding these mechanisms is critical for developing immunologic approaches for HIV-1 treatment and prevention, as most HIV vaccine candidates rely on dendritic cells for inducing HIV-1-specific responses. Efficient cell-intrinsic responses against HIV-1 in dendritic cells from elite controllers enhance ability to stimulate HIV-1-specific T responses, shedding light on previously unrecognized mechanisms of HIV-1 recognition contributing to T-mediated control of HIV-1.
Researchers have developed a buoyancy-based screening method to identify Drosophila larvae with increased fat storage levels, revealing 66 genes that regulate fat storage when mutated, including the sirtuin family member Sir2. Sir2 regulates carbohydrate and lipid metabolism by deacetylating key proteins, and its knockdown in the larval fat body results in increased fat levels. Genetic mosaics demonstrate that Sir2 restricts fat accumulation in individual cells in a cell-autonomous manner, with changes in metabolic enzymes indicating a shift away from catabism. Sir2 mutants survive better under amino-acid starvation when sugars are provided, suggesting a Sir2-mediated catabolic response to amino-acid starvation. Sir2 functions in the Drosila fat body to regulate storage via RNA levels of metabolic enzymes and is a key regulator in switching from ingested nutrients to stored fat as energy. The study identifies Sir2 as a negative regulator of fat storage in Drosila larvae, with most effects explained by cell-autonomous function in the fat body. This mode of regulation may be evolutionarily ancient, with Sir2 mediating the switch from dietary to stored energy in response to amino acid starvation, irrespective of sugar content.
Researchers studied the evolution of mitotic spindle behavior during the first embryonic division in 42 nematode species closely related to Caenorhabditis elegans, analyzing 128 strains from 27 Caenorhabdit and 15 non-Caenorhabdit species. All strains underwent asymmetric cell division, but exhibited large intra- and inter-species variations in degree of asymmetry and spindle movement parameters, including oscillation, elongation, and displacement. These parameters changed frequently during evolution with no apparent direction in species phylogeny, except for spindle transverse oscillations, which emerged at the base of the Caenorhabdit genus. Changes were unrelated to evolutionary variations in embryo size, and spindle elongation, displacement, and oscillation evolved independently. This contrasts with expectations based on C. elegans studies, revealing unrecognized changes in spindle mechanics. The essential process of asymmetric division has been conserved over nemode evolution, but underlying spindle parameters can combine in various ways. Asymmetric division is subject to system drift like other developmental processes. The study used time-lapse videomicroscopy to record first embryonic division in nematode strains, comparing spindle positioning between species with similar architecture. Variations in spindle movements were unexpected based on understanding of C. elegans, where oscillations reflect mechanical properties of the spindle and have been instrumental in understanding biophysical basis of asymmetric division.
The evolution of new gene networks allows bacteria to explore and exploit new niches, including pathogenic interactions with host organisms. The archetypal DNA binding protein OmpR is identical in Salmonella Typhimurium and Escheria coli, but regulatory specialization has resulted in different environmental triggers of Omp expression and divergent Omp regulons. Omp mRNA and Omp protein levels are elevated by acid pH in S. Typhurium but not in E. coli due to differences in the promoter regions of the omp genes. Introduction of S. Typhurium sequences into E. coli makes its OmpR acid-inducible. The Omp regulon in S. Typhium overlaps with E. coli at 15 genes and includes many horizontally acquired genes, including virulence genes. Omp binds genomic targets in higher abundance when DNA is relaxed, which occurs in S. Typhium as a result of acid stress, a requirement for optimal expression of virulence. Genomic targets of Omp do not share a strong nucleotide consensus, suggesting Omp's ability to recruit genes arises from modest specificity and preference for relaxed DNA, allowing cooperation with DNA-topology-based allostery to modulate transcription in response to acid.
Researchers have identified a novel nuclear effector protein, NUE, in the intracellular pathogen Chlamydia trachatis, which contains a SET domain characteristic of histone methyltransferases. The protein is secreted via a type III secretion mechanism and translocates to the host nucleus, where it associates with chromatin. Expression of NUE in mammalian cells reconstitutes nuclear targeting and chromatin association. In vitro methylation assays confirm NUE is a histone methyltransferase that targets histones H2, H3, and H4, and itself through automethylation. Mutants deficient in automethylation show diminished activity towards histones, suggesting automethylation enhances enzymatic activity. NUE is the first bacterial effector to directly target mammalian histones. The protein is secreted from bacteria, localized to the mammalian nucleus, and exhibits enzymatic activity as a histone methyltransferase. Automethylation of NUE may enhance its methyltransfer activity by increasing affinity for substrates. NUE preferentially methylates mammalian histones over chlamydial histones. The study proposes CT737 and its homologs in chlamdia genomes as NUE, the first identified nuclear effector in chlamdia. Further research is needed to determine the genes regulated by NUE in the nucleus during Chydia infection.
A study of over 35,000 people from 21 populations found a significant inverse association between height and genome-wide homozygosity, equivalent to a 3cm height reduction in offspring of first cousins compared to offspring of unrelated individuals. The effect remained after controlling for socio-economic status. There was high heterogeneity among populations, with consistent direction but varying effect size. This suggests multiple rare recessive variants influence height. Genome-wide association studies previously identified common variants, but little attention was given to recessive effects. The findings imply a polygenic recessive component to height's genetic architecture, supporting the theory that heritability results from many genetic variants of small effect. The study used alternative estimates of genomic homozyosity, capturing different aspects of inbreeding depression, which implies directional dominance across loci. The association between height and homozyosity suggests many recessive variants of small effect scattered across the genome influence height. The methodology is applicable to heritable traits, paving the way for investigation into inbreeding effects on a range of biomedical traits. The results provide evidence for a significant inverse association between genome-wide homozyosity and height, equivalent to a 0.4cm reduction in offspring of first cousins.
Researchers investigated the relationship between monocyte subsets and anti-parasitic activity in patients with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Flow cytometry analysis of blood samples from patients and healthy individuals exposed to malaria revealed distinct monocyte phenotypes. At admission, patients had high percentages and numbers of CD16+ and CCR2CX3+ monocytes. Expression of CCR2 and CXCR1 on CD14high monocytes defined two patient subgroups with differing abilities to limit parasite growth through antibody-dependent cellular inhibition. Patients with high CD14CCR2CX3+ monocytes had lower parasitemia and higher inhibition activity. Data showed monocytes can exert strong anti-parasitic activity during malaria. Results indicate a causal association between circulating monocytes expressing C2, CX1, CD56, mTN-α, and mIF-γ and lower parasitemia and strong inhibition. Monocytes from patients had increased inflammatory markers, including TREM1, compared to healthy controls. Two patient groups had different monocyte phenotypes, with Group 1 having elevated CD14CCR2CX monocytes and low parasitem. The study characterized monocyte subsets in acute uncomplicated malaria, showing increased inflammatory subsets and distinct phenotypes associated with anti-parasitic activity.
Schistosoma mansoni infection in Ugandan men is associated with increased abundance and function of HIV target cells in blood, but not foreskin. A cross-sectional study of 34 HIV and malaria-uninfected men who volunteered for circumcision found that 12 were definitively positive for S. mansoni eggs in stool and 12 definitively negative for both S. mansoni eggs and worm. Tissue and blood cell subsets were characterized by flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Th17 and Th1 cells from the blood and foreskin expressed higher levels of CCR5 and were more activated than other CD4 cell subsets. S. mansoni-infected men had higher frequency of systemic Th1, Th17, and Th22 cells in the blood than uninfected men. Th17 cells in the blood of S. mansoni-infected men demonstrated enhanced function producing multiple cytokines. However, these immune alterations were not observed in foreskin tissue. S. mans infection was associated with increased frequency of highly HIV-susceptible Th1, Th17, and Th22 cell subsets in blood, but these cell differences did not extend to foreskin. S. mans induced changes in cell immunology through the common mucosal system are not likely to increase HIV susceptibility in foreskin.
Researchers have demonstrated that the anti-filarial activity of antibiotic therapy is due to extensive apoptosis after Wolbachia depletion from filarial nematodes. Depletion of Wolbachia produces profound defects in nematode development, fertility, and viability, and has promise as a novel approach for treating filarial diseases. Using whole mount confocal microscopy, an immediate response to Wolia depletion is extensive apoptosis in the adult germline and somatic cells of embryos, microfilariae, and fourth-stage larvae. Apoptosis occurs in the majority of embryonic cells that had not been infected prior to antibiotic treatment. No apoptosis occurs in hypodermal chords, which are populated with large numbers of Wolbach, although disruption of hypodermal cytoskeleton occurs following depletion. The induction of apoptosis upon Wolia depletion is non-autonomous, suggesting involvement of factors from Wolbach in hypodermal chords. The pattern of apoptosis correlates with nematode tissues and processes perturbed following Wolia depletion, embryogenesis, and long-term sterilization sustained for months until premature death of adult worms. Observations provide a cellular mechanism for sustained reductions in microfilar loads and interruption of transmission prior to macrofilaridal activity following antibiotic therapy of filarial nematodes. Extensive apoptosis of adult germl cells, embryos, and somatic cells of microfilar occurs following Wolia depletion, confirmed by activation of cell death protein in treated females, microfilar, and larvae. Wolbach's effect on apoptosis may be indirect, influencing essential metabolites, compromised by hypodermal cytoskeletal defects, sensitive to embryogenesis and larval development with high metabolic demands for growth and organogenesis.
Plasmodium falciparum requires extracellular pantoate for proliferation, converting it into coenzyme A via pantoate kinase. Anti-plasmodial panto analogues, including panto and CJ-15,801, kill the parasite by targeting coenzyme A biosynthesis, but their mechanism remains unknown. Whole-genome sequencing revealed mutations in putative panto kinase gene Pfpan1 in parasites resistant lines pressured with panto or CJ-15-801, altering panto kinase activity and conferring a fitness cost, indicating Pfpan1 codes a functional kinase essential for growth. Mutants exhibit different sensitivity to potent antiplasial panto analogues, one being hypersensitive. Evidence suggests different panto analogues have distinct mechanisms, some inhibiting coenzyme biosynthesis while others inhibiting coenzyme utilising enzymes. Mutations in Pf1 make parasites resistant to certain panto analogues while hypersensitizing to others. The study validates the importance of metabolic activation of panto analogues in antiplasial activity and provides genetic evidence for distinct mechanisms of action, targeting coenzyme biosynthesis or utilisation, influenced by Pf1 mutations. Pantoamides are identified as antiplasial panto analogues with increased potency. The findings indicate panto kinase is primary in metabolic activation of panto analogues during intraerythrocytic stage.
Genome-wide association studies were conducted in 6,247 African American individuals to identify genetic variants associated with PR interval duration, a measure of atrial and atrioventricular conduction time. A strong signal was observed within the SCN5A gene, encoding the cardiac sodium channel, with genome-wide significance in two cohorts and meta-analysis, explaining 2% of PR variability. This variant was also associated with PR interval in Europeans but with a smaller effect size. Further analysis identified genome-wide associations with SNPs in SCN10, MEIS1, and TBX5, correlated with European and Asian studies. African ancestry was associated with increased PR duration in one cohort. Findings demonstrate common variants' relevance in African Americans at previously associated loci in European and Asian samples and identify a stronger association at one locus in African Americans. The strongest variant explained 2% of PR variability, unlikely to explain large ancestry variation in atrial conduction. Prolongation of PR is a risk factor for long-term atrial fibrillation, heart block, and all-cause mortality with heritability estimates between 30-50% in European and Asian populations. Genetic variants identified may provide insights into molecular electrophysiology and novel targets for arrhythm treatment.
Researchers have identified a small GTP-binding protein, ARL, that plays a crucial role in the replication of Tomato mosaic virus, a positive-strand RNA virus that replicates on intracellular membranes. ARL, along with a seven-pass transmembrane protein TOM1, co-purifies with the ToMV 180K replication protein from solubized membranes of infected tobacco cells. Immunopurification with anti-FLAG antibody showed that ToMV 130 and 180 replication proteins and TOM1 co-purified with ARL, exhibiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity that transcribed ToMV RNA. Simultaneous mutations in specific ARL genes inhibited tobamovirus multiplication. In vitro studies showed that TOM and ARL are required for efficient negative-strand RNA synthesis. Coexpression of ToMV 130 protein with TOM and ARL in yeast resulted in detectable RNA 5-capping activity, which was undetectable or weak when expressed alone or with either TOM or ARL. These results suggest TOM and ARL are components of ToMV replication complexes, crucial for activation of replication and synthesizing and capping functions. Endogenous ARL co-purified with ARL from uninfected and infected cells, indicating a membrane-bound complex containing ToMV proteins, TOM, and ARL is formed in infected cells. Membrane-bound tobavirus 130 protein has activities to form coval guanylate complex and transfer guany moiety to the 5-terminus of newly synthesized RNA, generating capped RNA.
Inhibitory interneurons play critical roles in shaping the firing patterns of principal neurons in brain systems, with two basic motifs emerging: feed-forward and feedback inhibition. In the locust, a subset of lateral horn neurons provide feed-forward inhibition onto Kenyon cells to maintain sparse firing, crucial for olfactory learning and memory. However, a single inhibitory cell, the GABAergic neuron, is the main source of inhibition in the mushroom body, mediated by a feedback loop including Kenyon cells. A model of the locust olfactory system found both inhibitory motifs maintain sparse Kenyon cell responses and provide optimal odor discrimination, but only feedback inhibition creates a response consistent with recorded data. The GABA neuron is capable of providing primary inhibition to Kenyon cells. Inhibition in the mushroom body changes with learning, and the feedback circuit is important for labile but not long-term memory. Anatomical evidence suggests the GABA neuron inhibits both Kenyon cells and lateral horn neurons, yet Kenyon cells fire sparsely while lateral neurons respond to odors with dense spiking. The GABA-mediated inhibition affects both Kenyon and lateral neurons, which respond differently to odor presentations.
A dual real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay has been developed for the diagnosis of lyssavirus infection, including rabies, in animals and humans. The method combines two complementary technologies, a probe-based TaqMan RT-PCR for detecting RAB species and an intercalating dye SYBR Green for other lyssavirus species. The assay was evaluated with a large panel of animal samples covering genetic variability and extended to all lyss species characterized to date. It was also tested on 211 human biological samples, detecting 41 cases of rabies and confirming the interest of skin biopsy and saliva for intra-vitam diagnosis. The method was implemented in two rabies reference laboratories in enzootic countries, Cambodia and Morocco. The combined RT-PCR constitutes a relevant tool for diagnosis in humans and animals and represents a promising tool for lyssavirus surveillance. The assay has high sensitivity and specificity and detects a large panel of animal lyss samples. It was developed for intra-vitam diagnosis in humans and post-mortem diagnosis in animals, using two techniques, probe-based TaMan RT-PCR for RAB and SYBR RT-PCR for other lyssavirus. The method detected different isolates and was evaluated on a large dataset of positive and negative samples.
A trial was conducted in the Eastern Region of Ghana to assess the efficacy of insecticide-treated nets in controlling tsetse flies and reducing trypanosomiasis in pigs. Two villages were selected, one as control and one experimental, with 14 and 24 pigs respectively, protected with 100 cm high, 150 denier polyester nets treated with deltamethrin. Bi-monthly monitoring showed a 90% reduction in tse fly density in the protected village within two months, exceeding 95% in subsequent months. Trypanosome prevalence decreased from 76% to 16% in protected pigs and 72 to 84% in control after three months. Six months post-intervention, 8% of protected pigs were infected compared to 60 in the control. The results indicate that insecticide-treated nets significantly reduce tse fly numbers and tryosome prevalence, providing a viable option for resource-poor farmers to maintain livestock in areas deemed unsuitable due to tse-related trypanosomias risk. This method also benefits villagers by reducing nuisance flies and other biting insects, making it an affordable and sustainable solution for managing tse-transmitted trypanosomias in pigs, essential for household income and consumption in rural areas of Eastern Ghana.
A survey of 441 biomedical articles published between 2000-2014 assessed the status of reproducibility and transparency, including access to raw data, protocols, replication studies, systematic reviews, and funding disclosure of conflicts of interest. Only one study provided a full protocol and none made raw data directly available. Replication studies were rare, with only four identified, and 16 studies included in systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Most studies did not mention funding or conflicts, but the percentage with no statement decreased from 94.4% in 2000 to 34.6% in 201, while those reporting conflicts increased from 0 to 15.4% and no conflicts from 5.6% to 50%. Articles in clinical medicine journals were more likely to lack funding information and have private funding compared to other fields. The majority of empirical articles did not mention funding, with 59% in clinical journals and 26.3 in other fields. Only 16% of clinical articles had a PubMed Central reference number compared to 27.5 in other fields. The study provides baseline data to compare future progress in improving these indicators in the scientific literature, highlighting the need for increased transparency and reproducibility in biomedical research.
Yersinia pestis causes primary pneumonic plague, a highly lethal syndrome with mortality rates approaching 100%, through inhalation. Pneumonic plague progression is biphasic, with an initial pre-inflammatory phase facilitating bacterial growth in the absence of host inflammation, followed by a pro-inflammatory phase marked by neutrophil influx, inflammatory cytokine storm, and severe tissue destruction. Yersinia pestis utilizes a plasm-encoded type III secretion system to deliver effector proteins directly to the cytosol of target cells, which is essential for virulence and has anti-inflammatory and anti-phagytic effects on mammalian cells. Alveolar macrophages and neutils are the primary targets of Y pestis type III secretion during primary pneumonic plague. Depletion of roughly 92% of alveolar macroages had little effect on bacterial burden in the lung, indicating macroages are not involved in limiting Yers survival or Y pest creates a protective environment deactivating host immune responses. Y pest targets innate cell populations via type III secretion of Yop effectors, primarily macroages and neutils during the pre-inflammatory phase. Neutrophil influx is unable to limit bacterial growth and responsible for severe inflammation during the pro-inflammatory phase. Monitoring host cell dynamics shows Y pest targets alolar macroages early, followed by a switch to neutrophils, providing insight into disease progression.
A study in Southeast Brazil evaluated the performance of serology in identifying asymptomatic visceral leishmaniasis infection in a cohort of 136 participants over a two-year period. Blood samples were collected and tested using molecular techniques, including PCR with Leishmania-generic primer and hybridization, and ELISA with three antigens: L. infantum, L. amazonensis, and rK39 recombinant protein. Results showed high reactivity in kala-azar patients but low reactivity in asymptomatic individuals. Compared to molecular techniques, L. amazon and L. infant antigens showed higher sensitivity but lower specificity than r39. There was low agreement among antigens used. Serological tests were inaccurate for diagnosing asymptomatic infections, potentially leading to misclassification in population studies. Molecular techniques confirmed Leishmania presence in all kala-azar patients and 86% of cohort participants. The study suggests that serological tests may not be reliable for estimating prevalence, evaluating interventions, or identifying risk factors for Leishmania infection. The global number of new visceral leishiasis cases is estimated at 500,000 per year with Brazil, India, Nepal, Ethiopia, and Sudan accounting for 90% of cases. In Brazil, the disease is caused by Leishmania infantum transmitted mainly by Lutzomyia longipalis with wild and domestic canids as reservoirs.
Researchers have utilized microarray analysis to investigate the silencing of Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons in mouse embryonic stem cells, identifying histone deacetylase Hd1 as a regulator of retrotranson expression. The study found that cryptic repetitive probes on Illumina and Affymetrix gene expression platforms can accurately monitor repetitive element expression, allowing for genome-wide analysis of retrotranson silencing. This approach revealed that multiple silencing mechanisms, including DNA methylation, Eset-mediated histone modification, and Ring1B-containing polycomb repressive complexes, are targeted to retrotransons in embryonic cells. Different genomic copies of the same retrotranson can be differentially sensitive to these silencing mechanisms. The study identified new retrotranson targets for polycomb repressive complexes and Hd1 histone deetylase in mouse embryonic stem cells, demonstrating a complex interplay between silencing mechanisms that repress retrotranson loci in germ and embryonic cells. Approximately one to two thirds of all retrotransons in the mouse genome are represented by probes on the microarray platforms analyzed. The findings suggest that genome-wide silencing of repetitive elements can be monitored by extracting information from microarray expression data, providing insights into retrotranson regulation in mammals and defense mechanisms protecting the mammalian genome from retroposition.
Arabidopsis thaliana cryptochrome 2 (CRY2) mediates light control of flowering time by interacting with CRY-interacting bHLH1 (CIB) in response to blue light to activate the transcription of Flowering Locus (FT). CIB binds the canonical E-box (ACG-box) with higher affinity than non-canonical-box (CAN) sequences in vitro, but associates with non-canonical-box at the FT promoter in vivo. CRY interacts with CIB, CIB4, and CIB5 in response to blue light, not darkness or other wavelengths. Genetic analysis shows CIB, CIB, C4, and CIB redundantly activate FT transcription and are positive regulators of CRY-mediated flowering. CIB proteins form heterodimers with higher affinity to non-canonical-box than homodimers, explaining why they bind canonical E-box in vitro but associate with non-canonical-box in vivo. Expression of CIB proteins is regulated by blue light. The study demonstrates CIB function redundantly regulates CRY-dependent flowering and forms heterodimers to interact with non-canonical-box DNA. CRY interacts with at least CIB and C5 in response to blue to affect FT transcription and floral initiation. The results support the hypothesis that CIB interact with non-canonical-box elements of FT, while CRY interacts with CIB and C5 in response to blue light. CIB promotes flowering by activating FT mRNA expression and C2-dependent floral initiation.
An economic analysis evaluated the costs and benefits of overseas presumptive treatment versus domestic screening and treatment for intestinal helminth infections among US-bound refugees from Asia. A decision model estimated the cost and health impacts of four interventions on an annual cohort of 27,700 refugees, including no program, domestic screening and treatment, overseas albendazole and ivermectin presumptive treatment, and overseas albendazole with domestic screening for strongyloides. The no program option was the least expensive but least effective, while overseas albendazole and ivermectin was the most effective, reducing outpatient cases, deaths, and hospitalizations by 80% at an estimated cost of $458,718 per death averted or $2,219 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Overseas presumptive treatment was cost-effective, less expensive, and as effective as domestic screening. Addition of ivermect to albendale reduced chronic strongyloidiasis and potentially fatal disseminated strongloidis. Domestic presumptive albendale and screening for strongloides had similar outcomes but higher costs. Markov models estimated probability of outpatient and inpatient treatment, years with parasitic infection, and quality-adjusted life years. Refugees died of unrelated causes at rates equivalent to Asian Americans. Average age and number of refugees were estimated using US entry data from 2002-11.
Researchers have discovered a new microsporidian parasite, Nematida displere, that infects the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans with a unique tissue tropism, invading multiple tissues including epidermis, muscle, neurons, and intestine. Despite invading the intestine, little replication occurs there, with most replication happening in muscle and epidermis, distinguishing it from related pathogens N. paris and N. sp.1 that exclusively infect and replicate in the intestine. The N. displere genome reveals over 10% of proteins belong to a species-specific family of RING-domain proteins of unknown function that may mediate interactions with the host. Whole-genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis places N. displere in the Nematida genus as the earliest diverging species. N. displere is the first pathogen to infect neurons, muscle, and coelomocytes of C. elegans. Infection is dependent on C. elegans feeding, consistent with other invertebrate-infecting microsporidia. The discovery of N.ere presents a model to study mechanistic and evolutionary bases of pathogen tissue tropism, providing a powerful whole-animal model to investigate factors responsible for pathogen growth in different niches.
The Cockayne syndrome complementation group B protein is essential for transcription-coupled DNA repair and mutations in this protein are associated with Cockayne syndrome, a disease characterized by premature aging, sun sensitivity, and neurological and developmental defects. Research has shown that the protein belongs to the SWI2/SNF ATP-dependent chromatin remodeler family, but its chromatin remodeling activity and role in DNA repair were unknown. The study reveals that the protein repositions nucleosomes in an ATP-dependent manner and this activity is enhanced by NAP-like histone chaperones, newly identified as binding partners. The combined chromatin remodeling by the protein and NAP-like chaperones is required for efficient transcription-coupled DNA repair. The study demonstrates that chromatin remodeling and protein recruitment by the protein are separable activities. The collaboration between the protein and NAP-like chaper adds to understanding of how ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone chaper regulate chromatin structure. The results provide insights into chromatin remodeling by the protein in transcription-coupled DNA repair and mechanisms of Cockayne syndrome. The study used in vitro and in vivo assays to characterize the protein's activity, showing it can reposition nucleosomes and this is enhanced by NAP-like histone chaper. The findings indicate the protein has two functions in transcription-coupled repair: protein recruitment and nucleosome remodeling, with specific residues critical for NAP-like histone interaction and chromatin activity.
A survey of inter-individual variation in DNA methylation has identified environmentally responsive co-regulated networks of epigenetic variation in the human genome. Variably Methylated Regions (VMRs) are clusters of CpGs with high inter-individual epigen variation found in purified cell types, occurring preferentially at enhancers and 3' UTRs. While most VMRs have high heritability, a subset show correlated variation in trans, forming co-regulated networks with low heritability, differing between cell types, and enriched for transcription factor sites and biological pathways relevant to each tissue. Networks include 95 co-regulated VMs in T cells for T-cell activation, 34 in fibroblasts for tissue growth, and 18 in neurons for synaptic signaling. Culturing genetically-identical fibroblasts under varying conditions demonstrated VM networks responsive to environment, with methylation changing in a coordinated fashion. These environmentally-responsive VMs are enriched for imprinted loci, suggesting sensitivity to environmental conditions. The study provides a map of epigen variation, showing genetic and environmental causes underlie this variation. VMs co-localize with functional features, influencing gene expression, and form cis and trans-regulated networks for transcription factor sites and cell-type functions. Environmental effects on methylation at VMs were experimentally demonstrated, revealing signatures overlapping population-level datasets, providing insights into variable methylation biology across the human genome.
A study evaluated the performance of the Panbio Dengue Early Rapid test for detecting dengue virus nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and its combination with a commercial IgM/Ig rapid test for diagnosing dengue. The test was assessed in Vietnam with 198 laboratory-confirmed and 100 negative samples and in Malaysia with 263 laboratory-confirmed and 30 samples. The sensitivity and specificity in Vietnam were 69.2% and 96% and in Malaysia 68.9% and 96.7% compared to RT-PCR. Combining the Dengue Rapid with Ig/Ig test increased sensitivity to 93%. Using NS1 detection with IgM and IgG serology increased sensitivity and extended the detection window for acute deng diagnosis. The study found optimal sensitivity was achieved when NS1 testing was combined with Ig and Ig detection with a significant increase compared to individual markers. The combination resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity to 89% in Malaysia. The Panbio Dengue Rapid is a sensitive and specific test for deng NS1 and when used with Ig/Ig test increases sensitivity for acute deng with an extended detection window. The clinical utility of immunochromatographic testing for deng is enhanced by using NS1 detection in combination with anti-glycoprotein IgM and IgG serology.
Researchers have developed a new computational method, Transat, to detect conserved helices of high statistical significance in RNA structures, including transient, pseudo-knotted, and alternative structures. Existing RNA structure prediction methods assume a unique functional structure and do not account for in vivo folding features. Transat predicts structural features of known reference structures, pseudo-knotted structures, and alternative configurations, and identifies unstructured sequences bound by other molecules. The method provides evidence for new helices that define folding pathways and supports the notion that homologous RNA sequences fold similarly. The predicted features differ from those assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. Unlike existing methods, Trans works comparatively, highlighting conserved features without requiring detailed knowledge of the cellular environment. Experimental validation of RNA structures is limited, and computational methods make simplifying assumptions. Transat predicts novel helices corresponding to conserved features of co-transcriptional folding, supporting the idea that homologous sequences fold similarly. The predictions will enable comprehensive studies of RNA pathways and alternative configurations, providing input for future experiments. Transat's performance was evaluated and shown to predict structural features of known structures, including pseudo-knotted ones, and alternative configurations, providing new insights into RNA folding in vivo.
Plant immunity is controlled by a complex network that must function effectively even when components are targeted and disabled by pathogens. The Arabidopsis immune network, which mediates Pattern-Triggered-Immunity, is comprised of four sub-networks: salicylate, jasmonate, ethylene, and phytoalexin-deficient 4 signaling sectors. A network reconstitution strategy was used to resolve systems-level mechanisms underlying the Arabidopsis transcriptome response to the immune stimulant flagellin-22, revealing widespread interactions among sectors and buffering. Regulatory mechanisms show that jasmon, ethylene, phyalexin-deficient 4, and salicate signaling control transcriptional response to flagellin22 in unexpected patterns. Many regulatory mechanisms are not detectable by traditional single-gene null-mutant analysis, similar to pathogenic perturbations, null-mut effects on immune signaling can be buffered by the network. The network is highly buffered, allowing parts to compensate for loss of another's functions, concealing the identity of components when one is disabled. This resilience is crucial in plants, which lack adaptive immunity, as pathogens target and disable immune proteins. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a systems biology approach, network reconstitution, to elucidate dynamical functions of the plant signaling network and reveals high-order perturbation at the scale of signaling and transcriptional profiling can decipher complex network regulation.
The development of the central nervous system involves the patterning of monolayered neuroepithelial sheets into distinct domains, allowing for increased neuronal diversity in a controlled spatial and temporal manner. In Drosophila, neuroepithelial patterning of the embryonic optic placode gives rise to the larval eye primordium and optic lobe primord, which develop into photoreceptor precursors and optic ganglia. A genetic network regulates the balance between larval eye and optic lobe precursors, with proneural factor Atonal specifying larval precursors and orphan receptor Tailless specifying optic lobe precursors. Hedgehog and Notch signaling pathways act upstream to coordinate precursor specification. Notch signaling controls binary cell fate decisions, defining photoreceptor subtype identity through a cascade of transcription interactions. The non-overlapping expression of Ato and T marks domains giving rise to larval precursors and optic lobe primium. During embryonic development, the optic placode produces larval photoreceptors and optic lobe precursors. Transcription regulators and signaling pathways define distinct domains, with Notch regulating A expression and maintaining epithelial fate. Inhibiting Notch leads to transformation of the optic placode to larval photoreceptors. The study characterizes the genetic mechanisms controlling early and late steps in specifying photoreceptor versus non-photoreceptor fate, providing a model of combinatorial action of extrinsic and intrinsic factors controlling neural patterning.
Human Beta Defensin 1 (hBD1) is a ubiquitously expressed endogenous antimicrobial peptide that exhibits distinct activities in its oxidized and reduced forms. Electron microscopy revealed a net-like structure surrounding bacteria treated with the reduced form of hBD, but not the oxidized form. The reduced hBD-derived nets capture bacteria and inhibit bacterial transmigration independent of killing, preventing migration of hBD-resistant pathogens. The presence of nets is stable in human duodenal secretion with high proteases, and cysteins are necessary for net formation. This redox-dependent function serves as an additional mechanism of action for hBD, differing from other defensins like Paneth-derived human-defin 6 (HD6). The reduced form provides host protection by entrapping bacteria in extracellular structures, preventing invasion. hBD has multifunctional activities, including antimicrobial mechanisms from a single peptide, with post-translational modifications controlled by the local environment. The thioredoxin system transforms oxidized hBD into reduced form, which forms nets, entrapping bacteria. This mechanism is distinct from HD6 net formation, indicating a broad spectrum of evolutionarily conserved resistance mechanisms. The presence of hBDred in human colonic tissue mucus highlights its role in shaping microbiota, utilizing multiple strategies to combat bacterial challenges.
Researchers investigated the role of the OCRL protein in endocytosis in the zebrafish pronephric tubule, a model for the mammalian renal tubule, to understand the underlying basis of renal tubulopathy in Lowe syndrome and Dent disease. They found that OCRL deficiency causes a defect in endocytosis, coinciding with reduced levels of scavenger receptor megalin and accumulation in endocytic compartments, and reduced early endocytic compartments and enlarged vacuolar endosomes in pronephric cells. Cell polarity was unaffected, but mild ciliogenesis defects were observed. The catalytic activity of OCRL is required for renal tubular endocytosis, and the defect can be rescued by suppression of PIPK. Results indicate OCRL is necessary for endytic trafficking in vivo, supporting the hypothesis that endocytic defects cause renal tubulopathy in Lowe and Dent disease. Suppression of PIPK restored endytosis, megal levels, and endosome morphology to wild-type levels, highlighting the importance of Ptd(4,5)P2 for endytic trafficking in the renal tubule, suggesting PIPK as a potential therapeutic target for Lowe and Dent disease. The study provides the first evidence of OCRL regulating endytic trafficking in vivo and supports its role in endytic recycling within the proximal tubule.
A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the Kilombero River Valley, Tanzania, to investigate inter-epidemic transmission of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) in livestock. The study found an overall seroprevalence of 11.3% in randomly selected cattle and sheep, with 5.5% in animals born after the 2007 outbreak and 22.7% in animals present during the outbreak. There was a linear increase in prevalence in post-epidemic annual cohorts and 9 inhibition-ELISA samples were positive for RVV IgM antibodies, indicating recent infection. Spatial distribution showed hotspots and sex difference in seroprevalence was significant in animals present during the outbreak. Animals living >15 km from the flood plain were more likely to have antibodies than those <5 km. Species, breed, composition, grazing, and altitude were not associated with serositivity. Findings indicate post-epemic transmission of RVV with constant exposure and active foci preceding the survey. RV is a mosquito-borne zoonosis affecting livestock and wild ruminants with cycles of 5-15 years in Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa following high precipitations and flooding. The study used commercial ELISA kits detecting IgM and IgG antibodies in serum and structured interviews with herd owners.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, has a conserved a contractile vacuole complex to regulate osmolarity. Researchers investigated the role of Rab11 in trafficking glycosylphatidylinositol-anchored proteins to the plasma membrane and promoting host invasion. Rab11 localized to the contractile vacole complex, while a dominant negative mutant localized to the cytosol, and epimastotes expressing this mutant were less responsive to hyposotic and hyperosmotic stress. Trans-sialase, a GPI-anchored protein, co-localized with Rab11 to the contractile vacole during transformation and was prevented from reaching the plasma membrane in mutants, reducing infectivity. Incubation with exogenous active transialase and sial donor partially rescued infectivity. Results reveal Rab11's role in osmoregulation and trafficking transialase to the plasma and a novel mechanism of GPI-anchored protein secretion. Transialase catalyzes the transfer of sial acid from host proteins to parasite mucins and is trafficked to the plasma by an unconventional pathway involving the contractile vacole enriched in lipid rafts. Expression of dominant negative Rab11 altered morphology, osmoregulation, traffic of transialase, and parasite infectivity, indicating contractile vacole localization is GTP-dependent.
A phase III clinical trial compared the immunogenicity and safety of a purified chick-embryo rabies vaccine administered according to a shortened post-exposure prophylaxis 4-site/1-week intradermal regimen with the currently recommended 2-site Thai Red Cross regimen. The study enrolled healthy individuals aged 1 year and above, randomized into groups to receive intradermal vaccine with or without human rabies immunoglobulin. Results showed non-inferity of the 4-site/1 regimen to the 2-site regimen at day 49, with all participants achieving adequate rabies neutralizing antibody concentrations by day 14. Geometric mean concentrations peaked at 18 IU/mL in 4/1 groups and 12 IU in 2/TR groups at day 14 and declined subsequently. Administration of human immunoglobulin resulted in lower concentrations. Both regimens had similar safety profiles with no vaccination-related serious events. Data suggests the 4/1 regimen may be an alternative to current recommendations, offering improved cost and compliance benefits. Non-inferity was demonstrated with a lower limit of 95 confidence interval for the difference in percentage of participants with adequate concentrations greater than -5, meeting the primary objective of assessing nonferior immune response at day 49.
The human brain's ability to detect and attend to salient goal-relevant events is facilitated by the salience network, anchored in the anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Leveraging subsecond resolution large-session fMRI datasets from the Human Connectome Project and novel graph-theoretical techniques, researchers investigated the dynamic spatiotemporal organization of the salience network. Results show the network's large-scale dynamics are characterized by high flexibility in time-varying connectivity with other networks, including frontoparietal, cingulo-opercular, ventral, and dorsal attention networks. The salience network demonstrated the most spatially varied dynamic interactions and maintained high network centrality over time, indicating it is a hub for cross-network interactions. Time-varying connectivity profiles were distinct from other prefrontal control systems and predicted individual differences in cognitive flexibility. These findings were replicated in a second dataset, demonstrating robustness. The study provides insights into the distinct functional architecture of the salience network and its position to facilitate interactions with multiple systems, supporting cognitive processes. The salience network has a unique spatiemporal organization with high temporal flexibility, diversity, and centrality, distinct from other cognitive systems, including frontoparietal and dorsal attention networks.
The SV40 late protein VP4 is a viropin that forms pores to disrupt membranes for viral release. Nonenveloped viruses, such as SV40, assemble in the nucleus and must be released from the host cell without being encapsulated by cellular membranes. VP4, a newly identified SV40 gene product, is expressed late during the viral cycle corresponding to the time of cell lysis. Purified VP4 efficiently binds and disrupts biological membranes by interacting with the bilayer, releasing fluorescent markers into unilamellar vesicles or liposomes. The hydrophobic domain of VP is essential for membrane binding and disruption, with a preference for lipids replicating plasma membrane composition over nuclear membranes. Phosphidylethanol inhibits membrane perforation activity of VP. Disruption involves formation of ∼3 nm diameter pores in mammalian cells, including permissive SV40 host cells. Results support VP acting as a viropin in perforating cellular membranes to trigger SV40 release. The release of viral particles by cell lysis after assembly ensures efficient spread of the virus. Deleting the hydroobic domain abolishes membrane activity, indicating its role in lysis. VP forms ∼3 diameter pores in mammalian membranes, supporting its central role in disrupting cellular membranes for SV40 release.
Dengue virus is a significant public health problem in tropical and subtropical areas, with an estimated half of the worldwide population at risk of infection due to the absence of antivirals or a vaccine. A DNA vaccine, pcANS1, containing the signal sequence from human tissue plasminogen activator fused to the DENV NS1 gene, induced protection against dengue in mice. The vaccine elicited robust anti-NS antibodies and T cell responses, with passive immunization conferring partial protection against low viral loads. CD4 and CD8 T cells were activated, producing IFN-γ and cytotoxic activity, but CD4 cells were crucial for protection. Depletion of CD4 cells abolished protection, while transfer of CD4 cells and anti-NS antiserum from vaccinated mice resulted in survival rates similar to pcANS-immunized animals. The results indicate cooperation between CD4 T cells and humoral immunity is critical for protection against deng mediated by the NS antigen. Both humoral and cellular responses are necessary for effective protection, with neither alone being sufficient. The study provides insights into immunity elicited by DENV NS antigen and prospects for vaccine development, highlighting the potential of DNA immunization as a tool to induce both arms of the immune system.
Researchers have elucidated the structure-function relationship of the transcription factor ComR, a member of the RNPP family, which controls natural transformation in streptocci. ComR is activated by binding of its pheromone XIP, inducing release of the sequestered HTH domain and dimerization, allowing DNA binding. This mechanism is conserved and specific to ComR orthologues, demonstrating ComR is not an Rgg protein but a new RNPP family member. Identification of X and ComR residues is crucial for designing antagonistic strategies to control gene exchanges among streptocci. The ComR regulon includes com and comX genes and recognizes pseudo-palindromic 20p sequences called Com-box. Phylogenetic Rgg subusters include hydrophobic peptides-associated Rgg and Com regulators, widespread in Firmicutes and streptocci, regulating biofilm, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence. The ComRS system has not been explored, unlike the two-component ComDE system regulating competence in Streptoc pneumoniae via σX in response to extracellular Competence-Stimulating-Peptide. The structure of ComR from Streptoccus thermophilus combined with mutational analysis and in vivo assays proposes an original molecular mechanism of ComR regulation, offering opportunities to engineer peptide-based systems in streptocci and Gram-positive bacteria.
Researchers have characterized the prokaryotic pentameric ligand-gated ion channel ELIC, a member of a large family of ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors, through electrophysiology and X-ray crystallography. ELIC is activated by primary amines, including the neurotransmitter GABA, at high to millimolar concentrations, binding to a conserved site and evoking currents that desensitize over time. The protein forms cation-selective channels with properties similar to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. ELIC is activated by a set of primary amines including alkamines, aminothiols, aminoalcohols, bromamines, and diamines. With known agonists, EL has become amenable for detailed structural and functional investigations into mechanisms of ion conduction and gating. The channel is impermeable to anions and closely related to nicotinic accholine receptors and serotonin receptors. The binding of ligands induces channel activation over a large distance in a different part of the protein, with interaction with the protein likely being stronger, fulfilling an important requirement for ligand activation. The crystal structure of ELIC shows a non-conducting conformation of the channel in the absence of ligands, its relationship to the resting or desensitized state and eukaryotic receptors is unknown. EL provides an attractive model to study general mechanisms of ion conduction and gating in neurotransmitter receptors due to its high single channel conductance and simple behavior.
Researchers investigated the progression from atopic dermatitis to asthma, a common in individuals with eczema, and found skin-derived thymic stromal lymphopoietin triggers bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Mice with skin-barrier defects developed AD-like inflammation and were susceptible to allergic asthma due to overexpressed TSL by keratinocytes. Elimination of TSL signaling blocked the atopic march, demonstrating high serum TSL levels were required to sensitize the lung to inflammation. Epider-derived TSL was sufficient to trigger the atopic march, sensitizing lung airways to inhaled allergens without epicutaneous sensitization. TSL overexpression in skin led to AD-like pathology and predisposed mice to asthmatic phenotype. Removal of ILR subunit of TSL receptor prevented atopic march despite AD pathology and elevated IgE levels. High systemic TSL availability sensitized lung to allergens, providing a novel mechanism for atopic march. Defective skin function caused AD-like inflammation and asthma susceptibility. Deleting TSL receptor blocked asthma in mice with persistent AD pathology. Skin-barrier impairment promoted distant atopy in lung via systemic diffusible cytokine, not requiring epicutaneous sensitization. Findings suggest selective inhibition of systemic TSL may block asthma development in atopic dermatitis patients, in addition to treating primary skin defects.
The genome of Thermotoga maritima, a phylogenetically deep-branching hyperthermophilic bacterium, has been characterized using an integrated approach that combines multiple omics datasets with bioinformatics tools. The analysis revealed distinctive properties of the T. maritima genome, including a high number of genes per transcription unit, a paucity of putative non-coding RNAs, and few transcription units with multiple transcription start sites. Quantitative analysis of promoters and ribosome binding sites showed increased sequence conservation relative to other bacteria. The 5' untranslated regions follow an atypical bimodal length distribution and transcriptional regulation is limited by a lack of intergenic space for the majority of transcription units. A high fraction of annotated genes are expressed independent of growth state and a correlation of mRNA/protein is observed. These properties are hypothesized to be a reflection of the organism's hyperthermophilic lifestyle and could yield insights into the evolutionary trajectory of microbial life on earth. Genome-scale analysis showed T. maritima encodes a highly conserved, robust architecture that ensures transcription initiation. The integrated approach enabled experimentally anchored annotation of several genomic features, including protein-coding genes, functional RNAs, non-coding RNAs, transcription units, promoters, ribosome sites, and regulatory sites. Translational evidence supports high expression of T. marima, with peptide detected for 74% of annotated proteins, and mRNA and protein abundances are tightly linked.
Visual object recognition is influenced by contextual inputs, with observers more likely to perceive a target when context has weaker contrast and less likely when context has stronger contrast. A Bayesian model of visual inference accounts for the data, illustrating context influences perception in two ways: biasing observers' prior belief that a target should be present according to visual principles and biasing internal model of likely contrasts caused by a target. Low-contrast contextual bars aligned with the target bias observers to perceive a target, even with zero contrast in the image, as the context fills in the target. High-contrast bars, regardless of grouping with the target, bias observers to perceive no target. The study investigates how context biases perception of visual inputs, specifically presence or absence of a bar at a central location with low or zero contrast, in the context of other bars. The filling-in bias is stronger with weaker contrasts and when the target is seen as likely to group with context as a straight line. The findings can be accounted for by a Bayesian inference and decision model, assessing whether the target or noise is inferred as the cause of luminance profile at the target location.
Cooperation in the production of common goods is observed throughout nature, despite being vulnerable to exploitation by defectors who consume without contributing. However, population collapse due to defectors can lead to small population sizes, which favor cooperation in structured populations. Defectors can occasionally go extinct before cooperators by chance, allowing cooperators to grow. Empty locations, either preexisting or created by defector-induced extinction, favor cooperators over defectors. Resource limitation, induced by defectors, selects for adaptive mutations that reduce local population size, favoring cooperation. The presence of defectors increases heterogeneity in population dynamics, reducing simultaneous extinction. Selection for rare mutants adapted to resource limitation introduces a bottleneck, facilitating cooperation survival. Defectors create conditions that rescue cooperation through three mechanisms: defector extinction before cooperators, empty locations favoring cooperators, and resource limitation selecting adaptive mutations. These factors generate variation in cooperator frequency, promoting cooperation. Small population sizes, precipitated by defectors, provide a built-in mechanism for cooperation persistence. The initial presence of defectors can improve survival of cooperators when a subpopulation mutates to defectors. Defectors lead to conditions that rescue cooperation from defector-induced destruction, allowing cooperators to outgrow defectors globally despite defectors outgrowing cooperators locally.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogens, interacts with polarized epithelium, adhering almost exclusively at sites of multicellular junctions where numerous bacteria attach to extruded apoptotic or apoptotic cells. This dead cell tropism is independent of the type of cell death, as P. aeruginosa also binds to necrotic cells. P. aeruginosa is internalized through efferocytosis, a process in which surrounding epithelial cells engulf and dispose of extruded apoptotic cells. Intracellularly, along apoptotic cell debris, P. aeruga inhabits an efferytic phagosome that acquires lysosomal features and is finally killed. The elimination of P. aeruginosa through efferocytosis is proposed as part of a host defense mechanism. In healthy individuals, apoptotic cells are quickly removed, but contexts favoring the presence of dead cells may offer an opportunity for P. aerugin colonization. Apoptotic cells or apoptotic bodies with P. aerugin associated to their surface could be targets for professional phagocytes. While some bacteria may escape, findings highlight epithelial ability to eliminate P. aerugin through efferytosis. The dead tropism of P. aerugin could contribute to colonization of damaged epithelia. P. aerugin is internalized by epithelial cells through efferosis and eliminated intracellularly after 24 hours.
The development of the Drosophila embryonic gonad involves the migration of primordial germ cells (PGCs) to somatic gonadal precursor cells (SGs) guided by a combination of repulsive and attractive cues. The hedgehog (hh) pathway plays a crucial role in this process, with the shifted (sh) gene facilitating long-distance transmission of hh signaling through the proteoglycan matrix. sh is expressed in the gonadal mesoderm and is required for PG migration. The hmg-dependent isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway generates a PG attractant produced by SGs, which depends on sh and another hh gene, g1. Ectopic expression of hmg in the nervous system promotes release of hh into the mesoderm, where it can contact migrating PGs. Potentiation of hh by hmg appears to depend on cholesterol modification. Previous studies indicate sh mRNA is maternally deposited and uniformly distributed in blastoderm embryos. The hh signaling pathway plays a role in patterning, morphogenesis, cell migration, and axonal guidance, requiring signaling to nearby and distant cells. Factors involved in basol release and transmission of hh also function in directing PG migration to SG during embryogenesis. Attractive signals produced by SG guide PG migration, with hh potentially functioning as a PG attractant, and sh having a role in this process.
Researchers investigated the cytotoxic capacity of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells in recipients of a trivalent adenovirus type 5 HIV recombinant vaccine and compared it to HIV-negative individuals and chronically infected patients, including long-term nonprogressors. The study found detectable HIV-specific CD8 T-cell cytotoxic responses in vaccinees at a median of 331 days following immunization, with a magnitude not related to the number of vaccinations or cytokine-secreting T-cells. The cytotoxic capacity of vaccinees was less than long-term nonprogressors but overlapped with progressors. However, vaccine recipients carrying HLA class I alleles B27, B57, or B58, associated with immune control over HIV replication, showed higher cytotoxic responses. The findings suggest protective HLA class alleles may lead to better outcomes in both chronic infection and immunization due to efficient priming of HIV-specific CD8 T-cell cytotoxic responses. Measurements of granzyme B target activity and infected CD4 T-cell elimination were used to assess antiviral activities in vaccine recipients, with significant responses present in vaccinees compared to HIV-negative controls. The results indicate long-lived memory cells were induced with the vaccine strategy, providing insight into mechanisms of protection from HIV infection or control of replication, essential for future vaccine design.
The evolution of modern human cognition is hypothesized to have been catalyzed by the development of jointly intentional modes of behavior, with a high degree of collaborative behavior amongst early hominins relative to other apes aiding the development of rich cognitive abilities found in humans. The emergence of shared intentions is linked to significant technological advance, with composite tool manufacture and grammatical language evolving contemporaneously around 300,000 years ago, facilitating jointly behavior. This study formally models the co-evolution of intentional behavior and cumulative culture, showing that rapid techno-cultural advance goes hand in hand with the emergence of the ability to participate in jointly intentional behavior. Conversely, in the absence of opportunities for techno-cultural improvement, the ability to undertake joint behavior is selected against. The results derive from the effects of jointly behavior on the speed of convergence to improved technological norms, linking technology adoption to the evolution of collaboration. The study provides a unified mechanism for the suppression or emergence of shared intentions and collaborative behavior in humans, as well as a potential cause of inter-species diversity in the prevalence of such behavior.
Male fertility requires the production of high-quality, motile spermatozoa in abundance, and alterations in this process can lead to oligoasthenatozoospermia, a common cause of human infertility. Researchers investigated the role of microRNA (miRNA) in post-meiotic spermatogenesis and identified the miR-34 family, specifically miR-34b and miR449, as highly expressed in post-meiotic male germ cells. Deletion of both miR34 and mi449 loci in mice resulted in oligoasthenatoospermia, characterized by low sperm count, aberrant morphology, and impaired motility. Analysis of miR34bc-deficient pachytene spermatocytes revealed deregulated genes enriched for miR34 target genes. The loss of miR34bc did not block spermatogenesis but impaired developmental transitions, resulting in phenotypic hallmarks of oligoasthenatoospermia. Histological analysis showed thinning of epithelium in seminiferous tubules, reduced mature sperm quantity and quality, and aberrant morphology. Motility of mi34bc-deficient sperm was severely affected, leading to infertility. The mi34 family has multiple functions during spermatogenesis, regulating meiosis and later stages of spermiogenesis. The study identifies mi34b and mi449 as the first miRNA loci required for mammalian spermatogenesis, whose deregulation is causal to oligoasthenospermia and infertility. The findings present loss of specific miAs as a definitive event in the genesis of oligoasthenospermia, a major cause of male infertility in humans.
Escherichia coli Niss 191 (EcN) has been used therapeutically for over a century, but the determinants of its probiotic properties remain elusive. Ec produces siderophore-microcins responsible for antagonistic activity against other Enterobacteraceae and synthesizes the genotoxin colibin, a virulence and putative pro-carcinogenic compound. The pks-encoded ClP peptidase activates colibin and is required for antagonistic activity, with its transmembrane helices involved in Mcc biosynthesis or secretion. A single amino acid substitution in ClP inactivates genotoxic activity while maintaining antagonistic activity. In an in vivo salmonelis model, this mutant reduced clinical signs and fecal shedding similarly to the wild strain. ClP-dependent antibacterial effect was observed in vitro with other E. coli strains carrying truncated Mcc gene and pks island, requiring glucyltransferase Iro involved in salmoch production. The interplay between colibin, saloch, and sideroph-M biosynthetic pathways suggests co-selection in evolution of E. coli phylogroup B2, illustrating the margin between pathogenic and probiotic activity. Decoupling antagonistic from genotoxic activity by inactivating ClP opens the way to safe use of EcN, optimizing its effectiveness and safety as a probiotic.
Cryptococcus neoformans, a leading cause of fungal meningitis worldwide, relies on glycans for survival and pathogenesis. The synthesis of these glycans requires nucleotide sugars, which are produced in the cytosol and transported to the secretory pathway by nucleotide transporters. The major virulence factor of C. neoans is its polysaccharide capsule, composed of glucuronoxylomannan and glucuronylomannogalactan, which acts as a barrier against host defenses and immune modulator. Xylose, a neutral monosaccharide, is a significant component of the capsule. Researchers identified Uxt1 and Uxt as transporters specific for xylose donor UDP-xylose and galacturan donor UDP-galacturan, exhibiting distinct subcellular localization, expression, and kinetic parameters. Both transporters are necessary for xylose incorporation into the capsule and required for C. neoans to cause disease in mice, but not for fungal viability. The findings elucidate the substrate specificity of nucleotide transporters, glycan biosynthesis, and contribute to understanding glycobiology, providing a potential target for therapy. Glycans play structural and regulatory roles in fungal survival and pathogenesis, with the polysacchar capsule being a key virulence factor. The study expands understanding of cryptoccal glycan biosynthesis and sets the stage for further research on mechanisms of cryptoccal pathogenesis and host response.
A global database for mapping, control, and surveillance of neglected tropical diseases is being developed to provide open-access to available data for researchers and disease managers. The database initially focused on schistosomiasis in Africa, with over 12,000 georeferenced survey locations from 35 countries, and is now expanding to include other diseases such as soil-transmitted helminthias and leishmanis. Data was extracted from peer-reviewed journals, grey literature, and Ministries of Health, and stored in a MySQL database with a web interface for free access and management. The database offers opportunities for disease modeling, targeting interventions, monitoring, and surveillance, as well as geostatistical analyses of disease distribution in space and time. The goal is to extend the database to include other neglected tropical diseases such as ascariasis, hookworm, trichuris, lymphatic filari, onchercis, and trachoma. Systematic searches of electronic databases were conducted to retrieve relevant publications with emphasis on schosomiasis prevalence in Africa. The database provides location-specific data, while other projects like GAHI focus on country-specific risk estimates. The open-access database is available at http://www.gd.org and aims to support disease control and elimination efforts.
Chronic helminth infections induce a Th2 immune shift and establish an immunoregulatory milieu, which can suppress Th1 immunity necessary for controlling Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MT) infection. However, a study using cotton rats as a model found that chronic helmin infections do not exacerbate MT infection. Immunological responses, histological studies, and mycobacterial cultures were assessed two months after MT challenge in rats with and without L. sigmodis infection. Results showed similar spleen cell proliferation and interferon production between co-infected and MT-only animals. MT loads and lung granuloma size were not increased in co-infected animals. Histological and quantitative MT cultures demonstrated equivalent or reduced mycobacterial burden in co-infected animals compared to MT-only infected. MT infection in rats results in discrete granulomas containing macrophages and mycobacteria similar to human tuberculosis. Chronic helmin infection did not alter MT control in the rat model, suggesting filaria eradication may not facilitate MT control, but worm-derived therapies for autoimmune diseases may not increase infection risk. Systemic helmin-induced immunomodulation can be overcome in active MT infection, confirmed in cotton chronically infected L. sigis.
Researchers investigated the role of degenerin/epithelial sodium channels (DEG/ENaC) in Drosophila melanaster, specifically the ppk23 channel, and found it is expressed in a subpopulation of sexually dimorphic gustatory chemosensory bristles distinct from those expressing feeding-related gustatory receptors. Disrupting or inhibiting pp23 activity did not alter gustatory responses, but blocking pp23-positive neurons or mutating the pp23 gene delayed and reduced male courtship initiation and intensity. Mutations in pp23 altered male response to the female aphrodisiac pherone 7,11-heptacosene, indicating pp23 plays a role in the peripheral sensory system determining sexual behavior. Data suggest pp23 is a candidate for pherone receptor or key component of pheromal signaling, contributing to sensory functions underlying sex-related behaviors. pp23-expressing cells play a role in male-female courtship, not feeding, with pp23 required for normal courtship and attraction to aphrodisiac pherone in males. Null pp23 allele males showed longer courtship latency and reduced courtship, while deletion of pp28 had no impact, supporting pp23's role in chemosensory functions. Overall, DE/ENa signaling contributes to sensory functions underlying sex-related behaviors, indicating a novel function for this family of ion channels.
Mitochondria from diverse phyla, including protozoa, fungi, higher plants, and humans, import tRNAs from the cytosol to ensure proper mitochondrial translation. In the unicellular green alga Chlamonas, a correlation was found between mitochondrial codon usage and the nature and amount of imported tRNAs, leading to the hypothesis that tRNA import might adapt to the mitochondrial genome. By manipulating Chlamdomonas' mitochondrial genome, mutations were introduced to modify codon usage, resulting in reduced levels of mitochondrial translation and decreased activities of respiratory complexes due to limitations of tRNAs in mitochondria. This indicates tRNA import cannot be rapidly regulated in response to a novel genetic context, suggesting steady-state levels of imported tRN result from co-evolution between tRNA mechanism and mitochondrial translation requirements. Fine-tuning in Chlamdomonas mitochondria between tRNA and codon usage originates from co-evolution rather than dynamic adaptation of cytos tRNA import. Mitochondrial tRNA import cannot adapt rapidly in Chlamonas, codon bias affects translation efficiency, and information in mitochondrial DNA does not regulate tRNA import. Steady-state levels of tRN correlate with codon usage, suggesting levels defined by mitochondrial DNA for optimal translation.
Diabetes affects nearly 30 million people in the United States, with another 84 million being prediabetic, and up to 70% of these individuals may progress to type 2 diabetes without intervention. Current methods for quantifying glucose dysregulation are limited by single-point measurements or average glycemia, neglecting glucose dynamics. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) was used to evaluate postprandial glucose elevations, patterns, and variability between individuals given an identical nutrient challenge. An analytical framework was developed to group individuals by glycemic responses, called "glucotypes", revealing heterogeneity within traditional diagnostic categories. Individuals considered normoglycemic by standard measures exhibited high glucose variability, reaching prediabetic and diabetic ranges 15% and 2% of the time. Glucose dysregulation, characterized by CG, is more prevalent and heterogeneous than thought, affecting normogcemic individuals, with variable physiology reflected in glycemic responses. Extensive phenotyping led to a model for identifying mechanisms of glucose dysregulation and a webtool for visualizing CG profiles and classifying glucotypes. Increased glucose variability may precede abnormal levels, representing an earlier "prediabetes" stage, with longer studies needed to determine predictive value for type 2 diabetes. Glucotypes were related to insulin secretion, resistance, and concentrations, demonstrating heterogeneity in insulin metabolism and glucose profiles. Models for glucose dysregulation were developed, relating patterns to glucose intolerance, diabetes, and metabolic measures, including insulin resistance and secretion. Severe glycemic variability was present in 25% of normogcemic individuals, reaching prediabetic or diabetic levels 15 and 2% of time, potentially enhancing prediction of diabetes progression risk.
Mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades play a crucial role in regulating plant defense responses. The Raf-like MAP kinase kinase EDR1 negatively regulates plant defense and cell death, but its function and impact on MAP kinase cascades are not well understood. EDR1 physically interacts with MKK4 and MK5, requiring the N-terminal domain of EDR, and negatively regulates the MK4/MK5-MPK3/MP6 cascade in Arabidopsis. EDR mutants have increased MPK3/MP6 activity and protein levels compared to wild type, while EDR also affects MK4/MK5 protein levels. Mutations in mpk3, mkk, and mkk suppress ed1-mediated resistance, and overexpression of MK4 or MK5 causes ed1-like mildew-induced cell death. EDR associates with MK4/MK5 and negatively regulates the MAP cascade to modulate plant immunity. EDR functions as a negative regulator of plant defense, with ed1 mutants showing enhanced resistance to pathogens and ethylene-induced senescence. Loss-of-function mutants of mkk and mkk display susceptibility to powdery mildew, and ed1-mediated resistance requires MK4 and MK5 function, indicating they are key players in plant immunity. EDR directly interacts with MK4 and MK5, affecting protein levels of MK4, MK5, MP3, and MP6, fine-tuning plant defense responses.
Infectious diseases are a major global healthcare concern, causing millions of deaths annually, and effective control strategies require reliable computational tools to understand disease dynamics and predict future cases. A computational framework based on Gaussian processes was developed to perform spatiotemporal prediction of infectious diseases, leveraging the structure of similarity matrices for efficient implementation. The framework was tested on Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever cases in Turkey between 2004 and 2015, showing better results than standard machine learning algorithms, including random forests and boosted trees, under temporal, spatial, and spatiemporal prediction scenarios. Gaussian processes were used to identify nonlinear dependencies and make reliable predictions, capturing complex relationships better than tree-based algorithms. The framework combines similarity matrices to obtain a larger matrix between location and time pairs, training a Gaussian regression model for predictions under three scenarios: temporal, spatial, and spatiotemporal. Tested on Turkey's surveillance data, the framework demonstrated potential to contribute to public health policy. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, a vector-borne disease with a 5-40% fatality rate, is widespread in Africa, the Balkans, Middle East, and Asia. The framework's performance was benchmarked against baseline algorithms from the literature.
Rift Valley Fever (RV) is a mosquito-borne viral zoonosis in Africa and the Middle East that causes significant human deaths and economic losses due to high incidences of death and abortion among livestock. Researchers proposed a periodic three-patch model to investigate the transmission dynamics of RV virus among ruminants with spatial movements. Findings indicate that human activities, such as Eid al-Adha feast, and climatic factors like rainfall and hydrological variations contribute to the transmission and dispersal of the pathogen. Sporadic outbreaks occur when livestock are recruited to areas at risk due to festival demand and abundant mosquitoes emerge. Numerical results show transmission dynamics over short and long periods, particularly during festival time. Festival and seasonal factors such as livestock importation, transportation, and death by sacrifices impact disease outbreaks. Simulations show earlier festival preparation increases risk of massive outbreaks, particularly in areas where ceremonies are held. Human activities like importation and transportation of livestock have impacts on disease patterns at different locations. Implementing vaccination and interventions can change outbreak patterns. The study evaluates seasonal and festival impacts on RV outbreaks and dispersal, providing information for governments to predict and control the disease.
A study assessed spatial and temporal changes in human anthrax occurrence in Azerbaijan from 1984 to 2010, analyzing data on livestock outbreaks, vaccination efforts, and human incidence during Soviet and post-Soviet governance, and preemptive livestock vaccination. Results showed an 11.95% annual increase in incidence from 198 to 1995, followed by a 35.24% decline after vaccination initiation in 1996. Geographic distribution varied, with cases concentrated in the west initially and shifting eastward over time. Over 20 years post-Soviet, human anthrax in Azerbaijan has undergone marked changes, with decreases in incidence but continued control measures needed in livestock to mitigate occurrence. The shifting patterns highlight the need for an integrated "One Health" approach considering geographic distribution changes. Human cutaneous anthrax was concentrated in the west and south during Soviet governance, shifting east towards the capital in the mid-1990s and remaining in eastern and northern Azerbaijan during vaccination. A 1996 outbreak led to a comprehensive vaccination program, and recent reemergence in the Caucas raises concerns over transboundary spread. Spatial and temporal changes are consistent with previous research on zoonotic diseases post-Soviet dissolution, emphasizing the need for dynamic surveillance and control strategies.
Voltage-gated potassium channels are membrane proteins that respond to changes in membrane potential by enabling K+ ion flux across the membrane. Polyunsaturated fatty acids induce channel opening by modulating voltage-sensitivity, which can provide treatment against refractory epilepsy through a ketogenic diet. Research has shown that polyunsaturated fatty acids interact with the Shaker voltage-gated potassium channel, influencing its gating mechanism through electrostatic interactions with the voltage-sensor domain. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal a putative polyunsaturated fatty acid binding site in the open state of the channel at the protein-lipid interface near the extracellular halves of S3 and S4 helices of the voltage-sensor domain. The lipophilic tail of polyunsaturated fatty acids forms non-specific hydrophobic interactions in the hydrophobic core, while the carboxlic head displays specific interactions with polar/charged residues at extracellular regions of S3 and S4 helices. In contrast, saturated fatty acids show increased conformation flexibility in polyunsaturated tails compared to saturated chains, explaining specificity of polyuns fatty acid action on proteins. Polyuns fatty acids modulate channel functioning by partitioning into the lipid bilayer and interacting with extracellular halves of voltage-sensor domain helices S3 and S4, with a minimum of two double bonds increasing channel currents. Direct polyuns fatty acid interactions have been observed in various voltage-gated channels, including KV1.5, Na, and Ca channels, with both activation and inactivation in KV1.5 and KV2.1 channels. The study provides insight into the molecular basis of polyuns fatty acid interactions with the Shaker voltage-gated potassium channel, shedding light on potential therapeutic applications of ketogenic diets in treating epilepsy.
Cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite responsible for significant disease burden in developing countries and life-threatening enteritis in AIDS patients, with current treatments lacking efficacy. Researchers have developed a pipeline to screen antiparasitic agents targeting Cryptosporium inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, a novel therapeutic target identified through genome sequencing. A related parasite, Toxoplasma gond, was genetically engineered to serve as a model for C. parum infection, allowing for rapid assessment of antiparasitic potential and target specificity. A fluorescence-based host cell proliferation assay and C. parum growth assay utilizing high-content imaging were established for further evaluation. The pipeline identified 1,2,3-triazole ethers exhibiting excellent in vivo selectivity and anti-cryptporial activity. The T.gond model mirrors Cryptosidium purine pathways and depends on inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase for survival, facilitating antiparas activity screening. Two promising candidates, A103 and A110, were identified as >100 times more potent than paromycin, the current standard for anticryptporial activity. The pipeline accelerates the discovery of antiparasitic agents and overcomes the challenge of poor experimental tractability of C. parum.
A genome-wide association study was conducted to identify genetic loci associated with primary tooth development in infancy, analyzing 4,564 individuals from the 1966 Northern Finland Birth Cohort and 1,518 from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Five loci were identified with significant associations, including genes linked to tooth and organ development, such as KCNJ2, EDAR, HOXB2, RAD51, IGF1, IGF1BP, and HMGA2. Genes at four of the identified loci are implicated in cancer development. A variant in the HOXB cluster was associated with occlusion defects requiring orthodontic treatment by age 31. The identified genes have roles in organogenesis, growth, and developmental processes, with mutations leading to altered development in teeth, jaws, hair, sweat glands, and intestines. The study provides insight into the genetic architecture of primary dentition, with implications for understanding developmental and organogenic processes. Variants associated with breast cancer and adult height were also identified, highlighting common pathways between tooth development and other growth processes. The findings suggest genetic determinants of early tooth eruption may associate with dental occlusion later in life.
Researchers created two mouse models, Ts3ah and MsY, with a tandem duplication and deletion of the Hspa13-App interval syntenic to human chromosome 21q11.2-q21.3, to study dosage-sensitive genes involved in Down syndrome and monosomy 21 phenotypes. The trisomy and monosomy of this region altered locomotion, muscle strength, mass, and energetic balance, with global changes in gene regulation of energetic metabolism, mitochondrial activity, and biogenesis in skeletal muscles. Genes were downregulated in Ts3ah mice and upregulated in MsY mice, correlating with changes in mitochondrial proliferation and reactive oxygen species production. The study demonstrated the Hspa-App interval controls metabolic and mitochondrial phenotypes in muscles due to changes in gene dosage of Gabpa, Nrip, and Atp5. Results indicate copy variation in the HspaApp region impacts locomotor activity by altering muscle function. Mouse models Ts3ah and MsY displayed opposite locomotor phenotypes, with impaired coordination attributed to cerebellar or central dysfunction. Analysis revealed 26 downregulated genes in MsY muscles, including App, Atpj, Chl, and Usp, mapping within the monosomic segment. Mitochondrial membrane permeability increased in Tsah, while reactive oxygen production decreased in MsY, without altering respiratory function.
Researchers have developed a quantitative model of the GIRK1/2 channel, a G protein-gated K+ channel activated by Gβ subunits from Gi proteins, to understand its basal and evoked activities. The model reveals that the extent of activation by neurotransmitter is inversely related to basal activity. Experimental results from Xenopus oocytes, HEK cells, and hippocampal neurons show that 3-4 Gβ dimers are available for each GIR1/2 channel, while available Gα decreases from ~2 to less than one per channel as GIR1/2 density increases. The model accurately recapitulates basal and evoked GIR1/2 currents, predicts dose-dependent activation by co-expressed Gβ, and accounts for the inverse correlation between basal activity and agonist index. Analysis suggests a maximal stoichiometry of 4β but only 2 Gα per GIR1/2 channel. The unique association of GIR1/2 with protein subunits underlies the complex pattern of basal and agonist-evoked activities, allowing GIR1/2 to act as a bidirectional detector of Gβ and G. The study provides a quantitative analysis of the GPCR-Gi-GIR/1/2 cascade, focusing on basal and agonist-evoked activities that regulate neuronal excitability. The model allows quantification and simulation of GIR1/2 currents under steady-state conditions and after activation by neurotransmitter or Gβ, revealing GIR/2 as a transducer of inhibitory neurotransmitter effects in heart and brain.
Researchers have developed a novel approach, termed PredTA, to predict targets of transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) secreted by plant-pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria, which act as transcriptional activators on plant genes to support bacterial virulence. The model accounts for recent findings on TALE targeting, including frame-shift binding and flexible strand orientation, and learns parameters from quantitative data. Benchmarking PredTA using RNA-seq data after Xanthomon infection in rice shows improved prediction performance compared to previous approaches. Several novel putative virulence targets were predicted, but some TALEs had no predicted targets, termed orphan TALEs, possibly due to incomplete gene annotations. Genome-wide scans for target boxes recovered known targets and detected putative targets independent of existing annotations, including non-coding RNAs. Promoter-wide scans for TALEs from five Xanthas species confirmed known targets ranked high in PredTA predictions. Unique genes were predicted, with RNA-seq supporting activation by TALEs in planta, requiring further investigation for infection importance. Genome-wide predictions of TALE boxes in Oryza sativa for 256 Xoc and 54 Xoo TALEs identified differentially expressed regions near predicted boxes, demonstrating the approach's potential for elucidating virulence targets of TALEs supporting bacterial infection of plants.
Researchers have developed APOEE, a machine-learning algorithm to assess the functional impact of human mitochondrial non-synonymous genome variations, which outperforms existing prediction methods in estimating the harmfulness of these variations. APOEE was built on 100 sets of variants drawn from a training set of 864 known mitochondrial variants and its performance was evaluated using various metrics. The algorithm uses a logistic model tree approach, incorporating features related to 13 mitochondrial proteins, multi-alignments, and amino acid conservation, and provides transparent and reproducible results. A total of 24,189 non-synonymous amino acid changes affecting human mitochondrial DNA were analyzed, with frequency of co-evolving amino acids and mean Z-scores calculated for each site. The predictions of existing tools were used to feed APOEE, offering a finely tuned classifier for mitochondrial variants. Assessing pathogenicity of genome mutations is challenging, particularly for mitochondrial DNA, due to limited studies and resources. APOEE addresses this gap, providing a reliable tool for estimating the pathogenicity of mitochondrial non-synonymous variations. The algorithm's performance was compared to existing predictors, with results reported in Table 1, demonstrating its ability to outperform them. The APOEE classifier is based on decision tree learning, providing investigable rules of pathogenicity.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection can cause a range of diseases from self-limiting dengue fever to life-threatening deng hemorrhagic fever and shock, with thrombocytopenia being a major characteristic of both mild and severe deng disease. Research has shown that DENV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) stimulates immune cells via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and causes endothelial leakage. This study demonstrates that DENV, but not Zika virus culture supernatant, induces P-selectin expression and phosphatidylserine exposure in human platelets, which is abolished when NS1 is depleted. Recombinant NS from four serotypes of DENV has similar effects, blocked by anti-NS, anti-TLR antibody, TLR antagonist, and TLR inhibitor, but not polymyxin B. Activation of platelets by DENV NS promotes adenosine diphosphate-induced plate aggregation, platelet adhesion to endothelial cells, and phagocytosis by macrophages. DENV-induced thrombocytia and hemorrhage are attenuated in TLR knockout and wild-type mice when NS1 is depleted. Results suggest DENV NS binding to TLR on platelets triggers activation, contributing to thrombocytia and hemorrhage during deng infection. DENV NS plays a central role in the interplay of deng pathogenesis, inducing platelet activation, apoptosis, inflammatory response, and vascular leakage. Platelets from DENV patients exhibit increased activation and apoptosis, and DENV NS contributes to thrombocytia, another clinical feature of deng infection. DENV NS is more potent than ZIK NS at inducing plate activation, explaining its prevalence in flavivirus infections with thrombocytia manifestations. Vascular leakage, thrombocytia, and cytokine storm play roles in deng pathogenesis complexity.
Researchers performed a mathematical analysis of the dynamic control loops regulating vasomotor tone of vascular smooth muscle, blood volume, and mean arterial pressure, involving the arginine vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide, and renin-angiotin-aldosterone systems. The analysis revealed two regulatory mechanisms that perform the same function, one affecting blood pressure by vasoconstriction and the other by regulating volume. Both systems are candidate oscillators consisting of negative feedback loops with a single equilibrium that can be stable or give rise to oscillatory instability. A subsystem including atrial natriuretic peptide and arginine vasopress stimulation of vascular smooth muscle is a candidate oscillator with multiple negative loops, with higher oscillatory potential when delays are comparable. The results provide insight into physiological mechanisms of long-term homeostasis of hydraulic parameters based on dynamical interactions. The AVP-AN-RA endocrine control of body fluids and blood pressure was analyzed using mathematical tools to highlight the loop arrangement and function. The system can be split into two coexisting dynamic systems containing vascular smooth muscle and functional agents as nodes, exerting effects on blood pressure and volume. A subset system including atrial natritic peptide and arginine vas stimulation of smooth muscle was analyzed, showing crosstalk between signal pathways and receptors. The system is a negative feedback loop of an input monotone subsystem with three coexisting loops due to effects of atrial natriuretic peptide and arginine released by heart and stimulated by stretch receptors.
Thromboembolic disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Research has identified a novel mechanism related to thrombus formation, specifically the role of fibrin networks in regulating protein transport during thrombus development. The permeability and diffusivity of fibrin networks are key factors determining protein transport through the network. Studies in mice have shown that stabilized thrombi are covered by a fibrin cap, which limits thrombin generated inside the thrombus from reaching platelets on the surface, restricting platelet activation and thrombus growth. Simulations using microfluid devices demonstrated thrombin is washed downstream through the fibrin network, limiting platelet exposure. The fibrin cap prevents small thrombi from developing into life-threatening events by restricting platelets from high thrombin concentrations. The spatial distribution of hemostatic activators, such as thrombin, is crucial for platelet activation and fibrin polymerization. Fibr networks do not form a strong barrier for relevant molecules, but permeability affects protein transport in thrombi. The findings emphasize the importance of spatial distributions of activation and activity in regulating thromogenesis. Fibr networks limit throm growth by affecting protein transport and separating platelets from thrombin concentrations, providing a mechanism for limiting asymptomatic thrombi growth.
Researchers investigated how invariant natural killer T (iKT) cells suppress intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) replication. iKT cell activation, measured by CD25 upregulation and IFγ production, was primarily driven by IL-12 and IL18 when co-cultured with infected macrophages. However, iKT control of Mtb growth was CD1-dependent and did not require IL12, IL18, or IFγ, indicating conventional markers did not correlate with iKT effector function. iKT control of Mtb replication was independent of TN and cell-mediated cytotoxicity. A novel mediator of iKT antimicrobial activity was identified as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM). iKT cells produced GM in vitro and in vivo in a CD1-dependent manner during Mtb infection and GM was necessary and sufficient to control M growth. The study found that IL12 and IL18 produced by infected macroages induced CD25 and IFγ expression but were not required for iKT control of Mtb. Macrophage expression of CD1 was essential to elicit iKT antimicrobial activity. iKT cells upregulated activation markers and produced IFγ during Mtb infection, driven by IL12 and IL18, but blocking these signals had little effect on controlling M growth. The antimicrobial function required CD1 signaling and was mediated by GM, suggesting iKT limit bacterial growth through non-classical effector function.
The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is a common component of human intestinal flora, and interactions between colonizing commensal microorganisms and their hosts play important roles in health and disease. To gain insight into C. albicans colonization, genes expressed by fungi grown within a host were studied. The EF1 gene, encoding a putative transcription factor, was highly expressed during growth of C. albicans in the intestinal tract. An ef1 null mutant exhibited increased colonization of the murine intestinal tract, whereas an EF1 overexpressing strain exhibited reduced colonization of the intestinal tract and oral cavity of athymic mice. EF1 regulates the level of colonizing fungi, favoring commensalism as opposed to candidiasis. Mutants lacking EF1 colonized the intestinal tract at higher levels than wild-type organisms, while strains engineered to overexpress EF1 exhibited reduced levels of intestinal colonization. EF1 affects interactions between colonizing C. albicans and cells of the intestinal tract, resulting in altered adherence or signaling to the immune system. High expression of EF1 attenuated colonization, while deletion of EF1 resulted in enhanced colonization, demonstrating EF1 is a regulator of the level of colonization during growth of C. albicans in the murine tract.
Immunization with irradiated sporozoites is the most effective vaccination strategy against liver stages of malaria parasites, yet the mechanisms underlying its success are unknown. Research shows that complete development of protective CD8+ T cell responses requires prolonged antigen presentation. Using TCR transgenic cells specific for the malaria circumsporite protein, it was found that sporozoite antigen persists for over 8 weeks after immunization, detected in lymphoid organs and dependent on CD11+ cells. Prolonged antigen enhances the magnitude of CD8 T cell response by reducing primed cells exposed to antigen, expanding fully developed memory cells, and priming naïve cells to become effector cells. Irradiated Plasium sporozoites, incapable of division and differentiation, stimulate robust CD8 T responses. Transferring effector cells to mice without persisting antigen reduces memory pool size. Mice with transgenic cells depleted of CD8 cells on days 3 and 4 after immunization had only sporite specific effector CD8 cells primed by persisting antigen. Seven days after transfer, mice were challenged with live P.yoeliisporites and parasite load measured in liver. Data shows optimal development of protective CD8 T immunity against liver stages is dependent on prolonged presentation of sporozoite-derived antigen.
Researchers evaluated the potential of polymyxin B (PolB) to kill Leishmania amazonensis, adsorbed or not in PBC nanoparticles (PAn), to augment internalization in infected macrophages. PAn nanoparticles coated with Pol (PAn-PolB) presented a size of 261.5 ± 25.9 nm, low PDI, and ζ potential of -1.79 ±0.17 mV, stable for at least 45 days. The 50% release from PAn-PolB was 6-7 times slower than free Pol, favoring a prolonged release profile. Pol alone reduced in vitro amastote infection of macroages at 10 μg/mL without complete parasite elimination. PAn presented leishicidal effect, surpassing Pol activity, but no antimicrobial activity was detected. Pol maintained activity against E. coli, Pseudas, and Klebsi, adding antimicrobial properties to nanoparticles. The coated delivery system demonstrated antileishial and antimicrobial properties. Leishicidal tests were performed in vitro with Leishmania amazonensis promastotes, IC50 for free Pol was 77.1 μg/mL. PAn-Pol presented a coating of 2.4 x105 molecules of Pol per unit with sustained release. Optimal PAn presented antileishial activity by itself, superposing Pol. PAn-Pol formulation reached IC50 of 6.0 μg/mL, a high decrease compared to the free drug. The bactericidal feature helps prevent secondary infections in cutaneous leishmaniasis.
A historical cohort study in Belo Horizont, Brazil investigated prognostic factors for death from visceral leishmaniasis, analyzing data from the Reportable Disease Information System-SIN. Between 2002-2009, 111 deaths and 777 cured patients were recorded, while 49 deaths and 327 cured patients were recorded between 2007-2009. Multivariate logistic models identified variables associated with death, including weakness, Leishmania-HIV co-infection, age ≥60 years, bleeding, other infections, and jaundice. A prognostic score was developed with a sensitivity of 71.4%, specificity 73.7%, positive predictive value 28.9%, negative predictive value 94.5%, and area under receiver operating curve 75.6. Factors associated with death from visceral leishiasis were weakness, Leishmania-HIV co-infection, other infections, bleeding, jaund, and age ≥60 years. These findings agree with the Brazilian Ministry of Health, which considers age <6 or >65, jaund, bleeding, and co-morbidities as factors associated with death. Leish-HIV co-infection can act synergistically aggravate the condition of co-infected patients. Visceral leishias has an estimated 500,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths worldwide annually, with >90% concentrated in six countries, including Brazil, where the causative agent is Leishmania infantum. Fatality rates in Belo Horizont were 18.7% in 2004 and 22% in 2009.
Plants rely on receptor-like kinases for perception and integration of external and internal stimuli. The Arabidopsis leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase BAK1 is involved in steroid responses, innate immunity, and cell control. A novel allele of BAK, bak1-5, differentially regulates three BAK-dependent pathways. Innate immune signaling mediated by BAK-dependent FLS and EFR is compromised in bak1-5 mutants, but not BR signaling or cell control. The non-kinases FLS and EFR have low kinase activity and cannot transphosphorylate BAK in vitro. Kinase activity is dispensable for ligand-induced heteromerization of FLS or EFR with BAK. Suppression of FLS and EFR signaling in bak1-5 is due to BAK5 interaction and requires B1 kinase activity. Results demonstrate phosphorylation-dependent control of growth, immunity, and death by BAK. BAK dictates specificity of downstream signaling, blocking FLS and E-mediated PT signaling but not cell control and BR signaling. Heteromerization with B1 is crucial for plant immunity and targeted by bacterial virulence effector AvrP. Function of B1 in cell control and immunity is independent of BR signaling. The bak1-5 mutant is impaired in elf18 and flg22 responses, possessing full BR signaling capacity. The new allele bak1-5 is strongly impaired in PT signaling, particularly EFR responses, suggesting misregulation of PT signaling.
Researchers have developed an experimental and computational approach to model the heterogeneous response of cancer cells to anticancer treatments, capturing the complexity of concurrent responses across cell phases and generations. The method combines time-lapse live microscopy and flow cytometry data to render the proliferative process through the cell cycle and subsequent generations during treatment, using modules that describe the functional activity of pathways causing arrest, repair, and cell death in each phase. A framework was created to apply different modules and test complexity justified by available data. The approach was applied to X-ray treated human ovarian cancer cells, spanning a range of doses, and the most suitable model was built combining modules with a rational strategy and fitting all data. The final model provides a complete rendering of the cycling process following X-ray exposure, with quantitative measures of dose-dependence of G1 and G2 checkpoint activities in subsequent generations, reconciling known effects of ionizing radiations and new insights. The method enables a detailed study of mechanisms at the cell population level, accounting for inter-cell variability, and provides a dynamic rendering of the flow of cells through phases and generations for controls and each dose.
Coenzyme Q deficiency in Pd2 mutant mice causes isolated renal disease, attributed to a mitochondrial biosynthetic defect. Levels of CoQ9 and Co10 in kidney homogenates from Pd2 mutant mice were significantly lower than controls. Disease manifestations originate in glomerular podocytes, as seen in Podin/cre Pd2lox/lox knockout mice, but not in conditional knockouts targeted to tubular epithelium, monocytes, or hepatocytes. Liver-conditional Pd2 knockout mice have no disease despite undetectable Co9 levels, impaired respiratory capacity, and altered metabolism. Data suggest disease relates to tissue-specific respiratory thresholds, with glomer podocytes displaying greatest sensitivity to Pd2 impairment. Biochemical evidence of CoQ deficiency, respiratory dysfunction, and altered amino profiles are present in livers of Pd mutant mice. Inflammatory response is not primary cause of disease, but a mechanism to collect cellular debris. Availability of Pdlox/lox mice permits investigations into Co deficiency and damage, particularly in central nervous and skeletal systems. Mutations in genes encoding CoQ biosynthesis, including CO2, PD1, PD2, and electron-transferring-flavoprotein dehydrogenase, are associated with disease. Nephrotic syndrome is seen in individuals with PD2 and CO2 mutations. Knocking out Pd2 in podocytes results in a severe phenotype, with tub dilatation and interstitial nephritis as consequences of Co deficiency. Detection of Co9 and Co10 in Pd mutant kidneys suggests partial activity of the missense allele.
Determinative developmental cell lineages in protostomes and deuterostomes are structured to minimize the impact of cell deaths on the resulting cellular composition of organisms. Features such as shallown topology, early ontogenic appearance of rare cells, and non-clonality of most cell types contribute to this robustness. Simulations demonstrate that this robustness likely arose as an adaptation to random cell deaths during development. Phenotypic robustness is crucial for life, but its mechanisms and origins are not well understood. This study reveals a new mechanism of phenic robustness at the supracellular level, unique to multicellular organisms. Cell lineage robustness complements subcellular and cellular mechanisms, forming a multi-layer defense against environmental and genetic perturbations. Determinative cell lineages are robust to necrosis and cell division failure, representing environmental and genetic disturbances. Computational analysis provides testable hypotheses on developmental lineages and opens doors to characterizing complex lineages, valuable for understanding evolution, development, and carcinogenesis. Findings reveal a novel explanation for ontogenesis contribution to phenic robustness, crucial for species with determinative development where cell fate is largely fixed. Lineage robustness, with regulative development, forms a defense against common perturbations, including germline mutations, in nature.
EmbryoPhenomics is a high-throughput and open-source platform for phenomics in aquatic embryos, consisting of an Open Video Microscope and a Python package Embryo Vision for high-dimensional measurement of phenomic traits from video data. The platform allows for experimental control over the embryonic environment and can document the development of large numbers of embryos in treatments ranging from long to short-term exposures. Over 30 million images were acquired across four experiments, with EmbryoCV successfully extracting phenome data from 95%, producing high-dimensional data describing morphological, physiological, and behavioural responses. The platform is versatile and applicable to a range of experimental designs and species, demonstrating its ability to quantify complex phenome responses of developing embryos. EmbryoCV is a package for automated analysis of video to extract biologically relevant phen-level measurements and OpenIM can acquire images at different temporal scales. The resultant sequence can visualize short-term changes in physiology and behaviour. EmbryoPhenomics generates data describing whole-organism responses with scale, diversity, and quality required to study embryonic development, comparable to molecular-omic technologies, with high concordance between manual and EmbCV measures of spatial and temporal characteristics.
Malaria parasites, Plasmodium spp., encounter different nutritional environments during their life cycles in mosquito and human hosts, requiring adaptation through dramatic metabolic rewiring from glycolytic to tricarboxylic acid metabolism. Researchers used stable isotope labeling, targeted metabolomics, and reverse genetics to map stage-specific changes in Plasium berghei carbon metabolism. Glutamine serves as the predominant input into TCA metabolism in both asexual and sexual stages and is crucial for male gamogenesis. Glutamine catabolism and key reactions are essential for ookinete to oocyst transition in the mosquito. These findings extend knowledge of Plasium metabolism, highlighting possible targets for transmission-blocking strategies and significant differences between Plasium species not anticipated by genomics or transcriptomics, underlining the importance of integrating metabolomics in drug discovery. The study utilized metabolomic and genetic approaches to investigate metabolic changes in key stages of Plasium berghei, showing increased dependence on TCA cycle and mitochondrial metabolism in mosquito stages. Inhibitors of this pathway are being investigated for asexual inhibition and should be extended to assess transmission-blocking capacity. Central metabolism in blood and mosquito stages of rodent malaria parasite P.berghei was assessed using 13C-stable isotope labeling, targeted metabolomics and genetics, demonstrating TCA cycle and electron transport are required for ookete development and ooc formation.
Biological signaling pathways exhibit the ability to differentiate between pulsatile and sustained signals in regulating gene expression, with many networks built around the incoherent feedforward loop motif, where an input activates an output and its inhibitor. This motif can exhibit temporal adaptation, desensitizing the system to sustained inputs, allowing distinction between signals with varying temporal profiles. Quantitative modeling examines the ability of incoherent feedforward loops to process oscillatory signals, indicating translation of pulsatile dynamics is limited by two constraints: kinetics of components and match between network and signal parameters for optimal counting. The capacity to process oscillatory signals can be changed with increased amplitude or kinetic rates. Natural networks exhibit the ability to distinguish oscillatory and sustained signals, with incoherent feedforward loops being a general motif downstream of divergent signals. The motif's ability to respond to transient but not sustained signals relies on temporal adaptation to sustained signals. Insights from the model can identify natural decoding systems and understand perturbations. Inherentforward loops are ideal for decoding oscillatory signals due to reacting to fold-changes rather than absolute concentration, driving temporal adaptation and pulse generation in response to sustained inputs, suggesting a role in processing transient or oscillatory signals.
Orientia tsutsugushi, the causative agent of scrub typhus, is an obligate intracellular bacterium transmitted by Leptotrombid mites, leading to serious febrile illness in Southeast Asia. Due to difficulties in culturing, research on its cell biology and pathogenicity has lagged behind other pathogens. To address this, a clinical isolate of O. tsugushi was grown in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells and bacterial growth measured using O. tsugushi-specific qPCR. Conditions for improved viability and growth were monitored and a standardised method for comparing viability after purification and propagation developed. The results provide techniques for improved propagation, purification, and storage, useful for clinical isolation and in vitro experiments. O. tsugushi levels were quantified by extracting DNA and measuring genome copy number using a primer/probe specific to the 47kDa Htra gene. An optimised growth assay was used to compare growth across conditions, useful for comparing antibiotic sensitivity of isolates. The study aimed to develop an evidence-based toolkit for research into O. tsugushi, a neglected human pathogen associated with CNS infections, miscarriage, and poor neonatal outcomes. Improved methods will aid research into strain diversity, antibiotic resistance, and diagnostics.
A study investigated the safety and efficacy of praziquantel treatment in 1-5 year old children infected with Schistosoma haematium. 104 Zimbabwean children aged 1-5 were treated with prazantel and side effects were assessed within 24 hours. Treatment efficacy was determined 6 weeks after administration through schistosome egg counts in urine. Pre-treatment infection intensity in 1-5 year olds was 14.6 eggs/10 ml and prevalence was 21%. 3.8% of children reported side effects, including stomach ache, loss of appetite, lethargy, and inflammation. Prazantel significantly reduced schistosome levels with an egg reduction rate of 99% and cure rate of 92, comparable to 6-10 year olds where egg reduction rate was 96 and cure rate 67. Results indicate prazant is safe and efficacious in 1-5 year olds as in 6-10 year olds. Pre-treatment schistosome levels showed significant reduction in children receiving praz compared to untreated in both age groups. The study suggests inclusion of pre-school children in schist-control programmes. Prazel works synergistically with the host immune system to kill worms and its efficacy in young children may differ from older. Side effects were reported in 4 children, none egg positive for schist infection.
A genome-wide Drosophila epithelial tumorigenesis screen identified Tetrasin 29b as an evolutionarily conserved suppressor of Ras-driven cancer. Oncogenic mutations in the small GTP Ras contribute to approximately 30% of human cancers, but Ras mutations alone are insufficient for tumorigenesis. The study devised an in vivo genome-wide functional screen in Drosila and discovered multiple evolutionarily conserved pathways controlling Ras-driven epithelial tumenesis. Human orthologs of fly hits were significantly downregulated in thousands of primary tumors, revealing novel prognostic markers for human epithelial tumors. The top 100 candidate tumor suppressor genes were validated in secondary Drosila assays, identifying known cancer genes and novel genes that cooperate with Ras-driven tumenesis. Low expression correlated with KRAS12 mutation and poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer. Mechanistic characterization of Tetrasin family T29b revealed regulation of EGFR signaling, epithelial architecture, and restrains tumor growth and invasion. The Drosila screen uncovered novel evolutionarily conserved epithelial cancer genes and experimentally confirmed T29b as a regulator of EGFR/Ras-induced epithelial growth and invasion. The study utilized Drosila in vivo RNAi approaches and conservation of developmental pathways to dissect cancer-relevant networks, identifying novel biomarkers and targets for diverse epithelial tumors. The data provides a starting point for novel genes and pathways in tumor suppression and metastasis of Ras-driven epithelial cancers.
Researchers investigated the wtf gene family in Schizoscharomyces pombe, previously shown to contain meiotic drivers in wild isolates, and discovered wtf13 as a meiotic driver that kills spores not inheriting it by generating a diffusible poison and spore-specific antidote. Another wtf gene, wtf18, arose spontaneously and suppresses wtf13 by making an antidote, rescuing only spores that inherit w18, gaining transmission advantage while dampening wtf drive. This establishes a novel paradigm for meiotic suppressors, providing insight into drive mechanisms and evolution. Four wtf genes were identified as meiotic drivers in S. pombe isolates, acting to kill spores not inheriting them, with wtf4 from S. kucha causing drive via poison-antidote mechanism. Sp18 protein acts similarly, rescuing spores inheriting Sp18 from w13 killing. Results suggest ancestral wtf was dual-transcript poison-antote meiotic driver, with duplications selected for driving and protecting spores from poison. The study identifies w13 as autonomous meiotic driver using dual-transcript poison-antote mechanism, homologous to other wtf drivers, joining four proven wtf meiotic genes in S. pombe group. Wtf18 encodes protein suppressing wtf via molecular mimicry of Sp13antid protein.
Researchers have developed an algorithm that predicts gene expression in unseen individuals using only their genotype information from the local genomic vicinity of the predicted gene. The algorithm's predictions are remarkably robust, agreeing between training and test sets from distinct populations. Although the number of predictable genes is relatively small, the predictions' robustness allows for identification of genes that can be predicted in advance. An extension incorporating heterogeneous genomic annotations improves predictions by assigning higher weights to variants with proximity to genes and high GC content. Successfully predicted genes have higher average expression and variability across individuals. The algorithm uses multiple SNPs in the local vicinity of the predicted gene and assigns relevance to SNPs with particular annotations. A subset of genes are better predicted when incorporating information from other populations, suggesting shared predictive variation across populations. Gene expression variation plays a key role in disease susceptibility and phenotypes, with some linked to genetic variation among individuals. The goal is to predict gene changes based on genetic sequence, and this algorithm achieves this using only genotype information, providing insight into characteristics of predictable genes from cis variation.
Researchers investigated the cause of competitive suppression of an avirulent clone of Plasmodium chaudi by a virulent clone in immuno-deficient and competent mice using dynamical-based Bayesian inference. The study found that the ratio of background loss of meroites to invasion rate of mature red blood cells needed to be clone-specific to predict the data. This difference was largest in immuno-competent mice and smallest in immuno-deficient mice, explaining why competitive suppression was alleviated in immuno-deficient mice. The results suggest that competitive suppression acts early in infection, before peak parasitemia, and that innate immune clearing of meroites is the likely mediator of interactions between virulent and avulent clones. In mixed infections, an interaction between clones and the innate response induces changes in the strength of its clearance of meroites. Understanding within-host competition between strains is essential for understanding the evolution of virulence and drug resistance in malar infections. Previous studies have demonstrated competitive suppression of less virulent clones by virulent clones, but the extent of resource limitation and host response could not be disentangled. This study provides evidence of immune-mediated competition in rodent malaria, likely caused by induced changes in innate immune clearance of meroites.
Researchers have proposed a model, Origin-Dependent Inverted-Repeat Amplification (OA), to explain the generation of interstitial inverted triplications, a type of copy number variation where no genetic information is lost but novel junctions and increased sequences create potential for adaptive phenotypes. The model suggests a replication error at pre-existing short, inverted repeats generates an extrachromosomal, autonomously replicating intermediate, which integrates into the genome without loss of distal sequences. In vitro and in vivo approaches in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae tested the feasibility of the proposed error, showing ligation of leading and lagging strands can occur at short, interrupted repeats. Removal of molecules with closed forks results in a hairpin-capped linear duplex that replicates to create an inverted dimer plasmid, integrating into the genome by homologous recombination, creating an inverted triplication. This model explains human de novo, inverted amplicons with a 2:1 mixture of sequences from both homologues of a single parent, arising from a plasmid intermediate from one homologue integrating into the other prior to meiosis. Key features of ODIR were tested, supporting the mechanism and suggesting avenues to unravel origins of interstitial, inverted copy number variations in human health and evolution. Other models, including Microhomology Mediated Break Induced Replication and Fork Stalling and Template Switching, propose promiscuous and mobile nascent strands, while ODIR involves branch migration and ligation at short inverted repeats. Replication stress causes a leading strand to fold back at short inverted repeats, copying the nascent strand until a second pair is encountered, creating an inverted triplication with two copies in direct orientation, potentially produced by intramolecular non-allelic homous recombination.
Researchers investigated the extent and impact of alternate translation initiation in cells infected with influenza virus, performing evolutionary analyses that suggest selection against non-canonical initiation at CUG codons in virus lineages adapted to mammalian hosts. Using ribosome profiling with the inhibitor lactimidycin, they experimentally delineated translation sites in a human epithelial cell line infected with influenza, identifying candidate sites of alternate initiation in influenza mRNAs at AUG codons downstream of canonical initiation codons. One site truncates 14 amino acids from the N-terminus of the N1 neuridase protein, resulting in loss of cytoplasmic tail and portion of transmembrane domain. The truncated neuraminase is expressed on the cell surface during infection, enzymatically active, and conserved in most N1 lineages. No globally higher levels of alternate translation on host transcripts were detected, but a subset induced by anti-viral response is enriched for alternate sites. Results map the landscape of translation during influenza infection, shedding light on evolutionary forces shaping this landscape. Ribosome profiling identified little signal for CUG initiation in viral genes but candidate AUG sites downstream canonical codons. Signatures in viral genome consistent with selection against CUG-mediated initiation in lineages adapted mammalian hosts were found, with minimal support for CUG initiation on influenza transcripts. The study provides the first comprehensive analysis of translation during influenza infection, identifying new alternate sites, including a functionally active viral protein not previously described.
Enteric bacterial pathogens, such as Enterohemorrhagic Escheria coli (EHE), cause severe foodborne disease, resulting in significant economic and health burdens. HEC causes bloody diarrhea and potentially fatal kidney disease, with no effective treatment or prophylaxis. HEC utilizes a type III secretion system (T3) to inject virulence proteins (effectors) into host cells. Researchers found that E. coli O157:H7 nle1 and nle2 genes encode T3 effectors that bind to human ribosomal protein S3 (R3), a subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κ) transcription complexes. Nle1 and Nle2 co-localized with R3 in the cytoplasm, but not in nuclei, with the N-terminal region required for binding to the N-termin of R3. Nle1 and Nle2 are autophosphorylated Ser/Thr kinases, but binding to R3 is independent of kinase activity. Nle1 reduced nuclear R3 abundance and repressed R3/NF-κ-dependent transcription, while Nle2 stimulated R3-dependent transcription. Deleting nle1 from E. coli O157:H7 produced a hypervirulent phenotype in a gnotiotic piglet model of Shiga-producing E. coli infection, suggesting Nle disrupts host immune responses by binding a cofactor of transcription complexes.
Transcription factor binding to DNA is a fundamental regulatory interaction, commonly represented by position scoring matrices assuming independence between positions. However, this simplification often does not hold. A novel probabilistic method, feature models, is presented to model TF-DNA interactions based on log-linear models, using sequence features to represent binding specificities. The approach captures complex dependencies and high-level features, such as palindromes, and is a generalization of the position scoring matrix model. The algorithm learns structural features from binding site data and discovers de novo motifs enriched in target sequences. Evaluation on synthetic and chromatin immunoprecipitation data shows feature models explain TF binding better than position scoring matrices. Application to high-throughput TF data reveals sequence features in mouse and human TF binding specificities. The feature model and motif finder software are available. The approach integrates into motif finding algorithms and represents important features of TF binding, learning from aligned and unaligned sequences. Validation on yeast ChIP-micro data shows comparable performance to state-of-art finders. Compilation of human and mouse TF datasets demonstrates feature models learn binding specificities better than position scoring matrices, providing a novel approach to modeling TF-DNA interactions.
Researchers investigated the regulation of sympathetic nervous activity in humans and chimpanzees, focusing on the adrenergic α2 receptor (AD2) gene, an inhibitory modulator of the sympathetic system. They found lower expression of AD2 in humans and chimpanzees compared to other primates. Analysis of three-dimensional chromatin structure identified a cis-regulatory region with accelerated DNA sequences in humans and chimpanzees. Active histone marks were present in rhesus macaques but not humans and chimpanzees, while repressive marks were enriched in human brain samples. The region contains two neuron-restrictive silencer factor binding motifs with polymorphisms that have reached fixation in humans and chimpanes but not bonos. CRISPR/Cas9 editing and reporter assays showed the derived nucleotides repress AD2, likely by increasing silencer binding. Signatures of positive selection for lower AD2 expression were detected in humans. The findings indicate selective pressure for enhanced sympathetic activity in human and chimpanzee evolution. Examination of transcriptomic, epigen, and genomic data identified regulatory variants responsible for human-chimpanzee specific repression of AD2. Two variants were identified, one possibly arising recently in humans and chimpanes, with different repression mechanisms in humans and chimpanes. Further analysis may shed light on the evolution of repression mechanisms in humans and chimpanes.
Researchers conducted a deep evolutionary comparison of gene expression to investigate the genetic networks underlying C4 photosynthesis in two independent lineages, Cleome gandra and Zea mays, which diverged approximately 140 million years ago. They identified a cohort of 3,335 conserved genes representing components of leaf and photosynthetic development and found that genes encoding C4 cycle proteins are recruited into networks defined by photosynthesis-related genes. Despite independent origins, the species use homologous transcription factors to induce C4 photosynthesis and maintain cell-specific gene expression. A molecular signature associated with leaf photosynthetic maturation is shared among angiosperm species derived from the common ancestor of monocot and dicot. The study reveals convergent and parallel changes in gene expression underpin the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, with transcription factors shared by independent lineages being key targets for engineering the C4 pathway into C3 crops. The findings indicate C4 photosynthesis is associated with the parallel evolution of trans-factors, underpinned by cis-elements, amino acid substitutions, and expression of homolog transcription factors with analogous temporal and spatial patterns in independent lineages of C4 plants.
A study investigated the persistence of Ebola virus (EV) RNA in tissues after plasma clearance in a healthcare worker infected with EV in Sierra Leone, hospitalized in Italy. Researchers longitudinally explored EV-specific negative sense RNA and positive RNA, including replication intermediate and messenger RNA, in upper and lower respiratory tracts compared to plasma. Results showed persistence of positive and negative RNA in lower respiratory tract specimens even after viral clearance from plasma, suggesting local replication. The study compared levels of EV RNA in clinical specimens to explore the role of body compartments in EV replication. Data indicated decay of EV RNA over time, differing significantly between plasma and respiratory samples. Detection of positive RNA with negative RNA in respiratory samples supported active replication rather than stability or spill-over. Absence of detectable RNA in plasma with continued detection in respiratory samples suggested EV replication in lung tissues. The findings support the hypothesis that EV can replicate in human airways, consistent with post-mortem examinations showing viral antigens in lung tissues and EV nucleic acids in macrophages. The study enhances understanding of EV biological features contributing to human transmission and informs intervention strategies.
Machupo virus, a New World arenavirus, causes Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, while its relative Junin virus causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever. Researchers previously found that a recombinant chimeric Machupo virus expressing glycoprotein from the Candid#1 vaccine strain of Junin virus is completely attenuated in mice and protects against lethal challenge. To investigate the role of different domains of Candid# glycoprotein in attenuation, several recombinant Machupo viruses were created, expressing the ectodomain of Candid# glycoprotein alone, with a transmembrane domain substitution, or with the transmembrane domain of Candid#. The results showed that the ectodomain of Candid# glyprotein contributed to attenuation, but was not sufficient for complete attenuation. Mice infected with the virus expressing ectodomain alone had reduced lethality and detectable virus in organs, while those infected with viruses containing the transmembrane substitution or transmembrane of Candid# had no detectable virus and produced neutralizing antibodies. The study suggests the importance of glycoprotein domains in attenuation and immunogenicity, providing insight into vaccine development for Machupo and other New arenaviruses. The findings indicate that while the transmembrane domain is crucial for virulence, other glycoprotein domains also play a role in attenuation.
Researchers investigated the functional constraints of centromeric histone 3 (CEN3) by introducing single amino acid changes in conserved residues of the histone domain in Arabidopsis. Many transgenic lines displayed wild-type growth and fertility on self-pollination but exhibited post-zygotic death and uniparental inheritance when crossed with wild-type plants. The failure of centromeres marked by missense mutations in the histone domain of CEN3 reproduces genome elimination syndromes described with chimeric CEN3 and CEN from diverged species. A single mutation is sufficient to generate a haploid inducer, providing a simple method for identification of non-transgenic haploid inducers in existing mutagenized crop collections. An in silico search identified an Arabidopsis line carrying the A86 substitution within the histone domain, which while fertile on self-pollination, produced postzyotic death and unipal haploids when crossed to wild-type. Mutations in conserved residues of the CEN3 histone domain result in fit and fertile plants that display postzyotic incompatibility and produce haploids when crossed to wild-type. Centromeres determined by point mutations in CEN3 specify efficient inheritance in self-crosses but lead to missegregation in F1 hybrid when confronted with centromeres by wild-type CEN3. Transgenic experiments suggest haploid inducers may exist among mutagenized populations or natural variants.
Researchers investigated the role of alternative splicing in the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into cardiac precursors. They modified the H9 human embryonic stem cell line to allow for selection of pluripotent cells and cardiac progenitors and analyzed exon-level expression data to identify spliceforms with cardiac-restricted or common cardiac/neural expression patterns. The identified splice events corresponded to pathways of cytoskeletal remodeling, RNA splicing, muscle specification, and cell cycle control, as well as genes with serine/threonine kinase and helicase activity. Using the AltAnalyze program, novel changes in protein and microRNA binding architecture were predicted to affect protein function, including enrichment of isoforms that oppose cell arrest and promote calcium signaling. Combining genome-wide predictions with functional annotations, data suggest potential mechanisms influencing lineage commitment and maintenance at the level of specific isoforms and microRNA regulation. Genes with cardiac-specific patterns included calcium signaling, metabolism, cell cycle, and double-stranded RNA binding proteins. The loss of pluripotency corresponds to alternative splicing of genes regulating transcription, cell contact, and metabolism, while cardiac-enriched events favor contractile pathways. Fifty alternative exons were selected for further analysis, supporting a role for alternative splicing in cardiac precursor specification. The results offer novel targets for driving expression of pluripotent cells to distinct lineages and inducing pluripotency from adult cells at the level of specific isoforms, identifying genes undergoing alternative splicing and global trends suggesting functional elements regulated by alternative splicing.
Trehalose biosynthesis is a potential target for developing antimicrobials against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Researchers generated a conditional mutant of M. tuberculosis to assess the target potential of trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase OtsB, finding it essential for growth in vitro and acute infection in mice, but not in chronic infection. Blocking OtsB led to accumulation of toxic trehalose-6-phosphate, causing cell poisoning. Preventing its production in a ΔotsA mutant abolished Ots2 essentiality. Trehalose-6-phosphate accumulation upregulated over 800 genes, possibly due to increased RNA stability from neutralized ribonuclease activity. A genome-wide screen identified genes with synthetic lethal interactions with OtsA, revealing potential targets for combination therapies. Differential Ots2 essentiality during infection stages indicates remodeled trehal metabolism. The Ots-OB pathway dominates in culture and acute phase but is dispensable in chronic phase. Alternative pathways for trehal biosynthesis are present in M. tuberculosis, including Ots-OB, TreY-Tre, and TreS. Data show Ots2 essentiality relies on toxic effects associated with Ots-mediated trehal-6-phosphate accumulation. The Ots-OB pathway is widespread and conserved in pathogens, making prevention of phosphosugar formation a strategy to avoid poisoning and abolish Ots2 essentiality.
Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects 11-18 million people and has limited treatment options with poor efficacy and safety profiles. Trypanoma cruzi proline racemase is an attractive candidate for chemotherapeutic intervention, with conformation changes associated with substrate binding believed to expose residues that elicit a host mitogenic B-cell response, contributing to parasite persistence and immune evasion. Accelerated molecular dynamics simulations were used to capture large-scale motions of functional relevance, identifying potential conformation epitopes in the vicinity of newly identified transient pockets. The study reveals open conformations of Tryosoma cruzi proline racemase and the closed to open interconversion mechanism, advancing understanding of its function. The results provide insights into the molecular basis of the mitogenic-cell response and potential for structure-based drug discovery. Two crystal structures of Tryosoma cruzi proline racemase are available, with emerging crystallographic and mutagenesis data indicating ligand-induced conformation changes modulate exposure of critical residues. Conservation and small molecule mapping analyses indicate mitogenic properties are associated with exposure of conserved conformation epitopes around previously unidentified pockets. The study presents a model for the open form of the target through state-of-the-art molecular simulation, indicating mitogenic properties may be associated with exposure of conformation epitopes around newly identified pockets, representing a promising target for therapies to combat Chagas disease.
Researchers have developed an inducible and reversible genetic rescue system in mice, termed iKO, allowing for efficient and reversible gene knockout and rescue. The system combines two genetically modified mouse lines: a knockout line with a tetracycline-dependent transactivator replacing the endogenous gene and a line with tetrcline-inducible cDNA of the target gene inserted into a tightly regulated genomic locus. The iKO system utilizes doxycycline to turn the target gene on and off, providing low basal and high inducible expression. The method has been engineered for high-throughput, large-scale, and cost-effective production of iKO mice. As proof of concept, iKO mice were created in the apolipoprotein E gene, demonstrating reversible switching of Apo transcription, plasma cholesterol levels, and atherosclerosis progression and regression. The iKO system shows stringent regulation and versatility, allowing incorporation of other techniques and adaptation to various applications. Two genetically modified strains are created: a knockout line with tetr-dependent transactivator inserted into the target gene and a line with tetr-inducible cDNA inserted into a regulated locus. The system complements existing inducible expression approaches, offering advantages over tamoxifen-dependent CreERT and Cre/lox recombination methods. The design enables streamlined production of knockout and TRE mice, making it possible to generate iKOs for numerous genes in a cost-effective manner with flexibility for wide applications.
Researchers investigated the placental genetic response to Trypanosoma cruzi infection in a murine model, comparing two strains: K98, a non-lethal myotropic CA-I strain, and VD, isolated from a human congenital infection case. Functional genomics analysis revealed distinct responses, with "Secretory Granule" pathway downregulated in both infected groups, while "Innate Immune Response" and "Response to Interferon-gamma" pathways upregulated in VD but not K. Metabolic processes and macromolecular transport were downregulated in infected placentas, with some signaling pathways oppositely regulated between strains. VD showed stronger placental tropism, detected by parasite DNA and RNA. The study highlights a strong, parasite-dependent immune response at the expense of cellular metabolism, potentially controlling congenital transmission risk. Upregulation of antigen processing and presentation genes in V infection suggests a defense mechanism against the pathogen. Several genes were affected in expression levels, more so in V, possibly due to its higher tropism. This study is the first to describe the placental genetic response to T. cruzi in a murine model, providing insight into host-parasite interactions and potential congenital infection mechanisms. The findings contribute to understanding the role of T.cruzi genotypes in pregnancy and congenital transmission.
Sindbis virus, which causes polyarthritis and rash, was first identified in northern Europe 50 years ago and is known as Ockbo disease in Sweden and Pogosta in Finland. Researchers evaluated mosquito abundance and Sindbis virus prevalence in vectors from an endemic area in central Sweden, collecting mosquitoes from 2000-2003 and assaying for virus on cell culture. Results showed one strain in 2001, four strains in 2003, and 15 strains in 200 with increased infection rates in both enzootic and bridge vectors. Maximum likelihood infection rates were 10/100 in enzic vectors and 0.62/100 in bridge vectors in 200, compared to lower rates in 1 and 3. Sequence analysis revealed all isolates belonged to Sindbis genotype I with local maintenance of four clades over years. Increased Sindbis prevalence in mosquitoes constitutes a valuable marker for scrutinizing the hypothesized seven-year cycle of outbreaks. Clinical cases occur July-October with a peak in August, coinciding with floodwater mosquito activity. Higher Sind prevalence in enzic vectors during 9 mirrored increased antibody prevalence in amplifying host. The study provides objective markers for Sindbis polyarthritis outbreaks in northern Europe, with serological evidence and clinical cases showing distribution mainly in central Sweden and antibody prevalence in wild bird populations. Network analysis suggests diversity of strains in mosquito population with many strains at several sites and one site.
Researchers investigated the interaction of multiple coding mechanisms in the locust olfactory system, which transforms dense, transiently synchronized spike trains of antenna lobe neurons into a sparse representation in the mushroom body, a region associated with memory. Recordings from the mushroom body demonstrated highly specific responses to odors in Kenyon cells, with only a few cells responding reliably to a specific odor and different odors inducing responses in different cells. A biologically plausible model explored the possibility of plasticity controlling synaptic weights to ensure specificity of Kenyon cell responses to familiar odors. Plasticity at synapses between the antenna lobe and mushroom body efficiently regulated the tuning to filter intense oscillatory output and condense to a sparse representation. Activity-dependent plasticity drove specificity, reliability, and persistence of odor representations, suggesting a role in information processing. The study is consistent with experimental results supporting a pre-synaptic mechanism of plasticity between Kenyon cells and mushroom body extrinsic neurons in olfactory memory. The locust system is ideal to study interaction of neural strategies with plasticity and learning due to its well-characterized circuitry, architecture, and properties of neuronal ensembles, and their role in odor perception.
The Stockholm Atherosclerosis Gene study analyzed transcriptional profiles of liver, skeletal muscle, and visceral fat, as well as atherosclerotic and unaffected arterial wall tissues from coronary artery disease patients to identify functionally associated genes important for disease development. Two-way clustering of 278 transcriptional profiles resulted in 60 tissue clusters, with one atherosclerotic lesion and visceral fat clusters segregating patients into groups differing in coronary stenosis extent. Associations with atherosclerosis were validated by analyzing carotid atherosclerosis profiles, revealing a cluster related to carotid stenosis. The transendothelial migration of leukocytes pathway was overrepresented in three clusters, forming the atherosclerosis module. This module was enriched with genetic risk for coronary artery disease and involved transcription factor LIM domain binding 2 as a potential regulator, supported by subnetwork analysis and cellular expression. The module appears important for atherosclerosis development, with LIM binding 2 meriting further research attention. The study identified 128 genes strongly associated with atherosclerosis severity, active in both atherosclerotic wall and visceral fat, with seven genes present in both tissue clusters. The findings suggest a module harboring biological activity for human atherosclerosis, warranting further investigation into its role in coronary artery disease development.
Researchers have uncovered a two-loop transcriptional feedback mechanism in the cyanobacterial circadian clock, involving the KaiC protein, a central component of the circadian clock in cyanobacteria. The KaiC protein is involved in activation and repression of its own transcription and runs through different phospho-states during a 24-hour period. A combined transcriptional-translational and post-translational oscillator model was used to analyze various combinations of positive and negative transcriptional regulation, revealing a two-loop mechanism that reproduces existing observations, including effects of knockout or overexpression of Kai genes. Threonine and double phosphorylated KaiC hexamers activate kaiBC transcription, while unphosphorylated Kai hexamers suppress it. The model suggests the expression ratio of positive and negative components of kaiBC is crucial in responding to removal or overexpression of Kai genes. The study supports the view that phospho-states of Kai govern the timing of the cyanobacterial circadian oscillator and clock generating 24-hour gene rhythms. The regulation of kai expression plays a key role in the cyanobacterial circadian clockwork, with about 30-64% of the transcriptome under circadian control. Overexpression of the kai gene resets the phase of the rhythm, providing insights into the transcriptional-translational kai regulation. The findings have parallels with two-loop structures in mammalian clocks and could help reveal how the circadian pathways control rhythmically regulated genes in the cyanobacterial genome.
Researchers investigated the distribution of HIV-2 reservoirs in peripheral blood cells of antiretroviral-naive HIV-2 infected individuals and found that HIV-2 reservoirs differ from HIV-1 reservoirs by the lack of monocytic infection and limited infection of central-memory CD4 T cells. HIV-2 DNA was undetectable in monocytes and quantifiable in transitional-memory T cells, with lower levels in central-memory T cells. HIV-2 reactivation was observed in cells from only a few individuals. The CXCR6 co-receptor was distributed similarly in cell populations, but central-memory T cells had lower CX6 expression and higher TRIM5 expression. The study suggests that HIV2 reservoirs are characterized by a lack of monocytic infection and limited central-memory T cell infection, associated with lower CX6 co-receptor expression and higher restriction factor expression. The findings shed light on the low pathogenicity of HIV2 infection, suggesting mechanisms similar to other attenuated HIV/SIV models. The study provides the first immunological characterization of HIV2 peripheral cell reservoirs in individuals with poorly productive HIV2 infection and slow disease progression, demonstrating a trend towards predominance of infection in transitional-memory cells over central-memory cells. The distribution of HIV2 reservoirs is attributed to the cellular distribution of CX6 co-receptor and restriction factors, indicating HIV2 may be less adapted to human central-memory cells than transitional cells.
The Attentional Routing Circuit (ARC) model provides a mechanistic description of selective attentional processing in the cortex, implemented at the level of individual spiking neurons, with computations mapped to specific neuron types and laminar circuitry. The model simulates three studies of attention in macaques, quantitatively matching observed forms of attentional modulation, including shifting and shrinking receptive fields, increased responses without changes in selectivity for non-spatial features, and response-gain effects on contrast functions. Unlike past models, ARC unifies various forms of attention modulation, consistent with available data, and makes testable predictions. The model predicts spatial attention affects neural selectivity without altering other feature dimensions, distinguishing it from the normalization model. The seemingly different forms of attention modulation are consequences of a single mechanism for selective attention routing. The model demonstrates biological plausibility, accounting for five forms of attentional effects, and predicts an increasing proportion of neurons at higher cortical levels show attention modulation due to switching from default to selective routing during demanding tasks. The magnitude of modulation is expected to increase in higher areas, providing a unified explanation of attentional effects in the cortex.
Atrial fibrillation is a common arrhythmia associated with substantial morbidity, and current treatments have limited efficacy. Approximately one in four individuals with atrial fibrillation has a first-degree relative with the condition, indicating a heritable component. Over 35 genes have been implicated in atrial fibrillation risk using genome-wide association and candidate screening approaches, but causal variants remain unknown. This study examined whole-exome sequencing data from 1,734 individuals with and 9,423 without atrial fibrillation from the Framingham Heart, Cardiovascular Health, and Atherosclerosis Risk Communities studies, and NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project. None of the 99,404 common variants evaluated were significantly associated with atrial fibrillation after adjusting for multiple testing. A common missense variant in SYNPO2 was associated with atrial fibrillation, but requires further evaluation to determine causality. No significant associations were found between rare variants and atrial fibrillation in gene-based tests. Individuals with atrial fibrillation did not display enrichment for common or rare coding variation in previously implicated genes. The findings suggest large-effect coding variation is not the predominant mechanism underlying atrial fibrillation. Efforts to identify biologically meaningful coding variation may require larger sample sizes or populations enriched for genetic effects.
Alveolar echinoccosis, caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, is a serious disease in the Northern Hemisphere. Between 1990-2011, 121 human cases were detected in Poland, with 83 confirmed, 16 probable, and 22 possible cases. The mean age at diagnosis was 47.7 years and sex ratio M/F was 0.86/1.0. The disease was fatal in 23 patients with a mean age of 54.1 years. Family aggregation was found in 4 foci involving 9 patients and 76 cases were diagnosed at an advanced stage. The liver was the primary location in all cases and 30 patients had spread to other organs. 94 patients were treated with albendazole and 73 had surgery including 15 liver transplantations. The study confirms alveolar echinoccosis is emerging in Poland, the fourth in Europe with over 120 detected cases, indicating a need for a national screening program in high-risk areas to increase awareness and train primary care physicians for early detection. Incidence was 0.014 with 27 cases found during field studies in endemic areas. Ultrasonography was mainly used for diagnosis and IgG antibodies detected using ELISA and immunoblot for confirmation.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanism of the zinc-sensing zinc uptake regulator (Zur) protein in Escherichia coli to understand how microorganisms respond to dynamic changes in zinc availability. The structure of zinc-loaded Zur bound to the PnuABC promoter revealed that the metalloregulatory protein represses gene expression through cooperative binding of two dimers encircling the core element of Zur-regulated promoters. Analysis of protein-DNA interactions led to the discovery of a new member of the Zur regulon, pliG, which is directly regulated by Zur in a zinc-responsive manner. Comparison of in vitro Zur-DNA binding affinity at four Zur regulon promoters showed 10,000-fold variation in Zur-DNA binding constants, paralleling a 100-fold difference in repression observed in vivo. The degree of repression correlates with the thermodynamic profile of Zur-DNA interactions, indicating that the number of ferric uptake regulator dimers binding to a promoter varies significantly. The findings support the idea that thermodynamics of protein-DNA interactions play a dominant role in physiological control of gene networks, allowing fine-tuning of stress responsive expression across promoters. The study reveals a layer of regulatory tuning based on differential affinities of zinc-saturated dimers for various promoters in the regulon, optimizing cellular physiology in response to shifts in metal availability.
Rift Valley fever is a vector-borne zoonotic disease that causes high morbidity and mortality in ruminants. A 2008-2009 outbreak affected Madagascar, including the Anjozobe district in highlands. An entomological survey showed absence of Aedes among potential RVF virus vectors and low mosquito abundance due to unfavorable climatic conditions. No serological or virological sign of infection was observed in wild mammals, suggesting absence of RV virus reservoir. However, three-year serological and virological follow-up in cattle showed recurrent RV circulation. A spatial discrete-time metapopulation model combined with cattle trade was designed to understand key determinants of transmission. Three scenarios were analyzed: RV overwintering through direct transmission between cattle, low vector circulation during winter, and combination of both. Multi-model inference resulted in a model incorporating low vector-borne transmission and direct transmission between viremic cows. Predictions showed 84% of infections attributed to vector-borne transmission and 16% to direct transmission. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis. Interactions between agricultural works, seasonality of vector proliferation, and cattle practices are key to understanding RVF circulation in Madagascar highlands. Socio-economic practices appear determinant in introduction, spread, and persistence. RVF is mainly transmitted by Aedes, Culex, and Mansonia mosquitoes, but also by direct contact with viremic fluids or tissues between ruminants. Study suggests recurrent circulation in highlands is due to vector-based transmission and direct transmission at calving vemic cows.
The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus is a highly invasive and aggressive species that poses a significant public health threat throughout its expanding range. To understand its historical and contemporary movements, researchers analyzed 13 nuclear microsatellite loci and mitochondrial COI sequences from 911 individuals in the Indo-Pacific region. Approximate Bayesian computation revealed that Ae. albictus was introduced to New Guinea via mainland Asia, then colonized the Solomon Islands, and recently invaded northern Australia's Torres Islands from Indonesia. A newly colonized population in the Torres Islands showed rapid genetic changes, possibly due to genetic drift or secondary invasion. High spatial structure and gene flow were found between geographically distant populations, suggesting dispersal driven by human movements. The study provides the first widespread sampling of the species' native range, revealing more spatial structure than previously shown, and the probable invasion history in the Australasian region. Notable temporal structure was found in introduced Torres Island populations, demonstrating drastic changes within a decade, with implications for genetic databases estimating invasion sources. Established populations in the Indo-Pacific showed high genetic structure and connectivity, indicating human-driven dispersal. The study characterizes Ae. albictus invasion history and population structure in the Indo-Pacific.
A cross-sectional study investigated the effect of Schistosoma mansoni infection on morbidity indicators, including quality of life and physical fitness, among 572 schoolchildren aged 7-8 years in Mwan Region, North-West Tanzania. Prevalence of S. mansoni infection was 58.7% with an arithmetic mean of 207.3 eggs per gram. Most infections were light, while 16.4% had heavy infections, with girls having higher intensities than boys. There was no association between S. mansoni and parameters such as anthropometry, anaemia, liver or spleen pathology. However, infected children had lower emotional quality of life scores and higher VO2 max compared to uninfected. Multivariable regression showed age, S. mans infection, haemoglobin, and VO2 were predictors for emotional quality of life, while physical quality, height and haemoglobin predicted VO max. The study found S. mans infection had a significant effect on emotional quality of life but not physical fitness. Quality of life should be a useful to measure schistosome morbidity, but more studies are needed to refine the tool to focus on aspects affected by schistosome infections. Alternative methods such as physical fitness and perceived quality could be used to evaluate morbidity due to S. mans in young children.
Leptospirosis is a zoonosis caused by a spirochete with wild rodents, including brown rats, as asymptomatic reservoirs. Experimental studies have used intraperitoneal inoculation to investigate renal colonization mechanisms, but natural routes like mucosal or subcutaneous inoculation are needed to understand rat-rat transmission. This study compared subcutaneous and mucosal inoculation to intraperitoneal routes in adult rats using Leptira isolation, serology, and histology. Infection was asymptomatic with similar antibody production regardless of colonization. Renal colonization rates were 8/8, 5/8, and 1/8 for intraperitone, mucosal, and subcutaneous routes, respectively. Mucosal inoculation was more efficient for renal colonization and urinary excretion than subcutaneous and induced slower infection than intraperitone. Results can facilitate understanding of infection modalities in rats, unlike epidemiological studies in wild rats. Future studies on natural routes will increase knowledge of rat-rat transmission and infection kinetics. Leptira infection in rats has identical asymptomatic forms regardless of inoculation route and antibody response in chronic infections was lower than acute with no relation to colonization. Natural routes affected Leptira dissemination time and renal colonization. This study established a rat model based on natural transmission routes, reporting effects of subcutaneous and mucosal routes on colonization and excretion compared to intraperitone.
Annexin A2 (AnxA2) plays a crucial role in modulating the inflammatory response in polymicrobial sepsis by regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and IL-17 signaling. In a cecal ligation and puncture (CL) seps model, An2-/- mice exhibited increased pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, and decreased bacterial clearance and survival. An2 deficiency intensified ROS and IL17 levels. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed cysteine 9 of An2 is essential for ROS regulation. ROS is responsible for elevated IL17 and exaggerated inflammatory response. Depletion of IL17 via CRISPR/Cas9 downregulated inflammation and conferred protection against seps in An2-/- mice. An2 functions as a putative ROS inhibitor in seps progression, and cystine 9 is crucial for oxidation regulation. An2 mitigates seps severity by modulating ROS and IL17 levels. Targeting neutrophils in seps may have therapeutic potential. An2-induced neutroph infiltration contributes to organ injury and mortality. IL17 signaling is regulated by ROS, and inflammation reduced after IL17 knockdown. Increased IL17 correlates with ROS in An2- mice, and IL17 knockdown inhibits inflammatory response. An2 is involved in innate immunity, endosome function, and inflammation. Overall, An2 inhibits heightened inflammatory response by regulating ROS and IL17 in seps. An2- mice manifest severe seps, excessive macrophages, decreased survival, impaired clearance, and tissue injuries. Cystine has a critical function in oxidative sensing, and An2 is a mediator in host defense against seps.
HIV-1 infection of macrophages plays a key role in viral pathogenesis and progression to AIDS. Stimulation of monocyte-derived macrophages with polyinosinic-polycidylic acid (poly I:C) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ligands for Toll-like receptors TLR3 and TLR4, respectively, decreases HIV-1 infection. Researchers found poly I:C and LPS abrogated infection by CCR-using macroage-tropic HIV-1 and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein-pseudotyped HIV1 virions, while TLR2, TLR7, or TLR9 agonists only partially reduced infection to varying extent. Suppression of infection did not correlate with effects on CD4 or CCR expression, type interferon induction, or production of pro-inflammatory cytokines or β-chemokines. Integrated proviruses were detected in unstimulated TLR7 and TLR9-stimulated cells but not TLR3 or TLR4-stimulated macrophages, suggesting alteration of post-entry pre-integration events. Increased microRNA-155 levels were found in macrophages upon TLR3/4 but not TLR7 stimulation, and miR155 specific inhibitor partially restored infectivity in poly I:C stimulated macrophages. Ectopic miR155 expression diminished HIV-1 infection in primary macrophages and cell lines. Poly:C stimulation and ectopic miR155 did not alter detection of early RT products but resulted in accumulation of late products and undetectable levels of integrated proviruses and 2-LTR circles. Reduced mRNA and protein levels of HIV1 dependency factors involved in trafficking and nuclear import preintegration were found in poly:C stimulated and miR155 transfected macrophages. The findings provide evidence that miR155 exerts anti-HIV1 effect targeting several HIV1 factors involved post-entry preintegration, leading to severely diminished HIV1 infection.
Researchers investigated the daily rhythms of plant growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, focusing on the interaction between light, circadian clock, and growth-promoting hormone pathways. Using DNA microarrays, they analyzed the seedling transcriptome under various conditions and found a group of plant hormone-associated genes co-expressed when hypocotyl growth rate is maximal. The expression correlates with a cis-acting element in phytohormone promoters, sufficient to confer diurnal and circadian patterns. Circadian and light mutants showed both internal coincidence of phyhormone signaling and external darkness are required for wild-type growth. The circadian clock indirectly controls growth by permissive light-mediated phyhormone levels at the proper time, integrating pathways for seasonal regulation. A transcriptional module associated with growth increase rate is regulated by internal coincidence of multiple phyhorm pathways and external dark-light transition. The circadian clock acts upstream of light to gate phyhorm gene expression in the evening. Circadian and light pathways interact to coordinate biosynthetic, catabolic, receptor, and signaling genes from multiple phyhorm pathways. Almost 90% of Arabidopsis transcripts accumulate at specific times due to the circadian, light, and temperature cycles. The study reveals temporal integration of phyhormone pathways allows plants to fine-tune responses for seasonal and shade regulation.
Researchers have explored the use of RNA interference technology to control Chagas disease vectors, such as Rhodnius prolixus, by genetically modifying the insect gut microbiota. Escheria coli HT115 (DE3) expressing dsRNA for Rhodni heme-binding protein (RHBP) and catalase (CAT) was fed to nymph and adult stages, resulting in systemic RNA interference and temporal concentrations above 3.35 × 10^7 CFU/mL producing significant RH and CAT gene knockdown. RH expression in the body was reduced by 99% three days after feeding, returning to normal levels 10 days after, while CAT expression was reduced 99% and 96% in ovary and posterior midgut, respectively. Mortality rates increased 24-30% in first instars fed RHBP and CAT bacteria, molting rates reduced 100% in first instars and 80% in third instars, and oviposition reduced 43% (RH) and 84 (CAT). Embryogenesis was arrested in 16% (RH) and 20 (CAT) of eggs. Feeding 10^5 CFU of natural symbiont Rhococcus rhodii transformed to express RH-specific hairpin RNA reduced RH expression 89% and oviposition. Modified microbiota induced systemic RNAi in R. prolixus may result in a paratransgenic strategy for sustainable vector control. Oral delivery of bacteria expressing dsRNA for CAT or RHBP affected normal development and female fecundity. Results show E. coli can deliver RH and CAT dsRNA into the midgut, leading to systemic RNAi in fat, anterior midgut, and ovaries, and modified symbiotic R. rhn also induced gene silencing with physiological effects.
Fever in pregnancy poses significant risks to both mother and fetus, and in the 1980s, malaria was the leading cause of death in pregnant women in refugee camps on the Thai-Burmese border. Artemisinin combination therapy has reduced malaria incidence, but remaining causes of fever are not well-documented. A study of 8,117 pregnant women attending antenatal clinics from 2004-2006 found 5% experienced febrile episodes, with malaria being the main cause in 55.5% of cases. Arthropod-borne, rickettsial, and zoonotic diseases accounted for nearly half of febr illnesses, with coinfection observed in 3.9% of women. Pyelonephritis was a common cause in 19.7% of cases. Scrub and murine typhus were associated with poor pregnancy outcomes, including stillbirth and low birth weight. Malaria remains the leading cause of fever, but scrub and murine typhus are also significant causes associated with poor outcomes. Treatment with azithromycin is recommended for febr pregnant women without malaria, pyelonephritis, or respiratory infection. The study highlights the importance of understanding causes of febr illness in pregnant women in tropical areas to reduce maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality.
Researchers investigated the relationship between maternal age and recombination rates in humans by analyzing over 600,000 genotyped markers in 69 French-Canadian pedigrees, revealing recombination events in 195 meioses. A significant decrease in recombination rates with advancing maternal age was observed, likely driven by chromosome-specific effects localized in the middle of chromosomal arms and subtelomeric regions. This decrease may lead to reduced protection against non-disjunction, contributing to higher aneuploidy rates in older women. A genome-wide decrease in recombination rate with maternal age was found, with significant decay on nine chromosomes in the French-Canadian cohort and two in the Hutterite. The reduction in recombination for older mothers was greater in the middle of chromosomal arms and subtelomeric regions compared to other areas. Comparison of recombination hotspots between younger and older mothers showed distinct patterns, highlighting different mechanistic or structural constraints influencing recombination over generations. The findings support the hypothesis that chromosome-specific effects are determinants of the relationship between maternal age and recombination, varying among populations due to genetic factors regulating recombination machinery. The study provides insight into age-related causes of non-disjunction, a major factor in chromosomal aneuploidy in women, and proposes a model reconciling associations between maternal age and recombination in trisomy cases.
Researchers have developed an immunization strategy to induce innate memory in macrophages in vivo, resulting in prolonged protection against Cryptococcus neoformans infection. IF-γ priming of macroages in vivo induces a rapid upregulation of IFN-γ and STAT1 signaling pathways, leading to enhanced cytokine recall responses that are pathogen-specific and dependent on changes in histone methylation and acetylation. This correlates with increased STAT1 binding to promoter regions of genes associated with anti-fungal immunity. The innate-like phenotype is maintained for at least 70 days post-immunization, providing complete protection against secondary challenge in the absence of adaptive immune cells. IF-γ priming of macroages in vivo establishes antigen-specific memory-like responses, suggesting a novel mechanism for vaccine-mediated protection in immunocompromised patients. Previous studies have shown that mice with macroages deficient in STAT1 are unable to mount a protective response against C neoform strain H99, and defects in trained immunity have been documented in patients with STAT1-mediated chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Priming macroages via the STAT pathway appears important for memory-like innate priming with correlation to microbial infection rather than microbial products. This approach targets IF-γ associated genes, leaving residual TLR and CLR functions intact for host-defense mechanisms, demonstrating an alternative to induce macroage memory in vivo facilitating pathogen-specific vaccine responses.
Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs) play crucial roles in transcriptional repression and developmental regulation in plants and animals. In Arabidopsis, depletion of different Polycomb group (Pc) components causes overlapping and unique phenotypic defects. Researchers quantitatively compared changes of tri-methylation at H3K27 in Arabidopsis mutants of key PRC components, showing CURLY LEAF (CL) coordinates with different members of PRC1 in suppression of distinct plant programs. Flower development genes are repressed in seedlings via non-redundant role of CL, associated with LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP). Embryo development genes are repressed by P1-catalytic subunits AtBMI and AtRING in common with P2-catal enzymes CL or SWINGER (SW). The context-dependent role of CL corresponds with H3K27me profiles and differential occupancy of motifs of transcription factors including MADS and ABA-related factors. Combinations of P members regulate different developmental programs and target specificity modulated by transcription factors. Genome-wide comparison of H3K27me and gene profiles in loss-function mutants of P1 and P2 components in Arabidopsis seedlings revealed P1 and P2 participate in transcription repression by catalyzing H27 tri-methylation and H2 ubiquination. Depletion of P components leads to developmental defects, raising questions about specificity of P. The study proposes different combinations of P members regulate developmental programs and specificity modulated by transcription factors.
Researchers investigated the RNA polymerase II trigger loop in Saccharomyces cerevisiae at individual-residue resolution, quantitatively phenotyping nearly all single variants to dissect its role in substrate selection, catalysis, and translocation. Three mutant classes with distinct distributions among residues revealed phenotypes linked to transcription defects or stresses. Disrupting an intra-loop hydrophobic pocket, proposed to provide a mechanism for substrate-triggered folding, conferred phenotypes consistent with increased catalysis. Genetic interactions between trigger loop and proximal domain residues supported the contribution of funnel and bridge helices to dynamics. The study incorporated structural and phenotypic data for high-resolution dissection of transcription mechanisms and evolution, applicable to other yeast proteins. Phenotypic landscape shed light on functional contributions of residues to dynamics, catalysis, and sequence evolution, expanding existing mutational studies. Data indicated intra-loop interactions and interactions with nearby domains are critical for function. Coupled with structures, genetic studies supported distinction between residues and multi-step folding for catalysis, identifying gain-of-function and loss-of-function variants, some conferring epistatic interactions. The trigger loop's ability to fold into conformations and dynamic conversion between states is critical, with perturbations resulting in altered activity and translocation, manifesting as loss-of-function or gain-of-function phenotypes.
Researchers investigated the pathogenesis of rabies virus (RV) and its ability to invade the central nervous system (CNS) via hematogenous spread. Mice were infected intramuscularly (i.m) or intravenously (i.v) with dog-associated RV (DOG) or silver-haired bat-associated RV (SB) and monitored for clinical signs of rabies. While both variants caused lethal encephalopathy via i.m infection, only i.v infection with SB resulted in lethal encephalopathy. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that i.v administered SB directly infected the forebrain, with the earliest affected regions being hypothalamic nuclei connected to circumventricular organs. The study suggests hematogenous spread of SB leads to fatal encephalopathy through retrograde invasion of the CNS at the neurovascular interface of the hypothalamus-hypophysis system. This alternative mode of virus spread has implications for post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies, particularly with silver-haired bat RV. The findings indicate that certain RV variants can invade the brain from the periphery via hematogenous spread and highlight the importance of antibodies in preventing rabies when administered in the presymptomatic stage. The study demonstrates a difference in pathogenicity between DOG and SB when inoculated into the bloodstream, with i.v inoculation of DOG not causing clinical signs of rabies, whereas i.v infection with SB resulted in lethal encephalopathy.
The H1N1 subtype of influenza A virus has caused significant morbidity and mortality in humans since the 1918 pandemic, with substantial disease burden continuing to the present. Despite this, the evolutionary history of A/H1N1 is not well understood, particularly the virological basis for epidemics of unusual severity in the 1940s and 1950s. Analysis of 71 complete genome sequences between 1918 and 2006 shows segmental reassortment played an important role in genomic evolution of A1 since 1918. An A1 isolate from the 1947 epidemic acquired novel PB2 and HA genes through intra-subtype reassortment, explaining abrupt antigenic evolution. The 195 epidemic may have been associated with reassortant A1 viruses. Intra-subtype reassort appears more important in evolution and epidemiology of H1 influenza than realized. Eight genome segments of H1 influenza exhibited congruent evolutionary patterns during the 20th century with strong phylogenetic evidence for distinct reassort events affecting segments. Reassortment between avian and human influenza generated novel H2N2 and H3N2 strains causing global pandemics in 1957 and 196. Few studies of reassort frequency in human A1 have been undertaken, with A1 thought to experience less antigenic evolution than A3.
Nicotine exerts its reinforcing effects by stimulating nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and boosting dopamine output from the ventral tegmental area. Research has debated the principal pathway of nicotine action, whether direct stimulation of dopaminergic cells or disinhibition through desensitization of GABA interneurons. A computational model of the ventral tegmental circuit and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor function reveals α4β2-containing receptors on dopaminergic or GABA cells mediate acute nicotine effects, accounting for in vitro and in vivo data. The model predicts conditions for direct stimulation or disinhibition to increase dopamine activity and proposes experiments to disentangle both mechanisms. The rate of endogenous acetylcholine input determines the evoked dopamine response for both mechanisms. The ventral tegmental area mediates nicotine's acute properties and suggests an acetylcholine dependence for reinforcement. A novel mesoscopic modeling approach extends population representation of dopamin and GABA neurons to describe nicotinic accholine receptor responses, clarifying interplay of pharmacodynamics and dopamin signaling. Endogenous cholin input is low for direct stimulation and high for disinhibition to observe dopamine increase, emerging from αβ2 nicotinic accholine receptor activation and desensitization properties. Experimental results support the role of GABA cells in nicotine action and the model captures nicotine-evoked modulation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to dopamin neurons.
Anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis, a chronic and disfiguring skin disease caused by Leishmania tropica infection, has limited therapeutic options. A randomized, double-blinded phase II trial in Kabul, Afghanistan, treated skin lesions with bipolar high-frequency electrocauterization followed by moist wound treatment with or without DAC-055. Patients under 5, with facial lesions, pregnancy, or comorbidities were excluded. The primary outcome was time for complete epithelialization. Biopsies were taken prior, after closure, and 6 months later. Mean duration for wound closure was 43.1 and 42 days in both groups. DAC-055 caused rapid epithelialization in Leishmania-positive biopsies. Superinfections occurred at 8.8% in both groups. Relapses were 10.2% and 18.5% in groups I and II. In vitro, DAC-055 showed leishicidal effect on promastigotes. Compared to intralesional antimony, electrocauter plus moist treatment led to rapid wound closure. Results suggest lower relapse rate and acceleration of wound closure warrant future studies on DAC-055 activity.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide RNAi screen in Drosophila cells to identify factors impacting RAS-mediated MAPK activation, revealing 101 validated hits, including most previously known factors associated with the pathway. Epistasis experiments determined their position relative to core components, showing several new factors acting at different steps, including a protein modulating RAF activation, and most working downstream of MEK, influencing MAPK expression. These hits mainly consist of constitutive splicing factors, suggesting splicing plays a role in establishing MAPK levels. Two representative members were characterized, acting by regulating MAPK alternative splicing. The study provides an assessment of factors modulating RAS/MAP signaling, indicating the pathway relies not solely on classical events, such as RAF activation, but also on MAPK regulation. Core splicing components can impact alternative splicing. The RAS/MAP cascade involves sequential activation of RAF, MEK, and MAP, with MAP having various cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates, including transcription factors. New candidates, P1-87 and Sur-8, act in the RAS-RA interval, consistent with evidence from other organisms. The screen identified novel components upstream of RAF and factors acting at different steps, with some causing fluctuations in multiple proteins or transcripts, impacting non-RAS/MK assays.
A retrospective study of 498 Cryptococcus neoformans and C. gattii isolates in Thailand found 485 C. neoans and 13 C.gatt strains, with the majority from males and 88.5% of C. neoans from HIV patients. Molecular analysis revealed most isolates were C. neoans molecular type VNI, regardless of source. Multilocus sequence typing identified 20 sequence types, including ST30 for C.gatt and ST82, ST83, ST137, ST141, ST172, and ST173 for C neoans unique to Thailand. Most C.gatt isolates were ST7=VGb, identical to the Vancouver outbreak genotype. The study revealed greater genetic diversity and a wider range of molecular types amongst Thai cryptoccal isolates than previously reported. C neoans was the most common species among HIV positive patients, while C.gatt was a primary pathogen in immunocompet patients. The distribution of cryptoccal genotypes in Thailand is similar to worldwide, with predominance of C neoans var grubii, molecular VNI, isolated from HIV patients. The study suggests greater genetic diversity amongst Thai cryptoccal isolates, especially VNI strains, with 13 sequence types reported. The majority of Thai isolates are part of the global cryptoccal population, indicating Thailand as a stepping stone in the spread of the Vancouver outbreak strain.
Researchers analyzed the evolution of C2H-ZF zinc finger transcription factors across 12 Drosophila species spanning 45 million years and found significant variations in DNA-binding specificities among orthologs, including loss and recruitment of C2H-Z domains and diverging DNA-contacting residues in 44% of shared domains between D. melanogaster and other species. These diverging residues show evidence of functional constraint, being conserved across phylogenetic clades and evolving slower than other residues, and are rarely found as polymorphisms within D. melanaster populations, indicating rapid fixation. The specificities of dynamic domains change gradually across phylogenetic distances, suggesting stepwise evolutionary trajectories for TF divergence. Proteins with conserved C2-ZF domains are enriched in developmental functions, while those with varying domains exhibit no enrichments. The study suggests a subset of highly dynamic TFs are a source of regulatory variation in Drosila and metazo. Over half of single-copy polyF 1-1 orthogroups exhibit variation in number and arrangement of DNA-binding C2-ZF domains and specificity-conferring residues. Variations in specificity-determining positions influence binding specificities, challenging the assumption that 1-1 ortholog TFs are conserved, and provide evidence that binding modifications play a role in regulatory evolution.
Researchers have developed a conventional multiplex PCR assay and EvaGreen-based real-time singleplex PCR for detecting and differentiating Salmonella serotypes Typhi and Paratyphi, the causal agents of typhoid and paratyphoid fevers, using CRISPR as a serotype-specific target. The assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity and specificity after validation on 188 serotype Typhi and 74 seratyphi A strains from diverse genetic groups, geographic origins, and periods, and 70 strains of bacteria frequently encountered in bloodstream infections, including 29 other Salmonella serotypes and 42 strains from 38 bacterial species. CRISPR regions were identified as a unique and stable target in a conserved region of the Salmonella genome for each serotype. The CRPR-based assays were validated on cultured bacterial isolates and may facilitate identification of serotypes in clinical and public laboratories. Specificity was assessed by testing negative controls including 43 serotype Typhi isolates, 37 serotype Paraty A isolates, 29 non-typhoidal Salmonella strains, 18 non-Salmonella strains, and sterile water. The CRPR targets are suitable for specific detection of all populations of serotypes Typhi and Paraty A and may be used as an alternative to serotyping due to lack of availability of sera or non-motile strains.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch signaling in the differentiation of IFN-γ-secreting CD4+ T helper 1 cells during Leishmania major infection. Mice with T-cell specific ablation of Notch1 and Notch2 developed unhealing lesions and uncontrolled parasitemia, correlating with impaired IFNγ secretion and increased IL-5 and IL-13 cytokine secretion. Single inactivation of Notch1 or Notch2 resulted in resistance to infection and a protective Th1 response, indicating redundant Notch1 and Notch2 expression drives Th1 differentiation. Notch signaling is required for IFγ secretion by Th1 cells, independent of CSL/RBP-κ, as mice with RBP-κ deletion in T cells developed IFγ-secreting Th cells and healed lesions. Notch1 and Not2 are the only Notch receptors expressed on activated CD4 T cells, and compensatory expression of one or all Notch receptors on T cells occurs following parasite inoculation. Notch contributes to the generation of IFγ-secting CD4 cells, essential for controlling parasite load and lesion size. The study demonstrates a crucial role for RBP-κ-independent Notch signaling in Th1 differentiation following Leishmania infection. Understanding Notch regulation of IFγ-secreting Th cells and involved ligands may contribute to vaccine and immunotherapeutic development for Leishmania and other infections requiring IFγ-secreting CD4 Th response.
Acute Schistosoma mansoni infection increases susceptibility to systemic SHIV clade C infection in rhesus macaques after mucosal virus exposure. Individuals in sub-Saharan Africa, who represent 10% of the world's population, account for almost 2/3 of all HIV-1/AIDS cases, possibly due to helminthic infections. Researchers tested whether pre-existing Schistoma mansoni infection in rhes monkeys facilitates systemic infection after mucosal AIDS exposure. Two groups, normal and parasitized monkeys, were challenged intrarectally with decreasing doses of R5-tropic SHIV-C. Systemic infection occurred in parasitized monkeys at viral doses that remained sub-infectious in normal hosts. The 50 animal infectious dose was 17-fold lower in parasitized animals compared to controls. Coinfected animals had higher peak RNA loads and increased viral replication in CD4 central cells. This study provides direct evidence that acute schistosomias significantly increases the risk of de novo virus acquisition. Control of helmin infections may be a useful public health intervention to decrease the spread of HIV-1. Estimated 90 of new HIV-1 infections occur by mucosal transmission, almost exclusively R5 strains, and clade C strains cause 50 of infections worldwide. The increased susceptibility observed has public health implications for areas where parasitic worms and HIV-1 are endemic, supporting the suggestion that controlling helmin infections may reduce HIV/AIDS spread.
Acetylcholine regulates neural excitability and is a key neurochemical substrate of sleep, inducing effects including reduction in spike-frequency adaptation and shift in phase response curve. A biophysical modeling demonstrates interactions between neural excitability and network structure create distinct regimes: localized, traveling, and synchronous. Results match experimental observations of cortical activity during slow wave sleep, REM, and waking states. The model, composed of Hodgkin-Hux type neurons with M-current regulated by acetylcholine, shows regulation of acetylcholine level accounts for dynamical changes between regimes. Reduction of M-current recreates reduction in spike-frequency adaptation and shift from type 2 to type 1 phase response curve. Low acch levels create traveling waves, while high levels result in localized patterns pinned by network inhomogeneities. Further decrease in acch leads to high synchrony within traveling waves. Acetylch determines network sensitivity to synaptic heterogeneity. Regimes have functional significance as stationary patterns may play a role in encoding external input memory and traveling waves lead to synaptic regularization. Experiments show stimulation of cholin neurons induces transition from slow wave to REM-like activity. Analysis identifies slow wave as traveling wave originating in frontal cortex and propagating to posterior. Acetylch modulates neural excitability through nicotinic and muscarinic receptors, reducing spike adaptation and changing synchronization properties.
Researchers investigated the impact of mutations in the Toll-like receptor pathway on esophageal carcinogenesis, specifically esophageal adenocarcinoma, and found that 14.6% of 171 tumors had non-synonymous mutations affecting the Toll-like receptor pathway, with TLR4 being the most frequently mutated gene. These mutations were associated with proximal and metastatic disease, suggesting clinical significance. Validation in an external dataset showed 22.1% of tumors had non-synonymous TLR pathway mutations. TLR mutations were also found in other solid tumors exposed to microbiomes, including uterine endometroid carcinoma, cutaneous melanoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma. Specific TLR4 mutations, E439, S570, I703, and R787, had impaired reactivity to bacterial lipopolysaccharide with marked reductions in signaling. The study suggests TLR genes are recurrently mutated in esophageal adenocarcinoma and TLR mutations may play a role in disease pathogenesis in a subset of patients by disrupting innate immune signaling and promoting a microenvironment that favors tumorigenesis. TLR pathway mutations were frequently observed in solid tumors arising in body sites exposed to microbiota, including the oral and gastrointestinal tract, skin, urogen tract, and respiratory tract, with increased frequency in cancer types highly exposed to microbes.
Researchers investigated the molecular regulation of taste development in mice by combining in silico and in vivo analyses, focusing on taste receptor molecules required for sweet, bitter, and umami taste signal transduction. They discovered that these molecules colocalize within developing circumvallate papillae and used computational analysis to identify a common regulatory network for their transcription, revealing Hes as a likely regulatory factor. Expression analysis showed decreased nuclear Hes correlated with type II taste cell markers, and Hes−/− mutants displayed over 5-fold more TRM-immunactive cells than wild-type littermates after stage E18. The study suggests Hes plays a role in orchestrating taste cell differentiation in developing taste buds. In situ hybridization revealed Hes transcript in large numbers of cells within taste buds, overlapping with TRMs, and a reduction in nuclear Hes in type I and III taste cells in older animals. Computational analysis yielded several transcription factors involved in the TRM regulatory network, supporting Hes as a common regulator of taste cell differentiation. The findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of cell differentiation in developing taste buds, previously unknown despite studies on taste signal transduction and cell lineage.
Researchers investigated the interaction between ethylene and auxin in rice seedling root development, finding that transcriptional activation of OsE1 and YUC8/RE7 expression and indole-3-pyruvic acid-dependent auxin biosynthesis is required for ethylene-inhibited root elongation. Using an inhibitor of YUC activity, they showed that ethylene-inhibited primary root elongation is dependent on YUC-based auxin biosynthesis. A rice ethylene-insensitive mutant, rein-1, was identified with a truncated YUC8/RE7, resulting in reduced auxin biosynthesis, while Y8/RE7 overexpression enhanced ethylene sensitivity. Y8/RE7 catalyzed the conversion of indole-3-pyvic acid to indole-3-acetic acid, with the truncated version showing reduced enzymatic activity. Ethylene induced Y8/7 expression and promoted auxin accumulation in roots, with low concentrations of indole-3-acetic acid rescuing the ethylene response in rein-1. Genetic studies revealed Y8/7-mediated auxin biosynthesis functions downstream of Os1, directly activating Y8/7 expression. The findings reveal a model of interaction between ethylene and auxin in seedling root elongation, enhancing understanding of ethylene signaling in rice. Y8/7 participates in auxin biosynthesis, with multiple studies demonstrating ethylene enhances auxin biosynthesis to inhibit elongation. Introduction of a DR5:G reporter showed Y8/7 involvement in ethylene-enhanced auxin biosynthesis in root, providing insight into ethylene and auxin interaction regulating root growth.
A nationwide study in Saudi Arabia investigated the epidemiology of non-tuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) diseases, revealing a high diversity of species and increasing incidence. Of 527 isolates collected, 76.5% were from Saudi citizens, 34.2% were elderly, and 65.3% male, with 75.1% being pulmonary and 44.7% clinically significant. Thirty-four NT species, including 17 rare ones, were identified, with M. simiae, M. fortuitum, and M. abscessus being predominant. New cases of clinically relevant M. riyense were also found. Diabetes and previous tuberculosis history were independent risk factors associated with NT diseases. Rare events such as mycobacteremia, abscess, peritonitis, and ascites were caused by M. wolinsky, M. holsatic, M. duval, and M. mon. The study highlights the emergence of NT diseases as a challenge in Saudi Arabia, necessitating prioritization and development of diagnostic and management plans.
Yeast chronological lifespan is dependent on the accumulation of storage carbohydrates mediated by Yak1, Mck1, and Rim15 kinases. Upon starvation, yeast cells exit the mitotic cycle and acquire characteristics of quiescent cells to ensure longevity. Research using starvation-specific reporters and gene deletion libraries identified Rim15, Mck, and Yak1 kinases, SNF1/AMP complex, cell wall integrity, and cell cycle regulators as necessary for quiescence and lifespan extension. Chronological lifespan correlates with storage carbohydrate accumulation, not cell cycle status. Removing glycogen and trehalose biosynthetic genes reduces lifespan, while overexpressing these genes or supplementing trehalose rescues defects in signaling mutants. Yak1, Rim, and Mck regulate intracellular oxygen species and mediate TOR-regulated storage and lifespan extension. Metabolic reprogramming for energy stores and antioxidant defense is coordinated by Yak1, Rim, and Mck for quiescence entry and lifespan. Deficiency in carbohydrate accumulation, not cell cycle exit, correlates with decreased lifespan. Accumulation of trehal and glycogen is essential for chronological lifespan extension, with trehal being a better predictor in tor1 mutants. Signaling pathways activated by starvation reprogram carbon metabolism for energy stores in quiescent cells.
Researchers utilized error-correcting viral population sequencing to investigate the role of hemagglutinin glycosylation in compensating for fitness defects resulting from escape from anti-HA neutralizing antibodies in influenza A viruses. The study revealed that antibody-free propagation following antigenic escape rapidly selected viruses with mutations that modulated receptor avidity through the addition of N-linked glycans to the HA globular domain, expanding understanding of the mechanisms that maintain fitness during antigenic evolution to include glycan addition. Glycosylation plays a role in compensating for fitness costs imposed by substitutions on hemagglutinin, increasing viability and emergence of antibody-escape variants. The findings indicate glycosylation can restore optimal receptor interactions, increasing fitness of antigen escape variants even without antibody pressure, contributing to steady accumulation of N-linked glycans during human circulation of H1 and H3 viruses. High-definition virus sequencing revealed a new role for N-linked glycosylation facilitating immune escape, compensating for fitness costs and increasing viability of antibody-escape variants. The discovery highlights the power of virus sequencing in uncovering novel mechanisms of adaptation through high-definition genetics, broadening understanding of glycosylation function during antigenic drift and mutational plasticity of hemagglutinin.
Researchers analyzed 13 ventricular myocyte models to investigate rate dependence of antiarrhythmic drugs that prolong cardiac action potential. Reverse rate dependence, where prolongation is greater at slow heart rates, reduces arrhythm suppression at fast rates and increases arrhythm risk at slow rates, is a problematic property of these drugs. The study aimed to identify targets exhibiting forward dependence, where prolongation is greater at fast rates. Simulating populations of myocytes with varying properties, the analysis predicted rate-dependent effects of changes in multiple parameters, testing an average of 40 parameters per model at slow and fast rates. The results identified ionic perturbations that produce forward dependence and specific mechanisms, such as increased L-type calcium current with indirect rate-dependent changes in delayed rectifier potassium. Inward rectifier potassium and sodium-potassium pump were identified as likely targets to produce forward dependence. Statistical analysis showed models with minimal rate-dependent changes in action potential shape have little capacity for forward dependence, while those with large changes have considerable potential. The study provides insights into determinants of action potential rate dependence and a strategy for designing beneficial antiarrmic drugs, suggesting forward dependence can be produced if perturbations cause indirect effects on other ionic currents with rate-dependent properties.
Researchers developed a new method for Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheAS) using ICD-10 codes and biological results with a quantitative trait as the selection criterion and applied it to thiopurine-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity in patients treated with thiopurine drugs. Two aggregation methods for ICD10 codes and discretization algorithms for biological results were used to analyze 442 patient records with 10,252 ICD10 codes and 72,711 test results from a French hospital between 2000 and 2013 after thiopurine treatment initiation. Results showed concordance between I9-CM and I10 codes and cross-validation with biological tests validated I phenotypes. High TPMT activity was associated with iron-deficiency anemia and diabetes mellitus. The study identified potential associations between TPMT and clinical data in pharmacogenomics using I10 classification for the first time. The relationship between thiopine prescriptions and TP assays was considered by incorporating temporal data and restricting analysis to post-treatment events. Biological tests validated phenotypes obtained from ICD analysis. High TP activity was linked to signs that could indicate thiopine therapy failure and sustained steroid requirements in IBD patients. This method allows identification of patient subgroups requiring personalized management in pharmacogenomics.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 150 publications on stem cell transplantation in animal models of traumatic spinal cord injury found that allogenic stem cell treatment improved motor and sensory outcomes. The overall effect size was 27.2% for motor outcomes and 26.3% for sensory outcomes, with significant heterogeneity between experiments. Differentiation before implantation and intravenous delivery favored better sensory outcomes, while stem cell implantation did not improve sensory outcomes in female animals and was enhanced by isoflurane anesthesia. Biological plausibility was supported by a dose-response relationship. For motor outcomes, facets of cell biology had little effect, but experimental modeling, injury location, and immunosuppression had an impact. Reporting measures to reduce bias were higher than in other neuroscience domains but still suboptimal, with unblinded assessments inflating efficacy estimates. Extensive preclinical literature suggests stem-cell therapies may offer promise, but compromised validity and publication bias likely lower efficacy than reported. Objectives were to establish efficacy of stem cells, conditions for greatest efficacy, and effect of study quality on efficacy in traumatic spinal cord injury animal models.
Soil-transmitted helminth infections, including Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura, affect over a billion people worldwide. Preventive chemotherapy is the main control strategy, but does not prevent reinfection. A systematic review and meta-analysis assessed patterns and dynamics of STH reinfection after treatment. Fifty-one studies were included, with 24 providing STH rates pre- and post-treatment, and 42 reporting determinants of predisposition to reinfection. At 3, 6, and 12 months post-treatment, A. lumicoid prevalence reached 26%, 68%, and 94% of pre-treatment levels, T. trichi 36%, 67%, and 82%, and hookworm 30%, 55%, and 57%. Prevalence and intensity of reinfection correlated with pre-treatment status. STH infections occur rapidly after treatment, particularly A. lumic and T. trichi. Frequent anthelmic administrations are needed to maximize the benefit of chemotherapy. Integrated approaches emphasizing health education and sanitation are required to interrupt STH transmission. Egg reduction rate may be a better indicator than cure rate for anthelmic efficacy. The study found significant relationships between STH and socioeconomic factors could not be definitively assessed due to variations in diagnostic methods, frequency, and efficacy of anthelmic drugs and adherence between studies.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is associated with metabolic syndromes spanning a spectrum of diseases from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. To identify deregulation in metabolic processes, researchers use pathway analysis, which requires predefined maps of reactions and subsystems. However, these approaches are subject to biases and cannot capture complex interactions. A new framework, Minimum Enrich Analysis, applies to genome-scale metabolic networks to generate minimal networks synthesizing target metabolites. Applied to nonalcoholic fatty liver in humans and mice, it identified deregulations in cholesteryl ester, cholesterol, and hexadecanoate synthesis. Key regulators of hydrogen peroxide synthesis differed between humans and mice. Minimal Enrich Analysis is applicable to any genome-scale metabolic network and target metabolite, making it flexible for studying condition-specific metabolism in diseases. The method formulates metabolic tasks mimicking disease phenotypes, such as lipid droplet formation and inflammation, and includes necessary metabolites. It overcomes limitations of traditional approaches by capturing complex interactions and balancing cofactors. Minimal Enrich Analysis provides insights into deregulated networks and regulatory processes in nonalcoholic liver disease and can be used to study other diseases and organisms with available genome-scale metabolic networks.
The olfactory system faces the challenge of identifying a vast array of odors regardless of intensity, and primacy coding, where odor identity is encoded by the earliest responding receptors, may provide a compact and informative representation for the brain. Analysis of a simple primacy coding model using numerical simulations and statistical descriptions shows that the encoded information depends strongly on the number of receptor types included, but weakly on the size of the receptor repertoire, and is independent of odor intensity. The model performs typical olfactory tasks with near experimentally measured performance and suggests smaller receptor repertoires can be advantageous in certain situations. Overly sensitive receptors can dominate and render the array useless, indicating a need for adaptation to environmental changes. Primacy coding outperforms simple and normalized coding due to sparse representations independent of odor statistics. The model predicts receptors are useful only if their likelihood to respond to odors is similar and that primacy formed in the olfactory bulb is more useful for identifying odors than alternatives. Results indicate a strong selective pressure to adjust receptor sensitivities and that primacy provides a robust, concentration-invariant representation, depending weakly on receptor details, allowing typical olfactory tasks to be solved.
Researchers investigated the phenomenon of incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoid neutralization curves for broadly neutralizing HIV monoclonal antibodies (bnMAbs) against a wide range of viruses. Using two panels of pseudoviruses and a panel of viruses in the TZM-bl assay, they found that bnabs targeting many neutralizing epitopes of the spike had neutralization profiles that plateaued at less than 100%. Bnabs targeting the V2 apex and gp41 were most likely to show neutralization curves that plateaued less than 100%, while those targeting high-mannose patch epitopes were less likely to exhibit this behavior. CD4 binding site antibodies also showed this behavior relatively infrequently. Incomplete neutralization was observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells-grown virus and molecular clones. Five bnabs were compared against an 18-virus panel produced in 293 cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with examples of plateaus less than 90% seen in both types. All bnabs were subject to inhibition that did not reach 100% and most had neutral curves with non-sigmoid slopes, with certain areas of the trimer more prone to these effects. Incomplete neutralization and non-sigmoid neutral curves are possible for all bnabs against a wide range of viruses, with implications for use in therapy and vaccine design. Neutralization profiles were evaluated with a panel of pseudoviruses in the TZ-bl assay, with some bnabs neutralizing the majority of viruses with an MP value close to 100, while others resulted in incomplete neutralization with MP less than 90 for a fraction of viruses.
Researchers investigated the metabolic traits of cancer cells, including aerobic production of lactate from glucose and extensive glutamine utilization, to understand how these rearrangements contribute to cell proliferation. A systematic model of human metabolism was simulated to convert glucose and glutamine to energy and biomass production, revealing that proliferating cells displayed fermentation of glucose to lactate in the presence of oxygen. At high glutamine utilization rates, glucose oxidation decreased and lactate production from glutamine increased, only when available carbon exceeded the amount that could be oxidized by oxygen. Flux Balance Analysis indicated this pattern maximizes biomass and ATP production, requiring a branched TCA cycle and redox-controlled reactions. Experimental assessment in a K-ras cell line validated computational results, predicting metabolite variations. Findings offer new understanding of metabolic reprogramming underlying cancer growth, suggesting competition between glucose and glutamine plays a role. The Warburg effect, characterized by aerobic glycolysis and glutamine utilization, is enhanced in unrestricted cell growth, requiring metabolic flux reorganization. Simulations of 50,000 wirings to modulation of glucose or glutamine flux identified boundary conditions promoting cancer rewiring, with implications for understanding cancer cell growth and metabolism.
Researchers investigated the interactome of the cellular prion protein (PrPc) and its mammalian paralogs, Doppel and Shadoo, in a cell culture model permissive to prion replication. The study established a similar physiological environment for the three prion family members in neuroblast cells and suggested direct interactions amongst them. Multiple interactions between PrPc and neural adhesion molecules, laminin receptor, Na/K-ATPases, and protein disulfide isomerases were confirmed, reconciling previous findings. Interactions between PrP and disulfide isomerases may extend beyond the endoplasmic reticulum and play a role in PrP accumulation. A hypothesis suggests Pr organizes its environment by binding adhesion molecules with immunoglobulin-like domains, recognizing oligomannose membrane proteins. Members of the mammalian prion family may populate similar environments in neuroblast cells and interact with endoplasmic retic chaperones. The prion family may be embedded in membrane domains supporting adhesion, lactate metabolism, and cell fusion. Biochemical interactions among mammalian prion family members exist. Prions are causative agents of neurodegenerative diseases, where Pr converts to a disease-associated conformer with different properties. The majority of co-purified proteins interact with all three bait proteins, indicating a similar molecular environment for the mammalian prion family in neuroblast cells.
Respiratory virus infections, such as influenza, typically induce a robust type 1 pro-inflammatory immune response, but type 2 cytokine production has also been observed. Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a prototypical type 2 cytokine essential for eosinophil maturation and egress from the bone marrow. Using a mouse model of influenza infection, researchers found a transient release of IL-5 into airways with significant accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs, particularly during the recovery phase. The source of IL-5 was group 2 innate lymphoid cells (I2) infiltrating infected lungs. Enhanced IL-5 production by I2 during recovery was concurrent with expression of the IL-33 receptor subunit ST2 by I2. NKT cells and alveolar macrophages (AM) are endogenous sources of IL-33 that enhance IL-5 production from I2. The interaction between c-kit+I2 and IL-33 producing NKT and AM leads to abundant IL-5 production by I2, accounting for eosinophil accumulation during recovery. Peak IL-5 release into airways corresponded to peak effector T dependent-inflammatory cytokine release. IL-5 was first detected in bronchoalveolar lavage at 4 days post-infection, maximum at 7 days post-infection, and undetectable at 8 days post-infection likely due to consumption by eosinils. I2 recruited to infected lungs primarily produce IL-5, stimulating eosinophil recruitment late in infection during recovery.
Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in children and HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa, but the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of NT disease in Asia are not well documented. A retrospective study of 102 NT infections at an infectious disease hospital in Southern Vietnam between 2008 and 2013 found 71% of patients were HIV-infected, 90% were adults, 71% male, and 33% reported intravenous drug use. The mortality rate was 28%, with HIV infection significantly associated with death. The most identified serovars were S. Enteritidis (43%) and S. Typhimurium (30%), with S. Typhurium more common in HIV-infected individuals. Isolates from HIV-infected patients showed reduced susceptibility to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The study concludes NT disease is severe in Vietnam with a high mortality rate, similar to sub-Saharan Africa, with HIV infection a risk factor for death, primarily in HIV-infected men. Continued surveillance, including sequencing, is recommended to monitor emergence of multi-drug resistant strains. The overall incidence of NT infections in Southeast Asia is limited compared to Africa, but similarly, HIV is the primary factor for NT disease in adults.
Researchers have developed a method to predict phage structural proteins using Artificial Neural Networks (ANs) that classify viral proteins based on amino acid frequency, achieving high specificity and sensitivity. Adding protein isoelectric points as a feature improved accuracy for specialized proteins, such as major capsid and tail proteins. Experimentally validating the predictions, several ORFs with no similarities to known sequences self-assembled into structures resembling virion. The ANs are tools for identifying phage and prophage proteins difficult to detect by bioinformatic analysis, valuable when sequence is available but in vitro propagation is impractical. The study aimed to design a computational tool not relying on sequence similarity to identify viral components, training feed-forward back-propagation networks classifying phage sequences by amino composition and isoelectric point. An ensemble of five networks identified a broad spectrum of phage proteins with 80% accuracy, while two ensembles of 10 ANs identified capsid and tail proteins with high specificity. Structural proteins are ideal targets for detection as they are present in all viruses, serving as an analog to rRNA in classification. The ANs recognize classes of virion proteins, trained with sequences from prophages, proviruses, and viral genomes infecting prokarya, eukarya, and archaea, and assessed against phage, capsid, and coat sequences from archaea and eukarya.
Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is an oncogenic human virus with a large genome encoding over 85 proteins, including unique and conserved herpesviral proteins. The function of KV ORF20, a member of the herpesviral UL24 family, and its role in the viral life cycle is not well understood. Quantitative affinity purification coupled mass spectrometry identified interferon-stimulated gene oligoadenylate synthase-like protein (OL) as an interacting partner of ORF20. Both endogenous and transiently transfected OL co-immunprecipitated with ORF, conserved among all OR20 isoforms and multiple OR20 homologs in herpesviruses. Characterization of OL interacting partners identified a similar interactome to OR20, including ribosomal and nucleolar proteins. OR20 and OL copurified with 40 and 60 ribosomal subunits, associating with polysomes when co-expressed. OR20 enhanced RIG induced expression of endogenous OL in an IR3-dependent IFN-independent manner. OL has antiviral activity against some viruses, but its role in gammaherpesvirus was unknown. During reactivation of latently infected HuLT-rSH cells, OL and OR20 mRNA were induced, and OL enhanced KV infection. However, with a KV OR20stop mutant, OL-dependent infectivity was lost, suggesting OR20 usurps OL function to benefit KV infection.
A study was conducted to determine the prevalence and presentation of Lassa virus disease (LVD) in febrile children with and without convulsions in an endemic area of Nigeria. Of 913 feile children admitted, 373 had fever, with 108 presenting convulsions. The overall prevalence of LVD was 3.5% in feile admissions, 2.8% in cases and 3.8% in controls. Vomiting and bleeding were associated with increased prevalence of LVD. LVD was not significantly associated with convuls in feile children. Screening feile children with undifferent fever in endemic areas for LVD could be important for medical and public health control. The causes of convuls with fever are dependent on age, climate, and clinical presentation, with viral and bacterial infections being main causes. Few reports are available on LVD contribution to convuls in children, and its true prevalence has not been determined. Undiagnosed LVD may contribute to poor outcome of feile convulsions in endemic areas. Localizing signs of infection were present in 5% and Lassa fever was initial diagnosis in 2.9%. The association between LVD and initial diagnosis was significant. Non-localizing symptoms and signs were associated with LVD prevalence.
Drought causes substantial reductions in crop yields worldwide, prompting research into new chemical and genetic factors regulating drought resistance in Arabidopsis thaliana. Karrikins, butenolide compounds found in smoke, promote seed germination and improve seedling vigor under stressful conditions. Mutations in KARRINSENSITIVE2, the proposed karri receptor, result in hypersensitivity to water deprivation. Transcriptomic, physiological, and biochemical analyses of kai2 plants reveal increased water loss, drought-induced membrane damage, enlarged stomatal apertures, higher cuticular permeability, reduced anthocyan biosynthesis, and hyposensitivity to abscic acid in stomatal closure and cotyled opening. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis identified genes associated with these changes, indicating crosstalk between ABA and K2-dependent pathways regulating plant responses to drought. Comparison with strigolone mutant d14 suggests strigones contribute to drought adaptation without affecting cuticle development. Findings indicate chemical or genetic manipulation of K2 and d14 signaling may improve drought resistance. K2 signaling regulates drought through cell stability, stomatal movement, cuticle, and anthocyan production. Binding of kar activates K2, regulating genes involved in cuticle, stomatal closure, anthocyan biosynthesis, and membrane integrity, contributing to drought adaptation. The study demonstrates K2's role in Arabidopsis survival after water deficit, identifying physiological and molecular explanations, highlighting the importance of K2-dependent signaling in drought resistance. Both K2 and d14 pathways promote adaptation to water deficit, implicating K2-dependent signaling as a positive regulator of plant response to drought.
Researchers investigated the importance of insulin signaling in the growth, development, and egg production of adult Schistosoma japonicum by focusing on insulin receptors Sj1 and Sj2. Human insulin was found to bind to the L1 domain of recombinant Sj1 and Sj produced in the Drosophila S2 expression system. RNA interference was used to knock down Sj expression in adult S. japonicum in vitro, resulting in reduced transcription of downstream genes associated with glucose metabolism and fecundity. Glucose uptake decreased in Sj-knockdown worms compared to controls. Vaccine challenge experiments showed rS1 and rS2 depressed female growth, granuloma density, and faecal egg production in S. japonicum in mice. The results emphasize the potential of Sj as veterinary blocking vaccine candidates against zoonotic schistosomiasis japonica. Binding assays, RNAi, and vaccine experiments support adult schistosomes having an insulin signaling system activated by host insulin binding to parasite receptors, regulating transcription of genes involved in glucose metabolism. Knockdown of Sj1 and S2 decreased glucose levels, suggesting effective blocking of signal transduction in the insulin pathway, supporting previous findings that PIK is required for insulin-stimulated glucose transport in schistosomes.
Lymphatic filariasis is a leading cause of disability in the Pacific regions where over 1.7 million people are at risk of infection. Mass drug administration has reduced prevalence but mosquito biology complicates the elimination strategy. Researchers have found that interspecific hybridization and introgression results in an Aedes polynesi strain infected with Wolbachia bacteria, making it bi-directionally incompatible with naturally infected mosquitoes, resulting in female sterility. Laboratory assays show males are equally competitive, leading to population elimination when introduced into wild A. polynensis populations. This strategy could supplement ongoing mass drug administration efforts to eliminate lymphatic filariasis. Existing vector control methods have been ineffective against A. polynensis, which provides a logical target due to its geographic range and ability to vector filariasis in low microfilaraemics. Inundative releases of bi-direction incompatible males induce sterility in A. polynensis females, resulting in population elimination. Geography of the Pacific is ideal for the proposed strategy. Successful demonstration of bi-direction incompatible males will encourage extension to a broader range and additional vector species, using the ability to generate novel Wolbach infections in medically important mosquitoes.
Human African trypanosomiasis is a severely neglected vector-borne disease that is fatal if untreated, with significant socio-economic and public health importance in affected communities in Tanzania. A study in Uram District estimated the public burden of rhodesiense HAT in terms of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and financial costs using hospital records from 143 patients. The estimated DALYs without age-weighting were 215.7 and 281.6, increasing to 622.5 and 978.9 when accounting for 45% underreporting. Direct medical costs were $15,514, with patients paying $3,673 and health services $11,841. Indirect costs for patients were $9,781. The study shows HAT imposes a considerable burden on rural communities, stressing the need for location-specific estimates. Previous studies in Tanzania estimated the country loses 10 million years of life annually through illness, with families incurring substantial costs for treatment. Underreporting is significant, with 7 cases unreported for every 10 reported, resulting in undetected deaths. The HIV/AIDS pandemic may contribute to increased HAT burden, with patients developing long-term complications. Household income is associated with disease burden, with rural populations suffering due to insufficient resources for basic needs.
Researchers investigated the role of cytoplasmic peptide:N-glycanase (Ng1) in mammals, a de-N-glycosylating enzyme highly conserved among eukaryotes, by analyzing Ng1-deficient mice. The mice were found to be embryonic lethal in the C57/BL6 background. However, additional deletion of the endo-β-acetylglucosaminase (Eng) gene, another de-glycosylating enzyme, partially rescued the lethality of Ng1-deficient mice. Changing the genetic background to C57/6 and ICR mixed also partially rescued embryonic lethality. Viable Ng1-deficient mice showed severe phenotypes reminiscent of NGL1-deficiency symptoms, which were suppressed by Eng deletion in C57/6 and ICR background. Ng1/Eng-deficient mice closely resembled symptoms of NGL1-deficiency patients. The study suggests Ng1 or Ng1/Eng-deficient mice serve as valuable models for NGL1-deficiency pathogenesis and cytoplasmic Eng represents a potential therapeutic target. The embryonic lethal phenotype of Ng1 mice is mainly related to deglycosylation function, given lethality was suppressed by Eng deletion. The results are consistent with NGL1-deficient human subjects bearing NGL1 mutations. Glycoproteomics analysis identified N-glycoproteins accumulating in Ng1/Eng cells, which may be linked to NGL1-deficiency pathogenesis. Recognizable phenotypes were observed in Ng1/Eng mice and Ng mice in C57/6 and ICR background, similar to N1-deficiency symptoms in humans. The study clarifies the biological function of deglycosylating enzymes Ng1 and Eng in mice.
Researchers investigated the role of gene expression noise in spatial patterning during Drosophila segmentation, focusing on the hunchback (hb) gene, which is activated by the maternally-derived Bicoid (Bcd) protein gradient. They developed a stochastic model of the hb promoter, varying the number and strength of Bcd and Hb self-regulatory binding sites, and fit parameters to data from wild-type embryos, self-regulation mutants, and lacZ reporter constructs. The results showed that wild-type hb output noise is dependent on transcription and translation dynamics rather than Bcd fluctuations. Multiple Bcd binding sites in the promoter and their strengths also play a role in buffering noise. The model is robust to variation in Bcd binding site number across fly species. The study identified ways in which promoter structure and regulatory dynamics reduce hb noise, including multiple regulatory sites, cooperativity, and self-feedback. The findings contribute to understanding the reproducibility and determinacy of spatial patterning in early development. The model illustrates the reduction in noise from increasing binding site and strength, moderate cooperativity, and slow protein timescales, and the degree to which within-embryo noise generates between-embryo variability. The results indicate that hb noise amplitudes are determined by expression dynamics, producing probability distributions distinct from Bcd. The study characterizes the inherent noise in gene expression due to low DNA and mRNA copy numbers and identifies how noise is controlled in spatial patterns, providing a model for patterning events.
Researchers have developed a novel method to estimate the genome-wide strength of selection against Neanderthal ancestry in modern humans, finding that selection removed Neander alleles from the population after hybridization. East Asians had higher initial levels of Neander ancestry than Europeans, even after accounting for selection. The bulk of purifying selection against Neander ancestry is attributed to many weakly deleterious alleles that were neutral in Neandertals but became selected against in humans due to larger population size. These alleles imposed a genetic load on early human-Neander hybrids. The study suggests differences in population size play a crucial role in shaping introgression levels. Selection acted against autosomal Neander alleles in anatomically modern humans, with observed patterns consistent with genome-wide purifying selection against weakly deleterious alleles. The accumulation of these alleles in Neandals, due to small population size, had a profound effect on Neander introgression in human genomes. Effective size and nearly neutral dynamics may determine introgression levels across species and the genome. The findings enhance understanding of Neander-human hybridization, shedding light on the nature of Neander contribution to human genomes and the role of selection in shaping Neander ancestry.
The HIV promoter within the long terminal repeat orchestrates aspects of the viral life cycle, including gene expression and replication, and establishment of latency. Stochastic fluctuations in gene expression, amplified by the Tat feedback loop, contribute to the formation of productive or inactive states. The HIV-1 promoter contains cis-acting Sp1 and NF-κB elements that regulate expression via recruitment of activating and repressing complexes. Mutations in Sp1 and NF-κ elements reveal functional differences in viral regulation, with Sp1 sites stabilizing both active and inactive states and NF-κ sites exhibiting distinct properties. Sp1 site III plays a role in recruitment of p300 and RelA to the promoter. Analysis of clonal populations infected with viral variants shows mutations in Sp1 yield higher frequency of clonal bifurcation compared to the wild-type promoter. Each Sp and NF-κ site contributes to regulation of viral expression, with Sp sites modulating transcriptional noise and frequency of latency. The study demonstrates the power of quantitative phenotyping viral mutants for dissecting regulatory inputs into the promoter, revealing Sp1 influences control of stochastic expression by stabilizing active and inactive states. The results have implications for treatment of HIV latency.
A comprehensive assessment of nine orthology projects and two standard methods was conducted to evaluate their accuracy in identifying orthologs, with respect to both phylogeny and function. The projects, including COG, KOG, Inparanoid, OrthoCL, Ensembl Compara, Homologene, RoundUp, EggNO, and OMA, and standard methods bidirectional best-hit and reciprocal smallest distance, were compared using six tests. Results showed OMA and Homene performed best in phylogenetic and functional analysis where high specificity is required, while OrthMCL outperformed Ensembl Compara at lower specificity and higher coverage. EggG provided the largest coverage for coarse-grained functional categories. Standard bidirectional best-hit often outperformed projects with complex algorithms, and Ensembl Compara's tree reconstruction approach was sometimes outperformed by pairwise comparisons. The study provides guidance on which database best suits user needs, introduces new methodology to verify orthology, and sets standards for current and future approaches. Accurate ortholog prediction is crucial for applications from protein annotation to phylogen analysis. The results allow comparison of projects on an objective basis, considering both phylogen and functional definitions of orthology, and highlight trade-offs between specificity and sensitivity.
Researchers have developed a computational drug repurposing pipeline to identify new therapeutics for schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease caused by parasitic helminth infection. The current treatment, praziquant, is 40 years old and shows signs of resistance. The pipeline highlighted protein kinases as targets, essential for parasite biological processes. The kinomes of Schistoma japonicum, S. mansoni, and S. haematium were elucidated and compared to the human kinome, identifying potential targets and existing inhibitors unique to Schistoma species. Approved drugs bosutin, dasib, imib, and new inhibitors vandib, sar, tide, alv, and din were identified as potential schistomicidal agents, along with 22 targets including CHK1, CDC2, WEE, PAK, MEK. The primary and secondary targets of approved drugs in Schosoma were suggested for novel therapeutics development. The kinome of S. japonicum was built and kinomes of S. mans and S. haemat were updated for a complete analysis of kinases across species. Comparative analysis identified kinase targets and inhibitors effective across three Schosoma species. Phenotypic screening verified efficacy of inhibitors against human life stages of Schosoma, demonstrating the necessity of combining target-based approaches with phenic screening.
Transcription factors, crucial components of intracellular regulatory networks controlling gene expression, often exhibit structure formation upon binding to their targets. This study investigates the folding and binding of the phosphorylated KID domain of CREB to the KIX domain of coactivator CBP. Simulations using a topology-based Gō model predict a coupled folding and binding mechanism with partially bound intermediates. Analysis reveals the transition state resembles the unstructured state, indicating CREB becomes structured after committing to binding, characteristic of an induced-fit mechanism. Increasing structure in the unbound KID reduces the binding rate, suggesting a "fly-casting"-like process. Non-native interactions lead to non-specific complexes that enhance the binding rate without altering the mechanism. The study supports the idea that being unstructured confers an advantage in protein recognition. Results agree with a recent nuclear magnetic resonance study, aiding interpretation of binding kinetics. The phosphorylated KID is known to be unstructured when unbound, and simulations show folding into a two-helix structure occurs mostly after binding, with the transition state closely resembling the unfolded. The mechanism involves formation of transient complexes evolving to an intermediate and high-affinity complex, consistent with an induced-fit interpretation where the ligand changes conformation.
A systematic review of schistosomiasis prevalence and intensity in Latin America and the Caribbean countries was conducted from 194 to 2014. The study analyzed 132 articles with 1,242 prevalence and 199 infection data points, mostly from Brazil. High prevalence and intensity were found in Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname, and Saint Lucia. Antigua, Barbuda, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, and Puerto Rico may have interrupted transmission but require verification. Schistosomias burden remains a public health issue with over 200 million infected and 700 million at risk globally. The World Health Assembly aims for elimination with less than 5% prevalence and 1% intensity of severe infection. The review focused on children to identify recent transmission, potentially underestimating chronic infection in adults. Heterogeneity in methodologies hinders cross-national comparisons. Standardized monitoring and evaluation are recommended to address public health interventions and verify elimination of Schistoma mansoni transmission. Improved epidemiological data by age and sex are required to meet regional goals.
Researchers investigated the characteristics of HIV-1 transmission by sequencing 167 near-full length genomes and generating 40 infectious clones from six linked heterosexual transmission pairs. The study found that consensus-like genomes sensitive to antibodies were selected during transmission, but transmitted variants did not demonstrate increased viral fitness or replicative capacity in peripheral blood cells. Resistance to interferon-α was also not significantly different between transmitted and non-transmitted variants. The findings suggest that neither viral replicative capacity nor interferon resistance determines transmission potential in chronically infected individuals. Instead, within-host evolution of HIV-1 in response to immune responses reduces transmission potential. The study used single genome amplification and cloning to assess genetic selection during transmission, evaluating particle infectivity, neutralizing resistance, and replicative capacity. The results indicate that heterosexual transmission is permissive to viruses with varying interferon resistance profiles, and factors other than interferon resistance determine fitness. The study provides genetic and phenotypic comparisons of full-length transmitted and non-transmitted variants, offering insight into HIV-1 transmission requirements and potential targets for intervention. Transmitted variants did not exhibit higher interferon resistance than non-transmitted viruses, contradicting previous suggestions of selection for interferon-resistant variants during transmission.
Filarial parasites induce lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic remodeling, contributing to the pathogenesis of lymphatic filariasis. Studies using human lymphatic endothelial cells exposed to filarial antigens, live parasites, or infected serum show significant cell proliferation and differentiation into tube-like structures. Serum from microfilar-positive patients and those with chronic lymphatic obstruction induce increased cell proliferation compared to uninfected individuals. Differentiation is associated with increased matrix metalloproteases and inhibition of tissue inhibitors. Filarial parasites alter gene expression involved in cellular organization, development, and adherence pathways, decreasing trans-endothelial transport. The parasites stimulate lymph endothelial cells to proliferate and differentiate, involving matrix metalloproteases and tissue inhibitors. In vitro studies demonstrate lymphangiogenesis, a process specific to lymphatic endothelial cells, related to excretory-secretory components and circulating lymphogenic factors. New vessels form with extracellular matrix, not prototypical markers of tumor lymphangiogenesis. Microfilar antigen and live microfilar induce lymphatic-like structures, while plasma from patients with lymphatic filariasis promotes cell proliferation. The findings provide insight into the pathology of lymphatic filariasis, suggesting fial parasites directly influence lymphatic development and function, contributing to disease progression.
Researchers have developed a microfluidic device to isolate individual Escherichia coli and amplify genomic DNA by Multiple Displacement Amplification in 60-nl reactions, eliminating the need for culturing methods. The results show reduced reaction volume lowers nonspecific synthesis from contaminant templates and unfavorable primer interactions. The quality of genome amplification was assessed by qPCR and compared favorably to single-cell amplifications in standard 50-μ volumes. Amplification bias was greatly reduced in nanol volumes, providing a more even representation of all sequences. Single-cell amplicons from microl and nanol volumes provided high-quality data by high-throughput pyrosequencing, demonstrating a route to sequencing single-cell genomes. Recovery of whole sequences from single cells facilitates microbial ecology and evolution studies as most microorganisms cannot be cultured. The Multiple Displacement Amplification method enables genome amplification from single cells isolated by FACS cytometry or serial dilution. Micromanipulation and fluorescent in situ hybridization allow specific microbes to be selected, increasing confidence in single-cell presence in MDA reactions. Large-scale pyrosequencing on single-cell amplic showed improved specificity with over 99% contigs mapping to the reference genome. The qPCR assays had loci representations of 80% for 60-n microfluidic MDA and 88 for 50-μl control reactions.
Researchers investigated the relationship between hantavirus host populations and human disease in the Atlantic Forest, where Sigmodinae rodents are the primary hosts for hantavirus transmission. Using 283 rodent capture records and geographically weighted models, they found that hantavirus host proportions were more influenced by landscape diversity than habitat or agricultural type. Local mammal diversity positively influenced pathogenic hant host proportions, indicating habitat quality may be more important than competition with native species. Sugarcane and tree plantations had a positive effect on rodent host proportions, while deforestation did not correlate with pathogenic hantavirus genotypes, suggesting non-deforested areas can be hotspots for outbreaks. The spatial match between host hotspots and human vulnerability was 17%, while coldspots matched 20%. The study found strong land use influences on hant hosts at the landscape level, suggesting disease surveillance should be reinforced in southern and southeastern regions where hant host proportions and vulnerability match. The results indicate complex rodent dynamics and interactions with human disease, with landscape diversity positively influencing hant host proportions, particularly in areas with agricultural and native habitats. Local species richness can dilute hant host proportions in southern communities, while deforestation has varying influence on hant hosts but not pathogenic viruses.
Infection with flaviviruses requires BCL for cell survival. BCL family proteins, including pro-survival proteins, BH3-only proteins, and BAX/BAK, control mitochondria-mediated apoptosis to maintain homeostasis via removal of damaged and pathogen-infected cells. The study examined roles of BCL proteins in induction of apoptosis in cells upon infection with flaviviruses, such as Japanese encephalitis, Dengue, and Zika viruses. Results showed that survival of infected cells depends on BCL, a pro-survival BCL protein, due to suppression of expression of pro-survival protein MCL. Treatment with BCL inhibitors and deficient BXL expression induced BAX/BA-dependent apoptosis upon infection with flaviruses. Flivirus attenuates cellular synthesis, reducing short-life proteins like MCL. Inhibition of BXL increased phagocytosis of virus-infected cells by macrophages, suppressing dissemination and chemokine production. BXL plays a crucial role in survival of infected cells with flaviruses and may provide a novel antiviral target to suppress propagation of Flavidae viruses. Infection with flaviruses reduces M1 expression but remaining BXL delays apoptosis in infected cells, crucial for viral dissemination and pathogenicity. Impairment of BXL accelerates apoptosis and dissemination is reduced by removal of infected cells through phagocytosis, leading to low pathogenicity in vivo. BXL is critical for cell survival during flavirus infection and inhibition restricts infectious particles in vitro and vivo.
A study estimated the economic burden of canine rabies in Viet Nam from 2005-2014, incorporating direct and indirect costs of post-exposure prophylaxis, dog vaccination, livestock losses, and disability-adjusted life years. The total economic impact was over $719 million, with 92% attributed to post-exposure prophylaxis costs. Canine rabies resulted in 36,560-45,700 disability-adjusted life years and 914 human deaths, with a rate of 0.11 per 100,000 people. The cost per vaccinated dog was $1.75. The findings indicate that rabies impacts in Viet Nam are consistent with Asia, with large expenditures on post-exposure prophylaxis and small investments in dog vaccination. Average annual post-exposure prophylaxis administered was over 400,000 and human cases reported were around 100. Livestock losses were an insignificant portion of total costs but may impact individual producers regionally. Comparing disease burden and control measures reveals Viet Nam is consistent with other rabies-endemic countries in Asia, spending more on post-exposure prophylaxis than prevention through dog vaccination, with 92% of costs attributed to post-exposure prophylaxis and 6% to vaccination. The study suggests coordinated veterinary public health campaigns preventing rabies is more effective than suppressing through post-exposure prophylaxis administration.
The Type II Secretion System is a molecular machine that drives the secretion of fully-folded protein substrates across bacterial outer membranes, with a key element being the secretin, an integral multimer outer membrane protein forming the secretion pore. Three forms of Type II Secretion Systems can be distinguished based on sequence characteristics of their secretin pores, with Klebsella-type and Vibrio-type distinguished by the pilotin mediating transport and assembly into the outer membrane. The crystal structure of novel pilotin AspS from Vibrio cholera shows convergent evolution, functionally equivalent yet structurally unrelated to pilotins in Kleiella and other bacteria. AspS binds a specific sequence in Vibrio secretins, enhancing assembly kinetics, with homologs found in all Vibrio species and some Escheria and Shella strains with Vibrio-type TSS. Vibrio-type secretins, Asp-type pilotins, and AcDsl substrates are correlated in diverse bacteria, suggesting acquisition of a complete unit of secretin-pilot-substrate with the rest of the TSS operon. The structure of AspS has no similarity to PulS family proteins, binding an S-domain in Vibrio secretins, distinguishing Klei-type and Vibrio secretins. Genomes encoding Vibrio-type secretin also encode Asp, while Klei-type encode PulS family, with phylogeny of Vibrio secretins reflected in Asp sequences.
Pathogenic Leptospira spp. shed in the urine of reservoir hosts can be transmitted to susceptible hosts through skin abrasions or mucous membranes, causing leptospirosis. The infection involves the ability of leptospires to adhere to cell and extracellular components, crucial for dissemination and colonization of host tissues. Researchers investigated the functional roles of transmembrane outer proteins Omp36, Omp37, and Omp47 on the leptiral surface, determining their capacity to bind host components by enzyme-linked immunosorb assay. Omp37 binds preferentially to elastin, exhibiting dose-dependent, saturating binding to human and aortic elastin, as well as fibrinogen, fibrin fragment, plasma fibronectin, and murine laminin. The binding of Omp37 to human elastin is enhanced by antiserum, suggesting involvement in leptiral binding and possibility of host-generated antibodies promoting adherence. Omp37 is recognized by acute and convalescent patient sera and Leptira-infected hamster sera and detected in pathogenic Leptira serovars, not saprophytic Leptira. Omp37 is a novel elastin-binding protein of pathogenic Leptira, potentially promoting attachment of Leptira to host tissues. The strong affinity of Omp37 for human elastin may facilitate attachment during the initial stage of infection. The identification of Omp37 is essential for understanding leptiral pathogenesis and development of diagnostic and protective antigens for leptpirosis.
Researchers have developed a model to calculate the probability of polyreactive antibodies 4E10 and 2F5 disabling the gp41 trimer after cell-HIV adhesion. The model predicts that for these antibodies to be effective in neutralization, the time to disable an epitope must be shorter than the time the epitope remains in the long-lived conformation induced by antibody binding, approximately five minutes or less for 4E10 and 2F. The binding of 4E10 and 2F to the membrane proximal external region of gp41 induces a conformational change resulting in a stably bound complex. Analysis of neutralization experiments indicates only a small number of gp41 must be disabled to prevent fusion, but the exact number cannot be determined from neutralization alone. Avidity plays a role in neutralization with 2F IgG being more effective than its Fab, attributed to 2F interacting more stably with the viral membrane than 4E. The model elucidates parameters determining the ability of these antibodies to disable epitopes and proposes an extension to analyze neutralization data, predicting dependencies on rate constants characterizing antibody binding, gp41 fusion, and number of gp41 bridging the virus and cell.
A longitudinal study in Mali and Senegal assessed the effectiveness of 15-17 years of annual or semi-annual ivermectin treatment in eliminating onchocerciasis in three hyperendemic foci. Skin surveys and blackfly analyses were conducted in 131 villages, examining 29,753 people and 492,600 blackflies for Onchocerca volvulus larvae. Infection and transmission levels declined after treatment, with two sites showing zero microfilaria and vector infectivity rates 3-4 years post-treatment. The third site, with initially high infection levels, showed significant decline to low levels 3-5 years post-treatment. All indicators were below elimination thresholds. The study established that onchercias elimination with ivermectin is feasible in some African foci. The main indicators used were microfilariae prevalence in skin and vector infectivity measured by number of flies with O. volulus L3 larvae per 1,000. The results support evolution from onchiasis control to elimination in Africa. Annual ivermectin treatment has controlled onchiasis as a public health problem in most areas, with nearly all endemic areas under treatment. The study's methodology, including epidemiological and entomological evaluations for 3 years post-treatment, is recommended for areas reaching elimination thresholds.
Human rhinovirus, a non-enveloped virus of the picornavirus family, delivers its genome across cell membranes without the advantage of fusion, and the mechanisms used to achieve this remain poorly understood. The small myristated capsid protein VP4 is released from the virus, interacts with the cell membrane, and is implicated in the delivery of the viral RNA into cytoplasm to initiate replication. Recombinant C-terminal histidine-tagged human rhinovirus VP4 induces membrane permeability in liposome membranes, forming a multimeric pore with dimensions consistent with the transfer of single-stranded RNA. The permeability induced by recombinant VP4 is influenced by pH and comparable to permeability induced by infectious virions. Native VP4 is myristated at its N-terminus, a feature of proteins with membrane properties. Mutations in VP4 alter the ability of the virus to induce permeability and deliver the genome into the cell. This provides a molecular mechanism for VP4-mediated membrane permeability during picornavirus entry, suggesting VP as an antiviral target. The similarities between VP4 and virus-induced permeability indicate VP is responsible for membrane permeability, but the virus-derived pore may be larger, involving additional capsid components. The findings present a model for exploration of VP4 as a novel antiviral target for the picornavirus family.
Francisella tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium that causes tularemia and is designated a class A agent by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Researchers identified three enzymes required for lipid A carbohydrate modifications in Francisella novicida, specifically mannose, galactamine, or both. Mutants lacking galactamine or galactamine/mannose were attenuated in mice and provided protection against challenge with wild-type Francisella when administered via aerosol or subcutaneous routes. The flK mutant induced higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and macroage inhibitory protein-2 in alveolar macrophage cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages from Toll-like receptor 4 knockout mice. Production of interleukin-6 and macroage inhibitory protein-2 was undetectable in MyD88 knockout mice, which were susceptible to the flK mutant. The ability of the flK mutant to activate pro-inflammatory cytokine production and innate responses via the My88 pathway may be responsible for attenuation and induction of protective immunity. Lipid A of Francisella has a unique structure with tetra-acyl chains and can be modified by addition of galosamine, which plays a role in bacterial virulence and immunity. Inactivation of the flK gene in other subspecies may result in attenuation and activation of adaptive immunity. The results suggest that carbohydrate modifications of lipid A may aid in the development of an effective Francisella vaccine.
The (p)ppGpp-binding GTPase Era promotes rRNA processing and cold adaptation in Staphylococcus aureus. Era, a ribosome-associated GTPase, is highly conserved throughout the bacterial kingdom and essential in many species, although its function in ribosome assembly is unclear. In Staphlococcus aureus, Era is not essential but important for 30S ribosomal subunit assembly, interacting with 16S rRNA endonuclease Ybe and DEAD-box RNA helicase Csh. Both Era and Csh are required for growth at suboptimal temperatures and rRNA processing. Era and Csh form interactions with (p)ppGpp synthase RelSau, with Rel impacting Gase activity of Era and helicase activity of Csh. In its GTP-bound form, Era acts as a hub on the ribosome directing enzymes involved in rRNA processing and ribosome subunit assembly. The stringent response impedes this activity, contributing to slowed growth. Mutant cells are defective in 30 subunit maturation and Era and Csh are crucial for rRNA homeostasis and growth at low temperatures. Era and Csh interactions with RelSau control cellular RNA processing in a stringent-dependent manner. Era acts as a guide for rRNA/ribosome maturation enzymes to substrates, with interactions fitting a role in promoting association of processing or degradation enzymes like Ybe and Csh.
Anthrax lethal toxin (LT) induces vascular insufficiency in experimental animals through unknown mechanisms. Research shows that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nOS) deficiency in mice causes increased sensitivity to LT, while deficiencies in other NOS enzymes have no effect on LT-mediated mortality. The increased sensitivity of nOS−/− mice is independent of macrophage sensitivity to toxin or cytokine responses and can be replicated in nOS-sufficient wild-type mice through pharmacological inhibition. Histological analyses reveal LT-induced changes in heart morphology of nOS/− mice with rapid appearance of inter-fiber spaces but no apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Electron microscopic analyses show pathological changes in hearts of both nOS/− and wild-type mice, including endothelial/capillary necrosis, inter-myocyte edema, and myofilament degeneration. Biomarkers of cardiac injury are elevated in LT-treated mice, and echocardiography indicates a reduction in ejection fraction, suggesting decreased contractile function. The heart is identified as an early target of LT, and nOS plays a protective role against LT-mediated cardiac damage. Cardiac protective therapy and allopurinol have no beneficial effects, but nitric oxide scavenger carbox-PT shows some protective effect. The study suggests a protective role for nOS in LT-mediated pathogenesis and highlights the heart as a primary target of LT in mice.
Researchers have developed a method for introducing CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene disruptions in the human-parasitic threadworm Strongyloides stercoris, enabling targeted mutagenesis in parasitic nematodes for the first time. The S. stercis twitchin gene unc-22 was disrupted, resulting in nematodes with severe motility defects, and S-unc-22 mutations were resolved by homology-directed repair when a repair template was provided. Omission of a repair resulted in deletions at the target locus, and S-unc-22 mutations were heritable, passing through a host and recovering mutant progeny. A similar approach was used to disrupt the unc-22 gene of rat-parasitic nemode Strongloides ratti, demonstrating the applicability of CRISPR-C9 to parasitic nemodes. The study exploited the complex life cycle of S. stercis to deliver CRISPR-Cas constructs targeting S-unc-22 into free-living adults and characterized S-unc-22 mutations in L3 progeny. CRIS-C9-induced double-strand breaks at S-unc-22 are resolved by homology-directed repair when an appropriate template is provided. This breakthrough enables future studies of gene function in medically relevant but previously genetically intractable parasites, as parasitic nematodes infect over 1 billion people worldwide and cause common tropical diseases. The CRIS-C9 target for S-unc-22 site2 and Sr-unc-22 site2 differ by only four base pairs, and CR-Cas9 targeting was found to be species-specific by injecting plasm vectors encoding Cas9 and sgRNA for S stercis and ratti, two laboratory models for skin-penetrating parasitic nemode infections.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to describe the effects of ribosome drop-off on translation, a phenomenon where ribosomes prematurely terminate translation due to stress conditions such as amino acid starvation or amino-tRNA depletion. The model shows that ribosome drop leads to non-intuitive ribosome density profiles and affects translation rates in an mRNA-specific manner. mRNAs with ribosome queues are less affected by ribosome drop than those without, and among those without queues, faster elongation rates correlate with resilience to drop-off. Genome analysis of S. cerevisiae reveals mRNAs coding for translation machinery are resilient to rib drop-off under favourable conditions, while stress-related proteins are less resilient under physiological conditions. The model predicts translation rates of mAs sustaining ribosome queues are less affected by drop-off, and higher translation rates render mAs more resilient to drop-off. The study highlights the importance of accounting for ribosome drop in interpreting ribosome profiling data and estimating translation rates. The effects of ribosome drop are mRNA-specific, with codon composition and configuration affecting translation loss, and resilience to drop may change under stress due to redistribution of translational resources, potentially playing a role in gene regulation.
The World Health Organization's strategy to address soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections in children is based on morbidity control through deworming of school and pre-school aged children, but transmission continues due to persist in untreated individuals and environmental reservoirs. Alternative strategies using mass drug administration (MDA) are being considered to accelerate interruption of transmission. The DeWorm trial tests the feasibility of interrupting STH transmission with three years of high coverage followed by two years of surveillance. A stochastic individual-based model simulates the DeWorm trial comparing control and intervention arms for Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm, evaluating threshold prevalences and MDA coverage to assess likelihood of bounce-back or elimination. Results suggest clusters should be assessed for transmission after two years unless interruption can be ruled out through evidence of low coverage. Models indicate a range of homogenous estimates following high MDA do not allow for discrimination between bounce or interruption within 24 months. Determining a breakpoint early in the trial can reduce monitoring efforts in settings where interruption is unlikely and avoid bounce to pre-treatment levels. Statistical confidence in predicting interruption is greatest when sampling is done 18-24 months post-treatment. Mathematical models illustrate interruption is possible with MDA if high coverage and compliance are achieved across age groups, but likelihood varies due to stochastic processes including transmission potential and contact with contaminated soil.
Researchers evaluated a conjugate vaccine for cholera made from Vibrio cholerae O1 Ogawa-specific polysaccharide and recombinant tetanus toxoid heavy chain in mice. The vaccine, OSP:Tc, was administered intramuscularly on days 0, 21, and 42 with or without dmLT, a non-toxigen immunoadjuvant. Significant serum IgG antibody responses targeting OSP were detected following a single immunization in mice receiving OSP:Tc with or without adjuvant. Anti-PS IgG responses were detected following a second immunization in these cohorts. No anti-OSP or anti-PS IgG responses were detected in animals receiving unconjugated OSP or immunjuvant alone. Administration of OSP:Tc and adjuvant induced memory cell responses targeting OSP and resulted in 95% protective efficacy in a mouse lethality cholera challenge. Serum anti-OSP IgM responses were detected in mice receiving OSP:Tc with or without adjuvant and unconjug OSP. Serum-LPS and vibriocidal responses were detected in all cohorts except mice receiving adjuvant alone. No IgA anti-OSP or anti-PS developed in any group. The cholera conjugate vaccine is protectively immunogenic in mice, inducing long-term immunity, especially in young children who respond poorly to polysacchar antigens. Previous infection with Vcholera O1 provides no protection against O139 and vice versa due to serogroup specificity determined by O-specific polysacchar of lipopolysacchar. The study demonstrates a cholera conjugate vaccine containing native OSP from Vcholera is immunogenic and induces anti-OSP B cell responses, a potential mediator of protective immunity against cholera.
Researchers investigated the interaction between the fungus Candida albicans and the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a neutropenic mouse model of gastrointestinal colonization and dissemination. They found that Candida albicans inhibits Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence by suppressing the expression of pyochelin and pyoverine genes, which play a critical role in iron acquisition and virulence. Deletion of these genes attenuates Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence, while heat-killed Candida has no effect. Candida-secreted proteins directly suppress pyochelin and pyoverine expression and inhibit Pseudomonas aerugin virulence in mice. Suppression of pyelin and pyoverine has no effect on Pseudomonas colonization but decreases cytotoxic effects on colonocytes. Oral iron supplementation restores Pseudomonas virulence in co-colonized mice. Candida-secreted proteins inhibit Pseudomonas-mediated cytotoxic effects and reduce virulence, and oral administration protects mice from Pseudas infection. Supplementation with iron restores Pseud virulence by inducing pyochelin-independent cytotoxic molecules, increasing gut permeability, and damaging mucosal barriers. Candida represses Pseud pyelin and pyd biosynthesis without affecting gut iron levels. Deletion of pyelin and pyd attenuates Pseud virulence, and Candid-secreted proteins inhibit Pseud cytotoxic effects in vitro. Overall, findings provide insight into bacterial-fungal interactions modulating bacterial virulence in the intestine.
The complexity of the inoculum determines the rate of reversion of SIV Gag CD8 T cell mutant virus and outcome of infection. Mutant virus that evades CD8 T cell recognition often emerges during HIV-1 or SIV infection, but is less replicatively fit than wild-type virus. Reversion to wild-type virus occurs upon transmission to a naive host and is associated with lower viral loads. Researchers quantified reversion of SIV and SHIV viruses in pigtail macaques using a sensitive PCR assay, finding that infection with mixes of mutant and wild-type virus containing ≥10% wild-type results in rapid outgrowth of wild-type virus within 7 days. In contrast, infection with biologically passaged SHIV with smaller proportions of wild-type or a molecular clone of pure mutant SIV demonstrated delayed reversion, taking ≥8 weeks to become dominant. Delayed reversion is associated with lower viral loads. Diversity of the infecting inoculum determines timing of reversion, predicting infection outcome. Delayed reversion of fitness-reducing CD8 cell escape mutations may reduce pathogenicity during early infection. Studies show reversion from mutant to wild-type in HIV-infected humans and SIV-infected macaques following transmission to naive hosts lacking MHC alleles to recognize the epitope. Lower viral loads are associated with lack of reversion at key Gag CD8 cell epitopes.
Researchers studied yeast strains from Evolution Canyon in Israel and found they exhibit high tolerance to the heavy metal cadmium due to an enhanced function of a metal efflux pump called PCA1. Molecular analyses showed this enhancement is largely attributed to mutations in the promoter sequence, while coding region mutations have a minor effect. Reconstruction experiments revealed three nucleotide substitutions in the PCA1 promoter quantitatively increase its activity, enhancing cadmium resistance. Comparison among yeast species showed critical nucleotides in Evolution Canyon strains are conserved and functionally important for cadmium resistance in other species, suggesting they represent an ancestral type. However, these nucleotides diverged in Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, giving cells advantages under conditions where cadmium is low or absent. Results indicate a selective sweep in yeast driven by a tradeoff in metal resistance. The cadmium-resistant phenotype is primarily caused by regulatory changes in the PCA1 gene, encoding a P-type ATPase required for cadmium efflux. Functional and phylogenetic analyses showed PCA1 experienced rounds of selective adaptation during yeast evolution, with a weak PCA allele spreading to most S. cerevisiae populations due to a tradeoff between metal resistance and fitness under low cadmium conditions. The reduced resistance in S. cereiae is a result of regulatory fine-tuning allowing cells to maintain a level of cadmium efflux without compromising fitness under normal conditions, explaining why the weak allele spread efficiently to different populations.
Researchers identified major oncogenic pathways in gastric cancer with significant relationships to patient survival by devising an in silico strategy to map patterns of oncogenic activation in 301 primary gastric cancers. Three oncogenic pathways, proliferation/stem cell, NF-κB, and Wnt/β-catenin, were found to be deregulated in the majority of gastric cancers. Patient stratification by oncogenic combinations showed reproducible and significant survival differences in multiple cohorts, suggesting pathway interactions play a role in disease behavior. Individual gastric cancers can be taxonomized by oncogenic activity into biologically and clinically relevant subgroups. Predicting pathway activity by expression permits the study of multiple cancer-related pathways simultaneously in primary cancers. Eleven oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways previously implicated in gastric carcinogenesis were evaluated, including RAS, p53, BR1, p21, Wnt/β-caten, E2F, SRC, MYC, NFκB, histone deacetylation, and stem-cell signatures. A four-step strategy was used to predict levels of oncogenic activation, involving defining pathway signatures, mapping onto gene profiles, and validating predictions. Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of global mortality, with most patients diagnosed at advanced stage, and deregulation of canonical pathways such as EF, K-RAS, p53 and Wnt/β-caten occurring at varying frequencies, indicating molecular heterogeneity.
Stress-induced DNA destabilization analysis of the Escherichia coli K12 genome reveals that strongly destabilized sites occur preferentially in intergenic regions containing promoters, rarely in coding regions. Investigation of genes grouped by functional categories shows strong SIDD sites are statistically overrepresented in upstream regions of transcriptional regulators, particularly those responding to physiological and environmental stimuli. Pathways controlled by transcription regulators with destabilized 5' flanks often have genes with destabilized SIDD sites. This association is observed in 38 of 43 free-living bacteria, but only 4 of 18 endosymbion or parasitic bacteria. Upstream regions of genes functioning in transcription have significant association with strongest SIDD in free-living bacteria. Genes responding to environmental stimuli are more likely to have destabilized 5' flanks. Strong SIDD sites are associated with transcription activators, repressors, and two-component systems regulating gene expression. Statistically enrichment of SIDD within functionally related genes is documented. Superhelical duplex destabilization may play roles in regulating expression of transcriptional control genes adapting to environmental conditions. SIDD may mediate adaptive transcriptional response through superhelically modulated destabilization.
High-mobility group (HMG) proteins are eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins characterized by the HMG-box motif and play a pivotal role in global genomic functions and control of specific developmental or metabolic pathways. The filamentous ascomycete Podos anserina contains 12 HMG-box genes, with four previously characterized, including three mating-type genes controlling fertilization and fruit-body development and one involved in mitochondrial stability. Systematic deletion analysis of the remaining uncharacterized HMG genes showed none were essential for viability but seven were involved in the sexual cycle. Two HMG genes, PaH5 and PaH9, display striking features with PaH5 being a pivotal activator of mating-type genes and PaH9 a repressor of stationary phase phenomena. Transcriptional analysis indicated PaH5 is the hub of a network regulating mating-type and mating target genes. Genetic analysis revealed this network controls fertility genes not regulated by mating-type transcription factors. This study highlights the critical role of HMG in reproduction, with 11 of 12 members involved in the sexual cycle. PaMG5 and Sp11 are conserved transcription regulators of mating genes despite divergence 550 million years ago. The P anina and S pombe mating genes form a module analogous to the SRY/SOX module in mammals, revealing commonality in sex regulation between animals and fungi. Deletions of HMG genes affected distribution, fertility, and fruit-body development with ΔPah5 exhibiting both male and female sterility, a rare phenotype in Podospora anserina.
The 2013-2016 African Ebola epidemic highlighted the need to determine the persistence of Ebola virus in survivors' body fluids and potential transmission risks, including sexual transmission. An observational study was implemented in Sierra Leone to investigate the presence of Ebola virus in body fluids of survivors. The study was conducted in two phases, first assessing Ebola virus in semen of 100 men and then in multiple body fluids of 120 men and 120 women. Challenges included unforeseen duration of follow-up, interpreting laboratory results, and translating findings into public health practice. Strong community engagement facilitated rapid implementation. Data informed national and global guidelines, demonstrating the need for semen testing among Ebola survivors. The study commenced within five months of initial discussions and published baseline results within 10 months. Participants provided body specimens at baseline and follow-up visits every two weeks until fluids tested negative for Ebola RNA on consecutive visits. Initial discharge certificates stated 'fragments of Ebola not detected' for analyzed fluids. The study accelerated implementation of programs in Ebola-affected countries and informed studies on Zika virus persistence. Research was vital in responding to the epidemic, emphasizing the need for rapid resources to answer critical questions and inform response efforts.
Researchers used dose-response curves from fluorescence energy transfer experiments to predict the chemical gradients Escherichia coli encounter in their environment. They evaluated Weber's law and its generalizations to predict average gradients and used information theory and simulations to obtain distributions, considering cell-external and internal noise limitations. The results showed broad exponential distributions leading to log-normal stimuli and maximal velocity. The chemotaxis system enables bacteria to detect and migrate in chemical gradients of nutrients and toxins and is relatively simple with few components. The study connected phenomenological laws with information theory at the molecular level, finding a link between transmission and drift. The findings indicate chemotactic E coli encounters exponential gradients in its habitat, with its pathway evolved to maintain perception in these. The results provide a step towards deciphering complex cellular environments, such as the human intestine. The study used a multidisciplinary approach, showing maximizing mutual information implies maximizing alignment of cell trajectories with the gradient and velocity of swimming up the gradient. The chemotaxis system shares design principles with other sensory systems, including Weber's law and fold-change detection, and the study quantified the view of signaling to characterize the chemical environment in terms of distributions.
Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are functionally defined by their multipotency and self-renew capacity, and their lifespan is determined by their ability to give rise to mature blood cells. Research has shown that genetically identical HSCs differ in lifespan, which is predetermined and intrinsic. A new model based on reliability theory accounts for the diversity of lifespans of HSC, suggesting that repopulation failure kinetics of each HSC are anti-persistent or mean-reverting processes. Failure rates increase during population-wide events and are counteracted by repair processes, but in the long-run, a crossover to persistent behavior occurs due to a slow increase in the failure rate of self-renew, leading to clonal extinction. The lifespan of each HSC depends on the amplitudes and frequencies of fluctuations in the failure kinetics, with shorter and longer-lived HSC differing in pre-programmed ability to dissipate perturbations. The findings suggest that lifespan of Hs is determined by preprogram differences in repair capacity. The population dynamics predict that molecular machinery preserving self-renew will ultimately fail, and several hypotheses have been developed to explain how Hs limit lifespan, including the generation-age hypothesis. Reliability analysis of Hs has implications on aging in Hs and non-homogenous cell systems.
Approximately one-third of the world's population suffers from chronic helminth infections with no effective vaccines available. Antibodies and alternatively activated macrophages form crucial components of protective immunity against helmin infections. Researchers demonstrate helmin-specific antibodies induce rapid trapping of tissue migrating helmin larvae and prevent tissue necrosis following infection with the murine parasite Heligmosoides polygyrus bakeri. Mice lacking antibodies or activating Fc receptors harbored highly motile larvae, developed tissue damage, and accumulated less Arginase-1 expressing macroages. Antibodies induced Fc and complement-dependent adherence of macroages to larvae, resulting in complete larval immobilization. Antibodies reprogram macroages to express wound-healing genes, including Arg-1, impairing larval motility. Antibody-induced Arg-1 expression occurred independently of IL-4α signaling. A novel IL-4α-independent mechanism of alternative macroage activation is antibody-dependent, mediating anti-helmin immunity and preventing tissue disruption. Antibodies elicit a subtype of IL-4α independent activated macroages, referred to as helmin-antibody activated macroages. Antibodies activate macroages modulate expression of genes associated with the alternatively activated phenotype, trapping helmin larvae and preventing parasite-induced damage. Antibody-activated macroages upregulate Arg1 and immobilize infective larvae. Antibodies mediate macroage activation resulting Arg1 expression and immobilization of invasive helmin larvae, forming a previously unrecognized component of macroage regulation during type 2 responses.
DNA double-strand breaks pose a significant threat to genome integrity, and cells respond by initiating repair programs involving enzymatic restoration of DNA and chromatin remodeling. The most accurate repair method is homologous recombination, which requires an intact copy of the broken locus. Researchers have developed a non-intrusive method to visualize DNA dynamics during early steps of homologous recombination, using protein oligomerization to form visible foci. Applying this method to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, they analyzed resection in living cells, revealing transient confinement of damaged chromatin during early steps, consistent with the need to keep DNA ends in contact. Resection in yku mutant began 10 minutes earlier than in wild type, defining the period of commitment to homology-dependent repair. The new DNA-labeling and targeting method provides insights into resection dynamics and will be applicable to fine-scale analysis of genome organization, dynamics, and function in normal and pathological contexts. Limiting analysis to cells undergoing resection after a single endonuclease cut enabled realistic calculation of DNA end dynamics and time to commit to homologous recombination. The ParB-INT system allows direct measurements on single cells, avoiding interference, making it suitable for studying chromosome positioning and dynamics in gene expression, replication, and recombination.
Researchers used stochastic agent-based models to estimate the rate of reinfection with Trypanosoma cruzi in humans and assess the frequency of reinfections during acute and chronic stages of Chagas disease. The models were fitted to epidemiological data from Argentinean villages where mixed infections by different genotypes of T. cruzi reach 56% in humans. The best model predicted 0.032 annual reinfections per individual, with 98.4% occurring in the chronic phase. The parasite escapes the adaptive immune response after primary infection in at least 20% of re-infection events. Low annual reinfection rates result in 14% and 60% risks of reinfection after 5 and 30 years, with most individuals reinfected 1-3 times. These rates are better explained by the weak efficiency of stercarian transmission than a highly adaptive immune response. The study provides estimates of interest for vaccine development and understanding the risk of chronic disease in endemic areas. Mathematical models are needed to infer the rate and timing of T. cruzi reinfections from epidemiological data as reinfections cannot be experimentally evaluated in humans. The analysis of mixed infections by T. cruzi genotypes allows evaluating frequency and timing of reinfections in humans.
Researchers investigated the immune responses to dengue virus infection by analyzing blood samples from a cohort of school-aged Thai children who experienced either subclinical or symptomatic dengue infection. The study found significant differences in cytokine production based on the type of deng virus used for stimulation and the occurrence of illness. Secretion of IL-15 and MCP-1 was higher in subjects who developed symptomatic infection, while IL-6 was produced by all symptomatic subjects but only 59% of subclinical subjects. In contrast, secretion of IL12, IL2, MIP-1α, RANT, GM-CSF, and TNFα was lower in symptomatic subjects. These findings demonstrate pre-existing immune responses to deng virus are associated with the outcome of subsequent infection. Higher levels of certain cytokines were found in symptomatic subjects, while others were higher in subclinical, indicating both protective and pathologic immune profiles. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNα, IFγ, IL18, IL1β, and IL6 have been implicated in severe deng. The study used PBMC prior to infection to determine pre-existing immune profiles, unlike previous studies that used sera or PBMC during or after secondary infection. The results may be useful for evaluating immune responses to deng vaccines.
The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in patterning the Drosophila wing imaginal disc, forming a concentration gradient along the anterior-posterior axis and specifying multiple domains of gene expression. However, a direct correspondence between Hh concentration thresholds and pattern borders has not been demonstrated. Research suggests H interpretation depends on exposure history and a single concentration can support multiple outputs. Mathematical modeling predicts only two domains can be defined in response to H at steady state, implying boundaries cannot be specified by a static H gradient. Simulations indicate a spatial "overshoot" of the H gradient, a transient state where the H profile expands beyond the steady-state gradient. Temporal examination of H target expression shows patterns expand then refine, providing evidence for overshoot. The H network architecture suggests this results from H-dependent upregulation of the receptor Patched (Ptc). Altering the network to prevent ptc upregulation leads to overlapping expression patterns. Results support a model where H dynamics, through Ptc upregulation, play a role in establishing expression patterns. H is secreted from the posterior compartment, forming a gradient in the anterior with highest levels at the anterior-posterior boundary. H targets include proteins that sequester H itself, such as Hedge-interacting protein 1, which limits the H range and is upregulated by H signaling. The study provides evidence for a new model of pattern formation considering gradient dynamics to explain H-dependent patterning of the wing.
Researchers have identified a new mouse mutation, Lightweight, which disrupts the homolog of the Caenorhabditis elegans unc-79 gene, and found that heterozygotes are hypersensitive to acute ethanol exposure. Experiments in C. elegans demonstrate conserved hypersensitivity to ethanol in unc-79 mutants and related unc-80 and nca-1;nca2 double mutants. Lightweight heterozyotes exhibit altered response to anesthetic isoflurane and are mildly hyperactive in novel environments, smaller than wild-type animals, with increased food consumption and leaner body composition. They also voluntarily consume more ethanol than wild-type littermates. The findings suggest a conserved pathway influencing alcohol-related behaviors in humans. Complete resequencing confirmed absence of confounding mutations and alterations in Lightweight heterozyotes response to ethanol and anesthetics are similar to those in C. elegans and Drosila. Lightweight heterozyotes have larger proportion of body weight as lean mass and smaller proportion as fat. C. elegans unc-79 mutants exhibit altered responses to anesthetics and ethanol, and Lightweight heterozyotes response to ethanol and inhaled anesthetics is consistent with conserved function of mammalian unc-79 product. UNC-79 and UNC80 proteins regulate NAL-related channels, and ethanol phenotypes of unc-79 and unc80 may be due to undiscovered roles of these genes.
Researchers have identified the Imd pathway, a conserved immune signaling pathway, as a potential source of anti-Plasmodium genes to control malaria transmission. Silencing caspar, a negative regulator of the Imd pathway, or overexpressing rel2, an Imd-controlled NFkappa transcription factor, confers resistance to Plasmodium falciparum in Anopheles gambia mosquitoes. The Imd pathway is most potent against the parasite's ookinete stage, with reasonable activity against early oocysts and lesser activity against late oysts. Cas silencing alone induces a robust anti-P falcum response even without gut microbiota. Components TEP1, APL, and LR1 are involved in parasite intensity-dependent defense. Overactivating the Imd pathway by silencing cas or overexpressing REL2 confers almost complete protection from cultured P falcum in laboratory-reared A gambia. Proteins acting with Cas, including Imd, FADD, CAS1, and REL2, are key players in defense against P falcum. The Imd pathway is uniquely potent against this parasite. Key players in Plasmod killing include thio-containing protein 1, fibrinogen immuno, and leucine-rich repeat family. Silencing multiple I pathway members results in strong infection-intensity phenotypes, indicating a major role in anti-P falcum defense. The study highlights physiological considerations for implementing Imd manipulation in A gambia to limit malaria transmission, revealing nuances in the I-directed response against falciparum.
Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BSCs) have been considered a potential therapy for fibrotic diseases, but their anti-fibrotic effect in pulmonary paracoccidioidomycosis is unknown. Researchers investigated BSCs in a mouse model of lung fibrosis caused by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis infection. Mice were inoculated with P. brasiliensis and treated with BSCs or itraconazole. Histological analysis showed increased granulomatous inflammation in BSC-treated mice and higher fibrocyte counts, soluble collagen, and collagen-α1, TGF-β, MMP-8, and MMP-15 expression. Combined BSC and itraconazole therapy decreased TIM-1 and MMP13 expression. Human fibroblasts stimulated with lung supernatants from infected and BSC-transplanted mice showed higher collagen expression. Results indicate late BSC infusion does not have anti-fibrotic effect, possibly due to interaction with the fungus promoting collagen and tissue remodeling. Itraconazole reduced soluble collagen in infected mice and BSC-transplanted mice. Supernatants from infected and BSC-treated mice induced higher collagen expression in human fibroblasts. The study found an exacerbating effect of BSC therapy on pulmonary fibrosis, possibly triggered by interaction with P. brasiliensis or inflammatory environment, but combined itraconazole and BSC showed promise in reducing TIMP and MMP13.
A consortium of partners from eight Mediterranean countries conducted entomological investigations from 2011-2013 to study the seasonal dynamics of phlebotine sand fly species that transmit Leishmania infantum. Over 99,000 specimens were collected, resulting in the description of 56,000 sand flies belonging to Leishmania vector species across a wide geographical area. The time of sand fly appearance and disappearance varied between sites, with significant correlations found between latitude, mean temperature, and the first month of appearance, ranging from April to June, and density trends varying from a single peak in July-August to multiple peaks from May-September. Adults ended activity from mid-September to November, without correlation with latitude or temperature. The period of potential exposure to Leishmania was associated with a bell-shaped density curve, peaking in July-September and falling between May-October for over 99% of values, with no risk from December to March. Nocturnal activity peaked between 11pm-2am, with annual variations providing homogeneous patterns for future monitoring. Higher risk for Leishmania transmission was identified in June-October, but not equally distributed, with earlier and more frequent waves in southern territories.
Orientia tsutsugamushi, the causal agent of scrub typhus, infects endothelial cells and monocytes, altering the expression of over 4,500 genes in the latter. Microarray analysis revealed upregulation of type I interferon, interferon-stimulated genes, and M1 macrophage polarization-associated genes. Apoptosis-related genes were also induced, leading to cell death in some monocytes. Live organisms were necessary for type I interferon response and M1 cytokine expression. Similar transcriptional changes were observed in mononuclear cells from scrub typhus patients, with upregulation of 613 genes including interferon-related and M1 polarization features. Monocytes polarized in vitro and ex vivo following O tsutsamushi exposure. Results suggest interferon-mediated monocyte activation and M1 polarization are critical in scrub typh pathogenesis. O tsamushi induced a specific M1 phenotype and type I interferon response in monocytes. Type I and II interferons and M1 signature were found in patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells, associated with inflammatory complications. Activated monocytes may play a role in pathogen dissemination. Oamushi upregulated genes involved in polarized immune responses, including IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-23p19, GMF, and CCL20. Only live tsam induced sustained type I interferon response in human monocytes, producing 65±16 pg IFNβ. Approximately 15% of upregulated genes were cytokines or chemokines, highlighting the role of interferon-mediated monocyte activation in scrub typh pathogenesis.
Researchers investigated how ants use visual memory to navigate complex environments and found the mushroom body circuit in the brain plays a crucial role. A spiking neural model of this circuit, originally developed for fruit fly olfactory association, was applied to desert ants learning visual routes. The model accounted for ants' ability to rapidly learn routes through natural environments and demonstrated key principles, including one-shot learning of sparse codes, enabling storage of hundreds of independent images. The neural architecture of the mushroom body can form the substrate for the familiarity algorithm, previously suggested for route following. The model, with minimal modification, learned over 80 on-route images from real ant viewpoints and distinguished them from similar off-route images. The network, originally for simple olfactory learning in flies, performed the complex function of navigation with increased size, consistent with enlarged mushroom bodies in navigating insects like ants and bees. The study suggests the mushroom body's function extends beyond olfactory learning, supporting visual route memory and navigation in complex environments. The findings estimate the theoretical capacity of the mushroom body to store hundreds of independent images, providing insight into how small brains implement route-following capabilities.
Plants have evolved unique defense mechanisms to protect themselves from disease, including the ability to shed damaged organs. Researchers developed a system to study pathogen-triggered leaf abscission in Arabidopsis cauline leaves infected with the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, finding that abscission is a novel form of immunity triggered by effectors. HAESA, INFLORESCICIENT ABSCISSION, and NEVERSHED are required for pathogen-triggered abscission to occur. Mutations in genes necessary for bacterial defense and salicylic acid signaling, such as phytoalexin deficient 4 and salicy acid-deficient 2, fail to abise cauline leaves normally. Bacteria physically contacting abscission zones trigger a strong response, with long-distance signals sent from distal infected tissue alerting the absc zone of danger. A threshold model regulating cauline defense is proposed, where minor infections are handled by limiting growth, but severe infections lead to cauline shedding. Salicy acid regulates both pathogen and drought-triggered leaf abission, with transgenic plants overexpressing NahG blocked in abission and sid2 or ics having reduced abission. The study defines a new system for pathogen-triggered leaf abission in Arabidopsis, connecting disparate pathways regulating defense and abission.
Retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs) play a crucial role in detecting image motion direction, generating larger dendritic Ca2+ signals when motion is from their somata towards their dendritic tips than in the opposite direction. To study direction selectivity (DS) in SAC dendrites, electrical responses to expanding and contracting circular visual stimuli were measured via somatic whole-cell recordings and quantified using Fourier analysis. Fundamental and harmonic components were larger for expanding stimuli, persisting in the presence of GABA and glycine receptor antagonists, suggesting inhibitory interactions are not essential. The presence of harmonics indicates nonlinearity due to the activation of voltage-gated channels. [Ca2+] changes in SAC dendrites evoked by voltage steps monitored by two-photon microscopy suggest the distal dendrite is tonically depolarized relative to the soma, in part due to resting currents mediated by glutamatergic synaptic and high-voltage-activated Ca+ channels. Compartmental modeling supports that dendritic DS in SACs can be computed by dendrites themselves, relying on voltage-gated channels and a dendritic voltage gradient, providing spatial asymmetry for direction discrimination. SACs generate DS signals independent of lateral inhibitory interactions when stimuli are confined to the cell's spatial extent. Blocking GABA and glycine receptors shows DS persists, indicating dendrites generate signals in absence of inhibition, involving voltage-gated Ca channels and membrane potential gradient between dendritic tips and soma. Optical recordings show dendritic sectors can be activated independently with strongest [Ca+] increases near synapses, allowing local processing due to peculiar morphology and low impedance at the soma.
The infective dose of pathogens, the number of pathogens required to infect a host, varies across species and depends on the mode of action of molecules used to facilitate infection. Pathogens using locally acting molecules require a lower infective dose than those using distantly acting molecules. However, pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators may be more virulent due to the large number of cells in the inoculum causing harm to host cells. A study of 43 human pathogens from diverse taxonomic groups found pathogens using local action have lower infective doses but are not less virulent than those using distant action. Virulence was negatively correlated with infective dose and higher in pathogens infecting skin compared to those ingested or inhaled. Pathogens with distantly acting immune modulators have higher infective doses than locally acting molecules. No relationship was found between case fatality or infection severity and mechanism of pathogenesis but case fatality was related to infective dose. Pathogens infecting through skin result in higher fatality rates than inhaled or ingested. The study highlights the importance of mechanistic details in explaining variation in parasite traits such as infective dose and virulence.
Schistosomes are parasitic helminths that cause schistosomias, a disease affecting 200 million people, primarily in underprivileged regions of the world. Researchers investigated the role of microRNAs in the developmental processes of Schistoma mansoni, the most experimentally tractable schosome species. Using the bioinformatics tool Sylamer, they analyzed 3'-UTRs transcripts differentially expressed between juvenile and adult stages and found the miR-277/498 family sequence significantly enriched in the transition from juvenile to adult worms. A novel miRNA, sm-miR-498, was identified with proximal genomic location to sma-miR277, suggesting they form a miRNA cluster. Expression of sma-miR277/498 miAs are upregulated in adults, while predicted targets are downregulated in adult but undisturbed in immature females. Sma-miR498 is expressed in tegal cells and distributed throughout male worms. Results indicate sma-miR277/498 play a role in post-transcriptional regulation during juvenile development and suggest an important role in female schistosome sexual development. The high-quality S. mansoni genome allowed querying 3'-UT regions for miAs recognition sites conserved across Schistoma species. Sma-miR277 and sm-miR498 may drive transcriptional regulating gene expression changes underlying juvenile and maturation. The miR277 and mi498 loci comprise a miRNA cluster with potentially co-regulated expression in other species.
A five-year surveillance of SARS-related coronaviruses in a cave inhabited by multiple species of horseshoe bats in Yunn Province, China, revealed a diverse pool of strains with high genetic similarity to SARS coronavirus in the hypervariable N-terminal domain and receptor-binding domain. The full-length genomes of 11 newly discovered strains, combined with previous findings, show SARS-related coronaviruses in this location are highly diverse in the gene ORF3 and ORF8 regions. Strains with high similarity to human SARS in ORF3 and split ORF8 were discovered, and those from this cave were more closely related to SARS in non-structural genes compared to those detected elsewhere. Recombination analysis shows evidence of frequent recombination within the gene and around ORF between these SARS-related coronaviruses, suggesting the direct progenitor of SARS may have originated after sequential recombination between precursors. Cell studies demonstrated newly identified SARS-related coronaviruses can use ACE2 as receptor, exhibiting a close relationship between strains in the cave and SARS. The findings provide new insights into the origin and evolution of SARS and highlight the necessity for preparedness for future emergence of S-like diseases, as all building blocks of the SARS genome were present in SARS-related coronaviruses from this location during sampling, including strains closely related to representative bat SARS from other provinces in the RBD region.
Current efforts to control soil-transmitted helminth infections involve periodic treatment with benzimidazole and imidoazole drugs, but high levels of resistance have developed in roundworms of livestock, necessitating monitoring of drug efficacy in humans. The faecal egg reduction test measures egg output pre- and post-treatment to detect resistance, but density-dependent fecundity may impact measurements. Female worms surviving treatment may increase egg output after density constraints are relaxed, underestimating drug efficacy. The degree of underestimation depends on pre-treatment egg output and worm density. Omitting cases with heaviest infections may improve measurements by ensuring consistent underestimation. The impact of reproductive biology on the faecal egg reduction test highlights the need for new methods examining direct effects on isolated worms or genotypes. Density-dependent fecund constraints may amplify egg counts after treatment if a proportion of the population is resistant, and widespread occurrence in human STH suggests the phenomenon applies to humans. The faecal egg reduction test may be distorted by density-dependent fecity, making it difficult to identify efficacy changes and development of resistance amongst dynamic worm biology.
Researchers investigated the role of epithelial heparan sulfate (HS) in regulating Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling during lung development, a process crucial aspect of branching morphogenesis. Deletion of HS synthase Ext1 in epithelial cells resulted in expanded branching tips, reduced branching number, and mesenchymal defects, associated with increased FGF10 expression and activity. Reduced SH signaling was observed, which normally suppresses F10 expression. Reactivating SH signaling in mutant lungs rescued tip dilation and attenuated FGF signaling. Decreased SH activity wasn't due to reduced expression or protein stability, but biologically active SH forms were reduced in Ext1 mutant epithelium and surrounding mesench cells. Epithelial HS dictates SH signaling, crucial for lung morphogenesis. Loss of HS led to reduced biologically active SH, causing unrestricted F10 expression, expanded tips, and reduced branching. HS in epithelial cells maintains SH activity, essential for SH-F10 cascade. Ablation of HS synthase Ext1 resulted in reduced biologically active SH particles on epithelium and mesench, causing F10 expression and branching defects. Epithelial HS directs epithelial-mesym interaction, controlling SH-F10 signaling during branching morphogenesis. Manipulating SH signaling in explant culture using Smoothened agonist confirmed decreased SH activity contributes to defects. Epithelial HS, on cell surface and basement membrane, maintains SH activity, crucial for branching morphogenesis.
Paired-end sequencing is a key technique for assessing genome rearrangements and structural variation on a genome-wide scale, particularly useful for detecting copy-neutral rearrangements such as inversions and translocations that produce novel genes in cancer. Researchers derived a formula for the probability of a fusion gene existing in a cancer genome given paired-end sequences and used it to compute fusion probabilities in breast cancer samples, finding accurate predictions with a small number of large fragments. The ability to detect fusion depends on the distribution of gene lengths and sequencing strategy parameters, including errors that suggest false rearrangements. Theoretical and empirical formulae elucidate trade-offs in experimental design for current and next-generation technologies, maximizing the probability of detecting genes with the least sequencing. Larger clones are more reliable for studies across tumor samples with limited paired reads. Sources of error in paired sequencing include experimental artifacts, genome errors, and mis-mapping, leading to incorrect predictions or false positives. Whole genome paired sequencing allows a survey of potential genes and rearrangements, offering advantages over transcript or protein profiling in cancer studies, enabling systematic analysis of genomic events leading to cancer and shedding light on its genetic basis.
Chemotaxis involves the coordinated action of separable but interrelated processes: motility, gradient sensing, and polarization, which are mediated by separate modules that account for these processes individually and when combined recreate most of the behaviors of chemotactic cells. A mathematical model implements these modules in terms of reaction-diffusion equations, demonstrating migration and changes in cellular morphology using a mechanical model of the cell cortex. The central module is an excitable network accounting for random migration, with response to uniform stimuli and gradients mediated by local excitation and global inhibition that biases direction. A polarization module linked to the excitable network through cytoskeleton allows unstimulated cells to persist and cells in gradients to acquire sensitivity between front and back. Varying strengths of feedback loops in the model obtain cellular behaviors mirroring genetically altered cell lines. Cells sense direction of chemical gradients and respond by polarizing and migrating toward attractants, with chemotaxis a fundamental property of single and multicellular organisms. Experiments suggest chemotaxis involves coordinated action of motility, gradient sensing, and polarization with considerable redundancy at the biochemical level. Models propose chemotaxis as consequence of excitable network activity biased in direction of chemoattract stimuli.
Tudor domain-containing protein 6 (TD6) is a male germ-line specific protein essential for chromatoid body structure, elongated spermatid development, and male fertility. In meiotic prophase I spermatocytes, TD6 interacts with protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5, supporting splicing, and associates with spliceosomal protein SmB in an arginine methylation-dependent manner. TD6 deficiency impairs spliceosome assembly, resulting in 3.5-fold increased levels of U snRNPs and reduced PRMT association with Sm and arginine dimethylation of Sm. This correlates with decreased numbers of SMN-positive and Cajal bodies involved in nuclear snRNP maturation. Transcriptome analysis of TD6-deficient diplot spermatocytes reveals high numbers of splicing defects, including aberrant intron and exon usage, and aberrant representation of splice junctions. TD6 plays a central role in regulating spliceosome maturation and mRNA splicing in spermatogenesis. The spliceosome is a large macromolecular machine with over a hundred RNA and protein components, and TD6 ensures proper splicing events, including those specific to spermatogenesis, are carried out. TD6's function in maturation of spliceosomal snRNPs during prophase spermatogenesis adds to its roles in later stages of spermatogenesis, including ChB formation and nonsense-mediated decay, highlighting its importance in male fertility.
A Bayesian model is presented to determine the acquisition and clearance of bacterial colonization within a host, accounting for within-host variation and uncertainty in estimated rates. The model provides probabilities of whether two strains should be considered the same, allowing determination of bacterial clearance and acquisition from genomes sampled over time. Unlike previous approaches, it does not rely on a fixed genetic distance threshold to determine relationships between isolates. The method uses genetic simulation and Approximate Bayesian Computation and Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference to model within-host population variation. The approach is validated through simulations and applied to a collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates from a longitudinal study. The model offers a robust and accurate way to analyze colonization dynamics, enabling calculation of rates of acquisition and clearance, and understanding of within-host response to interventions and transmission. It improves on heuristic strategies by providing probabilistic estimates and uncertainty for relevant quantities. The model defines a strain as a population of closely related isolates and determines the probability that two genomes represent the same strain based on genetic distance and sampling interval. An R-code implementation is available.
Plants generate new organs through the activity of stem cell populations called meristems, with the shoot apical meristem initiating leaves and flowers in highly ordered patterns via phyllotaxis, a process in which the hormone auxin plays a major role. Current hypotheses propose that cellular transporters of the PIN family create local auxin maxima, leading to organ initiation. Two concepts have been proposed to explain auxin transport: canalization, where auxin transporters amplify and stabilize existing fluxes, and a second hypothesis where hormone is transported to areas of highest concentration. Computational modeling has been used to test these hypotheses, showing that a flux-based polarization can explain auxin transport at the shoot meristem, providing a unifying concept for auxin distribution control. Auxin is transported throughout the plant by carriers at cell membranes, with AUX/LAX facilitating import and PIN-FORMED facilitating efflux. Differences in concentration lead to differential gene expression and growth, with importers and exporters mainly expressed at the meristem surface. The precise mechanism of PIN localisation is unknown, but it is proposed that both regimes correspond to states of the same flux mechanism. The flux-based hypothesis remains a potential unifying mechanism for auxin transport, with further experiments required to distinguish it from other hypotheses.
Researchers utilized a combination of bioinformatic tools and wet lab experiments to identify diagnostic peptides for visceral leishmaniasis, aiming to improve point-of-care tests for early detection and surveillance. Previous studies showed IgG as a potential biomarker for monitoring clinical status using crude lysate antigen, but replacing it with specific antigens could lead to more robust tests. Immunoblots revealed L. donani proteins detected by IgG from patients, which were identified by mass spectrometry and searched for constitutive expression and antigenic domains. Selected candidates had linear epitopes mapped in silico and high-scoring predicted epitopes screened in peptide arrays. The most promising candidate was tested in RDT prototypes with VL and non-endemic healthy control sera, showing 84% sensitivity and 95% CI 60-97 specificity with Sudanese VL sera. None of non-endemic sera were positive. In silico searches reduced wet experiment output, focusing on candidates with desired features, predicting epitopes and screening peptides, identifying the most promising for IgG sensitivity and specificity. This proof-of-concept strategy can be applied to develop robust IgG RDTs for monitoring clinical status in visceral leishiasis. Comparative genomics contributed to understanding leishmanias and in silico tools located antigenic domains, incorporating genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics for biomarker discovery. L. donani proteins recognized by IgG were profiled using western blots and cytosolic proteins separated by SDS-PAGE, immunoassayed with patient sera from India.
A multiregional cohort of 317 patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) from Syria, Pakistan, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, and Iran was reviewed to document the incidence of caseating granulomas. Granulomas were identified in 61.5% of cases, with 25.2% being caseating, 4.6% suppurative, and 70.2% tuberculoid without necrosis. Caseating granulomas were more common in Saudi Arabia and had a different distribution of Ridley's parasitic index (RP) pattern compared to tuberculoid granulomas. Time to achieve healing was shorter in tuberculoid granulomas (4 months) compared to caseating granulomas (6.2 months). Leishmania tropica was the predominant species in 88% of cases, with Leishmania major in 11.9%. All cases were negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The study found an 18.2% incidence of caseating granomas in CL, suggesting CL should be considered in the differential diagnosis for caseating granulomas in endemic regions. The presence of caseating granulomas was associated with a slower healing process, but not with a specific Leishmania species, possibly due to a worse host response or more aggressive strain. The study highlights the importance of considering CL in the differential diagnosis of caseating granulomas, particularly in regions where both CL and tuberculosis are endemic.
Researchers have identified a candidate gene, Zfp69, a zinc finger transcription factor, associated with the diabetogenic effect of the quantitative trait locus Nidd/SJ, which contributes to obesity-associated polygenic type 2 diabetes in mice. A critical interval on distal chromosome 4 conferring the diabetic phenotype was identified through interval-specific congenic introgression of SJL into diabetes-resistant C57/6 and subsequent cross with New Zealand Obese mice. Analysis revealed allelic variance of Zfp69, where NZ and C57/6 had a retrotransposon disrupting gene formation of a truncated mRNA, whereas diabetogenic SJ and NON generated normal mRNA. The diabetogenic ZfpSJ allele produced hyperglycemia, reduced gonadal fat, and increased triglycerides when combined with B6-Lep background. Human orthologue ZNF642 mRNA was increased in adipose tissue from type 2 diabetes patients. Zfp69 is the likely candidate for the diabetogenic effect of NiddSJ, with retrotransonAP1 contributing to genetic heterogeneity. Expression of the transcription factor in adipose tissue may play a role in pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. Positional cloning of mouse genes provides insights into obesity diabetes pathogenesis, with Zfp identified as the causal gene for Nidd and N/SJ, which aggravates and accelerates obesity diabetes in NZ strain and enhances hyperglyemia in B-ob mice.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive model of the regulatory network and signalling pathways controlling T helper cell differentiation, addressing the challenge of predicting mammalian cell differentiation from specific signals and transcription factors. The vertebrate hematopoietic system, with its many branching pathways and cell types, is a key area of study. Using a logical formalism for dynamical analyses due to qualitative data, an original reduction approach and stable state algorithm were applied to cope with network complexity. Simulations of various environments identified stable states corresponding to Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg subtypes, as well as transient hybrid cell types co-expressing combinations of markers in environment-dependent fashion. The model highlights the nature of cell types and relationships with canonical subtypes, allowing exploration of novel differentiation pathways in silico. Mathematical modelling addresses stability and robustness of differentiation states underpinning cellular phenotypes, formalising regulatory schemes in immunology. The network controlling T cell activation and differentiation was reconstructed, considering components and cross-regulatory links from literature and previous models, to determine expected stable states in changing environments. The study reveals diversity and plasticity of cell types predicted from regulatory network modelling, providing insights into T cell differentiation and potential applications for further research.
Researchers developed a thermodynamic model to evaluate the mechanisms controlling genome-wide patterns of transcription factor binding during early Drosophila development, focusing on five regulators of embryonic anterior-posterior patterning. Predictions based on DNA sequence and in vitro protein-DNA affinities achieved a correlation of 0.4 with experimental measurements. Incorporating cooperativity and competition had little effect, while incorporating genome-wide DNA accessibility improved predictions to a correlation of 0.6-0.9 for various factors across target genes. Results show that in open chromatin regions, binding can be predicted by sequence specificity of individual factors with minimal protein interactions. A combination of experimentally determined chromatin data and computational models may predict the binding landscape of any transcription factor with precision. The model was applied to predict genome-wide binding across 4,251 genes, finding a strong relation between prediction accuracy and gene expression level. The study reveals aspects of transcription biochemistry and provides a means to predict where, how, and to what extent transcription factors bind, establishing a practical method for predicting binding and understanding forces shaping quantitative variation in binding to open chromatin regions.
The basic helix-loop-helix (bHL) transcription factors and their inhibitors, the Id proteins, play crucial roles in regulating cell proliferation in metazoans, with their activity frequently deregulated in cancer cells. In Drosophila, Daughterless (Da) and Extramacchaeta (Em) are the sole representatives of class I and V bHL factors. Genetic analysis reveals that Em controls the G2/M transition and cell proliferation in epithelial cells of imaginal discs via Da. The activator of this transition, Cdc25 phosphatase string, is transcriptionally repressed by Da. Ectopic expression of string in cells with reduced Em or high Da levels rescues proliferative defects. Em is required to downregulate Da, which triggers mitosis via transcriptional activation of Cdc25. The interaction between Da and Em determines cell fate in developmental contexts, controlling the balance between proliferation and differentiation. This study defines a mechanism where Em regulates cell proliferation by controlling Da activity, which transcriptionally represses string. Da and Em act as essential proliferative factors for various cell types, influencing nervous system precursors and epithelial cells. The findings indicate bHL factors can control G2 transition in conjunction with Id factors, describing the first mechanism of class I and V bHL interaction in cell cycle regulation.
Researchers have developed a comprehensive pipeline for analyzing phosphoproteome data from interventional experiments to identify key proteins, discover protein interactions, and infer signaling networks. Using SILAC technique with kinase-dead mutations, they generated a dataset to study the transition to filamentous growth in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The pipeline includes phosphopeptide meta-analysis, correlation analysis, and causal discovery, and was applied to identify 882 unique phosphopeptides representing 486 proteins influenced by kinase-dead mutants. Five high-confidence proteins and 19 hub proteins, including P2p and Hsp42, were identified, with nine involved in stress responses and filamentous growth. Four predicted proteins, Nthp, P2, Pdrp, and Rcn, showed differential growth in phenotypic experiments, validating the approach. The pipeline provides a systematic way to discover signaling networks using interventional phosphopome data and suggests candidate proteins for investigation, applicable to other studies via different platforms. The study demonstrates interventional phosphopome can provide insight into signaling pathways in biological processes like yeast growth, increasing sensitivity to smaller phosphorylation changes using SILAC and addressing the missing value problem in proteomics.
The evolution of heteromorphic sex chromosomes has led to the development of two types of chromosome-specific regulation: dosage compensation and meiotic sex chromosome inactivation. In Drosophila melanaster, the regulation of the X chromosome in the male germline is unclear. Research findings indicate that X-wide dosage compensation appears to be absent from most of the Drosila male gerine and microarray analysis provides no evidence for X-specific inactivation during meiosis. Expression of transgene reporters driven by autosomal spermatogenesis promoters is reduced when inserted on the X chromosome versus autosomes, with this difference established in premeiotic cells and persisting in meiotic cells. The magnitude of X-autosome difference in transgene expression cannot be explained by the absence of dosage, suggesting a previously unrecognized mechanism limits expression from X during spermatogenesis in Drosila. Contrary to previous reports, the X does not appear to undergo X dosage compensation in the Dophila male gerine. Microarray data fail to show overall reduced expression from the X in cells enriched meiosis-stage sperocytes. X chromosome compensation is estimated in male somatic tissues using microarrays to assay gene expression in thorax dissected adult males and females. Expression of endogenous X-linked genes was thought to be affected by modes of chromosomal regulation including dosage compensation and meiotic inactivation. X chromosome compensation is absent from most of the Dophila germl and reduced expression from X is not a general feature of germl expression but a male-specific absence of gerine X dosage compensation.
Citrobacter rodentium infection, a model for human diarrheal infection caused by enteropathogenic E. coli, relies on forming epithelium-adherent microcolonies known as "attachment/effacement" lesions. Research shows that all colonic epithelial microcolonies are clonal populations, depending on local growth to persist, and are established within the first 18 hours of infection in wild-type mice. The early events shape the intestinal geography and severity of infection despite continuous presence of phenotypically virulent luminal bacteria. Mechanistically, resistance to A lesion formation is mediated by TLR-MyD88/Trif-dependent signaling induced by virulent C. rodium in a virulence-dependent manner. The establishment of C rodium pathogenesis is restricted to a short window determining disease geography and severity. The development of colonic C rodium A pathogenesis is dependent on early bacteria-host interactions, with A lesions originating from single-bacterial infection events within the first 18 hours. The initiation of colonic microcolonies is limited to an early stage, triggering a local immune response protecting the epithelium from de novo A lesion formation by luminal bacteria, determining disease outcome. Colonic A lesions depend on local cell-to-cell spread, not re-seeding from plankic luminal colonizers, derived from a small founder population, subject to a bottleneck.
Measuring overlap between two populations is straightforward when both are fully sampled, but in practice, only a fraction of each population is sampled due to stochastic data collection or sequencing techniques. Existing methods for quantifying population overlap under subsampled conditions are biased and their uncertainty cannot be quantified. A Bayesian method is derived to estimate population overlap from incomplete samples when total objects, species, or genes in each population are known. This approach solves a Bayesian inference problem, accounting for subsampling rates, producing unbiased estimates and quantifying uncertainty. The method provides a framework for computing uncertainty and can be used in prospective study planning, quantifying tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty. The approach contrasts non-probabilistic indices and metrics, offering a statistical ground for estimating overlap between fixed-size repertoires or populations from incomplete samples. The method estimates true repertoire overlap from knowledge of shared types between samples and quantifies uncertainty due to stochastic sampling. Larger whole-genome datasets can be incorporated as prior distribution of repertoire sizes, improving estimates, opening analysis of Plasmodium spp multig antigen families and general studies of β-divity in multig families with fixed population sizes.
Eukaryotic protein kinases regulate cellular functions by phosphorylating targeted substrates through a highly conserved catalytic core that oscillates between open, intermediate, and closed conformations. Research using cAMP-dependent protein kinase as a model has identified a set of conserved electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions regulating these mechanics, including a salt bridge between lysine from the β3-strand and glutamate from the α-helix and electrostatic interaction between the phosphorylated activation loop and α-helix and an ensemble of hydrophobic residues of the Regulatory and Shell. The highly conserved β3-lysine, previously thought essential for phosphoryl transfer, is not required for this process but is essential for active mechanics. The α/β-phates of ATP interact with the conserved lysine in β3, forming a salt bridge with conserved glutamate α-helix. The absence of this bridge and electrostatic interaction allows regulation through the R-spine and Shell. Enhancing hydrophobicity connects the β-sheet and α-helix through hydrophobic interaction. Repositioning lysine onto G-loop rescues catalytic activity. Mutating α-helix to alanine destabilizes active conformation, preventing cis-autophosphorylation, trans-autosphorylation, or steady-state catalysis, but coexpressing α/A with P1 restores R-spine assembly. β3 is a structural ATP sensor facilitating active mechanics by coordinating β-sheet and α-helix transition, not required for phosphoryl transfer.
American Samoa conducted seven rounds of mass drug administration from 2000-2006 under the Global Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis. In 2016, a school-based Transmission Assessment Survey of children aged 6-7 and a community-based survey targeting people ≥8 were conducted. The school-based survey identified nine antigen-positive children with an adjusted CFA prevalence of 0.7% and one microfilaraemic 7-year-old child. The community survey identified 102 antigen-positive people with an adjusted CFA prevalence of 6.2% and 22 microfilaraemic individuals. The school-based survey had limited sensitivity and negative predictive value but high specificity and positive predictive value for identifying villages with ongoing transmission. The community survey identified antigen individuals of all ages and foci of high prevalence. Both surveys confirmed recrudescence of transmission. The findings raise concerns about the suitability of school-based TAS for post-MDA surveillance globally. The community survey provided evidence of recent transmission by identifying antigen-positive children 8-9 years who were born after the last round of MDA or too young to participate. American Samoa failed the school-based TAS in 201 and the community survey identified higher numbers of antigen-positive people. The study confirmed recrudence of transmission in American Samoa 10 years after the last round of MDA.
Researchers investigated the role of oocyte-produced signals in maintaining the female sexual phenotype in zebrafish, as sex determination in this species is not well understood and appears to be influenced by multiple genetic and environmental factors. They found that oocytes are required throughout the life of the animal to maintain the differentiated female state and identified a novel role for Bmp15 in this process. Females deficient in B15 develop normally but switch sex during mid-to-late juvenile stage and become males. Estrogen production is necessary for female development and Bmp15 function is linked to regulation of estrogen biosynthesis, promoting development of estrogen-producing granulosa cells in the oocyte follicle. Mutations in Bmp15 lead to degradation of oocytes and transformation of the gonad to a functional testis. The study provides mechanistic insights into how oocytes regulate sex maintenance, suggesting oocyte-somatic gonad interaction stabilizes cyp19a1 expression and estrogen production. Two genes, cypa19a and Bmp15, are required for female development and maintenance, establishing a genetic pathway likely conserved in other fish. These findings indicate oocytes produce a signal that stabilizes female-specific gene expression in the somatic gonad, promoting ovarian fate.
Hox proteins play a crucial role in controlling morphogenetic diversity along the anterior-posterior body axis of animals by regulating distinct sets of genes. To achieve high regulatory specificity, Hox proteins cooperate with other transcription factors to activate or repress target genes in a highly specific manner. The regulation of the death gene reaper (r) by the Hox protein Deformed (Dfd) involves combinatorial interaction with at least eight functionally diverse transcriptional regulators on a minimal enhancer, resulting in local activation of r expression in the anterior part of the maxillary segment. Eight transcription regulators, including Apt, Gcm, Ems, En, Slp, Brk, Doc, and Disco, are required in addition to Dfd to properly regulate r expression. The combined action of multiple transcription regulators, including Hox proteins and structurally diverse factors, achieves proper spatiotemporal Hox target regulation. Hox proteins regulate a large number of downstream genes, including those involved in morphology and terminal differentiation. The recruitment of context-specific transcription factors to cis-regulatory sequences in compact Hox response elements enables broadly expressed Hox proteins to regulate targets in a spatial and temporal context. Studies on Exd and Hth reveal complex interactions between Hox proteins and co-regulatory factors in Hox target regulation. The findings suggest a large number of transcription factors are directly involved in Hox target regulation in vivo, contributing to the diverse effects of Hox proteins on morphogenesis.
Plants respond to pathogen attack through recognition and response to pathogen-specific molecules at the cell surface and inside the cell, with intracellular nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) sensor proteins monitoring pathogen effectors in plants and mammals. The genetic requirements for defense responses of an autoactive mutant of ADR1-L2, an Arabidopsis coiled-coil (CC)-NBRR protein, were studied. ADR1-L2 functions upstream of salicylic acid accumulation and can act as a helper to transduce microbial signals from sensor NBRRs. An autoactive missense mutation A1D2D484V was generated, leading to dwarfed plants with increased disease resistance and constitutively high salicylic acid levels, requiring an intact P-loop. Signaling from A1D2D484 does not require NAD oxidase and is negatively regulated by EDS1 and At1. Transcription regulation of A1D2D484 is correlated with phenotypic outputs, both salicy acid-dependent and independent. The genetic requirements resemble SA-dependent signal amplification of defense and cell signaling observed in LSD1, with A1D2 autoactivation controlled by EDS and salicy acid in separable but linked pathways. Results support a model of SA-dependent feedback loop including A1. The constitutive activation of A1D484 results in both salicy acid-dependent and independent phenotypes, consistent with previous genetic analyses.
Researchers investigated the role of RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway components in transcriptional silencing in Arabidopsis, focusing on the interaction between MORC6 and SUVH9. Genetic analysis revealed that SUV2 and SUV9 act synergistically with MOR6 to mediate transcriptional silencing, while ID2 interacts with MOR6 and silences a subset of MOR6 target loci. Other RNA-directed DNA methylation components, including Pol IV, Pol V, RDR2, and DRM2, also contribute to transcription silencing at MOR6 target loci. The SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, including SWI3, SWI3, and SWI3, interacts with MOR6 and SUV9, mediating transcription silencing. Results suggest RNA-directed DNA methylation components are involved in both DNA methylation and MOR6-mediated heterochromatin condensation, linking methylation to heterochromatin condensation and enhancing transcriptional silencing at methylated regions. MOR6 physically interacts with SUV9, recruiting it to chromatin, and then interacts with ID2 and the SW/SNF complex to mediate heterochatin condensation. MOR6 functions in transcriptional silencing at loci targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway components, and release of silencing in mor6 is not associated with loss of DNA methylation. ID2 plays a role in transcriptional silencing through the MOR6-dependent pathway, binding Pol-produced noncoding RNAs and interacting with the SW/SNF chromatin-remodel complex, contributing to noncoding-mediated transcriptional silencing.
Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) plays a crucial role in modulating phenotypes in vertebrate development, acting as a molecular chaperone that buffers underlying genetic variation. In zebrafish, H90 inhibition did not induce a heat response or perturb phenotype in wild-type strains but increased the severity of recessive eye phenotypes, such as sunrise, caused by paxb mutation, and decreased dreumes, caused by sufu mutation. A previously unobserved spectrum of severe structural eye malformations, including anophthalmia, microphthalmia, and nanophthalm, was uncovered by limited H90 inhibition. Inbreeding offspring from unaffected parents led to elevated malformation frequencies, revealing the oligogenic nature of the phenotype. Unlike Drosophila, H90 inhibition decreases developmental stability in zebish, with increased asymmetric presentation of anophthalm, microphthalm, and nanthalm phenotypes. Analysis of paxb mutation suggests H90 buffers mutations, implying mild perturbation of H90 at developmental stages underpins variable penetrance and expressivity of developmental anomalies where genotype and environment interact. H90 proteins are environmentally responsive chaper encoded at multiple loci in vertebrates and diverted from developmental role by generalised stress response. Compromising H90 function alters severity or penetrance without affecting overall development, uncovering previously unobserved developmental anomalies. H90 reduction impacts unilateral appearance of anophthalm and coloma, increasing intraindividual differences in mutants, confirming H90 role in maintaining trait thresholds, unlike plants and flies where H90 does not affect fluctuating asymmetry of quantitative traits.
Researchers have identified and characterized N-terminally acetylated proteins in Drosophila melanaster, a common modification found throughout the tree of life where the N-terminus of a nascent polypeptide chain becomes co-translationally acetylated after removal of the initiating methionine residue. Analysis of amino-terminal peptides from Drosila K167 cells detected over 1,200 mature N-termini, showing N-acetylation occurs in insects with similar frequency to humans. The X rule indicates prevention of acetylation under all circumstances and can be used to genetically engineer proteins to study the biological relevance of the presence or absence of an acetyl group. Applying this rule by expressing mutated proteins as transgenes in cell lines and flies provides a strategy to systematically study functional relevance of N-acetylations in cells and organisms. The X rule seems to be of general validity in lower and higher eukotes and can be used to study function of N-acetylation in all species. The study presents a compilation of mature protein N-termin from Drosila melanaster, showing N-acetylation is common in insects, follows rules of sequence requirements and Met cleavage, and occurs at lower frequency than man but higher than yeast. Shotgun proteomics and enrichment of N-terminal peptides show amino-acetylation is a common event in Drosila with sequence requirements similar to eukotes. Examples demonstrate N-acetylation promotes various biological functions not predicted from primary sequence, necessitating a method to generate and express proteins differing N-acetylation to investigate functional consequences of N-acetyl group presence or absence. Comparison with yeast and human data shows N-acetylation occurs in insects with similar frequency, with shifted acety frequency during evolution.
Researchers investigated the termination mechanisms of RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) and its link to high transcription output, using two tRNA-mediated systems to screen for Rpc1 mutants with gain and loss of termination phenotypes in S. pombe. 122 point mutations were mapped to the 3.9 Å structure of yeast RNAP elongation complex, clustering in the active bridge helix and loop, pore, and funnel, indicating involvement of the RNA cleavage domain of the C11 subunit in termination. Purified RNAP from readthrough mutants exhibited increased elongation rates, supporting a kinetic model where elongation rate is inversely related to termination efficiency. Mutants showed correlations of terminator in vitro and in vivo and increased transcription in vivo, synthesizing more RNA than wild-type cells due to increased elongation rates, not RNA decay or RNAP repressor M1 activity. Mobile elements of the RNAP active center, including C11, are key determinants of termination, and some mutations activate RNAP for overall transcription. Similar mutations in cancer suggest an unforeseen mechanisms of RNAP activation in disease. Results indicate RNAP III has two modes of termination, holoenzyme and RNAP-core, and terminator readthrough mutants synthesize more RNA per tRNA gene in vivo.
Researchers have developed a method to predict SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions using the structure of SH2-phosphope complexes and the FoldX algorithm, which performs similarly to experimentally derived sequences and substitution matrices in predicting known in vitro and in vivo targets of SH domains. The approach was validated using literature-derived SH2 interactions and a probabilistic scores from naive Bayes integration of coexpression, conservation, interaction in other species, shared partners, and functions. The method provides a set of high-confidence interactions for human SH2 domains with known structure, filtered secondary structure, and phosphorylation state. FoldX predicts in vitro binding thermodynamics of protein-phopeptide complexes and in vivo protein-protein interactions for nine SH2-containing proteins, showing its applicability for genome-wide predictions. The algorithm performs as well as experimentally derived sequences or position-specific matrices in predicting in vitro SH-phosphope binding and in vivo SH-mediated interactions. Combining information on phosphorylation and secondary structure, FoldX gives accurate predictions of novel protein interactions. The study proposes FoldX as an alternative to peptide experiments for predicting SH-mediated interactions, providing a resource for further testing and leading to new hypotheses on the role of SH domains in signaling.
The accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins is a hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders, with the aberrant accumulation of microtubule associating protein tau into toxic oligomers and amyloid deposits being a primary pathology in tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. Researchers have found that cyclophilin 40, a cis/trans peptidyl-prol isomerase, dissolves tau amyloids in vitro and ameliorates silver-positive and oligomeric tau species in a mouse model of tau accumulation, preserving neuronal health and cognition. Nuclear magnetic resonance revealed cyclophil 40 interacts with tau at sites rich in proline residues and can also interact with and disaggregate other aggregating proteins containing prolines. Cyclophil 40 lacking peptidyl-proly isomerase activity prevented its capacity for disaggregation in vitro. The study identifies cyclophil 40 as a novel protein disagase that can dissolve intracellular amyloids in an energy-independent manner. Overexpression of cyclophil 40 in tauopathic brain reduced tau oligomers and tangles, yielding improvements in neuronal health and preserved cognitive function, implicating cyclo 40 as a potential therapeutic intervention for tauopathies and amyloid disorders. Electron microscopy showed cyclo 40 altered morphology and reduced the size of tau fibrils. The distinct properties of cyclo 40 enable ATP-independent disaggregation, unique among other peidyl-proly isomerases.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study heterocyst differentiation in cyanobacteria filaments, a simple example of cellular differentiation in multicellular organisms. The model combines genetic circuit dynamics of single cyanobacteria with diffusion to simulate filament behavior under nitrogen deprivation. Results show that including diffusion and noise reproduces features of heterocyst pattern formation and sustainment observed experimentally. The model connects microscopic and macroscopic processes, shedding light on the gap between genetic circuit behavior and pattern formation. The study reveals noise plays a crucial role in onset of differentiation, enabling characteristic patterns over a range of parameters, indicating cyanobacteria's efficient response to environmental conditions. The approach uses systems biology framework, formulating genetic circuit dynamics into differential equations to describe molecular concentrations over time. The model simulates single cyanobacter behavior under external conditions and filaments by coupling genetic circuits via diffusion, capturing development and maintenance of heteroc patterns. Findings highlight the importance of noise and diffusion in heterocyst formation, providing insight into mechanisms of cell differentiation and pattern formation in multicellular organisms, with implications for understanding cyanobacteria's adaptation to natural environments.
A study in Cameroon explored the association between people's perceptions of the Community Directed Treatment with Ivermectin program and their adherence to ivermectin in three regions with high onchocercias prevalence. Adherence was comparable in two districts, Baf and Bafia, at 55% and 48%, and lower in Yassi at 40.7%. Perceptions of the program were the most determinant factor in adherence, with positive opinions of ivermect distribution and community distributors associated with higher adherence. Misconceptions about onchercis transmission were common, including lack of hygiene and high sugar consumption. Perceptions of ivermect distribution were more strongly associated with adherence than onchercis beliefs. Local authorities should involve communities and encourage distributors to improve adherence. Onchercis control relies on Community Directed Treatment with Iverect, a strategy adopted by African countries since 1995, consisting of yearly ivermect administration. Despite 15 years of treatment, onchis prevalence remains high in many areas. The study highlights the need for education and sensitization on on onchis and iver, and better implementation of the program with community ownership and good distribution.
Associations between epigenetic alterations and disease status have been identified for many diseases, however, there is no strong evidence epigen alterations are directly causal for disease pathogenesis. This study combined SNP and DNA methylation data with measurements of protein biomarkers for cancer, inflammation, or cardiovascular disease, to investigate the relative contribution of genetic and epigen variation on biomarker levels. A total of 121 protein biomarkers were measured and analyzed in relation to DNA methylation at 470,000 genomic positions and over 10 million SNPs. The epome-wide association study and genome-wide association analyses identified 124 and 45 loci with effect sizes up to 0.22 standard units change per 1% in DNA methylation and up to four units per copy of the allele. Most GWAS loci were cis-regulatory, whereas most EWAS loci were in trans. Eleven EWAS loci associated with multiple biomarkers, including NLRC5 with CXCL11, CX9, IL-12, and IL-18. All EW signals overlapped with GWAS were driven by underlying variants, three EW signals confounded by smoking. While cis-reg SNPs for biomarkers had an effect on DNA methylation, cis SNPs for methylation did not affect biomarker levels. Associations between protein and DNA methylation at numerous loci likely reflect underlying genetic variants, environmental exposures, or secondary effects of disease pathogenesis. The results indicate DNA methylation has a limited direct effect on biomarkers of complex diseases.
Varicella zoster virus (VZV) infects human natural killer (NK) cells and impairs their ability to respond to target cell stimulation, leading to a loss of cytotoxic and cytokine responses. Both VV-infected and VV-negative NK cells exposed to the virus in culture are affected, with impairment dependent on direct contact between NK cells and VV-infected cells. NK cell surface receptor expression remains stable, but cells are unable to release cytotoxic granules when stimulated through receptor-ligand interactions. VV inhibits degranulation and cytokine production, including IFN-γ and TNF, more strongly in VV-infected cells. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) also infects NK cells and renders them unresponsive to target stimulation but differentially targets cytokine production compared to VV. Experiments show NK function is blocked in infected and exposed cells co-cultured with cell-free VV, supporting a model of inhibition mediated by the virus. VV elicits a profound inhibition of NK cells, paralyzing their ability to functionally respond to target cells, with limited activation of NK cells in response to VV infected cells in vitro. Active and functionally-intact VV is required to mediate this effect. Co-culture with VV infected epithelial inoculum renders NK cells unresponsive, exhibiting abrogated cytokine production and degran, correlating with reduced target lysis, revealing a previously unreported strategy employed by VV to inhibit NK function.
Apparent motion is a visual phenomenon where two alternately presented stimuli at different locations evoke a percept of a continuously moving stimulus between the locations. The neural mechanism underlying apparent motion is thought to be increased activation of primary visual cortex neurons tuned to locations along the path, although evidence remains inconclusive. Apparent motion masking refers to reduced detectability of stimuli along the path and has been taken as evidence for apparent motion-related activation. However, masking can also be explained by predictive models predicting responses to stimuli on the path are suppressed when matching spatio-temporal prediction of a moving stimulus. The study found apparent motion has distinct effect on detection of gratings, limiting performance at high contrast levels, strongest when target orientation is identical to inducers. A population model of early visual processing based on standard contrast normalization found apparent motion-related activation too small to cause masking or perceived motion. Instead, the model predicts strong suppression of sensory responses during apparent motion, consistent with predictive coding framework. Orientation-tuned suppression in early visual cortex is major cause of masking, explained by higher-level predictions generated explaining away lower-level responses to expected input. Apparent motion evokes responses in subset of V1 cells, interfering with actual stimuli, impairing perception, but masking does not imply V1 activation. Predictive coding provides alternative, stimuli on path considered predictable when features match moving and appear at time consistent place, suppressing responses in early brain areas like V1 when predictable.
The HTLV-1 oncoprotein Tax plays a key role in CD4 T cell transformation by promoting proliferation and survival through activation of the NF-κB pathway. Research has elucidated the molecular mechanism of Tax-induced IKK activation, revealing Tax as a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase that catalyzes the assembly of mixed-link polyubiquitin chains with UbcH2, UH5, or Ubc7. These chains directly activate IKK by binding to the NEMO subunit of IK, utilizing minimal cellular ubiquination components for NF-κB activation. The biochemical function of Tax in IK activation clarifies confusion on HTLV-1-induced IK-NF-κB activation and reveals essential cellular factors hijacked by HTLV, shedding light on potential therapeutics for ATL and TSP/HAM. Tax-dependent IK-NF-κ activation induces cytokines such as TNF and IL1β, activating IK-NF-κ through autocrine and paracrine, complicating the dissection of signaling events. An in vitro reconstitution of IK activation captured primary events induced by Tax. HTLV1 Tax is the first pathogenic agent shown to activate NF-κ and studies have greatly advanced understanding of pathophysiological NF- activation. Despite extensive research, the molecular mechanism by which Tax activates IK-NF-κ is still unclear. The biochemical function of Tax utilizes minimal ubiquination components for NF-κ activation.
A systematic review of the relationship between propagule pressure and establishment success in alien species introductions was conducted using Bayesian meta-analytical methods. The study evaluated the effect of propagule pressure on establishment across various taxa and life histories, including invertebrates, herbaceous plants, long-lived trees, and terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates. Results showed a positive effect of propagule pressure on establishment, with success most dependent on propagule pressures of 10-100 individuals. Heterogeneity in effect size was associated with analytical approaches, with larger effects in animal introductions than plant introductions. No variation was accounted for by study scale or methodology. The relationship between propagule pressure and establishment was consistent across studies. Propagule pressure was found to be a key determinant of alien species establishment, with species and location-level factors also influencing success. Proxies for propagule pressure were used due to challenges in measuring real-world introductions. Overall, the study revealed a consistent relationship between propagule pressure and alien population success, with propagule pressure of 10-100 individuals being critical for establishment.
Interleukin 17 (IL-17) attenuates the degradation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) by altering the cooperation between AU-binding proteins (AUB) and microRNA16 (miR16), leading to enhanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators. The decay of many mRNAs depends on AUB that target AU-rich elements in the 3'-translated region, facilitating mRNA decay or stabilization. IL-17 reduces mi16 expression, promoting the binding of stabilizing AUB over destabilizing AUB and reducing mRNA decay. The interactions between AUB, mi16, and target mRNA depend on specific sequences and structural restraints, with IL-17 exerting its function by changing mi16 and AUB contributions. IL-17, in combination with TNFα, attenuates degradation of mAs encoding inflammatory mediators in epithelial and fibroblast cells, resulting in hyper-production of pro-inflammatory mediators. The degradation of mAs encoding IL-8, IL-6, and G-CS is directed by the mRNA decay pathway, depending on AUB and mi16. Modulation of AUB-mi16 regulation by IL17 depends on specific mRNA, limiting mi16 usage, and differential AUB participation. IL17 inhibits mi16 expression and promotes AUF1 binding, stabilizing IL8 mRNA, with similar findings for other ARE-containing mAs. Inhibition of mi16 results in attenuated mRNA degradation, while enhancing mi16 promotes degradation.
A study in Uganda examined the relationship between human Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma rhodesiense infection in cattle and human sleeping sickness in villages. The research found a significant association between high levels of T. brucei in a village herd and the likelihood of detecting T. rhodesense, with higher odds of infection in case villages than non-case villages. Cattle age also affected the likelihood of T. bruce infection, with those between 18-36 months and over 36 months having higher odds than those under 18 months. Village sleeping status had a significant effect on T. rhodesense detection, with higher likelihood in case villages. A high average T. bruce prevalence over 16% in a herd was associated with higher likelihood of T. rhense detection. The study suggests using village-level T. bruce prevalence as an indicator of risk in endemic districts. The ratio of T. rhense to T. bruce in cattle was relatively stable at 1:33. The low prevalence of human-infective T. rhense in Kaberido and Dokolo may be due to its recent introduction to these areas. The findings provide a means to determine risk at village level and permit appraisal of disease spread to neighboring districts.
The NSL complex, containing the histone H4 lysine 16 acetyltransferase MOF, regulates housekeeping genes in Drosophila. A comprehensive ChIP-seq analysis of four NSL complex members revealed that 85.5% of NSL-bound genes are constitutively expressed across cell types, characterized by increased histone modifications H4K16ac, H3K4me2, H3K4me, and H3K9 in promoter regions, a well-defined nucleosome free region, and broad transcription initiation patterns. The NSL complex is required for efficient recruitment of RNA polymerase II to target promoters, with reduced binding of TBP and TFIIB upon NSL knockdown. Genes with the most dramatic loss of Pol II upon NSL knockdown are enriched in DNA replication-related elements. The NSL complex preferentially targets constitutively expressed genes, also referred to as housekeeping genes, with elevated levels of H3K4me2/3, H3K9 and H4ac, and a distinctive arrangement of nucleosome free region and dispersed transcription patterns. A core set of 2,841 genes are bound by all four NSL subunits, suggesting the NS proteins operate as a single complex to regulate large numbers of genes in the Drosila genome. The NSL complex is conserved from Drosila to mammals, and unraveling its mechanism of action is crucial for understanding transcriptional regulation in higher eukaryotes and its evolutionary plasticity, acting as a major regulator of housekeeping genes by modulating Pol II transcription initiation.
Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FD) is a progressive muscular dystrophy caused by decreased epigenetic repression of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeats and ectopic expression of DUX, a retrogene encoding germline transcription factor. Researchers generated transgenic mice carrying DZ4 arrays from an FSH1 allele and a control allele, which recapitulate epigenetic and DUX expression seen in patients and controls. The mice exhibit high DUX expression in germl, incomplete epigen repression in somatic tissue, and FSH-specific varieg D4 expression in sporadic muscle associated with DZ4 chromatin relaxation. DUX activates similar functional gene groups in mouse cells as in human cells. The study suggests somatic epigen silencing of D4 is evolutionary conserved and contracted D4Z repeat arrays are silenced less efficiently, leading to varieg expression of DUX in skeletal muscle. ChIP and DNA methylation analyses indicate chromatin relaxation of D4 repeats, concord with observed DUX expression, modeling differences between FSH patients and controls. The model may serve therapeutic studies targeting DUX expression, as RNA interference reversed detrimental effects in muscle. FSH specific somatic derepression of D4 is associated with D4 chromatin changes, characterized by decreased methylation and lower Ch. The pattern of DUX expression is a locus-intrinsic property of the D4 repeat array, conserved between mouse and human.
Researchers investigated the malaria vaccine candidate Apical Membrane Antigen-1 (AMA1) to overcome its limited protection against closely related parasite strains. A vaccine containing diverse allelic proteins, AMA1 Quax or Q, elicited polyclonal antibodies that inhibited invasion of vaccine and non-vaccine strains of P. falciparum. Comparison with a strain-specific monovalent 3D7 AMA vaccine revealed Q induced higher levels of broadly inhibitory antibodies associated with conserved face and domain-3 responses. Inhibitory monoclonal antibodies raised against Q reacted with a novel cross-reactive epitope at the rim of the hydrophobic trough domain-1, which mapped to the conserved face of AMA1 and encompassed the 1-loop. These antibodies were more potent than previously characterized AMA-inhibitory mAbs and inhibited AMA binding to its ligand RON. Another novel antibody, 1E10, bound domain-3, was broadly inhibitory and blocked proteolytic processing of AMA1, and synergized with a characterized strain-transcending mAb. The study identified novel susceptible regions and epitopes that can improve antigen breadth and inhibitory response of AMA vaccines, suggesting vaccination with diverse proteins could provide universal coverage by redirecting the immune response towards conserved epitopes.
Researchers have identified a cellular mechanism that times the displacement of the mitotic spindle in asymmetric cell division, a crucial process for unequal cell division. The anaphase-promoting complex, its activator Cdc20, and cyclin-dependent kinase comprise a previously unrecognized timer for spindle displacement. In the Caenorhabditis elegans zygote, mitotic spindle displacement begins at a precise time after chromosomes congress to metaphase. Reducing function of the proteome, APC, or Cdc20 delayed spindle displacement, while inactivating CDK in prometase caused early displacement. Unlinking spindle displacement from this mechanism resulted in premature displacement of incompletely assembled components. The APC inactivates CD, delaying spindle movement until fully assembled. This link between cell cycle and asymmetric division may be evolutionarily conserved as mitotic spindle is displaced at similar stages in diverse systems. Quantitative measurements and genetic techniques showed delays in anaphase and spindle were rescued. The proteome and APC time spindle through inactivating CD. CD activity affects displacement and anaph timing independently. Negative regulation of CD serves as a timer for mitotic displacement, resulting in a 60-90s delay allowing spindle assembly before cortical forces pull it away. The APC-dependent regulation of CD serves a role as a timer for spindle displacement and mitotic progression.
Researchers conducted a genome scan to identify genes showing evidence of adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia in Tibetan and Andean populations, who have lived at high altitudes for millennia and exhibit unique circulatory, respiratory, and hematological adaptations. Using four population genetic statistics, they identified selection-nominated genes and regions, finding distinct patterns of adaptation between the two populations, with positive selection in different genes or regions. The EGLN1 gene, important in cellular oxygen sensing, showed evidence of selection in both populations but with differing variation patterns. Key HIF-regulatory and targeted genes are responsible for high-altitude adaptation, with several chromosomal regions implicated in putative response. The study aimed to characterize genetic mechanisms for adaptation to high-altitude hypoxia, contributing to understanding genetic and evolutionary architecture and phenotypic diversity. Candidate genes were identified based on signatures of positive selection in Andeans and Tibetans, with further research needed to elucidate genotype-phenotype relationships, particularly for the EPAS1 gene. Genome scans identified candidate regions with unknown physiological functions and targeted genes in biochemical pathways, including HIF, RAS, and globin family. The findings indicate a genetic role in high-altitude adaptation, providing a basis for future studies to confirm selection-nominated genes and regions.
Double-strand breaks in DNA can result from environmental or cellular interactions and are a major source of genetic instability, making efficient repair crucial for cell survival. The choice of repair pathway is important as some result in mutations and chromosomal rearrangements while others do not. Inverted repeats near a break can channel repair from accurate gene conversion to break-induced replication, leading to genetic instabilities. These repeats form unusual DNA structures when single-strand DNA is formed, including intermolecular single-strand annealing and fold-back structures, depending on the length of the spacer separating repeats. Long spacers lead to intermolecular single-strand annealing and formation of dimers, while short spacers lead to intramolecular single-strand annealing and fold-back structures, both interfering with accurate repair. Different protein complexes process these structures, with MRX-S2 for short loops and Rad1-Rad10 for long loops. The presence of inverted repeats promotes repair via break-induced replication and decreases gene conversion, leading to genomic destabilization. Inverted repeats are abundant in the human genome and understanding their role may contribute to understanding IR-mediated genomic destabilization associated with disease. The study uncovers the mechanisms of genomic destabilization resulting from rerouting repair into unusual pathways by inverted repeats, highlighting the importance of the choice of repair pathway in maintaining genomic integrity.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen capable of causing acute and chronic infections in susceptible hosts, with chronic infections thought to be caused by bacterial biofilms. Researchers developed an animal model using Drosophila melanaster to study P. aeruginosa biofilm infections in vivo. At 24 hours post-infection, P. aerosa biofilms localized and were visualized in Drosila crops with characteristic structure and extracellular matrix composed of DNA and exopolysaccharide. P. aerosa cells from in vivo biofilms showed increased antibiotic resistance relative to planktonic cells. Biofilm formation was dependent on expression of exopolysaccharide genes, as a pel::lux mutant failed to form biofilms. The pel::lux mutant was more virulent than PA1 while a hyperfilm strain demonstrated less virulence. Biofilm formation by PA1 and PAZ3 in the crop associated with induction of antimicrobial peptide expression. Infection with non-bio forming pel::lux resulted in decreased antimicrobial gene expression. Results provide insights into host-pathogen interactions during P. aerosa oral infection and highlight Drosila as a model for studying P.osa biofilms in vivo. Primary infection with AMP-inducing strains altered Drosila survival from secondary infection with virulent pel::lux. The model enables studying bacterial and host response during P. aerosa biofilm infections, which account for 65 of bacterial infections.
Researchers investigated the contribution of proximal 5′ flanking sequence and microsatellite variation to brain vasopressin 1 receptor (Avpr1) gene expression and behavior, focusing on the genomic mechanisms underlying differences in expression patterns within and between species. Using homologous recombination in mice, they found that proximal 5′ flanking sequences modestly contribute to species differences in V1 receptor distribution and impact stress-coping behavior. The vole Av1 microsat structure contributes to Av1 expression in the amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus, mirroring inter- and intra-species differences in central V1R patterns. This study provides direct evidence that polymorphic microsatellite elements near behaviorally relevant genes contribute to diversity in brain expression, generating behavioral diversity at individual and species levels. Replacement of the 5′ flanking region contributes to differences in V1R levels in thalam, amygd, ventral pallid, and hippocampus. Transgenic mice with the prairie Av1 locus display V1 binding patterns similar to prairie voles, leading to increased affiliative behavior in response to AVP. Diversity in Av1 expression contributes to inter and intra-species variability in AVP behaviors, making Av1 a model for exploring genomic mechanisms of brain expression and behavior. The findings suggest species-specific patterns are mediated by elements outside the immediate 5′ flanking region, and unstable polymorphic elements may enhance evolvability by increasing gene expression diversity.
Researchers investigated the mechanisms of genome instability mediated by RNA biogenesis impairment and Activation-Induced Cytidine Deaminase (AID) using a yeast system based on mammalian immunoglobulin switch regions and c-MYC sequences. ID induces double-strand breaks at these regions, leading to chromosomal translocations via Non-Homologous End Joining. ID-induced translocations were enhanced in THO mutants, which are impaired in RNA biogenesis, consistent with the idea that ID-mediated breaks depend on R-loop formation. The study shows uracil residues produced by ID-mediated deamination are processed into double-strand breaks and chromosomal rearrangements by conserved DNA repair functions from yeast to human cells. ID induces double-strand breaks in immunoglobulin regions and c-MYC sequences in yeast THO mutants, which are then repaired by Non-Homolog End Join. The c-MYC oncogene acts as a hotspot of recombination in THO mutants. The yeast system provides a validated assay to study mechanisms mediated by ID leading to breaks at regions and the c-MYC oncogene, such as those in B cells for class switching or Ig/myc translocations associated with Burkitt lymphomas. ID-mediated deamination of cytosines is channeled into doublestrands by Ung1 activity as in mammalian cells, then repaired by Nonhomolog Join. The results show yeast and mammalian cells have factors to channel ID-mediated DNA lesions into doublestrands for genome rearrangements and class switch recombination.
Researchers investigated how Escherichia coli cells with asymmetrically placed division planes partition their chromosomes, finding that the protein FtsK can pump up to 80% of the chromosome, approximately 3.7 Mb of DNA, between daughter cells at an average rate of 170±800 bp/s. The majority of DNA movement occurs at late stages of cell division when the division protein ZipA has dissociated from the septum and the septum has closed to a narrow channel with a diameter smaller than 250 nm. The constriction is necessary for effective translocation of DNA by Fts, with pauses in DNA translocation being rare and reversals not observed at experimental time scales of a few minutes. The average translocation speed is consistent with fully replicated chromosomes being present at the time of translocation, with values close to 210±900 bp/s. FtsK can move up to 3.7 Mb of the complete chromosome in conditions where the division plane is misplaced, compared to 400 kb near the replication terminus region in wild-type cells. The study demonstrates E. coli cells can reposition their chromosomes when the division plane is not localized, with DNA within the constriction realizing a cell-cycle checkpoint preventing daughter separation.
Researchers have developed a mathematical framework using integer linear programming to select an optimal set of peptides for epitope-based vaccines, which have applications in therapeutic and prophylactic approaches for infectious diseases and cancer. The framework identifies the set of epitopes with the maximum likelihood of eliciting a broad and potent immune response from a user-defined set of predicted or experimentally determined epitopes. It allows for the formulation of various vaccine design problems and incorporation of immunological requirements, such as coverage of epitopes from each antigen and avoidance of epitopes with high mutation rates, into constraints or modifications of the objective function. The approach outperforms simple and previously suggested algorithms, with runtimes on the order of seconds for typical problem sizes. The goal is to maximize overall immunogenicity while constraining solutions to sets of peptides that satisfy requirements for a good vaccine, formulated as an integer program with integral unknowns. This framework yields a combination of epitopes that is provably optimal for a chosen definition of a good vaccine, providing flexibility to work with various definitions of the term 'good vaccine'.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-7 (IL-7) in HIV-1 transmission to cervico-vaginal tissue in an ex vivo system, simulating in vivo conditions by depositing HIV-1 on cervico-vinal tissue with IL-7 concentrations comparable to those in semen of HIV-1-infected individuals. Results showed IL-7 significantly enhanced virus replication in infected cervico-vaginal tissue and lymphoid explants. Analysis revealed IL7 reduced CD4+ T cell depletion, preventing apoptosis, and increased the fraction of cycling CD4+ cells. High IL7 levels in semen may be relevant to the survival of the founder pool of HIV-1-infected cells in the cervico-vaginal mucosa at the initial stage of infection, promoting local expansion and dissemination of infection. Exposure to IL7 concentrations comparable to those in semen of HIV1-infected individuals facilitated HIV1 infection in cervico-vaginal and lymphoid tissues. IL7 increased the number of HIV1-infected CD4 T cells and enhanced HIV1 replication in human cervico-vag tissues, supporting productive infection of R5 rather than X4 HIV variants. Data suggest high IL7 in semen may render the female genital mucosa more susceptible to HIV acquisition, increasing the number of HIV1-infected CD4 cells 4.1 and 7 fold on day 9 post-infection.
Characterization of the Zika virus-induced small RNA response in Aedes aegypti cells reveals that RNA interference controls arbovirus infections through two pathways: PIWI-interacting RNA and exogenous interfering RNA. The ex-siRNA pathway is the key antiviral mechanism, producing virus-derived small RNAs of 21 nucleotides. In Aedes aegypti-derived cells, Zika-specific siRNAs were loaded into the ex-sRNA effector protein Argonaute 2, but knockdown of Ago2 did not enhance virus replication. Enhanced Zika replication was observed in Dcr-knockout cell line, indicating the ex-sRNA pathway's antiviral role. Although Zika-specific piRNA-sized smallAs were detected, they lacked the characteristic piRNA ping-pong signature and bound to Ago3, not Piwi or Pi6. Silencing of PI proteins showed that knockdown of Ago, Pi5, or Pi6 did not enhance Zika replication, only Pi4 displayed antiviral activity. Zika capsid protein amplified the replication of a reporter alphavirus, unlike yellow fever protein, it does not inhibit the ex-sRNA pathway. The findings elucidate Zika-mosquito RNA interactions important for understanding its spread. Zika induces production of both siRNAs and piAs in Aedes aegypti cells, although piAs lack the expected signature. Increased replication in Dcr knockout lines indicates the antiviral role of the exRNA pathway. The study demonstrates Zika interactions with RNA response in Aedes aegypti cells, providing insights into its transmission.
A study in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, identified Sporothrix species associated with clinical manifestations of sporotrichosis, analyzing 50 patient isolates using phenotypic and genotypic methods. Results showed distinct clinical and therapeutic responses between Sporothrix brasiliensis (n=45) and S. schenii sensu stricto (n=5) infections. S. brasiliensis was linked to disseminated cutaneous infection, hypersensitivity reactions, and mucosal infection, while S. schenii presented less severe and localized disease. Patients with S. brasiliensis required shorter treatment durations of itraconazole (median 16 weeks) compared to S. schii (median 24 weeks). The findings suggest Sporothrix species are linked to different clinical manifestations of sporotosis, with S. brasili effectively treated with oral itraconazole. The majority of isolates were identified as S. schii, but S. brasili caused typical forms of sporotosis, including lymphocutaneous and fixed cutaneous. However, all patients with hypersensitivity reactions and most with disseminated disease were infected with S. brasili. The study demonstrates an association between genic identification of Sporoth species and clinical aspects of human sporotosis, supporting careful speciation of Sporoth isolates to guide clinical care. The results provide new information on S. brasili disease and its clinical implications, particularly in Rio de Janeiro where S. brasili is more frequent than other Sporothrix species, unlike other Brazilian states where S. schii predominates.
Researchers analyzed RNA sequencing data from human and mouse tissues to assess the quantity and composition of transcripts, finding that most "dark matter" transcripts are associated with known genes. RNA-Seq identified fewer transcribed regions outside exons and non-coding RNAs compared to tiling arrays, with most non-exonic regions being introns, possibly fragments of pre-mRNAs. The majority of intergenic regions in RNA-Seq data are near known genes, consistent with alternative cleavage and polyadenylation, promoter-associated transcripts, or new exons. Reads identified 4,544 new exons affecting 3,554 genes. Remaining transcripts correspond to low-level background or small transcripts with sequence conservation from open chromatin regions. The majority of intergenic and intronic regions have low sequence coverage, with 70-80% detected by a single RNA-Seq read. Tiling arrays are ill-suited to detect low-level transcripts, and non-exonic transcripts in RNA-Seq are associated with genes, including new exons and promoters. Genome-wide analysis revealed 2,789 uncharacterized transcript fragments, with 1,259 in intergenic regions, consisting of coding and noncoding transcripts. Few transcripts were found in intergenic regions, 16,268 in human and 11,533 in mouse, contrasting extensive intergenic transcription reported in tiling studies, indicating the genome is not as pervasively transcribed as previously reported.
Researchers have developed a combined computational and experimental method to increase the thermostability of the flavin monucleotide-based fluorescent protein Bacillus subtilis YtvA LOV domain by 31°C. The method involves five steps: single mutant screening to identify thermostable candidates, experimental evaluation, redesign around thermostable regions, reevaluation, and multiple mutations combination. This approach provides a new tool to improve protein thermostability, particularly useful when conventional methods fail. The engineered Ytv LOV domain, named Flavin monucleotide Fluorescent Protein, has moderate thermostability, but a more thermostable version is desired for studying anaerobic microorganisms, especially thermophilic ones. Eight thermost sites were identified, with five at the dimer interface, suggesting stronger interactions between subunits increases thermostability. Mutant V120 has the highest thermostability at 54.2°C. About a dozen mutants have higher thermostability than the wild type, providing opportunities to improve further by combining mutations, considering melting temperature difference and distance between mutants. The success rate of 62% highlights the effectiveness of computational screening. This method can be applied to other proteins where conventional methods have difficulties, offering enormous potential for developing novel bioreagents.
Researchers investigated the diversity of sand fly species in the genus Lutzomyia and their infection rates by Leishmania and Wolbachia on Barro Island, Panama, where cutaneous leishmaniasis is a continuous health threat. Using DNA sequencing, they identified 20 sand fly species, including two possible "cryptic" species, and detected Leishmania DNA in 43.3% of Lu. trapido and 26.3% of Lu. gzi individuals. The Leishmania sequence was 93% similar to Le. naiff, a species previously unknown in Panama but recognized as a vector of cutaneous leishiasis in northern and central America. Distinct strains of Wolbach were detected in three sand fly species, including Lu. trapi, which frequently co-occurred with Leish. Two species, Lu. trap and Lu. gzi, were found to carry Leish at high frequency and are likely vectors of leishias to humans or mammals. Le. naif, known to cause cutaneous lesions in South America, has not been reported in Panama, suggesting a possible range expansion or introduction. The presence of Leish and Wolbach in Lu. trap identifies it as a target for gene introductions using Wolbach population control.
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation in dendritic cells is dependent on the mitogen and stress kinase (MS) family, which cooperates with CREB to induce immediate-early gene expression from latency. CRE binding to the major immediate promoter provides a target for MS recruitment, and MS-mediated phosphorylation of histone H3 is necessary for histone demethylation and viral reactivation. The interaction between CRE and MS is crucial for chromatin remodeling at the major immediate promoter, allowing viral gene expression. Inhibition of this interaction could provide a therapeutic strategy for intervention. MS binding to the major promoter prior to reactivation supports this conclusion, and MS chemical inhibition shows that reactivation involves histone phosphorylation at the latent major promoter, dependent on CRE binding. The regulation of the major promoter during CMV latency demonstrates a functional interaction between MS and CRE, controlling gene expression of a clinically important pathogen. Histone phosphorylation is associated with rapid response genes, promoting hyperacetylation in a MAP and MS-dependent manner, influencing CMV reactivation if the major promoter is subject to the same regulation. The study highlights the importance of CRE in CMV reactivation, promoting chromatin modifications and acting as a transcription factor, and suggests targeting the CRE-MS interaction as a potential therapeutic approach.
Researchers have identified a critical function for the ribosome biogenesis factor NOL11 in vertebrate ribosome biogenesis and craniofacial development. N11 is strongly expressed in the developing cranial neural crest of amphibians and mammals. Knockdown of Xenopus n11 results in impaired pre-rRNA transcription and processing, increased apoptosis, and abnormal development of cranial cartilages. Inhibition of p53 rescues the skeletal phenotype but not the underlying ribosome biogenesis defect, demonstrating an evolutionarily conserved mechanism through which ribosome-impaired cranial cells are removed. Excessive activation of this mechanism impairs craniofacial development. N11 is required for optimal pre-rRNA transcription and preRNA processing in Xenopus, and n11 knockdown results in activation of the nucleolar stress, p53 stabilization, and a craniofacial phenotype. N11 expression is tightly linked to cells where it is required for normal differentiation and development of cranial cartilages. Co-depletion of p53 and N11 did not rescue preRNA transcription although a partial rescue of cranial phenotype was observed. The findings reveal a novel requirement for N11 in cranial development and provide insight into the relationship between ribosome biogenesis and cranial cell survival, presenting the first frog model of a ribosopathy.
Researchers utilized a high-density protein microarray approach to identify seroreactive proteins of Leptospira interrogans serovar Copenhageni, a causative agent of leptospirosis, a widespread zoonotic disease. A protein chip comprising 61% of the proteome was constructed and the IgG response from 274 individuals, including acute and convalescent patients and healthy controls, was investigated. Sixteen antigens were found to discriminate between acute cases and healthy individuals from high transmission regions and 18 antigens distinguished convalescent cases. Known antigens such as LipL32, Lig and GroEL were identified, validating the serodiagnostic approach. Novel antigens, including hypothetical protein LIC102, showed sensitivity and specificity for acute and convalescent patients. This large-scale evaluation of immunodominant antigens associated with naturally acquired leptiral infection identified serodiagnostic antigens recognized by patient sera. The identified antigens have potential in developing new tests and improving available assays for diagnosing leptosrosis. Further research is needed to assess their utility in deployable platforms. A proteomic feature analysis for antibody recognition of leptiral antigens will be conducted using the full proteome and diverse specimen collections to characterize the antibody repertoire against different species and serovars. The study probed over 250 human samples against a partial proteome microarray containing 2,421 proteins from Leptira serov Copenhagen strain L130. The identified antigens may improve the accuracy of rapid tests in resource-limited settings.
Researchers investigated the role of melanization in mosquito defense against the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana using Anopheles gambia as a model. Melanization formed on all fungal stages except single hyphal bodies, but rarely aborted growth and mycelium continued growing despite being melanized. Silencing key regulators TEP1 and CLIPA abolished melanin formation on hypha but not germinating conidia or tubes. A layer of hemocytes surrounded germinating conidia, suggesting cell-mediated melanization of early stages and humoral response of late stages dependent on TEP1 and CL8. Microscopic analysis revealed TEP association with hypha surfaces and requirement of TEP and CL8 for recruiting phenoloxidase. Fungal proliferation was rapid in TEP and CL8 knockdown mosquitoes, increasing sensitivity to B. bassiana infections. Melanization retards B. bass growth and dissemination, a finding that may be exploited to design transgenic fungi for bio-control against mosquitoes. In A. gambia, melanization is dispensable for defense against bacterial and Plasmodium infections, but plays a role in anti-fungal defense. The study provides insight into mosquito immune response to entopathogenic fungi, which remains poorly understood despite their ubiquity and unique invasion route bypassing midgut epithelium.
Researchers investigated the ability of four compounds, bafilomycin, mycopholic acid, castanospermine, and deoxojirimycin, to block Dengue virus infection in Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. Injection of bafilomycin and myopholic acid prior to feeding on virus-infected blood inhibited Dengue virus titers in the midgut by 56% and 60% and in the salivary gland by 90 and 83% respectively. Treatment with castanosmine and deoxirim did not affect susceptibility to the virus. RNA-mediated silencing of vacuolar H+-ATPase and inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase genes resulted in reduced Dengue infection, indicating that bafilomycin and myopholic acid-mediated inhibition occurred through these host factors. The route and timing of administration was essential, with treatment after exposure diminishing the antiviral effect. The study provides proof-of-principle that chemical inhibition or RNA-mediated depletion of these host factors can suppress Dengue infection in adult Aedes aegypti, potentially reducing transmission. Bafilomycin inhibits viral entry by binding to the multiunit vacolar H+-Pase complex, while myopholic acid targets inos-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, a known to be involved in viral replication. Silencing of vacolar H+-P subunit negatively affected mosquito fitness, decreasing lifespan from 17 days post injection onwards. These findings suggest that vacolar H+-Pase and inos-5-monophosphate dehydrogenase are potent targets for blocking Dengue transmission.
Researchers investigated the role of cell volume in the dynamics of seizure, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization, incorporating cell swelling with dynamic ion concentrations and oxygen supply into Hodgkin-Huxley type spiking dynamics. The study demonstrated the spontaneous transition between epileptic seizure and spreading depression states as the cell swells in response to changes in osmotic pressure. The use of volume as a parameter revealed a dynamical definition for the experimentally described ceiling separating seizure from spreading depression and predicted a second ceiling demarcating spreading from anoxic depolarization. The model highlights the neuroprotective role of glial buffering against seizures and spreading depression, providing insights into anoxic depolarization and cell swelling during ischemia. The dynamics of seizures, spreading depression, and anoxic depolarization lie along a continuum of the neuron understood when ion concentrations, homeostasis, and cell response to osmotic pressure are considered. The results demonstrate a unified framework for a range of neuronal behaviors, potentially substantial in understanding and developing strategies for pathological states. Cell swelling occurs in various pathologies, including trauma, ischemia, hypoxia, seizures, and depression, with changes in osmolality affecting susceptibility to epileptiform activity and electrical signals. The study accounted for neuronal behaviors as a function of extracellular potassium and oxygen supply, revealing the role of volume as a bifurcation parameter in understanding human brain response to osmotic-induced states and controlling conditions.
Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the etiologic agent of paracoccidiomycosis, a prevalent systemic mycosis in Latin America. The pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β, derived from the activation of the cytoplasmic multiprotein inflammas, is essential against opportunistic fungal infections, but its role in P. brasiliensis infection is not well understood. Murine bone-derived dendritic cells responded to P. brasiliensis yeast infection by releasing IL-1β in a spleen tyrosine kinase, casase-1, and NOD receptor family NLR3 dependent manner. P. brasiliensis-induced NLR3 inflmas activation was dependent on potassium efflux, reactive oxygen production, phagysosomal acidification, and catheps B release. Mice lacking IL-1 receptor demonstrated IL-β has a role in killing P. brasensis by murine macrophages. The NLR3 inflamome senses and responds to P. brasensis yeast infection, playing a role in host defense against the fungus. IL-1 production by P. brasensis is dependent on NLR3 and caspase1 in dendritic cells. Notably, IL-1 signaling via IL1R and NLR3 components are essential for defense against fungal infections. IL-1 production in response to P. brasensis requires NLR3 inflam activation of casp1. IL-1 mediated signaling activates macroage fungicidal activity.
Toxoplasma gondii, a common brain-tropic parasite, primarily infects neurons in vivo, despite being capable of infecting most nucleated cells, including astrocytes and neurons in vitro. Research suggests that neurons are persistently infected because they lack the ability to clear intracellular parasites, while interferon-γ-stimulated astrocytes can clear them. A novel Toxoplas-mouse model was used to track host cells interacting with parasites, revealing a strong predilection for Toxma to interact with neurons throughout CNS infection. This predilection remains in the setting of IFNγ depletion, infection with parasites resistant to the mechanism by which murine astrocytes clear parasites, or when directly injecting parasites into the brain. Findings indicate that neurons are not incidentally infected but are Toxma's primary in vivo target. Toxma shows a strong predilection for interacting with neurons throughout CNS infection, with neurons consistently making up the majority of GFP+ parenchymal cells regardless of time or infecting strain. Understanding host-pathogen dynamics will provide opportunities to develop therapies to eliminate persistent pathogens. Toxma is estimated to chronically infect the central nervous system of up to 1/3 of the world's population.
A minimal model of motile cell behavior explains the shapes and movements of cells undergoing lamellipodial motility through actin-myosin contractility, consisting of force-balance and myosin transport equations. The model accounts for isotropic contraction proportional myosin density, viscous stresses in the actin network, and constant-strength viscous adhesion. Contraction generates spatially graded centripetal actin flow, reinforcing contraction via myos redistribution and retraction of the lamipodial boundary, countered by actin protrusion at the boundary. The balance of protrusion and retraction shapes the lamipodium. Initiation of motility depends on dimensionless parameter combinations representing myos-dependent contractility, viscosity-adhesion length, and rate of actin protrusion. Strong contractility leads to symmetry breaking and steady movement along straight or circular trajectories, sensitive to conditions at the cell boundary. Scanning the model space shows contractile motility supports cell turning with short viscosity-adhesion lengths and fast protrusion causing accumulation of myosin at the rear, destabilizing axial symmetry. The mechanical state of the cell depends on three dimensionless parameters: myos contractility, viscosity-adhesion length, and actin growth. Above a contractility threshold, cells become motile with myin concentrated in a band at the rear for unidirectional movement or spreading along the boundary with negative curvature for fast movement.
Understanding protein-protein interactions is a significant challenge in the post-genomic era, with high-throughput methods generating vast amounts of data but also introducing noise and incompleteness. Experimental techniques like yeast-2-hybrid and tandem purification have high false positive and negative rates, up to 64% and 43-71%, respectively. A novel technique is presented to assess interaction confidence in protein-protein interaction networks using geometric graphs, achieving 85% specificity and 90% sensitivity. This approach assigns confidence scores to physical-protein interactions in the human PPI network and predicts 251 interactions, with a significant fraction corresponding to protein pairs sharing common terms, validated in the HPR database and BioGRID. The geometric model detects false positives and negatives without requiring multiple datasets or prior protein information, outperforming better than existing techniques in the largest network component. Advances in high-throughput techniques produce growing experimental data but with high false positives and negatives, emphasizing the need for noise reduction and confidence assessment. The presented method uses only network topology for detecting false positives and predicting novel interactions, providing a valuable tool for guiding future experiments.
Researchers have established a Drosophila model for myotonic dystrophy type 1, a neurological disease caused by non-coding CTG repeat expansions, to investigate the role of interactions between expanded CTG and CAG transcripts. Co-expressing CTG with CAG repeats led to enhanced toxicity, novel pathogenesis, and generation of dcr-2 and ago2-dependent 21nt triplet-derived siRNAs. These small RNAs targeted CAG-containing genes, such as Ataxin-2 and TATA binding protein, which have long CAG repeats in both flies and humans. Noncoding CTG repeats confer length-dependent toxicity in brain and muscle in flies, forming RNA accumulations and affecting alternative splicing, recapitulating key features of human CT expansion disease. Coexpressing CTG and CAG disease transcripts resulted in dramatically enhanced toxicity and generation of triplet-derived siAs. Trinucleotide expansions within noncoding regions cause pathogenesis in several human diseases, including myotonic dystrophy, fragile X-associated tremor ataxia, spinocerebellar ataxia, and Huntington's disease-like 2. Anti-sense transcription occurs in approximately 70% of genes, suggesting a potential role in trinucleotide repeat diseases. The findings indicate generation of triplet-derived siAs may enhance toxicity in human expansion diseases with anti-sense transcription, providing insight into disease pathogenesis.
Soft rot is a devastating bacterial disease affecting plants worldwide, and Pectacterium sp. SCC319, isolated from a diseased potato in Finland in the 1980s, has been a model in soft rot research. Genomic approaches revealed SCC319, previously classified as Pectacterium carotovorum, is more accurately Pectacterium wasiae. Revised phylogeny indicates P. wasiae has been present in potato fields worldwide. Combination of genomic and in planta experiments identified features separating SCC319 and P. wasiae from other soft bacteria, including absence of type III secretion system. Experimentally established virulence determinants include transcription regulator SirB, type VI secretion systems, and horizontally acquired clusters Vic1 and Vic2 with predicted virulence genes. Genome comparison revealed traits like benzoic acid/salicylic carbox methyltransferase of eukaryotic origin. Findings indicate soft bacteria have a reservoir of traits utilized in the latent stage. Genomic comparison of SCC3 to sequenced Pectacter strains provides a basis for investigation of virulence, distribution, and phylogeny of soft bacteria. P wasiae has unique features compared to Pectacter strains likely acquired via horizontal gene transfer. Absence of T3 and T effectors is distinctive separating P wasiae from soft bacteria and pathogens. Extensive phylogen analysis reveals SCC3 belongs to P wasiae species.
Mitochondrial protein composition changes in response to cellular states, including those caused by mitochondrial DNA depletion, are related to various human diseases. Researchers investigated alterations in mitochondrial protein expression in cells with depleted mitochondrial DNA using network analysis of quantified proteomics data. Modularizing proteomics data into functional networks revealed two predominant subnetworks of upregulated and downregulated proteins with distinct biological processes. Downregulated proteins were involved in typical mitochondrial functions such as energy production and metabolism, while upregulated proteins were responsible for mitochondrial DNA repair and regulation. Comparing proteome and transcriptome data showed cells attempted to compensate for DNA depletion by modulating protein expression and transport. Results demonstrate protein composition changes remodels mitochondrial networks in response to dysfunction. Analysis elucidated biological implications of regulatory mechanisms under dysfunctional states, providing a framework for understanding cellular responses to mitochondrial dysfunctions. Mitochondrial dysfunction, caused by DNA damage, is linked to diseases and aging, and apoptosis. A data-integrative approach selected reliable proteins for network analysis, applying isotope-coded affinity tag quantitative analysis compared protein abundances in normal and depleted cells. Downregulated proteins were associated with basal functions, suggesting separate regulation under dysfunctional states.
Researchers have developed a method to deduce in vivo rates of protein synthesis from in vitro measurements by introducing a concept called kinetic distance, which quantitatively compares the kinetics of multistep processes in different environments. The kinetic distance depends logarithmically on transition rates and can be interpreted in terms of underlying free energy barriers. By minimizing the kinetic distance between in vitro and in vivo processes, with the constraint that deduced rates reproduce a known property such as overall in vivo speed, the method predicts in vivo rates. The approach was applied to protein synthesis by ribosomes, a key process of gene expression, using a codon-specific Markov model with reaction pathways for cognate, near-cognate, and non-cogn tRNA. Individual rates were determined in vitro and then predicted in vivo, validated by independent in vivo data on codon translation speeds, dynamics, and missense frequencies, showing good agreement without adjusting parameters. The deduced in vivo rates led to smaller error frequencies than in vitro rates, primarily due to improved tRNA selection. The method is computationally simple and can be applied to biomolecular processes with known in vitro kinetics.
Researchers investigated the microevolution of Helicobacter pylori during prolonged infection in single hosts and within families by sequencing 39,300 base pairs in 78 gene fragments from 97 isolates. The isolates included 34 pairs of sequential samples and single isolates from 29 individuals from 10 families. The accumulation of sequence diversity increased with time in a clock-like manner, allowing estimation of short-term mutation and recombination rates using Approximate Bayesian Computation. The results indicate a short-term mutation rate of 1.4×10−6 to 4.5×10−6 per nucleotide per year, with three times as many substitutions introduced by recombination as mutation. Long-term mutation rates over millennia are 5-17 fold lower due to purifying selection removing non-synonymous mutations. Comparisons show short-term rates vary in different bacterial species, spanning several orders of magnitude. Purifying selection results in an average dN/dS ratio of 0.07 in housekeeping genes among isolates, agreeing with the 5-17 fold difference in mutation rates. The study provides a robust estimate of the mutation rate over years to decades and longer-term genetic diversity between H. pylori from global sources, influenced by parallel changes with human hosts over 60,000 years.
Researchers investigated the contribution of melanopsin to irradiance coding in the thalamo-cortical visual system, finding that melanopsin-expressing retinal ganglion cells project extensively across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and support physiological light responses in the visual cortex, even in mice lacking rods and cones. Using chromatic stimuli, they isolated melanin-derived responses in mice with intact visual systems, revealing strong melanin input to approximately 40% of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus, which show sustained activation to light and irradiance-dependent firing rate increases. Melanin knockout mice confirmed the necessity of melanin for accurate irradiance encoding. The study establishes melanopsin photoreception as a significant source of sensory input to the thalamocortical visual system, providing unique irradiance information and allowing visual responses in the absence of rods and cones. Melanin contributes a quality of visual information unavailable from rods or cones, encoding irradiance over a wide sensitivity range, and is responsible for setting the tonic firing rate of 40% of thalamic neurons according to illumination, implicating melanin in spatial brightness perception. These findings identify melanin-expressing retinal ganglion cells as a potential origin of aspects of visual perception, supporting vision in retinal degeneration, and suggest revising architectural lighting practices to account for melanin photoreception requirements.
HIV-1 infection is associated with the depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells, which play a crucial role in regulating isotype switching and transepithelial transport of antibodies. This study investigated the impact of CD4+ cell depletion on humoral responses to antigens encountered at mucosal surfaces in HIV-infected individuals. Results showed reduced IgG responses to antigens from Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, but not Bacteretes, and elevated IgM levels with decreased IgA/IgM and IgG/Ig ratios in intestinal secretions of antiretroiral-treated HIV-1-infected individuals. This indicates reduced mucosal B cell competence for class switching from IgM to other isotypes, limiting their capacity to react to changing antigens in the gut. Decreased availability of microbiota-specific IgA and IgG may contribute to microbial translocation across the intestinal barrier, driving chronic inflammation. Key findings include elevated IgM levels, reduced IgG/Ig and IgA/IgM ratios in intestinal secretions, reduced IgG to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes in plasma, and correlation between IgA responses in intestinal and systemic compartments. Altered isotype response to environmental antigens, shifting from IgA to IgM, may promote inflammation and mucosal damage. HIV-1-infected individuals with low CD4 counts exhibit reduced IgG to Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, while ART-treated individuals show increased IgM to mucosal antigens and decreased IgG to most antigens compared to untreated subjects.
Populations in ecosystems are constrained by resource availability, requiring growth in one population to be balanced by reduction in others. A proposed model introduces a redistribution mechanism driven by abrupt reduction in a single species' population, freeing resources for others, relevant to communities like bacteria with strain-specific collapses or ecosystems where infectious diseases play a role. The emergent dynamics are characterized by cyclic 'diversity waves' triggered by collapses of dominating populations, peaking at the beginning and decreasing exponentially. Species abundances have a bimodal time-aggregated distribution, with lower peaks formed by recently collapsed or introduced species and upper peaks by those not yet collapsed. The self-organized hierarchical structure has long-term memory across waves, resulting in a scale-free tail of time-aggregated distribution with a universal exponent of 1.7. Simulations of model variants preserve collapse-driven dynamics, diversity waves, and broad time-aggregated population sizes. The classic definition of fitness as long-term growth rate is inappropriate, as each species' long-term rate is zero. The model introduces saturated dynamics exposed to episodic collapses, with all species sharing the same environment, limited by exponential growth, and replenished by diffusing individuals from other environments after collapse.
Escherichia coli's chemotactic movement is a well-studied paradigm of simple behavior that confers a significant competitive advantage and is expected to be strongly optimized. Bacteria follow gradients by performing temporal comparisons of chemoeffector concentrations, detecting differences through a sensory system that modulates flagellar motor rotation, decreasing tumble probability and reorientation if concentration change is positive. Researchers used computer simulations to predict an additional navigation mechanism in E. coli, suggesting tumbling probability and degree of reorientation during tumble depend on swimming direction along the gradient. The difference in mean tumbling angles up and down the gradient is small but results in a dramatic enhancement of cellular velocity along the gradient, demonstrating a new level of optimization in E. coli chemaxis. This fine-tuning of tumbling is mediated by adjustment of tumbling frequency, arising from the same mechanism as conventional chemaxis. The tumbling dependence on the number of switching motors was investigated using a hybrid model, introducing turning angle dependence on CW-rotating motors. Simulations show a small difference in tumbling angles significantly improves chemactic efficiency. When swimming down the gradient, probability of CW rotation is higher, motors change direction, and tumbling angles are larger. The study investigates tumbling dependence on direction and its effect on chemactic efficiency, indicating another level of evolutionary development in bacterial chemaxis likely used by peritrichously flagellated bacteria.
Stat3 signaling plays a crucial role in the development and homeostasis of medullary thymic epithelial cells, promoting their survival and maintenance. Activation of Stat3 in medullary thic epithelial cell precursors increases cellularity and drives medullary formation, bypassing the requirement for signals from positively selected thymocytes. Conversely, conditional deletion of Stat3 disrupts medary architecture and reduces the number of medary thymic epithelial cells. Stat3 signaling promotes the survival of immature MHCIIloCDlo medary thymic epithelial precursors but does not affect their proliferation. In contrast, neither enforced expression nor deletion of Stat3 affects cortical thymic epithelial cellularity or organization. The study demonstrates that Stat-mediated signaling, in addition to NFκB pathway, is essential for regulating medary thymic epithelial cellularity and homeostasis. Deletion of Stat3 results in disorganized medary regions and reduced medary thic epithelial cellularity, while its activation is required for optimal medary formation and maintenance. The presence of phosphorylated Stat3 in immature medary thymic epithelial cells suggests its involvement in thymic homeostasis. Overall, Stat3 activation is indispensable for medary formation and medary thic epithelial cell maintenance, contributing to central tolerance by regulating self-peptide expression and autoreactive thymocyte deletion.
Researchers have conducted a genome-wide identification of regulatory RNAs in the human pathogen Clostridium difficile, a common cause of nosocomial diarrhea, to understand the role of small noncoding RNAs in its physiology and pathogenesis. Using an in silico approach, 511 sRNA candidates were identified in intergenic and coding regions, and RNA-seq and differential 5'-end RNA-seq validated 251 putative regulatory RNAs, including 94 trans-regulators, 91 cis-antisense RNAs, and 66 riboswitches. Expression of 35 sRNAs was confirmed, with some showing growth-dependent profiles, including an antisense RNA involved in autolytic activity control. Sixteen c-GMP-responsive riboswitches were detected, with evidence of regulatory roles in motility and biofilm formation. Abundant sRNAs were encoded by multiple C. difficile CRISPR loci, potentially important for survival in bacteriophage-rich gut communities. The study provides a basis for future characterization of sRNA regulation in this emergent enteropathogen, highlighting the diversity of RNA mechanisms controlling key steps in the infection cycle. The identified sRNAs, mostly unique to C. difficile, could be associated with its specific physiopathology, emphasizing their functional importance in the bacterium, and suggesting a wide use of 5'-cis-RNA regulatory elements for rapid response to environmental changes.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection downregulates the abundance of liver-specific microRNA miR122 by promoting its destabilization via inhibition of GLD2, a non-canonical cytoplasmic poly(A) polymerase. The decrease in miR122 expression results in dysregulation of its functions, including proviral activity for HCV. High-throughput sequencing of small RNAs from human liver biopsies found that the 22-nucleotide prototype miR122 is modified at its 3' end by 3'-terminal non-templated and templated nucleotide additions. The proportion of mi122 isomers bearing a single nucleotide tail of ribonucleotide decreased in liver specimens from patients with HCV. The HCV core protein specifically inhibits GLD2 and its interaction with GLD in the cytoplasm is responsible for miR122 downregulation. Inhibition of GL2 by the HCV protein affects multiple miAs in addition to mi122 by decreasing the proportion of mono-adenylated isomers. Analysis of liver biops from healthy subjects and patients with HCV showed decreased mi122 levels in specimens from patients. The results demonstrate that the relative proportions of 23 and 24nt mi122 isomers bearing single or dinucleotide were decreased in liver tissues from patients with HCV. Non-templated addition of adenyl residues was substantially inhibited by HCV. The study provides new insights into the regulatory role of HCV protein controlling RNA and mi122 functions through mi122 stability modulation.
Researchers have discovered a distinct decrease in age-prevalence of Trypanosoma brucei infection in wild lions, consistent with exposure-dependent acquired immunity following infections with the genetically diverse species T. congolense. The causative agent of human sleeping sickness, T. bruce rhodesense, disappears by 6 years of age in response to cross-immunity from other trypanosomes, including non-pathogenic subspecies T. bruce bruce. Serengeti lions are co-infected with multiple tryosomes, including T congense, T. bruce, and T rhodesense, and exposed to T congense kilifi, Tsavo, T viv, and simiae. Tryosomes switch variable glycoproteins on their surface every 3-5 days to avoid immune recognition by the host. Findings suggest acquired immunity is mounted against T congense, allowing lions to clear T. bruce by 3-5 years and eliminate T. bruce rhodense by 6 years. Frequent re-exposure accelerates onset and extent of immunity, with lowest prevalence in high-tse exposure areas. Evidence of acquired immunity in lions generates a new perspective on vaccine development, previously considered impractical due to lack of natural immunity examples.
Researchers used mathematical modeling and sensitivity analysis to explore the hypothesis that mechanistic models of human cascades can be computationally screened for points of fragility, which could serve as therapeutic targets. A model of the well-studied coagulation cascade, composed of 92 proteins and 148 protein-protein interactions, was validated using 21 published datasets from different in vitro coagulation models. Simulated platelet activation and thrombin generation profiles were consistent with measured values, with a mean correlation of 0.87 across trials. Overall sensitivity coefficients calculated using Monte Carlo strategy identified fluid surface factor X/activated X and thrombin-mediated platelet activation as fragile, while fIX and fVIII activation were robust. Anti-Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors are classes of anticoagulants, supporting the prediction that fIX activity is robust. Results support the hypothesis that computationally derived points of fragility could be a basis for target selection despite model uncertainty. The model captured thrombin dynamics from TF-VII-initated coagulation, but challenges remain, including refining pro- and anti-plate activation mechanisms and exploring fIX robustness in vivo. Preliminary simulations of platelet activation and thrombin formation were consistent with cell-based coagulation assays, with correlations of 0.94 and 0.89. The model describes 21 datasets, including platelet and thrombin activation and anticoagulant activity, using minimal parameter variation. Sensitive elements were determined by computing overall sensitivity coefficients, with large values indicating fragility and small values indicating robustness.
Researchers investigated the kinetics of phage-bacteria interactions using a combination of experimental and modeling approaches to understand the dynamics of phage therapy, which utilizes bacteriophages as antimicrobial agents to control pathogenic bacteria. The study focused on Campylobacter jejuni, a food-borne pathogen, and a suitable virulent phage in an in vitro system. Results showed that phage-sensitive populations of C. jejuni arise and a simple model fits the data well, confirming the importance of inundation and proliferation thresholds in phage therapy. The model was fit to time series data to estimate thresholds and rate constants, revealing density-dependent features of phage infectivity worthy of further investigation. The study highlights the need for a theoretical framework to understand non-linear properties of phages as self-replicating pharmaceuticals and demonstrates the importance of testing models in vitro as a precursor to understanding kinetic properties of in vivo phage therapy. Phage-resistant cells are expected to be found in bacterial populations above a certain size and phage therapy is a selective treatment, emphasizing the need for a threshold-based understanding of phage-bacteria interactions. The study contributes to advancing therapeutic goals by recasting ecological and evolutionary approaches in terms relevant to phage therapy, aiming to provide accurate predictions of parameters such as inundation and proliferation thresholds for designing effective phage treatment.
Schistosomiasis, a disease caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistoma, affects over 260 million people worldwide, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The parasite must undergo larval development within specific snail hosts, presenting an opportunity to study conserved immunological features and adaptations. Researchers identified a Toll-like receptor, BgTL, in the snail Biomphalaria glabrata, which plays a crucial role in the immune response to Schistoma mansoni. BTL was discovered through a screen of snail cell surface proteins differing in abundance between resistant and susceptible B. glabrata strains. The resistant strain displayed higher BTL levels, and its expression increased 27-fold when challenged with S. mansoni, whereas susceptible snails showed no increase. Knockdown of BTL via siRNA oligonucleotides resulted in a significant alteration of the resistant phenotype, yielding infections in 43% of normally resistant snails. This study provides the first functional characterization of a gastropod TLR, demonstrating BTL as an important snail receptor influencing infection outcome following S. mansoni challenge. The findings contribute to understanding the molecular basis of interactions between schosomes and snail hosts, potentially identifying targets for disease prevention and control, aligning with the World Health Organization's call for global schosomiasis elimination by 2025.
Researchers have developed a new tool to assess human exposure to disease vectors in the Pacific by detecting antibodies against Aedes aegypti and Aedes polynensis saliva. Aedes mosquitoes transmit diseases such as dengue, chikunya, Zika, and Bancroftian filariasis in French Polynesia. An ELISA test detected immunoglobulin G against salivary gland extracts of Ae. aegypti and Ae. polesi in human populations exposed to these species. In Tahiti and Moorea islands, 98% and 68% of individuals developed IgG against Ae. aegypt and Ae. polesi, while 97% of individuals in metropolitan France had no Ig. Analysis showed no cross-reactivity between Ae. aegypt and Ae. polesi saliv gland extracts. The Ig response to saliv gland extracts is a valid biomarker of human exposure to Ae. aegpt and Ae. polesi bites. This immuno-epidemiological tool will enhance understanding of people's exposure to mosquito bites, identify areas of high disease risk, and evaluate vector control strategies in Pacific and tropical settings. The study found marked humoral reactivity in residents of French Polynesia against both Aedes species, with most developing specific antibodies during their stay in Tahiti. This represents the first attempt to detect an antibody response to saliv proteins of Aedes in a Pacific cohort, providing a promising approach to quantify human-vector contact and disease transmission risk.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis achieves pathogenicity by adapting to the intracellular environment of human macrophages and interfering with the host's metabolic machinery. Temporal profiling of metabolic flux in infected cells with virulent mycobacterial strains confirmed that the pathogen targets a subset of host reactions to integrate pathways facilitating macrophage survival and mycobacterial sustenance. The goal of this regulation is to converge host and pathogen-derived factors to define determinants of pathogenicity. The requirement for macroage survival sensitizes tuberculosis susceptibility to the glycemic status of the individual, while the mediation by the pathogen ensures the virulence of the infecting strain contributes to the resulting pathology. The pathogenicity of Mycobium tuberculosis is attributed to the plasticity of its central carbon metabolism, facilitating adaptation to the intracellular milieu of macroage, and engagement with metabolic pathways of the host. Time-dependent modulations in macroage metabolism after infection with mycobacterial strains confirmed that pathogenicity is linked to the capacity to regulate host metabolism, controlled at the level of cell metabolism, impacting disease pathology. Circulating glucose levels contribute to pathogenicity by influencing macroage apoptosis, revealing an additional facet of the relationship between glycemic status and innate defense against Mtb infection. The study suggests revisiting existing paradigms for understanding Mtb pathogenic, highlighting the extent to which metabolic intervention dictates the pathology of tuberculosis.
ZHP-3, the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of the yeast ZIP3 gene, plays a crucial role in crossover recombination and is required for proper segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiotic division. The ZHP-3 protein exhibits dynamic localization, shifting from the length of the synaptonal complex to asymmetric localization and eventually becoming restricted to foci marking crossover events. A zhp-3::gfp transgene partially complements a null mutation but results in high aneuploidy among progeny due to defects in meiotic chromosome segregation. The structure of bivalents is perturbed in this mutant, indicating an inability to properly remodel chromosomes in response to crossovers. Smo-1 mutants exhibit similar phenotypes to zhp-3::fp mutants, and double mutants show more severe meiotic defects, suggesting a role for SUMO in SC disassembly and bivalent differentiation. ZHP-3 couples crossover formation with SC disassembly and bivalent formation, unlike its yeast counterpart ZIP3 which couples recombination with synaps initiation. In C. elegans, ZHP3 foci correspond to meiotic crossovers, directing asymmetric disassembly of SC in diplotene/diakinesis. ZHP3 localizes to sites of crossover in late pachene and diplot, marking reciprocal exchange during meiosis, providing a tool for analysis of meiotic events in C.elegans.
Aedes albopictus, an invasive species, has colonized temperate regions of Europe and the US, posing a public health concern due to its ability to transmit arboviruses and causing nuisance due to its aggressive daytime biting behavior. A study in Rome, Italy, one of the most infested metropolitan areas in Southern Europe, investigated eco-climatic factors affecting Ae. albictus abundance in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural sites. Longitudinal monitoring along a 70 km transect showed an association between highly anthropized habitats and high adult abundance in both areas, with "green islands" corresponding to hotspots in metropolitan areas and bimodal seasonal dynamics with a peak in autumn due to preceding heavy rains and permissive temperatures. Increased vegetation cover in a 300m radius was negatively associated with mosquito abundance in both environments. Results indicate prioritizing mosquito control measures in temperate urban areas where human-mosquito contact and arbovirus transmission risk are higher and highlight potential health risks after summer months associated with high densities. Ae albictus abundance and dynamics in metropolitan versus sub-urban sites showed a complex relationship between landscape composition and mosquito abundance, crucial for predicting local distribution and relative abundance.
Phthiocerol dimyceros (DIM) are major virulence factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that play a crucial role in the early stages of infection when the bacteria encounter host macrophages. Research using Mtb mutants with deleted genes involved in DIM biosynthesis demonstrated that DIM participate in receptor-dependent phagocytosis of Mtb and prevention of phagosomal acidification. The effects of DIM require a state of membrane fluidity, as cholesterol-depleting drugs abolished differences in phagocytosis efficiency and phagosome acidification between wild-type and mutant strains. The insertion of a cholesterol probe in living cells showed that the polarity of the membrane hydrophobic core changed upon contact with Mtb, while lateral diffusion of cholesterol was unaffected. This effect was dependent on DIM and consistent with the observed effect following DIM insertion in model. DIM control invasion of macroages by targeting lipid organisation in the host membrane, modifying its biophysical properties. DIM-induced changes in lipid ordering favour the efficiency of receptor-mediated phagytosis of Mtb and contribute to the control of phagosomal pH driving bacilli to a protective niche. The cell envelope of Mycobium tuberculosis plays a major role in pathogenesis with a high lipid content constituting up to 40% of dry mycobacteria, with DIM promoting Mtb virulence. Plasma cholesterol is involved in bacterial entry and its concentration is critical for the role of DIM in phagocytosis. The effect of DIM is mediated by modification of the host plasma membrane, with changes in composition induced by cholesterol depletion affecting Mtb phagocytosis and phagosome acidification.
Researchers have developed a novel analysis of the dynamics of small neural networks composed of homogeneous populations of excitatory and inhibitory firing neurons, studying local and global bifurcations with an approach that is largely analytically tractable. For strong inhibition, these networks exhibit complex dynamics due to the formation of multiple solutions through spontaneous symmetry-breaking, a finite-size effect revealing differences between mesoscopic circuits and mean-field approximations. This qualitative change enables mesoscopic networks to regulate their degree of functional heterogeneity, potentially reducing the detrimental effects of noise on information processing. The analysis extends previous work by deriving exact expressions of bifurcation manifolds with less rigid constraints on synaptic weights, considering finite-size firing-rate models with arbitrary numbers of neurons in each population. Mean-field approximations neglect important phenomena, such as transitions between static regimes and chaos, or correlations among neurons, in finite-size networks. The study finds qualitative differences with mean-field when the system has strong inhibitory weights, undergoing a pitchfork bifurcation where multiple solutions emerge, enriching the complexity of the bifurcation diagram. This work progresses the methodology for studying dynamics of networks of a few tens of neurons, representing the lower bound of the mesoscopic scale.
Researchers investigated the viability and burden of Leishmania in extralesional sites during human dermal leishmanias by exploiting Leishmania 7SL RNA to establish viability and estimate parasite burden. The study evaluated the feasibility of discriminating parasite viability by PCR of Leishmania 7 RNA in relation to luciferase activity of transfected intracellular amastigotes. Samples from 28 patients with cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmanias were screened, and positive samples were analyzed by quantitative PCR of Leish 7 RNA genes and transcripts. The results showed that 7 RNA amplification coincided with lucase activity, confirming parasite viability. Viable parasites were detected in extralesional sites, including monocytes, tonsils, and normal skin of dermal leishias patients. Leish 7 RNA was found in 13 of 19 monocyte samples, 5 of 12 tonsil swabs, 4 of 11 normal skin aspirates, and 22 of 25 lesions, and genes were quantifiable in 15 of 19 monocyte samples, 12 of 13 tonsil swabs, 8 of 11 skin aspirates. The study demonstrated the presence of viable Leish in one or more extralesional tissues in 100 of 22 patients presenting DNA in these tissues, and amplification of RNA confirmed viability in 16 of 22 patients. The detection and quantification of parasites is crucial for determining infection status, monitoring treatment, and understanding the natural history of human infection. The study established that 7 RNA transcript number correlates with viable Leish and substantiates the presence of live parasites in extralesional tissues, allowing parasitological diagnosis to be achieved.
Researchers investigated the relationship between chromatin features and DNA replication timing in Drosophila using a comprehensive collection of 95 chromatin binding proteins and histone modifications. They found that combinations of chromatin binding proteins exhibit moderate predictive power for replication timing, while pairwise interactions between histone modifications lead to accurate genome-wide predictions that can be improved by chromatin binding proteins. A simplified model using six terms achieved 80% of full accuracy, indicating combinatorial histone patterns contribute to DNA replication regulation. Pairwise combinations of histone modifications can predict differential replication timing across cell types, supporting the existence of cell-type independent elements. The study used a genome-wide replication profile generated by tiling arrays and 95 chromatin features, including 30 histone modifications and 65 chromatin binding proteins, profiled in Drosila S2 cells using ChIP-chip or ChIP-Seq. The goal was to predict replication timing across the Drosila2 genome, considering replication initiation sites are associated with transcription units and share common motifs. The results indicate combinations of histone modifications allow a general cell-type description of the relationship between replication and chromatin, suggesting a regulatory mechanism of chromatin-templated processes for DNA replication.
Dengue virus and its four serotypes infect 390 million people and cause at least 25,000 deaths annually, with the largest burden in tropical and subtropical regions. Researchers investigated the spatial dynamics of DENV-1, DENV2, and DENV3 in Brazil by analyzing complete genome sequences. New lineages of the virus are introduced every 7-10 years, primarily from the Caribbean to the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, dispersing at approximately 0.5 km/day. Statistical analysis indicates aerial transportation of humans and/or mosquitoes, rather than Aedes aegypti infestation rates or geographical distances, determines deng virus spread in Brazil. The study used 170 Brazilian genome sequences and a spatial diffusion model, considering geographic distances, air traffic, Aedes aegypti infestation, human densities, and population. Results support a role for human spread of DENV through aerial transportation of humans and/or vectors. Introduction of new lineages is followed by epizootic amplifications in 7-10 year cycles. Periodic deng serotype peaks coincide with introduction of new lineages every 7-10 years. The study highlights the impact of air traffic in the spread of DENV within Brazil, but cannot discern the relative importance of air transport of infected humans or mosquitoes.
Researchers investigated how differences in receptive field organization across three parallel sensory maps influence correlations between activities of electrosensory pyramidal neurons in weakly electric fish. A model based on anatomical differences in receptive field size and overlap initially predicted large differences in correlated activity, but in vivo electrophysiological recordings showed nearly identical correlations across all segments. Incorporating the effects of surround in the model revealed multiple receptive field structures gave similar levels of correlation. Varying the surround gain and size relative to the center found combinations of center-surround balance resulted in identical correlations. Simulations showed the sign and magnitude of correlations were determined by the strength of positively and negatively correlated inputs. Pyramidal cells in all maps display antagonistic center-surround receptive fields, similar to retinal ganglion cells in the visual system. Results indicate receptive field overlap alone does not determine correlations, with implications for understanding how structure influences neural activity. The study used a combination of mathematical modeling and in vivo electrophysiology to quantify and compare correlations between activities of electrosorypyramidal neurons across three ELL maps, providing insight into how receptive field organization influences correlated activity in sensory systems with well-characterized structure and anatomical correlates.
Researchers investigated the impact of noise correlations on population coding in neural responses to repeated stimuli, considering a general setting with fixed neural tuning curves and other aspects. The study yielded insights into the role of correlations, summarized in theorems, and numerical examples with diverse tuning curves. The sign rule states that if noise correlations between neurons have opposite signs to signal correlations, coding performance improves compared to independent cases, holding for metrics and arbitrary curves. However, this rule is not necessary for good coding and diverse correlation structures can improve it. Optimal correlation structures lie on boundaries of possible noise correlations. Necessary and sufficient conditions were found for coding performance in noise to be as good as without noise. The setup made no assumptions on neural curves or variances, providing general insights into population coding. The sign rule holds pairwise for different neurons with signs of noise correlations consistent with signal correlations, also for heterogeneous populations. Conditions for chosen correlations yield coding as good as deterministic responses, satisfied with high probability for large populations, forming a high-dimensional set of correlation matrices.
Researchers investigated the impact of Pseudomonas aeruginosa on Staphylococcus aureus antibiotic susceptibility, finding that P. aeruginosa alters S. aureus susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics in a variable, strain-dependent manner. Three interactions were identified as responsible for antagonizing or potentiating antibiotic activity against S. aureus: LasA endopeptidase, rhamnolids, and 2-hepty-4-hydroquinoline N-oxide (HQ). LasA potentiates lysis of S. aureus by vancomycin, rhamolids facilitate proton motive-independent tobramycin uptake, and HQ induces multidrug tolerance through respiratory inhibition and reduction of cellular ATP. Production of these factors varies between clinical isolates, corresponding to the capacity to alter S. aureus antibiotic susceptibility. Vancomycin treatment of S. aureus mouse infection was potentiated by the presence of Las-producing P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa-secreted exoproducts impact S. aureus susceptibility through distinct pathways governed by rhamolids, HQ, and Las. Molecules produced by P. aeruginosa, including HQ, pyocin, and cyanide, inhibit S. aureus respiration. Rhamnolids interfere with S. aureus during wound infection. The presence of P. aeruginosa potentiates vancomycin killing of S. aureus through Las production, demonstrating the importance of deciphering interspecies interactions to improve antibiotic treatment of polymicrobial infections. The combined action of cell degradation by LasA and inhibition of peptidogly biosynthesis by vanycin leads to cell destruction and a bactericidal effect, while HQ induces tolerance to multiple antibiotics through respiration inhibition and ATP depletion.
Dengue virus infection is associated with thrombocytopenia and platelet dysfunction, which can lead to complications such as bleeding and plasma leakage. Researchers investigated the mechanisms of platelet clearance in dengue infection and found that patients had higher plasma concentrations of von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen and active VWF, and circulating platelets had more VWF bound to their membrane. The amount of platelet-VWF binding correlated with platelet count. Sialic acid levels in deng patients were significantly reduced, assessed by the binding of Sambucus nigra lectin and Maackia amnsis lectin to platelets. Plate sial acid on the plate membrane is neuraminidase-labile, but deng virus has no neuraminase activity. Induction of binding of VWF to glycoprotein 1 on platelets resulted in removal of plate sial acid by translocation of plate neuraminase to the plate surface. Neuramin inhibitor oseltiv reduced VWF-induced plate desial. Data demonstrate excessive binding of VWF to platelets in deng results in neuraminase-mediated plate desial and plate clearance. Oseltiv may be a treatment option for severe thrombocytia in deng infection. Circulating platelets in deng patients lost surface sial acid without increased plasma sialase activity. Increased VWF binding to platelets is the likely mechanism of plate desial in deng infection. Platelets are important for preservation of endothelial integrity. Two observational studies in Indonesian patients with acute deng showed VWF binding to platelets and sial acid loss correlated with thrombocytia, suggesting a novel mechanism of plate clearance in deng infection.
Researchers have identified a comprehensive collection of human transcripts under the control of bidirectional promoters, which are regulatory regions between two adjacent genes transcribed in opposite directions. These promoters are often associated with genes involved in DNA repair and may contribute to cancer development. Analysis of expressed sequence tags and microarray data revealed a significant enrichment of bidirectional promoters in genes implicated in somatic cancers, including breast and ovarian cancers. The study verified regulatory networks among genes controlled by bidirectional promoters, with subsets containing similar transcription factor binding sites, including evolutionarily conserved ETS factor sites in ERBB2, FCD2, and BRCA2. The findings suggest co-expression among groups of genes regulated by bidirectional promoters, particularly those involved in cancer. Misregulation of these promoters, especially with common transcription factor sites, could play a pivotal role in cancer development. Experimental data confirmed expression of flanking transcripts for 91%, 58%, and 65% of promoters in known genes, mRNA, and EST datasets. Bidirectional promoters are associated with DNA repair genes and somatic cancer, indicating a link between this regulatory mechanism and cancer pathways. The study examined bidirectional promoters in uterine and ovarian cancers, showing relationships between genes regulated by bidirectional promoters are intermediate between a single network and individual pairs.
Researchers analyzed the sex chromosomes of 37 fly species from 22 different families of Diptera, uncovering significant diversity in sex chromosome karyotypes despite superficial similarities. Over a dozen sex chromosome configurations were identified, with the small dot chromosome often used as a sex chromosome, suggesting it may be the ancestral karyotype of higher Diptera. Some species had undifferentiated sex chromosomes, while others replaced the dot with a different chromosome or incorporated multiple elements into sex chromosomes, and some had female heterogamety with Z sex chromosomes. Transcriptome analysis showed dosage compensation evolved multiple times through up-regulation of the single X in males, but X chromosomes had a deficiency of male-biased genes, possibly due to sex-specific pressures. The findings indicate Diptera ancestrally had homomorphic sex chromosomes, with the dot becoming a sex chromosome in crane flies and midges, or reverting to autosomal in mosquitoes and sand flies. Higher flies show diversity in sex karyotypes, and the karyotype of Drosila is derived, illustrating the transient nature of sex chromosomes in flies. The study reveals sex chromosomes have been lost, gained, or rearranged multiple times over Dipt evolution, providing a resource to study sex biology and showing similar forces shaped the unique evolution of sex chromosomes in diverse fly taxa.
Zika virus is an emerging mosquito-borne pathogen linked to severe fetal abnormalities, including microcephaly. Researchers investigated archived blood samples from six mothers who gave birth to babies with microcephaly and 12 who gave to healthy babies in Hawaii between 2009-2012, testing for Zika IgM and IgG antibodies. One mother who delivered a baby with microceph tested positive for Zika IgM (16.6%) and three tested positive for IgG (50%). Zika showed a trend towards significance with microceph, with IgG positive mothers more likely to deliver babies with microceph (Odds ratio=11, 95% CI=0.8-147.9, p=0.083). Similarly, IgM positive mothers were more likely to deliver with microceph (OR=6, 95 CI=0.2-195.1). The study provides evidence of a link between Zika infection and microceph, suggesting Zika positive cases associated with microceph in the US as early as 2009. Zika outbreaks have been recorded in the US, with the first congenital Zika case reported in the US in a mother who gave birth to a baby with microceph, positive for Zika by plaque reduction test.
Researchers investigated the source of Mycobacterium ulcerans infections in the Ashanti region of Ghana, where Buruli ulcer is endemic, by matching Variable Number Tand Repeat profiles of human and environmental samples. Environmental samples were collected from 10 water bodies in four communities and genotyped using four VNTR loci in the Agy99 genome. Mycobacterium ulcerans was found in three types of water bodies, with higher presence in biofilm samples. Four genotypes, W, X, Y, and Z, were identified in both human and environmental samples, while other genotypes were only found in water. An animal, a mouse, was found with a lesion characteristic of Buruli ulcer, confirmed as Mycobacterium ulcerans infection. The findings suggest patients may have been infected from community-associated water bodies and small mammals within communities could be susceptible to infections. Mycobacterium ulcer transmission may involve multiple routes where humans contact environments, compounded by water acting as a vehicle for disseminating strains. VN typing confirmed previously reported genotypes and resolved homogeneity in isolates in Ghana, identifying four Mycobacterium ulcer genotypes in humans and water, and other genotypes only in water. Molecular data correlated abundance of Mycobacterium DNA in environments with increasing Buruli cases, suggesting patients are infected from contaminated water.
The global distribution of alien bird species is influenced by a combination of anthropogenic and environmental factors, with anthropogenic factors affecting the number of species introduced to new locations and environmental factors influencing how many are able to persist. Analysis of an extensive database of alien birds reveals that locations of origin and introduction were initially driven by European colonialism, but recent introductions involve more countries and are driven by economic activity. Alien bird richness is highest at mid-latitudes and determined by anthropogenic effects, notably the number of introduced species. Environmental drivers are also important, with native and alien species richness being positively associated. Colonisation pressure is key to understanding alien richness, and areas of high native richness are not resistant to colonisation at the global scale. The study uses a database of 27,723 records for 971 alien bird species worldwide, combining information on colonisation pressure with abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic variables to identify determinants of alien richness. Global patterns of alien richness are determined by human and biotic factors, with regions of high alien richness in temperate mid-latitudes where former colonies, developing countries, and high GDP are located, and colonisation has been high.
Upstream Binding Factor (UBF) is a multi-HMG-box protein that plays a crucial role in RNA polymerase I transcription and chromatin structure. Deletion of UBF in mice shows it is essential for embryonic development and transcription of ribosomal RNA genes, defining active chromatin conformation of gene and enhancer sequences. Loss of UBF prevents formation of the SL1/TIF1 pre-initiation complex and recruitment of RPI-Rrn/TIF complex, accompanied by histone modifications and HP1 binding, but not DNA methylation. Despite this, rRNA genes maintain a potentially active state. Inactivation of rRNA synthesis does not suppress transcription of 5S, tRNA, snRNA, or mRNA genes involved in ribosome biogenesis, indicating rRNA activity does not coordinate global expression for ribosome biogenesis. Loss of UBF induces formation of somatic nucleolar precursor body-like structures containing rRNA processing factors but not associated with rRNA loci. UBF is required for recruitment of SL1 to the 47S promoter and determines rRNA activity. Elimination of UBF causes large-scale changes in rRNA chromatin, transitioning from active to potentially resting state, without heterochromatization. The study demonstrates UBF's essential role in rRNA transcription, epigenetics, and chromatin structure.
Researchers investigated the role of Wingless/Wnt signaling in adult intestinal compartmentalization, where Wingless gradients coincide with major boundaries between compartments. They found that tethering Wingless, which prevents its secretion and movement, disrupts critical roles in intestinal development, including target gene activation, boundary formation, stem cell proliferation, epithelial fate, muscle differentiation, and signaling crosstalk with the Decapentaplegic pathway. This study provides evidence for the requirement of direct, long-range action of Wingless in tissue patterning, relevant to animal development, tissue homeostasis, and Wnt-driven disease. The adult intestine forms through distinct mechanisms during metamorphosis and faces functional demands, including epithelial turnover and regeneration. Wingless gradients demarcate major boundaries between compartments, and its inhibition phenocopies defects in the epithelium, indicating Wing secretion and movement are critical for proper pathway activation during gut development. The study identifies a context where the requirement for long-range Wing action is unambiguous, supporting previous studies in larval disc. Findings may be relevant to mammalian intestine, which is similarly divided into compartments and dependent on Wnt expression for regionalization, and may uncover principles determining contexts where long-range Wnt action is essential.
Researchers investigated the role of urokinase plasmin activator (uPA) in invasive Group A streptocococcal infection, a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. They found that uPA contributes to plasmin recruitment and disease initiation in vivo, and in the absence of host plasmin activators, streptase (Ska) is required for cell surface plasmin acquisition by Group A streptococcus (GAS). However, in the absence of Ska, host activators can promote surface plasmin acquisition by GAS. The study used a transgenic mouse model to assess the contribution of uPA to invasive disease and found that mice expressing human plasmin transgene were more susceptible to GAS than uPA−/− mice. The decrease in virulence in uPA/− mice correlated with reduced bacterial dissemination and surface plasmin accumulation. Deletion of uPA did not eliminate GAS virulence, possibly due to the presence of host plasmin activator tPA. Mortality was reduced from 80% to 20% in the absence of both uPA and streptase. The findings have implications for understanding GAS pathogenesis and targeting plasmin activation in bacterial infections, suggesting cooperative plasmin activation plays a role in invasive disease.
Helicobacter pylori exploits a unique repertoire of type IV secretion system components for pilus assembly at the bacteria-host interface. Colonization of the human stomach by Helicobacter pylori is a risk factor for gastric cancer development. The cag pathogenic island encodes a type IV secretion system that translocates the bacterial oncoprotein CagA into gastric epithelial cells. CagL, a component of the cag TSS, binds the receptor α5β1 integrin. Mass spectrometry revealed co-purification of CagL, CagI, and CagH, which are encoded by contiguous genes in the cag PA and detectable on the bacterial surface. These proteins are required for Cag translocation and IL-8 secretion by gastric epithelial cells, but are not homologous to T4S components in other species. Scanning electron microscopy shows these proteins form pili at the interface between H. pylori and gastric epithelial cells. Mutant strains fail to form pili or exhibit a hyperpiliated phenotype. A conserved C-terminal hexapeptide motif in Cag, Cag, and Cag is required for Cag translocation and pilus formation. The results indicate Cag, Cag, and Cag are components of T4 assembly involved in pilus biogenesis, highlighting the role of H. pylori cag TSS.
Bovine tuberculosis is a chronic disease in cattle caused by Mycobacterium bovis, and vaccination may offer a long-term solution for controlling the disease. Researchers studied global gene expression to identify predictors of protection and facilitate vaccine development. Calves were vaccinated with BCG or a heterologous BCG prime-adenovector subunit boosting protocol and protective efficacy was determined after M. bovis challenge. RNA from PPD-stimulated PBMC from vaccinated-protected, vaccinated-unprotected, and unvaccinated cattle was analyzed by RNA-seq, revealing 668 differentially expressed genes. Cytokine-cytine interaction was the most significant pathway, with IL22 identified as a dominant surrogate of protection besides INFγ. RT-qPCR confirmed the importance of IL22 as a predictor of vaccine efficacy in an independent set of PBMC samples from BCG vaccinated and unvaccinated calves. BCG vaccination induces protective immunity in some calves, resolving M. bo infection, and remains the prototype vaccine to judge novel strategies. Predictive biomarkers would facilitate vaccine development, with previous data showing BCG inducing cell-mediated immunity and strong INFγ production. Strategies to improve BCG include subunit vaccines, DNA, protein, and live recombinant vaccines, but reliable immunological correlates of protection are lacking. Elevated IL17 transcription predicted protection in a previous study, but not in this one. Both BCG and BCG/Ad vaccination resulted in significant protection against M. bo challenge, with IL22 identified as key for protection against bovine tuberculosis.
Researchers investigated the role of essential centrosomal microtubule nucleators γ-tubulin ring complex and AIR-1/Aurora at non-centrosomal microtubule organizing centers in Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic intestinal epithelial cells. Using a tissue-specific degradation system, they found that γ-tub ring complex component GIP-1 recruits other components to the apical non-centrosomal microtubule organizing center, while AIR-1 and MZ1 specifically recruit γ-tub to the centrosome. Surprisingly, microtubules remain organized at the apical non-centrosomal microtule center upon γ-tub and AIR-1 depletion. Loss of GIP removed a subset of dynamic microtubules and the remaining microtubules grew faster. The results suggest different microtule organizing centers use discrete proteins for function and the apical non-centrosomal microtule center is composed of distinct populations of γ-tub-dependent and -independent microtubules competing for limited resources. γ-tub and AIR-1 are required to nucleate microtules at the centrosome but not at the apical non-centrosomal microtule center. The primary function of γ-tub may not be nucleation, as suggested by imaging studies of centrosomes from γ-tub-depleted embryos. The presence of microtules in dividing cells relies on γ-tub function and mitotic kinase AIR1/AurA. Depletion of both results in elimination of centrosomal microtules. The study reveals distinct microtule populations at microtule organizing centers and the role of essential centrosome components in regulating microtule dynamics.
Humans are a diploid species, inheriting one set of chromosomes paternally and one homologous set maternally, but most sequencing initiatives do not directly delineate the nucleotide content of the maternal and paternal copies due to costs and complexities. A comparison of 11 widely-used approaches to phasing human genomes was conducted using the publicly available 'Genome-In-Bottle' (GI) phased version of the NA128 genome as a standard. The approaches included laboratory-based assays and computational methods that reconstruct phase information from sequencing reads and population-level haplotype frequency. Performance was assessed using metrics such as switch rates, haplotype lengths, proportion of fully phase-resolved genes, phasing accuracy, and yield between pairs of SNVs. Results suggest a hybrid approach combining population-based phasing using SHAPE, genome-wide sequencing or parental genotypes, and a reference panel of variant and haplotype frequencies provides a fast and efficient way to produce accurate phase-resolved genomes. Population-based phasing performance is enhanced with genome-wide data and parental genotype inclusion reduces phasing errors up to ten-fold. A voting scheme combining multiple predictions enhances performance and coverage. DNA signatures associated with phasing errors include regions of low polymorphism or SNV density. Eleven approaches were compared, including laboratory-based methods and computational methods such as Beagle, Eagle, SHAIT, and HapCut, with input from haplotype panels from the 1000 Genomes Project. Hybrid approaches are accurate and cost-effective, nearly matching or surpassing laboratory-based methods.
Researchers have investigated the role of ATPase in Type-III protein secretion systems in Salmonella enterica, which are utilized by gram-negative pathogens to secrete building blocks of the bacterial flagellum, virulence effectors, and structural units of the needle complex. The study found that functional flagella can form in the absence of Type-III ATPase activity when the proton motive force and flagellar substrate levels are increased. Additionally, an increased proton motive force can bypass the requirement of the Salmonella pathogenic island 1 virulence-associated Type-III ATPase for secretion. The results demonstrate that ATP activity is dispensable for protein export via bacterial Type-III systems and propose that the function of the TSS-associated ATP complex is to deliver substrates to the export apparatus and ensure efficient unfolding. Increased substrate production or proton motive force can overcome the requirement for the ATP complex. The findings have implications for the evolution of bacterial flagellum and Type-III systems. The flagellar biogenesis in Salmonella enterica is mediated by a flagellar Type-III secretion system whose components are evolutionarily and functionally related to virulence Type-III systems of pathogenic bacteria. Elimination of the proton force inhibits flagellar Type-III secretion and ATP hydrolysis may energize chaper release and substrate unfolding. Overall, the study reveals that Type-III secretion can occur efficiently without ATPase activity in both flagellar and virulence Type-III systems.
Researchers employed chemical reaction theory to survey over 40,000 simple gene regulatory networks formed by two transcription factor-coding genes and their associated proteins, finding bistability in approximately 90% of the models, including circuits without cooperativity commonly associated with bistable systems. A topological sorting revealed eleven minimal bistable networks that do not contain smaller bistable subnetworks. The large number of previously unknown bistable topologies suggests switch-like behavior arises easily and is not lost through evolution. Integrating protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA, and gene expression data from Saccharomyces cerevisiae identified GRNs predicted to behave bistably. A comprehensive parameter-free survey identified 36,771 bistable GRN architectures, including eleven without cooperativity. The two-gene bistable family can be understood as descended from eleven minimal bistable networks, bistable by removal of one or more reactions. 36% of 40,680 unique two-gene networks are bistable, 9% have multiple steady states, and 6.5% monostable regardless of parameters. Basic biochemical processes in transcriptional regulation were captured but the formalism is not exhaustive, excluding mechanisms such as TF dimer degradation. Identified networks provide excellent bistable candidates and hypotheses for experimentation, offering guidance for systems with available interaction data.
Researchers have identified mutations in the HYAL2 gene, encoding hyaluronidase 2, as a cause of syndromic orofacial cleft in humans and mice. HYAL2 degrades extracellular hyaluron, a critical for developing heart and palatal matrix. Mutations destabilize the molecule, reducing HY2 protein levels, leading to craniofacial abnormalities, submucosal cleft, and coratrium sinister, and hearing loss in mice. Affected individuals exhibit orofacial cleft, craniofacial dysmorphism, conductive hearing loss, and coratrium sinister. The study reveals hyalidase enzymes play a vital role in human and mouse development, particularly in the pathogenesis of orofacial cleft and coratrium sinister. HY2 deficiency is a novel cause of syndromic cleft lip and palate in humans and mice, and the first molecular explanation for coratrium sinister. Cardiac findings in individuals with HY2 mutations display similarities, including coratrium and dilated coronary sinuses. The study highlights the importance of hyaluron turnover for normal human and mouse development and identifies a previously unrecognized pathway in orofacial cleft and coratrium pathogenesis, potentially amenable to treatment. The discovery provides evidence of HY2's role in normal heart development and defines the first molecular mechanism for coratri sinister in humans.
Researchers investigated the molecular remodeling of tip links underlying mechanosensory regeneration in auditory hair cells, which is crucial for sound detection. Current models propose a static composition of tip links with protocadherin 15 (PCD15) at the lower end and cadherin 23 (CD23) at the upper end. However, the molecular details of the regeneration process are unknown. Using novel backscatter electron microscopy, the study found that functional mechanotransduction-mediating tip links have at least two molecular compositions, containing PC15/CD23 or PC15/PC15. During regeneration, shorter links containing equal amounts of PC15 at both ends appear first, mediating mechanotransduction currents of normal amplitude but abnormal Ca2+-dependent adaptation. The mature PC15/CD link composition is re-established later, concurrent with complete recovery of adaptation. The study revealed a two-step remodeling process where CD23 disappears and PC15 migrates to form the upper end of the nascent link. The findings provide a mechanism for regeneration and maintenance of mechanosensory function in postmitotic auditory cells and may help identify components of the mechanotransduction machinery. Tip links are disrupted by intense acoustical stimulation and can regenerate, restoring mechanosensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. The study used backscatter electron microscopy to visualize nanometer-sized stereilia links and immuno-gold particles localizing PC15 and CD23, showing nascent regenerating links had PC15 at both ends. The results suggest the two-step molecular process underlies formation, turnover, and regeneration of tip links, safeguarding hearing.
Dengue virus infection causes a spectrum of clinical manifestations, from mild dengue fever to life-threatening deng hemorrhagic fever, with mechanisms triggering the transition from mild to severe forms not well understood. A mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling of sera from adult patients with deng fever and deng hemorrhagic fever at critical and recovery phases identified 29 differentially expressed metabolites, including bile acids, purines, acylcarnitines, phospholipids, and amino acids. Bile acids were up to 5-fold higher in deng hemorrhagic fever patients, correlating with liver injury markers aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase. Uric acid, a key antioxidant, was 1.5-fold lower in deng hemorrhagic fever patients, indicating decreased endogenous defense and elevated oxidative stress. Eight metabolites remained altered in the recovery phase, including chenodeoxycocholic acid, suggesting prolonged liver impact. The study identified metabolic pathways linked to deng progression, advancing understanding of deng pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic targets for deng management. Altered pathways may serve as targets to alleviate deng hemorrhagic fever. The findings provide insights into host and deng interactions between mild and severe forms, with implications for novel therapeutic strategies.
Researchers have identified and characterized the guanosine 5'-monophosphate reductase (GMP) enzyme in Trypanosoma bruce, a parasitic protozoan causing African trypanosomias. The enzyme plays a crucial role in interconverting purine nucleotides to maintain intracellular balance and is a potential target for treating parasitemia. The study found that Trypanoma bruce GMP is distinct, having an insertion of a tandem cystathion β-synthase domain absent in mammalian and bacterial GMP. The recombinant protein catalyzes the conversion of GMP to IMP in the presence of NPH with different affinities for GMP and NPH compared to mammalian counterparts. Addition of monovalent cations like K+ and NH+ increased Trypanoma bruce GMP activity, whereas mammalian GMP was unaffected. The purine nucleoside analog ribavir inhibited Trypan bruce GMP, but not mammalian GMP. The findings suggest a distinct mechanism of GMP reaction in Trypanoma bruce from host organisms. The study demonstrated the inhibitory effect of ribavirin on trypanosome proliferation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating its potential as a therapeutic agent against African tryosomias. The localization of GMP in glyomes of Trypan bruce was confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy and sequence analysis. Overall, the study reveals novel characteristics of Trypanoma bruce GMP distinct from animals, providing insights into the molecular phylogenetics of protozoa and potential therapeutic targets for treating African tryosomias.
Researchers utilized molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the binding and entry route of sodium channel blockers benzocaine and phenytoin in the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel NavAb. The study revealed two likely binding sites for both drugs, characterized by non-specific hydrophobic interactions, located above the activation gate and at the entrance to the lipid-filled fenestrations. Binding to the activation gate was found to be slightly more favorable than to the fenestration. The results suggest that both drugs can pass through the fenestrations into the lipid with minimal energy barriers, indicating a potential hydrophobic entrance route for neutral drugs. Key residues direct the drugs into and through the fenestration, forming the binding sites. Sodium channels are crucial for initiating action potentials in excitable cells, and aberrant expression or mutations can lead to diseases such as neuropathic pain, cardiac arrhythmia, and epilepsy. Local anesthetics like benzaine and anti-epileptics like phenyin block sodium channels, reducing signal propagation and manifesting as reduced seizures, pain, or cardiac excitability. The findings provide insight into the mode of action of sodium channel inhibitors, essential for developing next-generation drugs targeting specific voltage-gated sodium channels.
MyD88-mediated signaling in dendritic cells and intestinal epithelial cells plays a crucial role in controlling immunity against intestinal infection with C. rodium. My88-deficient mice are highly susceptible to bacterial infections, but the cell-specific contribution of My88 in protecting the host is poorly understood. Using a novel murine knock-in model, researchers found that functional My88 signaling in CD11+ cells activates dendritic cells, inducing an early group 3 innate lymphoid cell response and development of colonic Th17/Th1 cells. Restricting My88 to macrophages, T cells, or ILC did not induce efficient immune responses. However, My88 expression in intestinal epithelial cells partially protected mice, enhancing epithelial integrity and antimicrobial peptide expression. Data suggests My88 signaling in dendritic cells and epithelial cells is essential for a full spectrum of host responses against C. rodium. My88 in CD11+ cells activates proinflammatory cytokines in colonic dendritic cells, restoring the Th17/Th cell response and recruiting ILC. My88 in dendritic cells, but not macrophages, is critical for colonic I3 response and protection during early infection. My88 in epithelial cells maintains the barrier, highlighting its importance in both dendritic and epithelial cells for intestinal defense.
Onchocerciasis is targeted for elimination in Africa through annual or biannual ivermectin mass drug administration. An immunodiagnostic test detecting human IgG4 antibodies to Oncherca volvulus-specific antigen Ov16 determines transmission interruption and treatment cessation. Mathematical modeling explores the relationship between post-treatment Ov16 antibody prevalence in children, treatment duration and coverage, microfilaria prevalence, and elimination probability of oncherciasis. The ONCHIM model simulates Ov16 serostatus, assuming seroconversion triggered by first worm establishment, with yearly mass drug administration reducing parasite acquisition and seroconversion in newborns. Microfilaria prevalence and Ov16 prevalence decline with increasing treatment duration. The association between indicators and predicted probability of elimination depends on baseline endemicity, seroconversion assumptions, and diagnostic characteristics. Understanding Ov16 dynamics is necessary for accurate seroprevalence interpretation and endpoint estimation. Simulations reveal local conditions influence the association between post-treatment mf and Ov16 levels and probability of elimination. High-transmission settings require lower levels than low-transmission settings. Mathematical models assess infection trends under various conditions, estimating required treatment duration to achieve elimination. The Ov16 prevalence in children relates to local conditions, treatment duration, coverage, test characteristics, microfilaria prevalence, and probability of elimination.
Researchers have found that prion strains can change properties when propagated in different environments, with swainine-sensitive prions becoming resistant when propagated in PK cells in the presence of swainine. Prion populations exhibit heterogeneity even after cloning, indicating mutation-like processes occur at the conformational level. Brain-derived prions are naturally swine resistant, and those that become sensitive after propagation in cells can revert to resistance. RML prions, sensitive in brain or PK cells, can give rise to swine-resistant and dependent populations when passaged in the presence of swine. Certain PK sublines can isolate swine-resistant and dependent populations that propagate rapidly in the presence of the drug and can be passaged indefinitely without losing swine dependence. The misfolded prion protein associated with swine-dependent variants is less cleared in PK cells, indicating structural differences underlie prion properties. Propagation in the presence of an inhibitory drugs selects not only resistant prions but stable variants that propagate efficiently in the presence of the drug due to conformation changes in the abnormal protein. Swine-resistant prions can be selected from sensitive populations as brain-derived prions are resistant, and RML prions give rise to resistant and dependent populations when passaged in swine. Prion populations are quasi-species with variants constantly selected and replenished by mutation, with restricted repertoire in R-infected PK cells allowing selection of resistant populations in the presence of the drug.
Researchers analyzed the genotype-phenotype map of a space comprising 101 metabolisms that encode all possible subsets of 51 reactions in central carbon metabolism to study metabolism's potential for innovation. Using flux balance analysis, they predicted viability of these metabolisms on 10 different carbon sources, resulting in 102 potential phenotypes. Although viable metabolisms with one phenotype comprise a small fraction of genotype space, their numbers exceed 10^9 for some phenotypes. Metabolisms with one phenotype typically form a network extending through metabolic space, allowing reachability through single reaction changes. Minimal distance between genotype networks with different phenotypes is small, enabling access to novel phenotypes through few genotypic changes. Exceptions occur for metabolisms with complexity close to minimum viability. Increasing complexity enhances evolutionary conservation and innovation potential. Neighborhoods of metabolisms on the same carbon source contain novel phenotypes, accessible based on location in metabolic space. Random sampling of 100 pairs of metabolisms viable on a given source showed changes in metabolic genotype can lead to viability on new carbon combinations. Most metabolisms reside in a single connected network, with distinct phenotypes accessible through few changes. Analysis of metabolisms viable on multiple carbon sources revealed multiple novel phenotypes in the neighborhood of a given metabolism, indicating potential for metabolic innovation through genotypic changes.
Researchers analyzed the genetic variation and phylogeography of the Triatoma dimidiata complex across its geographic range, focusing on landscape and regional scales in Chiapas, Mexico, and the Neotropics. Two ND4 gene fragments were analyzed to assess differential haplogroup specificity. Results showed lowest genetic diversity in areas with high anthropic modification and high Trypanosoma cruzi infection prevalence. Haplogroups 1 and 3 had higher Tryosoma cruzi prevalence, while haplogroup 2 had lower prevalence. DTU and DTI infection frequencies differed in haplogroups 1 and 3, but not in haplog 2. All Neotropical haplogroups had moderate to high haplotype diversity, with greatest differentiation between haplogroups 1 and 3. Divergence from the most recent common ancestor was estimated between 0.97 and 0.85 million years ago, with primary divergence of haplogroups 2 and 3. Effective population size of Mexican haplogroups 1 and 2 increased between 0.02 and 0.03 million years ago. The study supports the Tehantepec Isthmus as the origin of the complex, with recent divergence of primary haplogroups and differential Tryosoma cruzi frequency and DTU specificity, impacting vector capacity. Haplogroup 1 has expanding populations in Mexico, raising concerns for vector control, and highlighting the importance of understanding parasite genetic diversity for therapeutic efficacy.
Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFR) is a rodent-borne disease caused by hantaviruses, primarily Hanta virus and Seoul virus, in China. Environmental factors significantly affect the risk of hantavirus infections through rodent population dynamics and human-rodent contact. A 10-year field surveillance from 2006-2015 analyzed rodent hosts, hantavirus, epidemiological, and environmental data to quantify relationships among environmental factors, rod species, and HFR occurrence. The study included 709 HFR cases, with rod species comprising Rattus norvegicus, Mus musculus, R flavius, and others. Rodent species played different roles across land types, with some associated with HFR risk in forests, water bodies, grassland, and built land. Rodent composition was associated with environmental variability. Predictive models showed cultivated land represented the highest risk for HFR incidence, validated by 2014-201 statistics. Spatial heterogeneity of HFR may be influenced by rodent composition, associated with local conditions. Environmental factors, including temperature, rainfall, humidity, land type, vegetation, and soil moisture, impact rod-to-human transmission. Transmission depends on contact frequency between humans and rodents, associated with human activities, living conditions, host distributions, rod densities, and virus prevalence. Future work should focus on preventing HFR in moist environments.
Costello syndrome is caused by activating mutations in the HRAS proto-oncogene, with Gly12 mutations having the highest transforming activity and being frequent in cancers but rare in Costello syndrome, where they cause a severe, lethal phenotype. A new germline Gly12 mutation, c.35GCGT, was identified in a 12-year-old boy with attenuated Costello syndrome, showing high levels of exon 2 skipping. Analysis confirmed c.35CGT results in exon 2 skipping by disrupting a critical Exonic Splicing Enhancer and creating an Exonic Splicing Silencer. The vulnerability of HRAS exon 2 is due to a weak 3' splice site, making exon inclusion dependent on splicing stimulatory proteins like SF2. Most cancer and Costello-causing mutations affect splicing differently. The phenotype in Costello and somatic cancers is determined by the transforming potential of mutant HRAS and efficiency of exon 2 inclusion. A splice oligonucleotide blocking access to the critical Exonic Enhancer causes exon skipping and halts cancer cell proliferation, revealing potential for new anti-cancer therapies based on HRAS exon skipping. Mutations in codon 12 and 13 impact exon 2 differently and HRAS splicing efficiency varies. Germl mutations in HRAS cause Costello, a congenital disease with postnatal growth retardation and tumor predisposition, with 75% caused by heterozygous c34A pGly12Ser mutations. Introduction of a single mutation creating the hnRNP binding motif causes complete exon skipping, indicating the importance of splicing regulation in HRAS.
N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methylation, the most abundant modification on mRNAs, plays crucial roles in various biological processes and is catalyzed by a methyltransferase complex including methyltransferase-like 3 (MET3) as a key factor. In vivo functions of MET3 and m6 modification in mammalian development remain unclear. Specific inactivation of Met3 in mouse nervous system causes severe developmental defects in brain, manifesting cerebellar hypoplasia due to enhanced apoptosis of newborn cerebell granule cells in external granular layer. MET3 depletion-induced loss of m6 causes extended RNA half-lives, aberrant splicing, and dysregulation of transcript-wide expression, leading to premature cell death. MET3-mediated m6 regulates mammalian cerebell development. MET3 is essential for cerear neurogenesis, transcript-wide gene dysulation by m6 depletion results in cell apoptosis and cerebell hypoplas. Met3 knockout model shows cerear defects indicating MET and m6 roles in neuronal development. Depletion causes apoptosis, altered Purje cell and Bergmann glia architecture. Loss of m leads to extended mRNA half-lives, aberrant splicing on synapse genes, inducing cell death. MET3-m6 modulates central nervous system post-transcription in mammals. MET3 inactivation causes elevated stability of apoptosis genes and altered splicing of synapse genes leading to cerebell defects.
Combinatorial binding of transcription factors OCT4, SOX, and NANOG in human and mouse embryonic stem cells identifies conserved enhancers active in early embryonic development. These transcription factors regulate gene expression by binding to cis-regulatory sequences and are essential for maintaining the capacity of cells to differentiate into any cell type in the developing embryo. Combinatorial binding is strongly associated with co-localization of the transcriptional coactivator Mediator, H3K27ac, and increased expression of nearby genes in embryonic cells. Loci bound by Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 in ES cells frequently drive expression in early embryonic development. Comparison of mouse and human cells shows less than 5% of individual binding events are shared, but 15% of combinatorial events and 53-63% of combinatorial events at enhancers active in development are conserved. The combination of OCT4, SOX, and NAN binding is critical for transcription and likely plays a role in embryogenesis by binding conserved developmental enhancers. Evolutionary rewiring of regulatory networks mainly affects individual events, whereas regulatory hotspots bound by multiple factors are under stronger constraints. Combinatorially bound enhancers are active during development, controlling key genes involved in differentiation, providing evidence for the connection between pluripotency and early development.
The AML/ETO oncoprotein, resulting from a chromosomal translocation involving chromosomes 8 and 21, initiates acute myeloid leukemia by recruiting co-repressor complexes to DNA and interfering with the function of its wild-type counterpart, AML. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation and expression profiling revealed that AML/ETO co-localizes with AML, demonstrating that the fusion protein follows the binding pattern of the wild-type but does not primarily displace it. The DNA binding profile of E-protein HEB is rearranged upon AML/ETO expression and the fusion co-localizes with AML and HEB on many regulated targets. The level of HEB protein is increased in primary cells and cell lines expressing AML/ETO, suggesting a major role for the interaction of A1/ETO with A1 and H in transcription regulation. AML/ETO targets DNA through E-box motifs as a result of interactions with transcription factors of the E-protein family, particularly HEB. The co-occurrence of AML and HEB is associated with regulation by A1ETO, indicating common regions for the three transcription factors are relevant to A1ETO function. A proportion of genes regulated by A1ETO did not display binding of the fusion in proximity of the gene. AML and H share a proportion of target genes in wild-type conditions, pointing to regulatory functions in hematopoies, and regions where they bind are less prone to be displaced by A1ETO, representing preferential sites for the protein.
Researchers investigated the role of Leishmania donovani histone acetyltransferase H2 (H2) in regulating cell cycle-specific transcriptional activation of cyclins. H2 was found to be essential for cell growth and survival, with H2-depleted cells displaying growth and cell cycle defects. Real-time PCR and DNA microarray analyses revealed downregulation of cyclins CYC4 and CYC9 were responsible for S and G2 phase defects in H2-depleted cells. CY4 and C9 have their own promoters, which are activated in a cell-dependent manner. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and real-time PCR suggested these promoters were activated in a cell-dependent manner. Nuclear run-on analyses confirmed CYC and C were transcriptionally activated from their promoters at specific cell stages. Two tiers of gene regulation were identified: transcription of polycistronic units primarily initiates at divergent switch regions, and a subset of genes have their own promoters activated in a cell-dependent manner, sensitive to H10 acylation levels. H-depletion resulted in downregulation of expression. The study presents the first data on cell-specific activation of promoters in trypanosomatids, uncovering new facets of gene regulation in this parasite, emphasizing the importance of stringent modulation of CY4 and C expression in Leishmania. H10 acylation was enriched in divergent regions, with lower levels in H2-depleted cells, but a 50% decrease did not impact gene expression, suggesting a role in transcriptional activation from divergent regions is unclear.
Researchers investigated how people infer others' intentions in social transactions using a computational model of behavioral data from an economic game where 16 pairs of volunteers interacted as "player" or "adviser". The player performed a probabilistic learning task and received information from a visual chart, while the adviser issued recommendations with varying incentives to provide helpful or misleading information. A meta-Bayesian framework found players' behavior was best explained by hierarchical learning, inferring volatility of advisers' intentions to optimize predictions about advice validity. Volatility estimates affected trial-by-trial decisions, with participants relying more on advice when believing the adviser's intentions were stable. The model predicted interpersonal reactivity index scores, ratings of advisers' helpfulness, and self-reports on strategy. Results suggest humans employ generative models to infer changing intentions, use volatility to inform decision-making, and integrate advice with non-social information. Players who interacted with advisers with changing intentions to maximize winnings showed pronounced values, indicating coupled learning levels and volatility updating advice accuracy. The study found hierarchical learning and translation of beliefs to decisions, with mapping from beliefs to choices increasingly deterministic when adviser intentions were considered stable. Players' updating reflected advisers' policy and willingness to take suggestions, perceiving stable intentions over time and weighting advice when predicting outcomes.
Scrub typhus, a disease endemic in Asia, has been observed in urban areas of Seoul, South Korea, with 88 cases identified between 2010-2013. The majority of infections occurred in mountainous areas, city parks, and near residences. Chigger mites collected from suspected sites were identified as Helenicula miyawai and Leptotrombidium scutare, with 87.4% being H. miyawai, which yielded Orientia tsutsamushi Bory strain. Patients showed mild clinical features with low APACHE score, low complication rate, and no hypokalemia. The study confirms indigenous urban scrub typhus in Seoul with H. miyawai mites infected with O. tsugamushi within the city. Patients visited hospitals due to fever and 96.2% had characteristic maculopular rash. Risk behaviors included walking, gardening, playing and harvesting. The high proportion of H. miyawai in high incidence areas combined with O. tsamushi carriage suggests this mite plays a role in human infection. The study highlights the need to consider urban scrub typhus as a differential febrile disease and target for prevention in endemic areas.
Researchers investigated the role of HENN-1, a Caenorhabditis elegans HEN1 RNA-methyl-transferase homolog, in RNA interference pathways, specifically its impact on 21U and 26 RNAs in the germline. The study revealed differential effects of HENN-1 on the two pathways, with 21U RNAs, or piRNAs, showing mild stability despite loss of methylation, and introduction of artificial 21U target not destabilizing non-methylated 21 RNAs. In contrast, most 26 RNAs displayed reduced stability and increased 3'-uridylation frequencies in response to HENN-1 loss. ERGO-1-bound 26 RNAs were modified by HENN1, while ALG-3/AL-4-bound 26GAs were not. Global expression analysis of henn-1 mutants showed mild effects, including downregulation of germl-expressed genes, suggesting indirect effects on gene expression apart from reduced 26 RNA levels. Loss of HENN1 resulted in modest effects on 26 dependent 22 RNAs and gene levels, and downregulation of genes implicated in germl exRNAi and cosuppression. Methylation of ERGO-bound 26 RNAs by HENN1 had a stabilizing effect, preventing non-templated uridylation. The findings refine understanding of endogenous RNAi in C. elegans and roles of Hen1 enzymes in these pathways.
A genome-wide association study combined with high-throughput glycomics analysis of 2,705 individuals in three cohorts identified common variants in Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1α (HNF1α) and fucosyltransferase genes FUT6 and FUT8 that influence N-glycan levels in human plasma. HNFα and its downstream HNF4 regulate the expression of key fucyltransferase and fucose biosynthesis genes. HNFα is necessary and sufficient to drive the expression of these genes in hepatic cells, revealing a new role as a master transcriptional regulator of multiple stages in fucylation. Alterations in glycosylation have been observed in numerous physiological and pathological processes, including cancer, and changes in levels of fucylated glycans have been associated with several diseases. HNFα regulates the biosynthesis of GDP-fucose and expression of fucyltransferase genes, including FUT6. Knockdown of HNFα resulted in 50% reduction in F6 transcript levels, suggesting HNFα regulates F6 expression in HepG2 cells. The study implicates HNFα in the regulation of immunity, embryonic development, protein folding, and molecular mechanisms underlying cancer, coronary disease, metabolic, and inflammatory disorders. The identified genes involved in fucylation indicate the addition of this sugar may be a rate-limiting step in N-glycan synthesis, with HNFα strongly associated with proportions of plasma N-glycans.
Centromeres are crucial attachment points between the genome and cytoskeleton, binding kinetochores which attach to spindles and move chromosomes. The DNA sequence of centromeres has little role in perpetuating kinetochores, suggesting epigenetic transmission of genetic information. RNA transcribed from centromeres remains bound within kinetore, thought to be part of epetic marking. A study of maize CENPC, a key kinetore protein, shows DNA binding is conferred by a localized 122 amino acid region, sensitive to single-stranded RNA. Long single-stranded nucleic acids promote CEN to DNA binding, matching RNAs on kineto in vivo. Removal of binding module causes delocalization of CEN. Data suggest centric RNA recruits CEN to kinet by altering DNA characteristics. Maize centere repeats are undermethylated, transcribed to stable RNAs, 40-200nt, single-stranded, proposed to serve structural template for kinet proteins. CEN has DNA and RNA capacities, localized to exon, required for centere localization. RNA facilitates CEN to DNA binding in vitro, a mechanism for RNA in centere specification. Single-stranded RNA has positive effect, centric RNA as epigen mark, mediating assembly. CEN recruited by protein-protein, converted by centric RNA. Human centrom contain similar RNAs, RNAse delocalizes CEN, suppression impairs kinet complex, supporting RNA stabilizes kinet proteins. Drosila CEN targets CEN3, CEN3 targets CEN, kinet replication self-reinforcing, CEN works with CEN3 to replicate centrom. In species like maize, cent DNA recruits kinet with epetic marks.
Genetic variants associated with birth weight, childhood obesity, and childhood body mass index have been identified through genome-wide association studies, and the placenta plays a critical role in fetal development and postnatal health. Analysis of the placental transcriptome and expression quantitative trait loci revealed substantial enrichment of genetic variants associated with birth weight, childhood obesity, and childhood body mass index, with placental expression quantitative trait loci contributing significantly to both birth and childhood phenotypes. Eight and six transcripts colocalized with birth weight and childhood obesity risk loci, respectively. The study demonstrates that placental transcription in utero plays a key role in determining postnatal body size and may hold possibilities for therapeutic interventions to prevent childhood obesity. Placental expression quantitative trait loci are enriched to a greater extent for childhood obesity and body mass index genetic hits than expression trait loci from other tissues, including adipose and liver. Over 3,000 cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait loci were discovered, demonstrating the placenta is transcriptionally active and largely controlled by fetal genetics. The findings support the hypothesis that genetically controlled in utero expression patterns influence birth weight, childhood obesity, and body mass, and highlight the placenta's role in determining weight at birth and childhood.
Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a chronic disease that occurs in some individuals after successful treatment for visceral leishiasis, with a prevalence of 10-20% in India and 50-60% in Sudan. A study in Malda district, West Bengal, detected 26 PKDL cases with a prevalence of 27.5% among antileishial antibody positive cases, using active surveillance and PCR-based diagnosis. Three diagnostic tools were compared, with PCR showing high sensitivity of 88.46% for confirmation. Patients were treated with sodium stibogluconate or miltefosine and followed for two years, with most lesions persisting after treatment and disappearing within 6-12 months, but reappearing in two cases after 1.5 years of miltefosine treatment. A significant number of PKDL patients remain undiagnosed without active surveys, highlighting the need for such surveys in endemic areas to eliminate Kala-azar. The PCR method is helpful in confirming diagnosis and can be achieved at district or state level, but further studies with larger samples are needed to determine if PKDL patients are free from parasites after treatment and require longer treatment periods.
Bacteria have evolved inducible genetic programs to face stress, including competence, which enables genetic transformation and horizontal gene transfer. In Streptococcus pneumoniae, competence development is synchronized within the population and depends on exported Competence Stimulating Peptide (CSP), generating a positive feedback loop. Research found that competence relies on a self-activated fraction arising via a growth-dependent mechanism, with CSP bound to cells during the event. The rate of development corresponds to propagation by contact between activated and quiescent cells. A two-step cell-contact mechanism was validated through co-cultivation of strains with altered CSP production or response. Membrane protein ComD retains CSP, limiting its diffusion in the medium. Competence initiator cells originate stochastically in response to stress, forming a subpopulation transmitting CSP by cell contact. Population-wide pneumoccal development is a two-step: initial cells switch to CSP overexpression, then induce competence in the population through CSP transmission between cells via collision. Spontaneous development at the single cell level should explore autocrine development stochasticity. Neo-synthesized CSP is retained on competent cells, a general pneumoc feature central to cell-contact mechanism. These processes promote horizontal gene transfer, genome plasticity, adaptation, evasion of vaccines, antibiotics, and immune defenses. Competence develops transiently during exponential growth, linked to metabolic state, renamed growth-time dependent mechanism.
Human papillomavirus type 16 L2 protein acts as a chaperone to ensure the viral genome traffics from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network and eventually the nucleus where replication occurs. The L2/vDNA complex must translocate across intracellular membranes to reach the nucleus. Researchers developed a system to detect membrane translocation of L2-Bir from incoming virions and found that L2 translocation requires transport to the TGN and is strictly dependent on entry into mitosis, coinciding with mitotic entry in synchronized cells. Cell cycle arrest causes retention of L/vDNA at the TGN, only release and progression past G2 enables translocation and infection. Microscopy of Ed-labeled vDNA reveals a rapid shift in vDNA localization during early mitosis, egressing from TGN to pericentriolar location, accumulating through prometaphase, and associating with condensed chromosomes by metaphase and anaphase, ensuring distribution into daughter nuclei. Mutations in L2 chromatin binding region blocked translocation, suggesting dependence on chromatin binding during prometase. Translocation is dependent on L2 CBR and an unknown mitotic tethering factor available during prometase. Furin cleavage of L2 is essential for proper trafficking to TGN and proposed membrane penetration post-TGN localization. The study provides insight into HPV tropism for mitotic keratinocytes.
A mathematical framework is presented to measure the relative transmissibility of one strain of a pathogen compared to another using data from competitive mixtures experiments in animals co-infected with a mixture of two strains. The model is applied to influenza experiments in ferrets to demonstrate the approach, assessing relative transmissibility between strains in contexts such as novel strain emergence, pandemic events, and neuraminidase inhibitor resistance. The framework estimates transmission fitness and inoculum size, providing critical for determining outbreak epidemiology and intervention impact. The method has wide applicability in influenza research, including seasonal, pandemic, and neuraminidase-resistant interactions. Estimation of within-host reproduction is a key focus, with improvements in competitive-mixture experimental design, including use of multiple ferrets and derivation of successfully infecting units transferred. The approach is applicable to other pathogens, considering within-host dynamics and competitive effects of co-infection. Observations of transmission mixtures allow measurement of relative transmissibility, with previous studies demonstrating sustained transmission over multiple host generations. The framework provides estimates for epidemiological models, emergence, and spread of resistant strains, informing intervention strategies such as neuraminase inhibitor distribution.
Light is a crucial environmental cue regulating plant growth and development, while abscisic acid (ABA) is a hormone involved in various phases of the plant life cycle and responses to environmental stresses. The integration of light signals with endogenous ABA pathways for adaptation remains poorly understood. BBX21, a B-box protein, regulates seedling photomorphogenesis and is also involved in ABA signaling, acting upstream of ABA INSENSITIVE genes and ELONGATED HYPOOTYL5 (HY5) in controlling seed germination. HY5 directly activates ABI5 expression and interacts with BB21, which negatively regulates ABI5 by interfering with HY5 binding to the ABI5 promoter. ABI5 also activates its own expression, while BB21 negatively regulates this activity by interacting with ABI. The study indicates BB21 coordinates with HY5 and ABI on the ABI promoter, integrating light and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. HY5 regulation of ABI5 represents integration of light and ABA during seed germination and early development. Multiple transcription factors in light signaling regulate ABA by regulating ABI expression, with BB21 negatively regulating ABI5 by interfering with HY binding. Light and ABA are cues controlling seed germination and development, with plants integrating external signals vital for survival. The cross-talk between light and ABA is starting to be understood, with ABI3 and ABI5 playing roles in photomogenesis and ABA inhibiting hypocotyl elongation. Several transcription factors bind the ABI promoter, with HY mediating ABA responses in seed germination and development by activating ABI expression.
The Mediator complex, a conserved in eukaryotes, plays a crucial role in regulating RNA polymerase II and has been studied in the pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. The Middle domain subunit Med31, Head subunit Med20, and Srb/Med13 from the Kinase domain were focused on, showing shared roles with yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schosaccharomyces pombe in stress response and gene expression. However, C. albicans Mediator has additional roles in transcription of virulence genes, including morphogenesis and adhesins. Med31, Med20, and Srb/Med contribute to key virulence, filamentation, and biofilm formation, with ALS1 being a target of Med31 for biofilm development. The roles of Med31 and Srb/Med in adhesin-encoding genes differ between S. cerevisiae and C. albicans, acting as repressors of FLO in S. cereiae and activators of ALS in C. albicans. Phenotypic analysis showed Mediator subunits roles in C. albicans pathogenesis, filament growth, and biofilm formation. Data suggests distinct Med-dependent control of adhesion between S. cereiae and C albicans. C. albicans Mediator has conserved functions with S. cereiae and Sch. pombe but also regulates expression of virulence-related genes, notably adhesins. Med31 is required for wild-type expression of FGR and ALS families in C. albicans.
Researchers investigated the degree to which the biofilm-specific cellular state and its genetic determinants contribute to the hyper-tolerant phenotype of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to antibiotics. Using genome-wide functional profiling of a complex, heterogeneous population of Pseudas aeruginosa in biofilm and plankton growth with tobramycin, they quantified the contribution of each locus to antibiotic tolerance. The study identified sets of mutations that contribute to antibiotic tolerance predominantly in the biofilm or plankton setting, offering insights into the differences and similarities between biofilm and plankic tolerance. A substantial contribution of the cellular state to antibiotic tolerance of biofilms was found, providing a foundation for the development of novel therapeutics against P. aeruginosa biofilm-associated infections. The experimental design recapitulated behaviors observed in clinical isolates, including the emergence of quorum-deficient mutants. The relative importance of each gene in P. aerugin to fitness in the presence of tobrycin was examined as a function of whether the bacterium is in a biofilm or plankton. While there is overlap between loci modulating antibiotic tolerance in biofilm and plankic cells, the importance of most genes is state-specific, with the majority of mutants having strongest advantages in biofilm having weak advantages in plankic. The study provides a comprehensive examination of antibiotic tolerance in different cellular states and the extent to which plankic and biofilm tolerances share mechanisms, offering insights for novel therapeutic development against P. aeruginosa biofilm infections.
Researchers have developed a Flexible Algorithm for Model Selection (FoS) to analyze complex biological systems with numerous interacting components and limited information on essential dynamics. The algorithm evaluates multiple models against experimental data to identify relevant factors and processes, addressing limitations of existing methods that compare preselected models or rely on exhaustive searches. FoS incorporates local and non-local search methods to prevent local minima and accounts for structurally similar processes. Tested on simulated and experimental data, FoS showed flexibility handling different structures, analyzing cell proliferation of CD4 and CD8 T cells under various conditions. Results indicated reduced proliferation potential in 3D cultures compared to suspension. FoS is applicable to various biological problems, providing a tool for data-oriented evaluation of complex spaces. The algorithm contributes to research by handling large model spaces and diverse structures, enabling data-driven inference of parameters and processes. It overcomes limitations of existing algorithms that rely on exhaustive searches or preselected models, offering a systematic description of experimentally observed dynamics. The development of FoS addresses the need for efficient algorithms to search large spaces, providing a useful tool for complex systems analysis.
A 12-month follow-up study was conducted in Bolivia to evaluate the treatment response of Trypanosoma cruzi infected children to benznidazole (BN) and identify potential biomarkers for treatment efficacy. The study involved 103 seropositive school-aged children who received BN treatment, with 73 completing the regimen and three experiencing side effects. Serology, conventional PCR, and quantitative PCR were performed, and Th1/Th2Th17 cytokine levels were determined. Results showed 11% of children were non-reactive, 42% ambiguous, and 47% reactive. IL-17 levels were significantly higher in seropositive children before treatment and decreased to normal levels after one year. IL-17 levels correlated with parasite counts detected by qPCR and were higher in non-reactive subjects at 12 months, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for detecting persistent infection and chronic inflammation. The study aimed to address the lack of information on treatment follow-up and efficacy in children, as current diagnosis methods are limited in evaluating treatment response. BN treatment efficacy may be influenced by factors other than pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, particularly in non-reactive individuals. Identifying reasons for treatment failure requires further study of host and parasite factors.
Neisseria meningitidis, the primary causative agent of bacterial meningitis, has a genome rich repetitive DNA with 2% occupied by diminutive transposon called Coria elements. Bioinformatic analysis defined eight subtypes with distinct ends and transcriptional analysis revealed two encode strong promoters. The strongest promoter's activity is dictated by a polymorphism at the right end of the element. Coria elements drive transcription of adjacent genes and express non-coding RNAs. Pair-wise comparisons between meningoccal genomes showed more than two-thirds of Coria elements maintain their subtype at any locus due to recombinational switching between elements. Upon switching, a new allele spreads through the population by natural transformation, potentially representing a new mechanism for phase variation. The strain-to-strain variability and number of strong promoters allows for widespread effects within the population. The study provides a resource to predict transcriptional effects of particular subtypes at a given locus. Natural variation in Coria distribution may contribute to development of hypervirulent lineages and disease. Coria end switching modulates gene transcription under influence by recombination, with differences correlated to clonal complexes. Remaining ORFs encode transcription activators, lipoproteins, and hypothetical proteins. The homogeneity of Coria sequences suggests recent creation in a burst of transposition, not degenerate remnants of transposition events.
Chae1 and Vel1 regulate toxin production, virulence, oxidative stress, and development in the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus. They are orthologs of LaeA and VeA, which coordinate secondary metabolism and differentiation in response to light signals in Asperillus spp. Chae1 and Vel1 mutants have reduced toxin levels in the dark compared to wild type, while overexpression of Ch1 and Vel1 increases toxin production. Expression of toxin biosynthetic genes Tox1 is upregulated in the dark in wild type, but reduced in Ch1 and Vel mutants. Deletion of Chae or Vel reduces tolerance to H2O2 and expression of catalase gene CAT3. Ch1 and Vel mutants show decreased aerial hyal growth, increased asexual sporulation, and female sterility. Chae overexpression strains are female sterile, while Vel overexpression strains are more fertile. Ch1 and Vel repress 1,8-dihydroxynaphthalene melanin biosynthesis, and melanization is enhanced in mutants and reduced in overexpression strains. Ch1 and Vel positively regulate toxin biosynthesis, pathogenicity, superulence, oxidative stress, sexual development, and aerial hyal growth, and negatively control melanin biosynthesis and asexual differentiation.
Researchers investigated the mechanism of functional asymmetry in bacterial Nav channels using non-equilibrium simulations and two-dimensional unperturbed landscapes. The results showed that two or three extracellular K+ ions can block the entrance to the selectivity filter in the presence of inward forces, but not outward, due to an unstable local minimum in the equilibrium free-energy landscape. In contrast, Na+ ions move favorably through the filter as a unit in a "knock-on" mechanism in both directions. The work required to break K+ block matches experimentally measured potentials for bacterial channels to induce inward K+ currents. The mechanism of ion selectivity differs from those derived from crystal structures or equilibrium landscapes and is consistent with electrophysiological measurements. Non-equilibrium simulations suggest a "pass" configuration for potassium ions blocks the selectivity filter at negative voltages, preventing K+ permeation. Molecular dynamics predicted unpert-free barrier differences for Na+ and K permeation of 1-3 kcal/mol, consistent with experimental PNa/PK permeability ratios. The study provides insight into selective ion permeation in bacterial channels, illustrating the importance of non-equilibrium factors in understanding ion selectivity mechanisms.
A study compared the intracellular spread of rabies virus in furious and paralytic forms of canine rabies, measuring viral antigen within neuronal cell bodies and RNA levels. The amount of rabies antigen in cell processes was quantitatively assessed in 10 naturally infected dogs, 5 with furious and 5 paralytic forms, at different levels of spinal cord, brain stem, and cerebrum. Results showed a decrease in rabies antigen in cell processes in a rostral direction, consistent with replication in cell body and transport to processes. Greater amounts of antigen were seen in cell processes in furious dogs compared to paralytic at all levels. This difference remained when comparing neurons with similar antigen, percentages, and anatomic levels with 100% positive neurons. The findings suggest intracellular transport may be slower in paraly form, resulting in slower propagation. Possible mechanisms involve host-specific differences in intracellular transport, potentially cytokine-mediated due to greater inflammation in paraly form. Distribution of viral antigen showed caud-rostral polarity in both forms, from spinal cord to cerebrum. The study extends previous results on antigen in neuronal bodies and RNA, demonstrating slower viral spread in paraly form.
Researchers investigated the role of the zinc-finger protein CTC in Drosophila, specifically its binding sites and organisation within the Bithorax complex. Using chromatin immunopurification with genomic array analysis, they identified CTC binding sites in representative regions of the Drosila genome, including the 3-Mb Adh region, the Bithorax complex, and Antennedia complex. A robust CTC binding consensus sequence was constructed, revealing CTC sites mapping to known insulator elements Mcp, Fab-6, and Fab-8 in the Bithax complex. Additional presumptive insulators, Fab2, Fab3, and Fab4, were identified, correlating with regulatory domain boundaries. CTC was found associated with all known or predicted insulators in the Bithax complex, except Fab7, suggesting a common CTF-dependent mechanism. Comparison with Polycomb target sites and histone modification supported the model of Bithax regulation. The findings indicate that CTC binds a single consensus sequence in both Drosila and vertebrates and propose all insulators in the Bithax complex function in a CTF-dependent manner, with the exception of Fab7. The study utilised genetic and molecular characterisation of Bithax transcription regulation for analysis of CTF function, demonstrating insulating activity of Fab8 is dependent on CTF.
Molecular recognition is a fundamental process in biochemistry where enzymes undergo conformational changes upon substrate binding to facilitate catalysis. Researchers investigated the induced-fit mechanism of peptide deformylase using a slow-binding inhibitor, actin, and crystal structures of initial, intermediate, and final states were solved. Ligand-induced reshaping of a hydrophobic pocket drives active site closure, which is stabilized by additional interactions. Biochemical analyses reconstructed the sequence of events from encounter to key-lock state. The study integrates biophysical, computational, and kinetic analyses to understand the slow-binding mechanism, applicable to receptor-ligand interactions. Actin, a slow-binding inhibitor of peptide deformylase, exhibits unique inhibitory properties, including potency and long-lasting effects. Crystallographic analysis involving enzyme variants and motions documented binding of unnatural inhibitors, but actin closely mimics the substrate and transition state. The slow kinetics of inhibitor binding is puzzling compared to catalysis, explained by a conal effect during hydrogen bond formation, aligning the substrate and stabilizing the enzyme-lig complex. The study provides a detailed mechanism of induced-fit at atomic resolution, allowing a coherent reconstruction of the sequence of events from encounter to the key-lock state of the enzyme.
Researchers investigated the role of the thalamus in relaying sensory information to the cerebral cortex, focusing on the influence of cortical feedback on thalamic cells during sensory processing. Using dynamic-clamp techniques in thalamic slices, they implemented a hybrid retino-thalamic-cortical pathway with biological and simulated circuits, mimicking synaptic bombardment of cortical origin with stochastic excitatory and inhibitory conductances. The study revealed a novel mechanism where transfer efficiency of sensory transmission depends on the number of thalamocortical cells, statistics of corticothalamic synaptic bombardment, and correlation between converging thal relay cells. Results showed that retinocortical signal efficiency increases when correlation across thal cells decreases, suggesting transfer could be amplified when cells become desynchronized by cortical feedback. The proposed mechanism could direct attention to specific thalamic subassemblies and select input to cortex according to descending cortically-defined priors. Cortically-induced synaptic noise had distinct effects on individual and mesoscopic organization of thal cells, with active decorrelation of background activity providing optimization for retinortical signal transfer. Stochastic facilitation at the thalamic population enhances sensory transfer in presence of decorrelated corticogenic feedback and may be the basis for attentional modulation of sensory signals at thal level. Systematic exploration of parametric space defined excitatory and inhibitory conductances led to definition of optimal noise, presenting advantages over modulation by neuromodulators, being dynamic, fast, and topographically precise.
Researchers have identified a critical role for the putative DNA demethylase NMAD-1 in regulating meiosis in Caenorhabditis elegans, with nmad-1 mutants exhibiting reduced fertility and defects in prophase I meiosis, leading to reduced embryo production and increased incidence of males due to defective chromosomal segregation. Nuclear staging is disorganized, cohesin complex is mislocalized, and chromosomes are improperly condensed or lost by the end of diakinesis. RNA sequencing revealed reduced induction of DNA replication and DNA damage genes during meiosis, coupled with delayed replication, impaired repair, and increased apoptosis of maturing oocytes. NMAD1 binds to multiple proteins regulating DNA repair and replication, including topoisomerase TOP2, and co-localizes with TOP2 on chromatin, with majority of TOP2 binding dependent on NMAD1. This suggests NMAD1 functions at replication sites to regulate DNA and repair during meiosis. Phenotypic and cytological analysis of nmad1 deletion strain showed impaired fertility, increased incidence of males, elevated RAD51 foci, and reduced replication rates, indicating NM1 demethylation activity at DNA is central to its role in meiosis. NMAD1 has been identified as a 6mA demethylase, proposed as conserved in silkworm and mice, however due to low levels of 6 DNA methylation in C elegans its substrate remains undetermined.
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a ubiquitous pathogen that can cause disability in newborns and serious diseases in immunocompromised patients. Researchers have identified adipocyte plasma membrane-associated protein (AAP) as a novel modulator in the early stage of HCM infection. AAP is necessary for HCM infection in epithelial and fibroblast cells, with knockdown of AAP expression significantly reducing HCM infection. Ectopic expression of human AAP in cells refractory to HCM infection, such as canine MDCK and murine NIH/3T cells, promoted HCM infection. Reduction in viral immediate early gene transcription and delayed nucleus translocation of tegument pp65 were detected in AAP-deficient cells. Biochemical studies suggest AAP participates in HCM infection through interaction with gH/g containing glycoprotein complexes at low pH and mediating translocation of tegument pp65. Results indicate AAP functions as a modulator promoting HCM infection in multiple cell types and plays a role in the complex HCM infection mechanism. Overexpression of AAP enhanced HCM infection in human cells and promoted HCM entry in less susceptible canine MDCK and murine NIH3T3 cells, leading to increased immediate early gene transcription, a prerequisite for initiation of lytic cycle.
Researchers have developed a minimal model that combines cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic elements to understand how instructive and stochastic events inform cell decisions in hematopoies. The model suggests cytokine-mediated receptor positive feedback can induce a switch-like response to external stimuli during multilineage differentiation, providing robustness to bipotent and committed states while protecting progenitors from noise-induced differentiation or decommitment. The results support both instructive and stochastic theories of commitment, where cell fates are driven by lineage-specific transcription factors, but cytokine signaling biases lineage commitment by regulating noisy cell-fate decisions. Simulations show the kinetics of differentiation depend on the starting progenitor state and route of commitment. The model agrees with lineage-specific receptor expression kinetics from microarray experiments, providing a framework to integrate classical and alternative commitment paths in hematopoies. The study demonstrates extrinsic regulation plays a role in instructing lineage choice and how cells respond to conflicting extracellular cues, underscoring the need to understand how extracellular cues influence hematies. Lineage-specific transcription factors and cytokine receptors play critical roles, with transcription factors identified as master regulators of commitment and differentiation. The model shows cell-fate decisions can be stochastic but external cues strongly bias this stochasticity, instructing cells to specific lineages, supporting an instructive role for cytokines in hematies.
Researchers have used electron cryo-microscopy to determine the ultrastructure of Bunyamwera virus, a prototypic member of the Orthobunavirus genus within the Bunyaviridae family, which poses a threat to human and animal health. The study reveals that Bunamwera virions have a pleomorphic shape with a locally ordered lattice of glycoprotein spikes protruding 18 nm from the viral membrane, becoming disordered in acidic environments. A 3D model of the trimeric fusion glycoprotein spike shows a unique tripod-like arrangement with protein-protein contacts between spikes at membrane-proximal regions and intra-spike at membrane-distal regions. The glycoprotein consists mainly of a putative class-II fusion glycoprotein, differing from previously observed fusion glycoprotein arrangements. The study provides evidence of a pH-dependent conformation change during orthobunaviral entry into host cells and a structural blueprint for this group of emerging pathogens. The sequences of BUN glycoproteins are conserved with pathogenic relatives, sharing 54% and 53% similarity with SBV and OROV. The results provide the first 3D structural analysis of an orthunavirus, supporting a unique mode of fusion glycoprotein oligomerization. Orthunaviruses constitute a structually unique group, with BUN displaying pleomorphism and a distinctive tripod-like spike structure, contrasting icosahedral phleboviruses. The data provides a structural blueprint for this group of medically important viruses.
A genome-wide association study was conducted on anterior chamber depth, a key anatomical risk factor for primary angle closure glaucoma, in 5,308 population-based individuals of Asian descent. A significant association was observed at a variant within AB5, which was linked to increased risk of primary angle glaucoma in a separate case-control study of 4,276 cases and 18,801 controls. The association strengthened when controls with open angles were included, suggesting genetic variants influencing anterior chamber dimensions contribute to primary angle glaucoma risk. AB5 is expressed in anterior structures relevant to primary glaucoma, such as the iris, ciliary body, and lens. Primary angle glaucoma remains a major cause of irreversible blindness, particularly in Asian countries, with up to 80% of estimated 15 million afflicted resident in Asia. The study provides clues to genetic mechanisms underlying this major cause of blindness and suggests re-sequencing the region may identify novel polymorphisms related to pathogenesis. The findings support anatomical risk factors of susceptibility, where shallower anterior chamber depth is a clinical feature predisposing to crowded anterior segment and increasing primary glaucoma risk.
Researchers have identified conserved developmental enhancers, called bilaterian conserved regulatory elements (Bres), between deuterostomes and protomes, which share a common toolkit of transcription factors and signaling pathways. Bres show sequence and synteny conservation, reflecting conserved patterns of transcription factor binding sites, and are predicted to act as response elements to signaling pathways. These enhancers drive expression of transcriptional repressors in the vertebrate central nervous system. The small number of identified Bres suggests extensive rewiring of cis-regulation between protome and deostome clades, but additional Bres may be discovered as understanding of cis-regulatory logic and sample of bilian genomes grows. Bres encode complex patterns of transcription factor sites, with Bore1 functioning as a Bmp responsive element and driving expression in the developing nervous system. The discovery of Bres offers a new avenue for exploring developmental logic encoded in the genome and its evolution. Further research is needed to determine the true number of Bres and what makes them unique, as current understanding is limited by tools and sample size of bilian genomes. As more genomes are sequenced, understanding of cis-regulatory improves, and screening is refined, more bilian conserved elements will be discovered, revealing the extent of cis-reg sequence and function underlying animal development.
Researchers investigated the impact of vaccination on the intrahost diversity of H3N2 influenza viruses, using next-generation sequencing of patient-derived viruses from a randomized, controlled trial of vaccine efficacy. The study found 166 cases of H3N2 influenza over three seasons and obtained whole genome data for 119 samples, identifying intrah single nucleotide variants at ≥1% frequency. Phylogenetic analysis of hemagglutinin and neuraminase sequences showed no stratification by pre-season HAI and NAI titer. Most intrah single nucleotide variants were rare and few were found in more than one individual, with most samples having fewer than 15 single nucleotide variants across the genome. The level of diversity did not vary with day of sampling, vaccination status, or pre-season antibody titer. The results indicate that seasonal vaccination has little impact on intrah diversity in natural infection and vaccine-induced immunity may only be a minor contributor to antigenic drift at local scales. No differences were found between vaccinated and unvaccinated populations with respect to genome-wide or antigen diversity in three H3N2 seasons. The study suggests that non-sterizing immunity may not select for novel antigenic variants as previously thought, contributing less to larger patterns of influenza evolution.
Researchers investigated the immune response of aged mice to live attenuated Leishmania donovani centrin knock-out parasites (LdCen/-) against visceral leishmaniasis, a severe disease caused by the protozoan parasite Leishmania donani. Analysis of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from young and aged mice infected with LC/- showed enhanced innate effector responses, augmenting CD4+ Th1 cell function. Splenic dendritic cells from LC/- infected mice revealed pro-inflammatory cytokine induction and downregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Immunization with LC/- induced IgG2a antibodies, lymphoproliferative response, and leishicidal activity in young and aged mice. Upon challenge with virulent L. donani, LC/- immunized mice displayed multifunctional Th1-type and cytotoxic CD8 cells, correlating to reduced parasite burden. Although LC/- induced a significant response in aged mice, it was diminished compared to young mice, with reduced T and B cell activation in aged animals correlating to less protection. LC/- immunization protected young and aged mice against virulent L. donani via enhanced Th1 response and nitric oxide production, with aged mice showing lower adaptive response. Overall, LC/- generated a protective but inferior immune response in aged mice against visceral leishiasis compared to young mice.
Researchers investigated the role of enterovirus capsid proteins in viral tropism, acid sensitivity, and optimal growth by generating chimeras between EV-D68, a respiratory enterovirus, and EV-D94, an enteric enterovirus. The study found that capsid proteins determine acid sensitivity and tropism in cell lines and tissues, and participate in determining optimal growth temperature, with EV94 adaptation relying on single mutations in VP1, while constructs with EV68 capsid could not adapt to higher temperatures. The results showed that EV68 maintains residual binding capacity after acid treatment despite loss of infectivity, and non-structural proteins modulate the innate immune response in tissues. The study concluded that capsid proteins are necessary and sufficient to determine acid sensitivity, restricted tropism, and growth, while innate immunity is modulated by non-structural proteins. The findings clarify the diverse biophysical and immunogenic roles of capsid proteins in pathogenesis and may guide the search for therapeutic targets, providing insights into the genetic regions responsible for differences in key determinants of viral viability, including acid sensitivity, optimal temperature, tissue tropism, and induction of immunity. The viable chimeric EV94 expressing EV68 caps-encoding genes demonstrated that capsid-encoding genes determine viral tropism and acid sensitivity.
Herpes Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) glycoprotein gE-gI is a transmembrane Fc receptor that binds human immunoglobulin G (Ig) and participates in antibody bipolar bridging, a process where antigen-binding fragments bind viral antigens while Fc binds gE. The fate of viral antigens associated with gE-bound Ig was unknown, but research showed cells expressing gE and viral antigen HSV-1 gD endocytosed anti-g Ig and g in a gE-dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. This suggests gE mediates clearance of infected cell surfaces of anti-viral Ig and antigens to evade Ig-mediated responses, representing a mechanism for viral Fc receptors in immune evasion and pathogenesis. An in vitro model was developed to study internalization and trafficking of antibody bipolar bridging complexes using 4-D confocal fluorescence imaging with transferrin and epidermal growth factor. Cells co-expressing HSV-1 gE and gD were incubated with Ig that could or could not form bridged complexes. Results indicate gE can mediate clearance of infected cell surfaces of anti-viral Ig and viral antigens, allowing the virus to evade Ig-mediated responses. The study used an in vitro system to monitor trafficking of bipolar bridged complexes involving HSV Fc receptor gE, antigen gD, and Ig, showing cells expressing gE and gD endocytosed anti-g Ig and g in a g-dependent process, resulting in lysosomal localization. This represents a general mechanism for viral Fc receptors in immune evasion and viral pathogenesis, allowing the virus to clear cell surfaces of viral antigens and anti-viral Ig.
Researchers investigated the transcriptome of protoscoleces of Echinococcus granulosus to understand how it interacts with hosts and adapts metabolically. Using Roche 454 sequencing and in silico secretome analysis, 26,514 non-redundant sequences were generated, with 22,910 mapped to the E. granulosus genome and 17,705 within coding regions. Of 2,280 predicted excretory-secretory proteins, 138 were involved in carbohydrate metabolism, 124 in protein metabolism, and 11 in glycolysis/gluogenesis pathways. Antigenic proteins, molecular chaperones, and proteases were also identified. The study revealed proteins enriched in development-related pathways, including TGF-β and insulin pathways. The findings provide insight into parasite adaptation to hosts and potential targets for hydatid disease treatment. The transcriptome of E. granulosus protoscoleces showed abundant non-coding transcripts, upregulated fermentative pathways, and platyhelmin-specific products. A total of 2,280 secretory proteins were predicted and validated against experimentally identified sequences. The study deepens understanding of host-parasite interactions and adds knowledge on genomics of E. granulosus, providing valuable information for novel intervention targets for hydat treatment and control.
The assimilation of nitrate is tightly regulated in microorganisms and plants, with the transcriptional activation of nitrate assimilatory genes in Asperillus nidans involving the interaction between pathway-specific transcription factor NirA and exportin KapK/CRM1. In the absence of nitrate, NirA is predominantly cytosolic and methionine 169 in the nuclear sequence is oxidized to methion sulfoxide, dependent on flavin monooxygenase Fmo. Exposure to nitrate leads to reduction of NirA-Met169 to Met169, independent of thioredoxin and classical methion sulfox reductases. Replacement of Met169 by isoleine leads to partial loss of Nir activity and insensitivity to Fmo-mediated export, while replacement by alanine transforms the protein into a permanently active factor. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis shows Met oxidation leads to a change in Nir conformation, with the nitrate responsive domain masking the NES in the presence of nitrate, restricting active NirA to the nucleus. In the absence of nitrate, Met169 oxidation leads to loss of protection, NES exposure, and relocation of inactive Nir to cytosol. The oxidation status of conserved methine within NirA is correlated with subcellular distribution and transcriptional competence, with Fmo specifically determining the oxidation status of NirA-NES, controlling nuclear-cytosolic shuttling but not transcriptional activity.
Researchers analyzed mammalian voltage-gated sodium channels to understand how functional constraints shape their evolution. The primary function of these channels is to allow action potential propagation, which requires tightly constrained properties. There are nine genes encoding these channels, many with over 90% sequence similarity, suggesting functional similarity. However, the multiplicity of genes raises questions about their diversity. Theoretical constraints, including excitability and uniqueness of resting potential, directly constrain channel properties. Data from 172 measurements of wild-type and mutant channels under various conditions show that all channels obey the excitability constraint, while muscle channels tend to obey the resting potential constraint. Neuronal channels do not obey the resting constraint. Excitability distinguishes the channels into four groups consistent with phylogenetic analysis. Channels are primarily expressed in specific tissues, such as Nav1.4 in skeletal muscle, Nav1.5 in cardiac, and Nav1.9 in dorsal root ganglion. Sodium channel diversity is bounded by physical constraints on function, including excitability and resting potential. Channels must be tuned to allow membrane excitability and have a unique resting state. The study suggests functional differences between channel groups based on these constraints.
Researchers have determined the high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) PA endonuclease domain with specific inhibitors, including diketo compounds and green tea catechin, which chelate two critical manganese ions in the enzyme's active site. The unique cap-snatching mechanism of viral transcription can be inhibited by targeting the PB2 cap or PA endonuclease domains. The study reveals how different substituent groups on the metal binding scaffold can orient to bind distinct subpockets within the active cavity and the plasticity of structural elements in the active site, resulting in induced fit binding. These findings are crucial for designing potent inhibitors targeting cap-snatching endonuclease activity of influenza polymerase. The need for novel antiviral drugs, less prone to resistance, is widely recognized, and targeting the viral polymerase, which performs transcription and replication of the RNA, is an attractive option. The enduclease activity has long been a target for antiviral development as its inhibition could stall viral replication at the primary level and relevant sites are conserved across strains with no host counterpart. The results will guide medicinal chemistry approaches to optimize lead compounds for efficient inhibition of PA enduclease, advancing the goal of developing efficacious therapeutics directly targeting viral replication.
Snake envenomation affects approximately 1.8 million people annually, resulting in 94,000 deaths, mostly in tropical countries, with specific antivenoms being the only effective therapy. A study aimed to produce potent polyspecific antisera against three medically important vipers in Thailand and neighboring countries, Callosasma rhodoma, Cryptelyrops alabris, and Dabo siensis. Four horses were immunized with a mixture of the three venoms using the 'low dose, low volume multi-site' immunization protocol. The antisera showed a rapid rise in ELISA titers against the three venoms, reaching a plateau at the 8th week post-immunization. The in vivo neutralization potency of the antisera against the venoms was higher than the minimal limits set by Queen Saovab Memorial Institute. The polyspecific antisera effectively neutralized procoagulant, hemorrhagic, necrotic, and nephrotoxic activities of the venoms. The immunization protocol was successful in producing potent polyspecific antisera against the three vipers with minimal side effects on horses. A commercial polyspecific antivenom in the form of F(ab')2 has been produced, which should help save lives of many victims of envenation by the three and related vipers in SE countries. The study demonstrated the production of truly polyspecific antisera against three vipers using the low dose, volume multi-site immunization protocol.
Salmonella enterica strains that cause systemic infections can persist for long periods despite a robust immune response, with chronically infected hosts serving as a reservoir for disease transmission. The bacterial effector protein Sse, translocated into host cells by the Salmonella Pathogenic Island 2 type III secretion system, is required for Salmonella typhimurium to maintain long-term systemic infection in mice. Sse inhibits normal migration of macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro, requiring the host factor IQGAP, a regulator of cell migration. Sse binds directly to IQAP and co-localizes with it at the cell periphery. The C-terminal domain of Sse is similar to PM/ToxA, with a cystine residue critical for activity, and mutation of the corresponding residue in Sse eliminates its function. Infection with wild-type S. tyimurium suppresses DC migration to the spleen in vivo in an Sse-dependent manner, with fewer DC and CD+ lymphocytes in WT-infected spleens compared to Δsse-infected. Sse blocks macrophage and DC migration by interacting with IQAP, reducing DC migration in vivo, correlating with reduced DC and CD+ cells in WT-infected spleens. Sse is necessary for maintaining long-term systemic infection, with its mechanism involving inhibition of host cell migration, allowing bacteria to counteract host clearance.
Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is a problematic pathogen that infects healthy individuals, causing severe disease, and is more virulent than hospital-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA), but the underlying mechanism for its high virulence is unknown. The psm-mec gene, located in the mobile genetic element SCCmec of HA-MRSA but not CA-MRSA, suppresses the expression of phenol-soluble modulin α (PSMα), a cytolytic toxin of S. aureus. psmec RNA inhibits translation of the agrA gene encoding a positive transcription factor for PSα via binding to agr mRNA. 25% of clinical MRSA isolates had a mutation in the psmec promoter that attenuated transcription and 9% had no psmec. Deletion of psmec from HA-MRSA increased expression of Agr protein and PSα and virulence in mice. psm RNA suppresses MRSA virulence via inhibition of agr translation and absence of psm function in CA-MRSA causes high virulence. The absence of psm is a determinant of high virulence of CA-MRSA and identification of psm mutation could predict virulence properties of MRSA. Integration of psm into chromosomes of CA-MRSA led to a decrease in Agr expression, suggesting psm acts to decrease Agr in S aureus cells.
Researchers have developed a mouse model to study antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of dengue disease, where maternal antibodies from deng-immune mothers increase disease severity in offspring upon infection with a different deng virus serotype. Type I interferon-deficient mice born to deng-immune mothers succumbed to deng infection within 4 days, displaying hepatocyte vacolation, vascular leakage, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Anti-TNFα therapy protected the mice, correlating with healthy hepatocytes, while blocking IL-6 had no impact. This model may help understand deng pathogenesis and evaluate vaccine efficacy. Previous studies used immunocompromised mice, but this model uses a less immunocompromised background. Maternally acquired heterotypic deng antibodies induced ADE in mice with increased viremia and vascular permeability. The model recapitulates clinical manifestations of severe deng, including vascular permeability, thrombocytia, lymphia, cytokine storm, and liver pathology. The lack of suitable animal models has hindered understanding deng pathogenesis and preclinical evaluation of prophylactic and therapeutic candidates. Immunocompetent mice are not susceptible to deng infection due to the inability to interfere with murine type I interferon response. The model may investigate protective or enhancing properties of vaccination-induced maternal antibodies and interference of maternal antibodies on vaccination efficacy in infants and children.
A systematic review and meta-analysis of 51 studies on visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas identified factors associated with Leishmania infantum infection in humans. Male sex was associated with visceral leishiasis in studies using the leishin skin test for diagnosis, while younger individuals were less frequently infected but more prone to illness. Presence of dogs at home, higher dog seropositivity in nearby areas, lower socioeconomic status, and highly vegetated areas were linked to infection. No association was found with chickens in the house and nutritional status. Ecological studies showed consistent evidence of dog seropitivity association with human visceral leishiasis, emphasizing the relevance of dogs as a marker of occurrence. The study found consistent patterns for some factors and highlighted the need for targeted control measures. Results cannot be applied to other contexts due to the disease's unique characteristics in the Americas, with Leishmania donovani as the etiological agent, Phlebotus argentipes as vector, and humans as the only reservoir. Spatial clustering, household conditions, vegetation near homes, and poverty were also identified as risk factors in a review of visceral leishias in Asia, with case-fatality rates varying between 4.2% and 10.2% in treated patients in Brazil.
Inhalation of Francisella tularensis causes acute and fatal pneumonia, with the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis and death remaining unknown. Evaluation of the host immune response reveals that an innate cellular response, rather than bacterial burden or cytokine production, drives tissue pathology and mortality. Lethal infection elicits medullary and extra-medullary myopoiesis, recruiting large numbers of immature myeloid cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells to the lungs, which fail to mature and die, leading to necrotic lung damage, loss of function, and death. This process is partially dependent on Ly6G+ cells. In contrast, sub-lethal infection is characterized by a predominance of mature neutrophils and monocytes required for protection, suggesting a threshold for lethal infection. Eliciting a mature phagocyte response provides transient protection against lethal infection. The study reveals the nature of the myeloid response determines host mortality versus survival following Francisella infection. Lethal infection recruits a proportion of immature myeloid cells to lungs and spleen, driving necrotic damage, multi-organ dysfunction, and death, while sub-lethal infection recruits mature myel cells controlling the bacteria. Medary myopoies and splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis supports continued recruitment of myel cells, impairing protective responses and bacterial clearance.
Genetic evidence suggests a worldwide chaotic dispersion pattern of the arbovirus vector Aedes albopictus, the Asian tiger mosquito, which is a vector of medically important arboviruses such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika. Classical genetics and Approximate Bayesian Computation approaches were used to analyze the demographic history of Aedes albict populations from Southeast Asia and recently colonized areas. In Southeast Asia, low differentiation and high coancestry values indicate high genetic connectivity among China, Thailand, and Japan, revealing a common origin. China appears to be the oldest population. Outside Asia, invasion in La Réunion, America, and the Mediterranean is primarily supported by chaotic propagule distribution, maintaining high genetic diversity in adventive populations. Independent and trans-continental introductions of Ae albictus have facilitated rapid establishment through admixture of unrelated genomes, resulting in high intra-population variability. This variability may extend to genetic mechanisms controlling vector competence, contributing to efficient arbovirus transmission and outbreak. The study provides information on population origins from Asia, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean, Pacific, and America, valuable for predicting vector outbreak risk. The spread of the mosquito across different conditions may result in variation in competence between eco-geographic populations due to interactions between unexplored genetic and environmental factors, crucial for assessing arvirus risk in invaded areas where Ae albict has established.
Researchers investigated the genes and functions that mediate the fitness of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in chronic wound infections to better understand the selective environment in wounds. Clinical isolates from human wounds were frequently defective in virulence and biofilm formation, and many virulence and biofilm genes were not required for bacterial fitness in experimental mouse wounds. Genes involved in anaerobic growth, metabolic pathways, and membrane integrity were critical for bacterial fitness. The characteristics of wound-impaired mutants could be represented by anaerobic, oxidative, and membrane-stress conditions ex vivo and comprehensively by high-density bacterial growth in the absence of a host. The study found that many virulence functions were inactivated in human infection isolates and only one virulence function affected bacterial fitness in murine chronic wounds. The data suggest that the predominant stresses on bacteria in wounds may be applied by the bacteria themselves rather than the host and that chronic sites may be relatively permissive environments where nutrient acquisition and growth do not depend on invasive or toxic functions. The findings shed light on the bacterial functions needed in chronic infections, the nature of stresses applied to bacteria, and suggest therapeutic targets that might compromise wound pathogenesis. The study used diabetic mice, which is a key factor in human wound pathogenesis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa inhibited wound-healing in the model, directly linking infection to disease. The results indicate that high-density growth capacity, not virulence or biofilm functions, mediates bacterial fitness in chronic wounds.
A study evaluated 968 patients with unilateral or bilateral filarial hydrocele and 218 comparison patients who underwent hydrocele-sparing hydrocelectomy in a bancroftian filariasis endemic area. Hydrocele recurrence rates were 0.3% and 19.3% respectively, with no recurrence in 28 re-operated patients. Leaking or dilated lymphatic vessels were seen in 30.9% and 46.3% of patients. Abnormal testicles were found in 18% and 35.7% of patients. Lymph fluid from ruptured vessels is a component of chronic filarial hydrocele fluid threatening testis integrity. Complete excision of hydrocele sac and suturing or excising leaking vessels is advised to avoid recurrence. Hydrocele is the most common manifestation of bancftian filariasis, with high prevalence in tropical areas. The study suggests lymph fistulae are a mechanism for chronic hydrocele, whether recurrent or not. In bancftian filari endemic areas, accumulation of fluid in vaginal cavity may be due to a different pathogenic mechanism. Complete excision of hydrocele sac resulted in low recurrence rates compared to hydrocele-sparing hydroceomy. The findings have implications for surgical repair in bancftian filari endemic areas where hydrocelectomy is a common procedure.
Trichella spiralis is a zoonotic parasitic nematode that causes trichinelliasis, a disease found on all continents except Antarctica, infecting mammals indiscriminately and contributing to global helminth morbidity and disability. During infection, T. spiralis larvae infect skeletal myofibres, disrupting their differentiation. Researchers used an activity-based probe, HA-Ub-VME, to identify deubiquitinating enzyme activity in T. spiralis L1 larvae lysate, analyzing results by immuno-blot and immuno-precitation, identifying potential deubiquitinating enzymes. Immuno-precipated proteins were subjected to LC/MS/MS, yielding peptides with sequence homology to conserved human deubiquitinating enzymes, including UCH5, UCH3, HAUS, OTU6, and Atax-3. The predicted gene encoding the putative UCH5 homologue, TsUCH37, was cloned and recombinant protein expressed and purified, verifying deubiquinating activity by Ub-AM assay. Co-precipitation of recombinant Ts37 showed association with putative T. spiralis proteasome components, including yeast Rpn homologue ADR1. The UCH inhibitor LDN-574 exhibited specific inhibition of recomant Ts37 and reduced viability of cultured L1 larvae. This study reports the identification of the first T. spiralis deubiquinating enzyme, a cystine protease putatively orthologous to human UCH5, suggesting interaction with the proteasome has been conserved throughout evolution. Results indicate potential use of inhibitors to elucidate the role of UCH enzymes in T. spiralis infection and investigation as therapeutic targets for trichinellis.
Researchers investigated the anti-trypanosomal activity of non-peptidic nitrile-based cysteine protease inhibitors against the CL Brener strain of T. cruzi, a parasite that causes Chagas disease. Three compounds showed potent activity in the 0.1-1 μM to 1 μM range, with two exhibiting EC50 values of 0.12 μM and 0.25 μM, an order of magnitude lower than their Ki values against cruzain, a recombinant form of cruzipain. This suggests their anti-tryosomal activity may not be solely due to cruzain inhibition, indicating a potential polypharmacological profile towards cystine proteases. Catheps K inhibitors on a cyclohexane dicarboxamide scaffold were also evaluated, with two compounds showing greater anti-tryosomal activity than expected from their cruzain inhibitory activity. The findings imply the anti-tryosomal effects may be due to inhibition of unidentified cystine proteases, including isoforms like cruzain-2. Compounds 5 and 11 may exhibit polypharmacology, targeting isoforms of cruzipain or other cystine proteases. The cystine protease profile suggests a new antichasic target may share molecular characteristics with catheps K, indicating phenic libraries for antichasic agents should include potent inhibitors of this enzyme. The study validates cruzipain as a therapeutic target for Chagas treatment, supported by previous efficacy of cystine protease inhibitors in animal models.
Maize, a crucial crop and model for studying genetics and evolution, has a complex genome that reflects its evolutionary history. A physical map covering 93.5% of the genome was constructed, with 86.1% aligned to the genetic map, containing 25,908 genic markers that anchored 73% of the maize genome to rice. The distribution of expressed sequence tags correlates with recombination, and collinear regions show 1kb in rice corresponds to 3.2kb in maize, with a 6-fold genome size expansion due to polyploid origin. Inversions account for most chromosome variations during diploidization, and evidence of ancient duplication predating maize and rice divergence was found. The progenitors of modern maize had ten chromosomes. Alignment of maize and rice genomes shed light on chromosome organization, rearrangements, and genome evolution, supported by comparative fragment polymorphism mapping showing whole genome duplication. The maize genome emerged from tetraploidization of ancient regions with multiple duplications, and synteny analysis revealed rearrangements since divergence from rice. A saturated genetic map was developed to anchor physical contigs, and multiple duplications contribute to the complex pattern, with recent duplications easier to identify than ancient ones.
Researchers investigated the de novo generation of infectious prions in vitro to mimic the early events of sporadic prion disease etiology. Prions are proteinaceous agents responsible for Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies, composed of misfolded prion protein that replicates without nucleic acids, inducing misfolding of cellular prion. Under standard Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification conditions, de novo generation of infectious prions was not observed, supporting its use for diagnostic applications. However, modified conditions allowed generation of infectious prions in the absence of pre-existing prions in different species at a low rate. De novo generated prions were infectious in wild-type hamsters, producing a new disease with unique clinical, neuropathological, and biochemical features. The findings support the prion hypothesis and provide a model to study sporadic prion disease, suggesting prion diversity is not restricted to known forms and new infectious foldings may result in novel phenotypes. The study used Protein Misfolding Cyclic Amplification technology, designed to mimic prion autocatalytic replication in vitro, to identify conditions for de novo generation of infectious prions in brain homogenates, based on the hypothesis that sporadic prion disease originates from spontaneous prion misfolding. The results show that de novo generated prions correspond to a new strain of infectious material, indicating a larger diversity of transmissible prion foldings than thought, and provide evidence for the prion hypothesis that misfolded and infectious protein can be generated in vitro without pre-existing prions.
A novel neural model for estimating angular velocity in the bee brain has been presented, capable of quantitatively reproducing experimental observations of visual odometry and corridor-centering in free-flying honeybees. The model is fitted using electrophysiological data and tested using behavioural data, suggesting the angular velocity response can be considered an evolutionary extension to the optomotor response. The detector is tested behaviourally in silico with the corridor-centering paradigm, where bees navigate a corridor with gratings on walls, reproducing invariance of average flight path to spatial frequency and contrast of gratings, including deviations from perfect centering behaviour. The detector's response to unit movement along the corridor is constant for a range of grating frequencies, demonstrating it can be used as a visual odometer. The model reproduces patterns including deviation of flight path from corridor centre due to differences in spatial frequency of sinusoidal gratings and square wave gratings. Results show the detector's output can estimate distance by summing over time and parts of the visual field, unaffected by spatial frequency of environment. The model proposes the angular velocity response as an extension of optomotor pathway, allowing detectors to be constructed from elementary motion detectors with varying response scales.
Untreated infections by Trypanosoma brucei gambi, the main agent of sleeping sickness, are not 100% fatal. A 15-year follow-up of 50 human African trypanosomiasis patients from the Ivory Coast, where 11 refused treatment, showed parasite clearance in 10 subjects using microscopy and polymerase chain reaction. Seven displayed decreasing serological responses, becoming negative to trypanosome antigens. Two alternative progressions of infection occur: aparasitemic and asymptomatic with strong-lasting serological responses, and spontaneous resolution with negative parasitological tests and dropping antibody titres. Field programs encounter subjects with positive serologic but negative parasitological results, indicating some display such courses. Recognizing trypanotolerance in humans, as in animals, is a step forward for research in the field. Trypanosoma brucei gambi causes over 95% of cases, evolving from haemolymph to meningoencephitic phase, leading to neurological disorders. The study used clinical, serological, molecular, and parasitological investigations, showing two natural progressions besides the classic fatal one. Re-examination of patients showed trypanosomes undetectable by microscopy and PCR-negative, with some still positive card agglutination test results. Asymptomatic Trypanosoma brucei infection is comparable to Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania, where infected hosts are still infective to vectors despite undetectable parasites.
Ionizing radiation's role in cancer development is often attributed to its mutagenic action on oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, but its effects extend beyond these loci, potentially influencing the selective effects of oncogenic mutations. The tumor suppressor p53's loss provides resistance to genotoxic stimuli, including irradiation, and p53 null animals develop T-cell lymphomas with high penetrance. Irradiation accelerates lymphoma development in p53 heterozygous mice, suggesting increased selection for p53-deficient cells contributes to the link between irradiation and lymphoid malignancies. Research using mouse models found p53 disruption confers a selective advantage upon irradiation, leading to long-term expansion of p53-deficient clones and increased lymphoma development. Selection for p53-deficient cells is due to protection from irradiation-induced ablation, prevention of clonogenic loss, improved progenitor fitness, and elimination of competing p53 wild-type progenitors. Irradiation selects p53-deficient hematopoietic progenitors, indicating its carcinogenic effect can be explained by increased selection for cells with p53 disruption, protecting progenitors from elimination and long-term reductions in fitness. Contrary to the mutagenic mechanism, irradiation delayed lymphoma development in mice with mostly p53−− hematopoies and impeded T-cell malignancies, extending survival. Results demonstrate irradiation selects p53-deficient cells in stem and progenitor pools, independent of additional oncogenic mutations, highlighting the importance of selection over mutagenesis in irradiation-induced tumorigenesis.
Schistosoma mansoni SmKI-1 serine protease inhibitor plays a crucial role in parasite development and regulates inflammatory diseases by binding to elastase and impairing neutrophil function. The recombinant SmKI and its Kunit domain possess inhibitory activity against trypsin and neutrophil elastase, blocking the active site of neutrophil elastase. SmKI1 inhibits the capacity of neutrophil elastase to kill schistosomes and its suppression in larval stage impacts parasite development in vitro and vivo. Treatment with SmKI reduces acetaminophen-mediated liver damage, neutroph recruitment, and elastase activity. In arthritis models, SmKI reduces neutroph accumulation, IL-1β secretion, and hypernocption. SmKI also inhibits early events triggering neutroph recruitment in pleural cavities in response to carrageenan. SmKI1 is essential for parasite survival, acting as a tryp and neutroph elastase inhibitor, and has potential as a therapeutic molecule against inflammatory diseases. Its interaction with elastase is a potential immune evasion mechanism developed by the parasite, allowing it to survive in human hosts by producing protease inhibitors targeting human proteases. SmKI reduces schistosomula killing by elastase and has anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a key protein in S. mansoni survival.
Researchers have developed a novel method for accurately modeling transmembrane helical protein structures from distant homologues, addressing the challenge of limited structural characterization of eukaryotic transmembrane helical proteins. The method was validated through blind predictions and a benchmark of 50 transmembrane protein homolog pairs with diverse topology, size, and sequence identity, achieving near-atomic accuracy in membrane-embedded regions. Models of adenosine A2A and chemokine CX4 receptors were ranked first in GPCR-DO blind prediction contests, demonstrating the method's effectiveness. The technique improves starting templates and is suitable for computer-based protein engineering, with redesigned models and X-ray structures exhibiting similar native interactions. The approach was tested in challenging predictions, including GPCRDO-CK8 for adenosine receptor and GPCRDOCK201 for chemokine receptor, with closest homolog templates sharing 32% sequence identity. Results suggest the method is useful for rebuilding and refining X-ray structures where functionally important regions are missing or deleted. High-resolution prediction of membrane structures is crucial for designing therapeutics and synthetic biology applications, and this method provides an alternative in the absence of close homologues, enabling atom-level modeling of a fraction of structurally uncharacterized transmembrane proteins from diverse homologues.
Listeria monocytogenes, the bacterium responsible for listeriosis, a foodborne disease that poses serious risks to fetuses, newborns, and immunocompromised adults, has been found to switch from an active motile lifestyle to a stage of persistence in vacuoles during infection of human hepatocytes and trophoblast cells. The bacterium initially proliferates in the cytosol and exploits the host actin polymerization machinery to spread from cell-to-cell, but after several days of infection, it stops producing the actin-nucleating protein ActA and becomes trapped in lysosome-like vacoles termed Lister-Containing Vacuoles (Lis). Subpopulations of bacteria resist degradation in Lis and enter a slow/non-replicative state. The bacterium can cycle between the vacolar and actin-based motility stages and when ActA is absent, such as in Δact mutants, vacolar bacteria parasitize host cells in a "viable non-culturable" state preventing detection by conventional methods. Exposure to gentamicin selects for vacolar and viable non-culturable bacteria. This ability of L. monocogenes to enter a persistent state in epithelial cells may favor asymptomatic carriage, lengthen incubation of listeriosis, and promote survival during antibiotic therapy.
Researchers have developed a neuromechanic model of auditory bistability to study the phenomenon of auditory streaming, where sequences of higher and lower frequency tones in an ABA pattern can be perceived as either integrated or segregated. The model combines neuromechanic and psychoacoustic experiments to investigate persistent alternations between these interpretations during minutes-long presentations. It comprises neuronal units with sensory-dependent inputs mimicking A1 responses to tones, mutual inhibition, adaptation, and noise, and NMDA recurrent excitation for temporal memory. Percepts are identified in firing patterns of neuronal units. The model predicts manipulations of frequency difference between tones affect durations of stronger and weaker percepts. Psychoacoustic experiments confirm this prediction, achieving quantitative agreement between experimental and modeling results. The study focuses on alternations after the build phase, incorporating sound-evoked A1 responses and temporal binding between triplets. Parameters controlling adaptation and noise were tuned to match statistics of perceptual durations. The model distinguishes from existing auditory models by its neuromechanic formulation and emergence of competing percepts within tonopic organization. The work provides a platform to consider other conditions, including context and volition, and future exploration of neural mechanisms underlying attention in auditory streaming.
Researchers have developed a method to assess the allergenicity of Schistosoma mansoni proteins using a humanised Rat Basophil Leukemia cell line, RS-AT8, and a cell-free in vitro translation system. This approach enables rapid translation of S. mansoni proteins and evaluation of their potential allergenicity without purification. The method involves translating S. mansoni proteins using wheat germ lysate and assessing their ability to activate the RS-AT8 cell line after incubation with serum from infected individuals. Antigen integrity is confirmed using Western blotting. Characterized plant and parasitic allergens, such as Par j 2, SmAL1, and IgE binding factor IPSE/alpha-1, were used to demonstrate the system's suitability. SmAL1, but not SmT2, activated the basophil cell line. This technology allows for high-throughput assessment of S. mansoni allergens and can be used to unravel the entire allergome of S. mans and other parasites, leading to a better understanding of allergenicity and the relationship between parasite-specific IgE and host protection. The method is suitable for studying the basis of allergenicity of helminthic proteins and assessing potential allergenicity of anti-helminthic vaccine candidates using individual sera.
Sexual reproduction allows transposable elements to proliferate, leading to rapid divergence between populations and species, resulting in hybrid dysgenic syndromes, a form of genomic incompatibility that arises when transposable element family abundance differs between parents. In Drosophila, dysgenesis occurs when paternally inherited transposable elements are not matched with a pool of corresponding silencing PIWI-interacting RNAs provisioned by the female germline. The study characterizes the effects of divergence in transposable element profile between parents on offspring using the D. virilis syndrome of hybrid dysgenesis as a model. Results show divergence in transposable element landscape is associated with persisting differences in germline transposable element expression when comparing genetically identical females of reciprocal crosses, transmitted to the next generation. Chronic and persisting transposable element expression coincides with increased levels of genic PI-interacting RNAs associated with reduced gene expression. Gene expression is idiosyncatically influenced by differences in genic PI-interacting RNA profile of parents that arise from polymorphic transposon insertions. The study supports a model where early germl events in dysgenesis establish a chronic, stable state of transposable element and gene expression in germl maintained through adulthood and transmitted to the next generation, demonstrating divergence in transposable element profile is associated with diverse PI-interacting RNA-mediated transgenerational effects on gene expression within populations.
Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CGG trinucleotide repeat in the 5'UTR of the fragile X syndrome (FMR1) gene, leading to increased FMR1 mRNA levels. Researchers found that overexpressing histone deacetylases (HDs 3, 6, or 11) suppresses CG repeat-induced neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of FAS through selective transcriptional repression of the CG repeat-containing transgene. In patient-derived lymphoblasts and fibroblasts, increased acetylation of histones at the F1 locus correlates with elevated F1 mRNA in premutation carriers. Histone acetyltransferase inhibitors repress F1 mRNA to control levels in premutation carriers and extend lifespan in CG repeat-expressing Drosophila. The CG repeat expansion in FAS promotes chromatin remodeling, increasing toxic F1 mRNA expression. Results suggest histone deacetylase activators or inhibitors may repress transcription at the F1 locus. Alterations in chromatin structure at the F1 are dynamic and modifiable by genetic and pharmacologic manipulations, changing transcription levels in human and animal models. Expanded FAS sequence alters chromatin structure through preferential association with acetylated histones, promoting F1 transcription and exacerbating RNA toxicity. The CG repeat interferes with translation by altering F1 mRNA loading onto polysomes, but transcription activation is not the dominant cause of elevated F1 levels.
Host genetics play a critical role in controlling CD8 T cell function and immunopathology during chronic viral infection. Effective CD8 T cell responses are vital for controlling chronic infections, and host genetics influence the maintenance of effector CD8 T cell responses versus exhaustion. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles and degree of MHC heterogeneity are associated with enhanced CD8 cell function and viral control. A study using F1 crosses of B10.D2 x B6 and BALB x BAL/c mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) clone-13 showed increased viral control in heterozygous mice. H-2xd B10.D2F mice on a C57 genetic background exhibited mortality following infection, which was CD8-cell dependent. These mice maintained CD8 cell effector cytokine production and reduced expression of exhaustion marker PD-1, and induced a larger Th1 response dependent on CD4-cell IFNγ production. Results indicate MHC heterogeneity increases the frequency of responding CD8 cells, contributing to CD8-dependent viral clearance and mortality. Host background and MHC diversity significantly impact CD8 cell exhaustion and clearance. CD8 cells are crucial for clearing acute LCM infection and maintaining control during chronic LCM-13 infection. Increasing MHC diversity allows a broader CD8 cell response, enabling more rapid control of persistent LCM-13 infection.
Anthrax is a re-emerging zoonotic disease endemic in China, particularly in rural regions. A study analyzed genetic characteristics of Bacillus anthracis isolated from northwestern China from 1990 to 2016 using canonical single-nucleotide polymorphism and multilocus variable tandem repeat analysis. Five sublineages were detected, including A. Br. 001/002, A. Br. Voll, A. Br.94, A. Br. Ames, and A. Br. 008/009. All sublineages were found in Xinjiang, while others were found in Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Inner Mongolia. The geographical distribution of B. anthrac populations exhibited different characteristics than those isolated before 199. The A. Br. Ames subgroup was scattered from Inner Mongolia to other provinces. 106 strains were assigned to 36 MLVA genotypes, with 21 first observed in this study. Recent outbreaks were classified as subgroups A. Br.001/002 and A. Br. Ames with genotypes ML15-28, ML15-30, ML-31, ML-38, ML-CH3, and ML-18. The study found diversification of ML genotypes and geographical distribution of B. anthrac populations is becoming balanced across northwestern China, providing preliminary results on B. anthrac diversity to promote prevention and control of the disease.
Enterohemorrhagic Escheria coli and related foodborne pathogens pose significant threats to human health by infecting the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells, causing severe diarrheal disease. Research using Citrobacter rodium, a mouse pathogen, suggests hosts rely on immune-mediated changes in intestinal epithelial cells, including goblet cells to defend against these pathogens. Goblet cell-derived Resistin-Like Molecule β is strongly induced during infection and detected in stool and serum, but its role in defense is unclear. Wildtype and REL-β deficient mice infected with Citrobacterium showed modestly elevated pathogen burdens, increased mortality, and mucosal ulceration due to deep pathogen penetration of colonic crypts, and impaired infection-induced epithelial cell proliferation. REL-β acts as a CD4 T cell chemoattractant, recruiting CD4 cells to the colon, increasing interleukin-22 production, which promotes epithelial proliferation. Delivery of REL-β to deficient mice restored CD4 cell recruitment, interleukin-22 levels, and epithelial proliferation, reducing mucosal pathology. Findings demonstrate REL-β and goblet cells play a critical role in recruiting CD4 cells to protect against enteric pathogens via increased epithelial proliferation. Loss of REL-β resulted in deeper pathogen penetration, patchy ulceration, heightened morbidity, and mortality, expanding the attributed role of goblet cells in host defense against enteric bacteria.
Noroviruses, a major cause of gastroenteritis in humans, have a unique mechanism of translation initiation that relies on interactions between the VPg protein covalently attached to the 5'-end of the viral RNA and eukaryotic initiation factors in the host. The C-terminal motif of murine norovirus VPg mediates direct and specific binding to the HEAT1 domain within the middle fragment of eIF4G. This motif is conserved in all known noroviruses and binds eIFG HEAT1 via a helical conformation. The binding site on eIFG HEAT1 is non-overlapping with the site for eIF4A, allowing norovirus VP to form ternary complexes. Fusion proteins containing the C-terminal peptide of MNV VP inhibit in vitro translation of norovirus RNA but not cap or IRES-dependent translation. The interaction between norovirus VP and eIFG is crucial for initiation from the viral genome, with norovirus VP serving as a proteinaceous '5-cap' that recruits the RNA to the translation machinery. A conserved ~20 amino acid motif in the C-termin of norovirus VP binds the HEAT1 domains eIFGI and eIFGII with micromolar affinity. High-resolution analyses are required to establish the relative positions of norovirus VP-RNA and eIF within the 48S ribosomal complex. The discovery of this conserved motif reveals a binding interface that might be exploited as a target for antiviral therapy.
Researchers investigated the evolution of gene clusters in bacterial genomes, where genes encoding proteins in a common pathway are often found near each other along chromosomes. Several explanations have been proposed, including natural selection, the selfish operon model, and the persistence model. The selfish operon model suggests clustered arrangements of genes are easily transferred to other species, improving survival prospects, while the persistence model proposes genes in proximity are less likely to be disrupted by deletions. Computational models were developed to study conditions under which gene clusters evolve and persist. Results showed gene clusters fail to evolve under a wide range of conditions, but factors promoting their evolution include a low number of genes in the pathway, high population size, and high horizontal transfer rate in the selfish model. The analysis showed evolution of gene clusters can occur under direct and indirect selection under certain conditions, supporting the selfish model as a viable explanation. The study examined distinct models, including a Moran process with natural selection and genome inversion, and a model with selection and inversion tracking rearrangements. Gene clusters were found to evolve under specific conditions, including low gene numbers and high population size, supporting the selfish model's viability as an explanation for gene cluster evolution in bacterial genomes.
Malaria, caused by Plasmodium falciparum, severely affects pregnant women due to the adhesion of parasite-infected erythrocytes in the placenta, mediated by a unique variant of PfEMP1 called VAR2CS, which binds to chondroit sulfate A on syncytiotrophoblasts. VARCSA appears only in the presence of placenta, suggesting its expression is repressed in men and non-pregnant women, but the mechanism is unknown. Research using parasite lines and gene constructs reveals the VARCS gene contains a small upstream open reading frame repressing translation of the mRNA, a novel regulation form in malaria parasites. This repression is reversible, allowing high translation upon selection, enabling parasites to upregulate the antigen in the host. The 5' leader sequence of varcs transcripts shows the uOR is not spliced and present in mRNA, indicating VARCS is encoded by a bicistronic transcript, suggesting regulation to prevent expression when no placenta is available. Varcs transcripts are detected in non-pregnant individuals, indicating post-transcriptional repression, but proteomic studies detected VARCS in non-placental parasites and CSA activity in non-pregnant hosts. The varcs gene is conserved in most parasite isolates, with a homologue in chimpanzee Plasium reichen, indicating selective pressure for preservation. Understanding VARCS regulation provides insights into host-parasite interactions and disease pathogenesis.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide analysis of whole blood from 34 dengue-infected children in Nicaragua to investigate the transcriptional profiles of peripheral immune cells and identify genes differentially regulated between clinical subgroups. The most striking transcriptional differences were observed between deng patients with and without shock, especially in the expression of mitochondrial ribosomal proteins associated with biosynthesis. In deng hemorrhagic fever patients, a subset of differentially expressed genes encode neutrophil-derived anti-microbial peptides associated with innate immunity. A meta-analysis confirmed DENV infection in vivo is associated with changes to protein and nucleic acid metabolism. Interferon response was not consistently observed in patient samples, suggesting it is relatively transient. A common response to DENV infection was identified, with 310 genes upregulated during acute illness, including IRF4 and BLNK, supporting B cell stimulation and proliferation. A distinct molecular profile was found between Nicaraguan deng patients with shock and DHF, and a muted difference between DF and DHF. Integrated analysis identified 32 genes significantly different between severe and non-severe deng cases, with 25 highly expressed in severe patients and 7 in non-severe. The study highlights differences between manifestations of DENV infection and identifies commonalities, potentially leading to better prediction of disease via a systems approach.
Herpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that cause significant disease and are difficult to clear from the host, making their entry an important target for control. Researchers studied Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4), a lymphotropic rhadinovirus related to Kaposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus, to understand how herpesviruses cross mucus-covered epithelia in vivo. Mu-4 targets the olfactory neuroepithelium, where it binds to heparan sulfate (HS) on apical neuronal cilia, allowing entry into neurons or underlying glial sustacular cells. HS binding is crucial for Mu-4 entry, as virions unable to bind HS show poor host entry. The olfactory neuroepithium provides an important site for HS-dependent herpesvirus uptake. Mu-4 exploits neurons for entry despite not being classically neurotropic, suggesting the olfactory neuroepithium may provide an entry portal for many herpesviruses. HS binding is key for Mu-4 host entry, and neuroepithelial-targeted, HS-based interventions could provide a means of herpesvirus control. Factors besides HS availability restrict Mu-4 entry to the olfactory neuroepithium, with gp150 mutants not infecting more widely than wild-type despite being less HS-dependent. Mu-4 infection depends strongly on hepar sulfate in vitro, with virions lacking HS binding proteins poorly infecting epithelial cells and lungs. Selective olfactory neuroepithelial targeting by Mu-4 implies infection depends on unique site features, with a sustacular neuron infection ratio of 3.6 ± 3.4.
Researchers have identified a new regulatory circuit involving CRP-cAMP, a widely established metabolic regulator, in silencing Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) genes under non-permissive conditions. CRP-cAMP-deficient strains showed strong upregulation of SPI-1 genes in mid-logarithmic growth phase. Genetic analyses revealed CRP-cAMP modulates the level of HilD, the master regulator of Salmonella invasion, at the post-transcriptional level, requiring a newly identified motif within the hilD 3'UT. The Hfq-dependent sRNA Spot 42 is under transcriptional repression of CR-cAMP and exerts a positive effect on hilD when repression is relieved. In vivo and in vitro assays indicate Spot42 targets the 3'UT of hil transcript through its unstructured region. CRP-cAMP indirectly regulates virulence by affecting post-transcription regulation of hil. CRP-deficient Salmonella strains are unable to secrete SPI1 TSS effector proteins and are avirulent, suggesting a role for CR-cAMP in regulation of Salmonella virulence. CRP regulation of hil does not occur at transcriptional level but at post-transcription level through the long 3'UT of hil. CR-cAMP repression of hil has a concomitant effect on expression and secretion of SPI1 effector proteins, highlighting its relevance in control of Salmonella virulence under non-permissive conditions.
Expansion of CAG/CTG repeats is responsible for diseases such as Huntington's disease and myotonic dystrophy, with instability in somatic tissues accelerating disease progression. Researchers investigated the relationship between CAG instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the HD locus using R6 and R6/2 transgenic mice, which express a similar transgene at different integration sites and recapitulate tissue-specific instability. Results showed increased instability rates in R6 tissues compared to R6 matched samples, with high transgene expression and chromatin accessibility correlating with increased CAG instability. Transgene mRNA and H3K4 trimethylation were increased, while H3K9 dimethylation was reduced in R6 tissues relative to R6 matched tissues. However, transgene expression and histone marks were similar in striatum and cerebellum, despite different CAG levels. Elongating RNA Pol II and H3K36 trimethylation correlated with CAG levels, suggesting transcription modulates somatic instability. Data supports that transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contributing to tissue-selective CAG instability. The integration site of the transgene influences repeat instability, affecting chromatin structure and transcriptional activity, with active chromatin resulting in increased CAG instability. CAG instability was higher in R2 mice, regardless of repeat size, indicating chromatin context and transgene expression underlie somatic levels. Despite similar transgene expression, striatum and cereum presented different CAG levels, and histone modifications were comparable, indicating chromatin accessibility is unlikely to underlie tissue-selective instability.
Enterovirus 71 is a highly virulent enterovirus that can cause severe diseases in humans, but the molecular features that enhance its ability to disseminate in humans remain unknown. Analysis of genomic features of EV71 in immunocompromised hosts with disseminated disease revealed three nucleotide changes that occurred within a five-day period, including a non-conservative amino change in VP1, a conservative substitution in protein 2B, and a silent mutation in protein 3. Infectious clones constructed with these mutations showed the VP1 Leu to Arg substitution conferred replicative advantage in neuroblastoma cells. This mutation was frequently associated with a second non-conservative mutation in VP1 in neuroblast cells. Comparative models suggest the substitutions may alter interactions with host receptors without significant structural changes. The VP1 loop region plays a critical role in cell tropism independent of EV71 lineage, contributing to dissemination and neurotropism in immunocompromised patients. Enteroviruses target various organs, causing gastrointestinal, respiratory, myocardial, and central nervous system diseases, with EV71 being one of the limited serotypes that can cause neurological complications. The study identified site-specific adaptations conferring increased neural tropism during EV71 infection, highlighting the importance of the VP1 region in viral dissemination.
Researchers investigated the ComRS system, a quorum sensing mechanism in Streptococcus species, where peptide pheromone ComS is processed, secreted, and imported into the cytoplasm to bind and activate transcription factor ComR, regulating competence genes. ComRS is present in most Streptoccus species, but ComS and ComR sequences diverge, suggesting species-specific communication. An in vivo assay measured ComR activity in response to cognate and heterologous XIP peptides, revealing distinct ComR classes with strict, intermediate, and promiscuous specificity. The X-ray crystal structure of ComR from S. suis showed the interaction with XIP and identified a variable and conserved face in the X-binding pocket, where conserved residues contribute to ligand binding and variable face discriminates X peptides. Directed mutagenesis probed the conformation of the X-binding site, confirming the model. Alignments with Com proteins from other species supported the findings, allowing prediction of novel X peptides that induce Com activity. The study provides a model for XIP recognition and specificity, shedding light on the role of ComRS in species-cross communication in regulating natural transformation, a key to bacterial evolution and acquiring traits such as antibiotic resistance.
Researchers studied the replication properties of centromeric DNA in the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans, discovering that each centromere is associated with a replication origin that fires first on its respective chromosome. Epigenetic formation of new centromeres was accompanied by shifts in replication timing, with neocentere becoming the first to replicate and associated with origin recognition complex components. The level of centromere-specific histone H3 isoform led to changes in ORC association with centromere regions, supporting the idea that centere proteins determine origin activity. Analysis of centere-associated DNA revealed a replication-dependent sequence characteristic of constitutively active origins, with a strand-biased pattern conserved among strains and species, independent of primary sequence. Inheritance of centere position is correlated with a constitively active origin of replication that fires at a distinct time. The study suggests a model where DNA replication timing serves as an epigen mechanism for centere inheritance, with centromeric chromatin replicating rapidly within the first 20 seconds of S-phase. The self-reinforcing association between centere determinants and early timing does not require a particular DNA sequence, establishing an epetic system. Phylogenetic comparison links epigen inheritance of centere position with replication, indicating DNA timing as a basis for functional centere inheritance at chromosomal sites, a novel epigen mechanism.
A genome-wide association study of 158,025 individuals of European ancestry identified three loci associated with chronic back pain. The study included 29,531 chronic back pain cases and used logistic regression models with genetic effects, adjusting for age, sex, and population structure. A genome-wide significant association was found for the intronic variant rs10519 in SOX5, which was replicated in 283,752 UK Biobank participants and exceeded genome-wide significance in joint-analysis. Two other loci, intergenic variant rs7834 between CCDC26 and GSD, and intronic rs468 in DCC, reached genome significance in joint-analysis. Despite phenotype heterogeneity, several associations of statistical significance were identified. The study aimed to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying chronic back pain, a leading cause of years lived disability worldwide. The research was an international collaboration between investigators from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging in Genomic Epidemiology and the European FP7 Pain-OMICS project. Limitations included heterogeneity of the chronic back pain phenotype and lack of independence in the replication sample of UK Biob participants. The study identified novel associations between genetic markers and chronic back pain, including SO5, CC26/GSD, and DCC.
Taenia solium cysticercosis is a significant zoonotic disease affecting humans and pigs in developing countries, with neurocysticercosis being a major cause of epilepsy in endemic regions. In Cameroon, the estimated number of people with neurocystercosis-associated epilepsy is 50,326, representing 1% of the population, while 15,961 pigs are diagnosed with cystercosis, accounting for 5.6% of the pig population. Annual costs due to T. solium cystercosis are estimated at 10,255,202 euros, with 4.7% attributed to pig husbandry losses and 95.3% to direct and indirect human cysticosis costs. The monetary burden per case is 194 euros and 9.0 Disability-Adjusted Life Years lost per 1,000 persons per year. These estimates likely underestimate the true values as they are based on epilepsy as the sole symptom of cystercosis. Comparison with a South African study indicates salaries influence the monetary burden, suggesting that knowing salary levels and prevalence could estimate the total cost of T. solium cysticosis in a country. Estimated Disability-Adjusted Life Years lost are higher than some other neglected diseases, highlighting the need for further studies to determine the global burden of cysticosis.
Staphylococcus aureus produces numerous non-coding RNAs with poorly understood functions, including Rsa, which carries a C-rich sequence suggesting post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs. Rsa represses synthesis of global transcription regulator MgrA by forming an imperfect duplex with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and loop interaction within the coding region of target mRNA. This repression requires two recognition sites and results in enhanced biofilm production and decreased capsule synthesis, leading to decreased protection against opsonophagocytic killing by polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Animal models show Rsa attenuates acute infections and enhances chronic catheter infections, contributing to interactions with the host immune system to moderate invasiveness and favor chronic infections. Rsa functions as a virulence suppressor of acute infections, likely selected through evolution to support commensal and saprophytic interactions with the host. Deletion of rsa increases invasiveness and resistance to opsonagocytic killing, while Rsa promotes biofilm and catheter colonization, potentially promoting chronic infections in humans. Rsa links global regulators σB and Mgr, affecting temporal expression of virulence determinants, activating biofilm and repressing capsule synthesis via Mgr translation regulation, demonstrating complex interdependency in pathogenic bacteria.
Researchers have developed a novel strategy to visualize HIV-1 uncoating using a fluorescently tagged oligomeric form of capsid-binding protein cyclophilin A, which is specifically packaged into virions through high-avidity binding to capsid. Single virus imaging reveals that this probe remains associated with cores after permeabilization/removal of the viral membrane and is lost concomitantly with capsid in vitro and in living cells. The rate of loss is modulated by core stability and accelerated upon initiation of reverse transcription. The majority of single cores lose the probe shortly after viral fusion, while a small fraction remains intact for several hours. Single particle tracking at late post-infection reveals gradual loss dependent on reverse transcription. Uncoating occurs both in cytoplasm and at nuclear membrane. The novel assay enables time-resolved visualization of single HIV-1 unating in living cells, revealing previously unappreciated spatio-temporal features of this process. The correlation between HIV-1 caps stability and loss of the marker supports the notion that the probe loss reflects HIV-1 unating. The release from wild-type and mutant capsids approached plateau by 80 min at 37°C. The results establish the probe as a means to study HIV-1 unating in living cells without compromising viral infectivity.
Oligonucleotide usage in archaeal and bacterial genomes is linked to properties such as codon usage, DNA-stacking energy, and structural conformation. Research assessed the statistical potential of different DNA 'word-sizes' and oligonucleotide frequencies in coding and non-coding regions, and used oligonucleotide frequencies to investigate DNA composition and sequence changes within prokaryotic organisms. Results showed prokaryotic chromosomes can be described by hexanucleotide frequencies, indicating proaryotic DNA is short-range correlated, with information encoded in short oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotide usage varied more in AT-rich and host-associated genomes than GC-rich and free-living genomes, mainly in non-coding regions. Bias in tetranucle usage correlated with GC content, with coding regions more biased than non-coding. Noncoding regions were 5.5% more AT-rich than coding regions on average. Pronounced compositional differences were found within and between AT-rich and GC-rich genomes, with GC-rich genomes more similar in tetranucle usage in noncoding regions. Differences between AT and GC genomes may be attributed to lifestyle, with host-associated bacteria more dissimilar and less biased than free-living archaea. Statistical tests on sequenced bacterial and archaeal chromosomes revealed largest increase in information from dinucle to trinucle usage, with less gained from tetra to heptanucle and no additional in octanucle frequencies, indicating oligonucle sizes larger than hexanucle possess little information in proary DNA.
Meiotic recombination ensures the correct segregation of homologous chromosomes during gamete formation and contributes to DNA diversity through large-scale reciprocal crossovers and localized gene conversion events. Researchers analyzed both types of recombinant molecules in sperm DNA at six active hotspots and found disparity in transmission of allelic variants indicative of cis-acting influences. A novel form of biased transmission exclusive to noncrossover recombinants was identified at two hotspots, arising from differences in heteroduplex formation and mismatch repair between crossovers and noncrosso. This biased conversion does not influence hotspot activity but constitutes a source of recombination-driven meiotic drive, potentially affecting thousands of recombination hotspots. The drive favors strong G/C over A/T base pairs, correlating with high GC content and recombination in mammalian genomes. Heterozygosity at a single SNP leads to differences in initiation between interacting haplotypes and influences hotspot activity, resulting in meiotic drive favoring hotspot-suppressing variants. Biased conversions accompanying crossovers have been observed as deviations from the expected 1:1 ratio of allele frequencies amongst recombinant progeny. The findings suggest a form of biased conversion acting on the human genome, contributing to the correlation between GC content and recombination, and evolution of genomic composition.
Exposure to environmental chemicals and drugs can have negative effects on human health, and understanding their molecular mechanisms is crucial to determining risk. A high-confidence human-protein association network has been built by integrating chemical toxicology and biology, revealing uncharacterized connections between compounds and diseases. This computational model predicts compounds that may be risk factors for human health and identifies potential associations between chemicals and proteins. Examples include chemicals associated with breast cancer, lung cancer, and necrosis, and protein targets for diethylhexylphthalate, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-dioxin, pirin, and permethrin. Associations are supported by recent studies, illustrating the power of integrating toxicogenomics with other data. The approach combines toxicogenomics, chemical structures, protein-protein interactions, disease information, and functional annotation to associate chemicals with diseases and identify molecular targets. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database was used to select 42,194 associations between 2,490 compounds and 6,060 molecular targets involved in human disease. Analysis identified clusters to predict chemicals affecting human health and new chemical-disease associations. The network lacks direction, making it impossible to separate positive from negative associations between chemicals and diseases. Advances in toxicomics provide gene/protein activity in response to small molecule exposures, enabling analysis of environmental chemicals with similar expression profiles.
Researchers have developed a nonlinear network receptive field model to characterize auditory cortical neurons, revealing extensive integration and multi-feature selectivity in the primary auditory cortex. The model, consisting of 1-7 sub-receptive fields that interact nonlinearly, better predicts neural responses to auditory stimuli than standard spectrotemporal receptive fields. The network field reveals excitatory and inhibitory sub-fields with different properties and interactions that give rise to operations such as gain control and conjunctive detection, enabling increased selectivity for complex spectrotemporal structures. Fitting feedforward models to single neuron activity in primary areas allows for better predictions of responses to natural sounds and unmasks nonlinear processing strategies used by the brain. The approach reveals richness and nonlinearity of cortical processing in an interpretable form, showing neural responses depend on multiple features in the stimulus space that interact in structured nonlinear ways. The fitted models reveal sensitivity over wider time and frequency ranges than conventional models and distinct properties, including gain and conjive selectivity, critical to auditory function. The nonlinear receptive field model expands simple linear field models, yielding improved predictive power and revealing key aspects of cortical processing while remaining interpretable in physiological context.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for casein kinase 2 (CK2)-mediated BMAL1-S90 phosphorylation in regulating central and peripheral clocks, with CRY acting as a repressor protein. CRY-mediated binding of CK2 to BM1 inhibits BM1-S90 phosphorylation by CK. The FAD domain of CRY, two-terminal BM1 domains, and BM1-Lys acetylation/deacetylation by CLOCK/SIRT1 are critical for CRY-mediated BM1-CK2 binding. BM1-S90 phosphorylation is prerequisite for BM1-Lys acetylation. A dual-feedback model proposes CRY-dependent CK-driven posttranslational BM1-BMAL loop as part of the core oscillator. CRY proteins have a dual function, repressing BM1CLOCK-driven transcription and CK2 kinase activity toward BM1-90. BM1 is hyperphosphorylated in CRY-deficient mice, indicating CRY involvement in rhythmic BM1 modification. The study established a circadian-controlling role of CK kinase in BM1 phosphorylation and a novel role of CRY as regulator of cyclic BM1 phosphorylation. The CK-mediated postlational loop regulates the intracellular circadian oscillator. CRY binding of CK2 to BM1 inhibits BM90 phosphorylation, with CK remaining catalytically active until inactivated after CRY binding. The cyclic BM phosphorylation is a critical event in the mammalian circadian core machinery, forming a distinct loop in the clock with integral roles in the oscillator through periodic CRY negative suppression.
Salmonella enterica has developed mechanisms to survive the antibacterial activity of bile, which disrupts membranes, denatures proteins, and damages DNA. Sublethal concentrations of sodium deoxycholate adapt Salmonella to survive lethal concentrations of bile through changes in gene expression, including upregulation of the Rpo-dependent stress response. Rpo− mutants are bile-sensitive, indicating the crucial role of the general stress response in adaptation. Individual cells can become bile-resistant without adaptation, with frequencies of 10−6 to 10−7 per cell generation, and some isolates are stable, indicating resistance can be acquired by mutation. Full genome sequencing of bile-resistant mutants shows alteration of lipopolysaccharide transport is a frequent cause of mutational resistance. Selection on lethal bile also provides isolates that are not mutants, suggesting they derive from cells whose physiological state permitted survival upon encountering bile. Single cell analysis shows stress genes are activated in the absence of sodium deoxycholate, underscoring phenotypic heterogeneity in clonal populations. Non-mutational preadaptation may be caused by activation of bile-resistance responses in the absence of bile. Growth on sublethal bile concentrations is accompanied by changes in gene expression, and batch cultures contain cells with high resistance without adaptation. Genetic analysis identified cell functions increasing resistance by activating defense, and wild-type resistance can be increased by growth in sublethal bile. Bile-resistant mutants can be isolated on lethal concentrations and may provide an alternative for adaptation to the gall, and mutational adaptation may be speeded by bile during long-term infection of the bile-laden bladder.
The E. coli chromosome is compacted into 400-500 supercoiled domains through active and passive mechanisms, including transcription and DNA-protein association. Prophage Mu is organized as a stable domain bounded by proximal location Mu termini L and R, 37 kbp apart on the genome. Formation and maintenance of the Mu domain is dependent on a strong gyrase site at the center, Mu end, MuB protein, and E. coli nucleoid proteins IHF, Fis, and HU. The domain is observed at two different chromosomal locations and its establishment is promoted by low-level transcription from two phage promoters, one of which is domain-dependent. Prophage λ does not form an independent domain. Low levels of MuB are expressed in the lysogen from Pe and a newly identified promoter Pe, with Mu configuration important for transcription from Pe but not Pe. E. coli NAPs such as H-NS, IHF, FIS, and HU are implicated in maintaining chromosomal supercoiled domains via DNA bending and bridging properties. The Mu domain is proposed to confer transposition readiness by fostering topological requirements and proximity of Mu ends, with potential benefits to the host from a subset of proteins expressed by prophage aiding long-term stability.
Primaquine is the only licensed antimalarial that prevents Plasmodium vivax relapses and clears mature P. falciparum gamocytes, reducing post-treatment transmission. A study in Papua New Guinean children treated with Chloroquine and Artemether-Lumefanine plus Primaquine or placebo found Prima reduced Plasium vivax gametocyte incidence by 73%, comparable to its effect on blood-stage infections. 92% of Plasium vivax and 79% of P.falciparum gamocyte infections were asymptomatic. Multivariate analysis showed reduced odds of gametocytes in mixed-species infections versus single-species for both Plasium vivax and P.falciparum. No difference was observed between Prima and placebo in gamocyte density or proportion of infections carrying gamocytes. Relapses and new infections had similar levels of gamocytemia, highlighting the importance of anti-hypnoite treatment for Plasium vivax control. The majority of gamocyte carriers were asymptomatic, suggesting the need for sensitive detection and early treatment of submicroscopic Plasium. Prima prevented relapses and reduced Plasium vivax gamocyte carriage, but had no effect on gamocyte positivity or density, except in mixed-species infections where odds were 60% reduced and densities 30 lower.
The Rho family of GTPases plays a crucial role in controlling actin organization during cellular responses such as migration, cytokinesis, and endocytosis, with primary members Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 having different effects on actin remodeling. The mechanism involves targeting the plasma membrane and activation by GTP binding, with GTP cycling between the membrane and cytosol being key to differential regulation. A modeling framework was developed to analyze experimental data, revealing GDI-mediated cycling and distinguishing between GDI-dependent and independent mechanisms, including vesicle trafficking and association-dissociation of GTP with membrane molecules. Analysis of Rac membrane cycling shows lower affinity of GDI for RacGTP compared to RacDP can be explained by faster dissociation from the membrane. Non-steady-state solutions for membrane fraction of GTP are presented in multidimensional charts, illustrating effects of GEFs/GAP and affinities between GTP and membrane/GDI on bound Gase. The methodology analyzes glucose-stimulated Rac cycling in pancreatic β-cells, providing a guide for assessing modifications to compensate altered GTP-GDI balance in disease scenarios. The study demonstrates Rho-GTP cycling can access diverse pathways through different systems and manipulations, with GDI-mediated and independent mechanisms contributing to Gase cycling, and interaction with GDI inhibiting nucleotide exchange.
Monitoring and evaluation programs for schistosomiasis typically collect data from school-aged children, as they are most likely to be infected, but adults are also infected and should be considered in treatment strategies. Mathematical models show that in moderate prevalence regions, treating only school-aged children may achieve World Health Organization goals, but in high prevalence regions with high adult infection burden, adult treatment is required. The optimal strategy depends on the burden of infection in adults, not just prevalence in children. Collecting data from a broader age range, including adults, at baseline and throughout treatment, is necessary to determine the best approach. The burden of infection in adults varies geographically due to behavioral, cultural, water, sanitation, and hygiene factors, and has been observed to differ in countries and communities. Including adults in treatment and monitoring is crucial as mass drug administration targeted only at school-aged children leaves a reservoir of infection in the community. Recent analyses recommend adaptations to guidelines, such as expanding treatment to adults or increasing frequency, and individual adherence to treatment should be collected in monitoring and evaluation programs to accurately determine the best strategy for a region.
Researchers applied a computational model of epilepsy to patient-specific structural connectivity derived from diffusion tensor imaging of 22 individuals with temporal lobe epilepsy and 39 healthy controls to predict surgery targets. The model was validated by examining patient-control differences in simulated seizure onset and network location. Results showed patients transitioned from non-epileptic to epileptic states more often than controls and regions in the left hemisphere, particularly temporal and subcortical, were frequent starting points for seizures. Contral and frontal locations may play a role in seizure spreading or resistance. Patient-specific resections led to better outcomes than routine procedures. The study aimed to develop a framework for predicting surgical outcomes using a bistable model and DTI data, hypothesizing subject-specific surgery would give greater seizure reduction. The brain was modelled as a network with structurally distinct regions abstracted to nodes and connections mapped through imaging. Seizure initiation and spreading were modelled using connectivity to individual patients. Validation examined initial nodes situated in the brain, with left temporal lobe origin expected in left TLE, matching clinical observations. Top escaping nodes were identified in both patient and control populations. The study provides a step towards patient-specific computational modelling of epilepsy to inform treatment strategies.
Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) employs several strategies to counteract host antiviral defenses, including the use of viral interferon regulatory factors (vIRFs) that block cellular IRF activities and induce apoptosis. The vIR-1 protein targets the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bim, a key regulator of HHV8 replication, and inactivates it via nuclear translocation. Immunofluorescence and western analysis revealed vIR-1-mediated relocalization of Bim in transfected cells, while co-localization of vIR-1 and Bim was detected in nuclei of lytically infected endothelial cells. Direct interaction between vIR-1 and Bim was confirmed by co-precipitation assays, and Bim-binding residues of vIR-1 were mapped by deletion and point mutagenesis. vIR-1:Bim interaction is crucial for vF1 replication and anti-apoptotic activity, and blocking this interaction with a cell-permeable peptide corresponding to the Bim region of vIR1 confirmed its relevance to v1 replication. This is the first report of an IR protein interacting with a Bcl2 family member and nuclear sequestration of Bim as a means of inactivation. The data reveal a novel mechanism by which a virus controls replication-induced apoptosis, suggesting inhibitory targeting of vIR-1:Bim may provide an antiviral strategy. vIR-1 regulation of B prooptotic function represents a critical component of v1 activity, essential for normal productive replication in endothelial cells, and disruption of this regulation could provide a means of controlling HH8 replication.
Researchers investigated the role of epithelial αVβ6 integrin in regulating lung immune responses to respiratory pathogens, finding that its upregulation during injury moderates acute lung injury through undefined mechanisms. β6-deficient mice had increased survival during influenza infection due to limited viral spread, reduced acute lung injury, and constitutively activated CD11+ alveolar macrophages, and elevated type I interferon signaling. Administration of transforming growth factor-β to β6 mice reduced macrophages and interferon activity, losing the protective phenotype. Protection extended to other pathogens like Sendai virus and bacterial pneumonia. Mice lacking β6 integrin developed less severe lung injury with altered homeostasis, possessing high CD11+ macrophages. Resistance to influenza depended on loss of transforming growth factor-β and elevated interferon signaling. Macrophages from treated with transforming factor-β displayed decreased interferon transcripts. The loss of β6 integrin resulted in an altered macroage population and increased interferon activation, enhancing protection from infection. β6 mice were protected from influenza-induced disease and other pathogens, independent of microbial numbers. Treatment with transforming factor-β reversed the macroage phenotype, losing protection, suggesting β-mediated transforming factor activation is crucial for protection and the macroage phenotype, resulting in decreased viral spread.
A retrospective analysis of 733 cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Argentina evaluated the usefulness of the Leishman Skin Test (LST) as a diagnostic tool. The majority of cases (93%) were localized, 7% had mucosal involvement, and <1% disseminated. Diagnostic confirmation was reached in 65% through positive smears from skin or mucosal lesions, with 6 cases having negative ST. Among smear-negative cases, 190 were also ST-negative, but 69 were ST-positive. Lesions older than 21 days correlated with positive results for both smear and ST. The study supports the use of ST as a diagnostic complement for American Cutaneous Leishiasis across age groups, even in endemic areas, with high correlation with smears. Leishmania (V) braziliensis is the most frequent cause of cutaneous and mucosal leishiasis in the Americas, with low parasite burden complicating diagnosis. The Leishin Skin Test relies on delayed hypersensitivity to Leishmania antigens, manifesting as an indurated nodule 48 hours post-inoculation. Standardization of the technique and further research will aid in managing suspicious cases. Overall sensitivity was over 98% using lesion smears as the comparator for all clinical forms, including localized, mucocutaneous, and disseminated leishiasis.
Genome-wide association studies have identified over 40 loci that affect the risk of coronary artery disease, but the causal mechanisms at most loci are unknown. Recent studies suggest many causal variants influence disease through altered transcriptional regulation in disease-relevant cell types. Researchers explored changes in transcription regulation during lipid-induced transformation of macrophages to lipid-laden foam cells, using open chromatin mapping and enhancer transcription factor mapping. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein exposure was associated with changes in chromatin and enhancer sites, correlated with expression of nearby genes, and enriched for transcription factors including C/EB-beta. Variants at coronary artery disease-associated loci were enriched in altered chromatin sites, including rs72624, an oxLD-induced enhancer at PP2 locus. OxLD increased CEB-beta binding and enhancer activity with the protective allele of rs726. Expression of PP2 protein LPP was present in foam cells in atherosclerotic plaques and oxLD exposure upregulated LPP in macrophages, resulting in degradation of pro-inflammatory mediators. The results demonstrate a genetic mechanism contributing to coronary artery disease risk at the PP2 locus, highlighting the value of studying epigenetic changes in disease processes involving pathogenic stimuli.
In districts with trachoma prevalence of 5.0-9%, one round of azithromycin mass drug administration (MDA) with 80% coverage can reduce trachomatous inflammation-follicular prevalence to <5%. A study conducted in 8 districts in Malawi with baseline prevalence of 5.0-9% found that after one round of azithromycin MDA, all 18 evaluation units had trachomatous inflammation-folicular prevalence <5%. The Malawi Ministry of Health administered azithromycin to a total population of 3,632,175 between October and November 2015, targeting districts with baseline prevalence obtained from 2013 surveys using Global Trachoma Mapping Project methodology. Results suggest one round of high-coverage MDA may be sufficient to eliminate active trachoma in hypoendemic districts, supporting Malawi's goal to eliminate trachoma by 2020. Previous studies in Tanzania and The Gambia also indicate one round of high-coverage azithromycin can interrupt local transmission of ocular chlamydia trachomatis, providing optimism for trachoma elimination as a public health problem by 2020.
Plants have evolved sophisticated innate immune systems to defend against pathogen attacks, utilizing nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins as intracellular sensors that recognize pathogen-encoded effectors and initiate complex responses. In Arabidopsis, NLR proteins RPS2 and RPM1 trigger resistance upon recognition of specific effectors, leading to increased cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, transcriptional reprogramming, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and programmed cell death (PCD). Six closely related Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) mediate bifurcate immune responses, with CP1/2 controlling cell death onset and sustained CP4/5/6/11 phosphorylating WRKY transcription factors for transcriptional reprogramming. CP1/2/4/11 phosphorylate plasma-resident NAD oxidases for ROS production, contributing to PCD. Functional and genetic screens identified WRKY transcription factors acting synergistically with CPs in primary NLR signaling. Sustained activation of CP4/5/6/11 phosphorylates WRKY8/48 for transcriptional reprogramming, while CP1/2/4/11 phosphorylate NPH oxidases for ROS production. Genetic evidence shows Ca+ signaling via CPs plays a pivotal role in downstream signaling and pathogen resistance mediated by intracellular NLR sensors. NLR proteins monitor perturbation of host proteins by pathogen effectors to mount responses, with AvR2 degrading Arabidopsis R4 to activate R2 and Avr1/B inducing R4 phosphorylation via host kinases to initiate RPM1 signaling.
Schistosoma haematobium is a neglected tropical disease that infects over 200 million individuals in 77 countries, causing significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite its scope, less than 0.5% of investigations have attempted to predict its spatial or temporal distributions. A retrospective study in Nion, Mali, used general exponential smoothing methods within a state-space framework to forecast Schistoma haematium time-series from 1996 to 2004, capturing seasonal and interannual fluctuations. Mean absolute error was circa 25% for 1 to 5-month forecasts. The framework produced reasonably accurate forecasts, reflecting S haematium-induced terminal hematuria incidence and non-linear interactions between disease dynamics, climate, irrigation, and public interventions. Schistoma haematobium poses an enormous burden on public health in developing countries, and control programs could benefit from forecasting and early warning systems to enhance management and mitigation. The employed framework can assist managing and assessing S haemat transmission and intervention in Nion and potentially the Sahel. Schistoma incidence rises due to irrigation projects, sedentary existence, and ineffective control, impacting asymptomatic and symptomatic infections. This study addresses the paucity of S haemat time-series forecasts in Sahelian locations and advocates for parsimonious state frameworks to forecast neglected diseases.
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) has evolved a self-imposed restriction mechanism through the tegument protein pp150, which prevents viral gene expression in the S/G2 cell cycle phase of fully permissive cells by binding to cyclin A. Researchers investigated the physiological relevance of this restriction during productive HCM infection using a cyclin-binding deficient pp150 mutant, finding that unrestricted gene expression in S/G2 led to G2 arrest. Cells in G2 arrest, but not mitotic cells, supported viral replication. Cyclin destabilization by the viral product pULa was required to maintain the virus-permissive G2 arrest. A double mutant where pp150 and pULa are disabled in cyclin interaction forced mitotic entry of infected cells, severely impacting viability and virus growth. pp150 and pULa cooperate to build a cell cycle strategy of cyclin targeting and avoidance essential for productive HCM infection. pp150 restricts viral expression to G0/G1 phase where cyclin A is low, while S2 cells delay but do not abrogate infection as pp-mediated repression is relieved after cell division. pp-dependent restriction to cyclin-negative cells delays gene expression and replication in proliferating cells. A cyclin sensor-less pp150 mutant showed high growth rates in G1 and G2 compartments.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that results in progressive degeneration of neurons, leading to paralysis and death, with approximately 10% of cases being familial and 90% sporadic. Genetic studies in familial ALS have identified causative mutations, but the cause remains unknown in 30% of familial and most sporadic cases. To identify novel variants linked to ALS, researchers undertook targeted sequencing of 169 known and candidate disease genes in 242 sporadic ALS cases and 129 controls. A significant enrichment of novel and rare variants was found in cases versus controls, indicating identification of disease-associated mutations. Functional studies and bioinformatics tools assessed variant pathogenicity, demonstrating cases have a higher burden of deleterious mutations than controls, suggesting novel or rare mutations contribute to sporadic ALS. Of 242 sequenced patients, 144 had rare or novel variants, indicating approximately 40% have no identifiable genetic cause. New variants were identified in known ALS genes and associated genes, with an association found between APOE and new variants in trio and RRM studies. The study highlights the utility of next-generation sequencing and rare variant analysis in understanding sporadic disease etiology.
Researchers investigated the role of Interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the development of T cell memory to influenza virus, analyzing virus-specific T cell activity in wild-type and IL-6 deficient mice. The study found that CD4+ but not CD8 T cell memory is critically dependent on IL-6, due to its ability to suppress CD4CD25 regulatory T cells (Tregs). Influenza-induced IL-6 limits the activity of virus-specific Tregs, facilitating the activity of virus-specific CD4 T cells, ensuring antigen-specific Tregs do not down-modulate the immune response, favoring pathogen clearance and host survival. In IL-6 deficient mice, CD4CD25 Tregs isolated 8 weeks post-infection suppressed proliferation of influenza-specific CD4 T cells, consistent with impaired memory responses. No increased cell death was found amongst lymphocytes in IL-6 deficient mice, implying a defect in T survival does not account for the failure to detect influenza-specific CD4 T memory. The major target of IL-6 activity is the Treg population, with CD4 memory diminished due to Treg suppression, while CD8 memory remains unimpaired, indicating CD4 and CD8 cells differ in susceptibility to Treg suppression. IL-6 is a selective regulator of long-term CD4 T memory through limiting Treg activity.
Researchers have identified enolase, a glycolytic enzyme, as the first protein to interact with Cytosine-5 methyltransferase 2 (Dmt2), which functions as a DNA and RNA methyltransferase. Enase, known for converting 2-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, exhibits both cytoplasmic and nuclear localization in Entamoeba histolytica and acts as a Dmt2 inhibitor. This inhibitory activity is antagonized by 2-phosphoglycerate, suggesting glucose metabolism controls enase's non-glycolytic function. Glucose starvation drives enase to accumulate in the nucleus, forming a complex with E. histolytica DMT2 homolog and reducing tRNA methylation. Enase's role as a Dmt inhibitor is demonstrated in E. histolytica expressing nuclear-localized enase. Results establish enase as the first Dmt-interacting protein and highlight its role in modulating Dmt activity. The study provides in vivo and in vitro evidence linking glucose metabolism to Dmt activity and shows Dmt as a tRNA methylase in eukaryotes. Sequence homology between Dmt and enase suggests conserved interaction outside Entamoeba, supported by binding of Drosila and human Dmt proteins to enase. The enase-Dmt interaction's significance in higher eukotes requires further investigation. The study reveals enase's dual role in glycolytic pathway and as a Dmt inhibitor.
Researchers have identified microRNAs in the saliva of mosquitoes, specifically Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, for the first time. Next-generation sequencing detected 103 microRNAs, including 31 novel ones, in the saliva of these mosquitoes. Several microAs were found to be expressed only in Chikungunya virus-infected mosquitoes. Five saliva microAs were tested for their role in CHV infection and demonstrated a functional role in transmission and establishment during blood feeding. Inhibiting these microAs decreased viral replication, suggesting their presence enhances CHV replication and dissemination in the host. MicroAs are generally intracellular but have been found in human serum, saliva, and other biofluids, but not previously in mosquito saliva. Deep sequencing identified mature microAs in two Aedes species saliva, with 72 aligning to previously identified microAs and 31 potential novel microAs. CHV infection affected saliva microRNA profiles with distinct microAs in uninfected and infected mosquitoes. The study provides evidence for the presence of mature microAs in mosquito saliva and their role in CHV infection.
Researchers investigated the role of nuclear double-strand break repair proteins Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59 in mitochondrial DNA repair in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Rad51 and Rad59 were found to localize to the mitochondrial matrix and Rad51 binds directly to mitochondrial DNA. A mitochondally-targeted restriction endonuclease was used to produce a unique double-strand break in the mitochondrial genome, allowing analysis of double-strand break repair in vivo. Loss of these proteins decreased the rate of spontaneous deletion events and loss of Rad51 and Rad59 impaired repair of induced mtDNA double-strand breaks. The study demonstrates that Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59 impact the rate of mitochondrial DNA deletions and repair of induced double-strand breaks, with Rad51 and Rad59 localizing to the matrix of mitochondria. Homologous recombination pathways exist in mitochondria and identification of mitochondrial-specific factors interacting with Rad51, Rad52, and Rad59 will help elucidate repair pathways. The mechanisms of mitochondrial mutagenesis and double-strand break repair are poorly understood, but improved control of double-strand break induction allowed study of mtDNA repair kinetics using genetic and molecular methods, confirming delays in break processing and generation of products with loss of these proteins.
Rheumatic heart disease poses a significant burden globally, particularly among disadvantaged populations, resulting from acute rheumatic fever, a complication of Group A Streptococcal infection. A systematic review was conducted to determine the association between social determinants of health and Group A Streptoccal infection, acute rheumatic fever, and rheumatic heart disease. The review included 90 studies, with 49 being of poor quality, and found 57.1% reported significant associations between socioeconomic determinants and risk of Group A Streptoc infection, and 50% with acute rheumatic fever/rheumatic heart disease. Crowding was the most assessed factor, followed by socioeconomic status. The majority of studies reported positive associations between crowding, dwelling, education, employment, and nutrition with increased risk. Crowding and socioeconomic status met criteria for causal association, but substantial heterogeneity existed across studies. The literature lacks quality, with most being observational, not interventional, and crowding presents a practical target for prevention. Socioeconomic status was assessed in six studies for Group A Streoc infection and 36 for acute rheumatic/rheumatic heart disease, with 50% and 44% reporting positive associations respectively. Case-control studies were more likely to report positive findings, with 100% reporting at least one association, compared to 64.9% of other studies.
A single point mutation in the PhoQ/PhP bacterial signaling network can confer novel properties, resulting in a bistable response to stimuli, unlike the wild-type's graded response. The mutant exhibits distinct morphologies in on and off states, which are inherited over many generations. External conditions that repress signaling in the wild-type drive the mutant to the on state. Mathematical modeling suggests bistability depends on autoregulation of Pho and PhQ. The on state has lower fitness in stationary cultures, but high inheritance can epigenetically trap cells in a low-fitness state. A point mutation in histidine kinase PhQ produces a phosphase-deficient protein, giving rise to bistability and pleiotropic alterations in cell physiology. At low kinase rates, the phosphase-deficient PhQ/PhP network exhibits bistability, existing in off and on states. The T281 substitution in PhQ results in bistability, persisting morphologically distinct states for generations. Architectural features allowing bistability are shared among two-component systems, but the bistable phenotype comes at a cost. A mathematical model of the PhQ/PhP network shows the kinase rate influences PhP production, providing insight into why the phosphase-deficient mutant is not constitutively on. The study demonstrates the versatility of the prototypical two-component architecture, highlighting tradeoffs in the PhQ/PhP system.
Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM) is a rare but devastating infection caused by the free-living amoeba Naegleria fowleri, with high mortality rates and limited treatment options. Due to the lack of economic incentives for pharmaceutical development, researchers rely on repurposing existing drugs, such as antifungal agents, for treatment. Naegleria fowleri requires ergosterol for cell membrane synthesis, similar to fungi, making sterol biosynthesis disruption a potential target. The CYP51 enzyme, essential for ergosterol synthesis, shares 35% sequence identity with fungal orthologs, suggesting repurposing of antifungal azole drugs like conazoles. Studies assessed conazoles' impact on sterol biosynthesis and viability of Naegleria fowleri trophotes, identified the endogenous CYP51 substrate, and analyzed interactions between recombinant CYP and conazoles. Results validated CYP51 as a druggable target and conazoles as candidates for PAM treatment. Fluconazole, miconazole, ketoconazole, voricon, and itracon have shown amoebicidal effects against Naegler fleri in vitro. Disruption of sterol biosynthesis is a validated strategy against fungal pathogens, and CYP is an extensively exploited target for antifungal agents. The similarity between Naeg fowleri and fungal CYP raises the possibility of repurposing antifungal drugs for PAM treatment, providing a potential therapeutic option for this devastating infection.
Researchers investigated the role of interleukin-4 receptor alpha (IL-4α) in maintaining type 2 immune responses and protective immunity against nematode infections. Using a strain of mice with temporally controlled IL-4α deletion, they found sustained expression of IL-4α is required for maintaining type 2 immune responses and protective immunity after polarization with Nippostrongylus brasensis infection. Temporal deletion of IL-4α prior to secondary infection showed that signaling via this receptor drives efficient recall of type 2 responses and clearance of parasites. The study demonstrates IL-4α mediated signaling is necessary for maintaining anti-nemat type 2 responses, describing a novel function distinct from its role in immune polarization. Impairment of IL-4α signaling disrupts established Th2 responses during primary and secondary infections, limiting the host's ability to expel worms. Abrogation of IL-4 signaling prior to secondary infection led to diminished Th2 recall and reduced ability to clear infection, indicating a role in recall response. The findings elucidate unknown functions of IL-4 signaling beyond establishment of Th2 responses, revealing a unique role in maintenance of anti-nemat Th2 responses. The study expands understanding of IL-4 mediated signaling in protective responses against nematodes, highlighting its critical role in host protection against parasitic nematodes.
Bartonella bacteria are prevalent in mammals and cause numerous human infections, and understanding their evolution and host switching patterns can reveal current distribution and potential cross-species transmission mechanisms. Analysis of the largest collection of Bartonella glA genotypes, including 67 new genotypes, shows the pathogenic genus likely originated as an environmental bacterium and insect commensal before infecting mammals. Rodents and domestic animals serve as reservoirs or key hosts for most Bartonella genotypes in humans, with evidence of exchange between phylogenetically distant domestic and wildlife due to increased contact. The study constructs global phylogenies of Bartonella from 16s rRNA genes and citrate synthase to determine evolutionary history, host switching, and spillover into humans or commensals into wild species. Host specificity seems due to ecological factors rather than immunological incompatibility, with a range of zoonotic strains and divergent strains having similar clinical presentations. Certain mammalian species, such as dogs, cats, and rats, have brought Bartonella strains globally, with rats being common in the largest clade of distributed rodent Bartonella. The influence of humans on Bartonella categorizes genotypes into monophyletic clades found in rats, rodents, humans, domestic and wild animals, highlighting the need for caution in contact between humans, domestic animals, and wildlife to protect health.
The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 is upregulated in cancer tissues and its elevated expression is associated with hyperproliferation. MALAT1 levels are regulated during normal cell progression and modulate the expression of cell cycle genes, required for G1 and mitotic progression. Depletion of MAL1 leads to activation of p53 and its target genes, with cell defects sensitive to p53 levels, indicating p53 is a major mediator of MAL1 activity. MAL1-depleted cells display reduced expression of B-MY, an oncogenic transcription factor involved in G2 progression, due to altered binding of splicing factors on B-MB preRNA and aberrant alternative splicing. MAL1 promotes cellular proliferation by modulating expression and preRNA processing of cell-regulated transcription factors. Differential MAL1 levels during cell stages influence expression of genes involved in cell progression. MAL1 depletion in human diploid fibroblasts induces DNA-damage, activating p53 and target genes, with cell defects sensitive to p53 levels. Abnormal MAL1 expression results in aberrant splicing, misexpression of cell cycle and death genes, contributing to tumor progression. MAL1 influences key regulators, altering transcription of downstream genes, with alternative splicing changes observed for BY in MAL1-depleted cells. Functional p53 is vital to evoke G or S arrest in MAL1-depleted cells.
Juvenile hormone (JH) plays a crucial role in regulating insect growth, metamorphosis, and reproduction, with its action on larval metamorphosis well-studied, but molecular basis in adult reproduction not fully understood. Methoprene-tolerant (Met), the JH receptor, mediates JH action in metamorphosis and vitlogenesis. Using RNAi in migratory locusts, JH stimulates DNA replication and increases ploidy in preparation for vitlogenesis, with Mc4 and Mc7 genes in DNA pathway expressed in presence of J and Met. Depletion of Mc4 or Mc7 inhibits de novo synthesis and polyploidization, reducing vitlogen mRNA and impairing oocyte maturation and ovarian growth. Met directly regulates transcription of Mc4 and Mc7 by binding to consensus sequences. JH-receptor acts on Mc4 and Mc7 to regulate DNA replication and polloidy for vitlogenesis and oocyte maturation. In adult females, JH acts independently to stimulate vitlogenesis and egg production, with importance of other Mcm subunits not ruled out as J stimulates gene expression in synchrony with Mc4 and Mc7. J acts on Mc genes for replication of fat genome to facilitate V expression for oocyte maturation, showing variation in J regulation within insects.
The Treatment of Early Neuropathy Leprosy trial evaluated the effectiveness of 20-week versus 32-week prednisone courses in leprosy patients with recent nerve function impairment. 868 patients were randomly allocated to either 20 or 32 weeks of prednisone treatment, starting at 45 or 60 mg/day depending on body weight, then tapered. The primary outcome was proportion of patients with improved or restored nerve function at week 78. At 78 weeks, 78.1% in the 20-week arm and 77.5% in 32-week arm showed improvement, with no significant difference between groups. Secondary outcomes, including Reaction Severity, SAL, and Participation Scales also showed no difference, except a higher proportion of Serious Adverse Events in the longer treatment arm. A 20-week prednisone was as effective as 32-week in improving recent clinical neuropathy, suggesting 20 weeks as the preferred initial treatment duration. Most patients showed improvement, but around 15% required further individualized treatment due to reactions or deteriorating neuropathy. The results indicate 20 weeks of prednisone is sufficient for most lepro patients with recent nerve impairment.
Male Rocky Mountain elk and European deer produce distinct vocalizations during mating season, with elk producing high-frequency bugles and deer producing low-frequency roars. A finite element model of the larynx and wave propagation of vocal tract based on elk morphology and biomechanics simulated sound production. Low frequencies require low vocal strain, large lung pressure, and glottal flow for intensity exceeding 70 dB at 10m, while high-frequency bugles require large muscular effort and lung pressure. Glott efficiency is higher in elk, suggesting an advantage for high-pitched signaling due to lower airflow and acoustic radiation at higher frequencies. High-frequency signals may indicate muscular strength and endurance, while low-frequency signals relate to body size. Contrary to expectations, large mammals like elk use high-pitched vocalizations for display, and the dichotomy between low and high-frequency calls is dramatic in these closely related species. Simulations showed vocal fold oscillation sustained at 65-140 Hz, with requirements for respiratory energy similar between elk and deer, but differing efficiency in aerodynamic to acoustic energy conversion. High-frequency production provides an advantage, and future studies will determine if the auditory system is better suited for high-pitched sounds.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-through sequencing is replacing chromatin immunoprecipation with genome-wide tiling array as the preferred approach for mapping transcription-factor sites and chromatin modifications. Current analysis relies on uniquely mapping reads, omitting up to 30% of alignable reads. A new approach utilizes multi-reads, allocating them as fractional counts using a weighted scheme. Incorporating multi-reads increases sequencing depth, detects novel peaks, and improves detection in mappable regions. Analysis of human and mouse datasets shows peaks from multi-read have similar characteristics to uni-read peaks, except majority reside in segmental duplications. Validation of GATA multi-read peaks by quantitative real-time ChIP identifies novel target genes. Incorporating multi-reads increases sequencing depth by 22% and 17% in STAT1 and GATA ChIP samples. Discarding multi-reads leads to reduced coverage, but incorporating them improves detection in repetitive regions, identifying novel sites not found with uni-reads. Next-generation sequencing enables large-scale profiling of transcription factor binding and chromatin modifications, and incorporating multi-reads enhances peak detection, particularly in segmental duplications. Multi-read peaks are located near promoters and genic regions, and their incorporation increases sequencing depth by up to 25%.
Achieving the 2020 targets for controlling or eliminating four neglected tropical diseases, including human African trypanosomiasis, leprosy, visceral leishmanis, and Chagas disease, set by the World Health Organization, is estimated to have significant socioeconomic benefits for individuals. A systematic review of literature on productivity loss and out-of-pocket payments related to these diseases was combined with projections of the number of people suffering from each disease from 201-2020 and 2020-203. Meeting the targets would result in global productivity gains of $23.1 billion and $35.9 billion in 201-202 and 202-203 respectively. Reductions in out-of-pocket payments would be $14 billion and $18 billion for the same periods. Despite limitations, including limited data on leprosy out-of-pocket payments, the benefits of achieving the targets are considerable, exceeding necessary investments by endemic governments and partners. The frequency of these diseases among the poorest households makes these investments valuable for improving well-being and reducing inequity. Estimated annual burden of out-of-pocket payments was calculated for each country and disease, with significant gains expected in the Americas and South Asia due to Chagas and visceral leishmanis.
Researchers investigated the relationship between neuronal selectivity and information encoding in the auditory cortex, challenging the prevailing theory that neurons with higher selectivity carry more information about sensory inputs. In the auditory cortex, neuronal responses are less selective immediately after sound onset and become more selective in the sustained response, previously thought to encode presence and content. However, the study found that the population conveys similar information across both epochs despite selectivity differences. The amount of encoded information depends on the total spikes in the read-out window, with inhomogeneous Poisson spiking accounting for this property. Neuronal selectivity increases as spiking evolves after sound onset, with high rates during the transient epoch and settling to lower sustained values, resulting in sparser representation and higher selectivity. Current theory posits unselective onset responses encode sound presence and selective sustained responses encode identity, but this approach has caveats. The findings imply a novel principle of sensory encoding potentially shared among multiple systems, contradicting the notion that higher selectivity neurons provide more information, instead suggesting rate determines population coding accuracy in the auditory cortex.
Researchers investigated the role of the co-stimulatory molecule OX40 in controlling persistent viral infections, specifically in the context of LCMV clone 13 infection. They found that OX40 is crucial for maintaining anti-viral T cell responses over time, as cells lacking the O40 receptor failed to accumulate and T cell-dependent germinal responses and LCM-specific antibodies were severely impaired. O40-deficient mice failed to control LCMV clone 13 infection, highlighting the importance of O40 signaling during persistent infection. O40 promotes long-term survival of T cells and shapes both CD4 and CD8 T responses during persistent LCM13 infection, including T-dependent antibody responses. O40-deficiency impacted the anti-viral response during LCM13, with impaired CD4 T cell responses and reduced antibody titers. Expression of O40 correlated with PD1 during acute and persistent LCM infection, suggesting sustained O40 expression is a result of ongoing antigen recognition. O40 receptor expression was stronger on CD4 cells but also present on a subset of antiviral CD8 cells. The findings establish O40 as key in sustaining cellular and humoral immunity during viral persistence, with implications for studying T cell dysfunction in human infections.
Convergent evolution of mechanically optimal locomotion in aquatic invertebrates and vertebrates has been observed in a diverse group of animals, where a mechanically optimal method of swimming with elongated fins has evolved independently at least eight times in both vertebrate and invertebrate swimmers across three phyla. The optimal wavelength, calculated by dividing the length of undulation along an animal's fin by the mean amplitude of undulations, consistently results in a value of around twenty, maximizing the force generated by the body and swimming speed. This optimal wavelength has emerged in morphologically diverse aquatic animals, including cuttlefish and cartilaginous and bony fish, which swim by undulating elongated fins while keeping their body rigid. The regulation of this optimal wavelength may reflect the action of common genetic networks underlying convergent evolution. The number of undulations present along the fin of a swimming animal can be predicted based on the optimal wavelength and mean undulation amplitude. Convergent anatomical specializations have also been found in body-caudal swimmers, such as thunniform swimmers like tuna and lamnid sharks, which minimize trunk movement during tail movement, resulting in pure thrust and faster swimming speeds.
Researchers investigated the role of condensin complexes in neural stem cell divisions during cerebral cortex development, finding that both condensin I and II are essential for neural stem cell survival in mice. Simultaneous depletion of both condins leads to severe defects in chromosome assembly and segregation, DNA damage, and p53-induced apoptosis. Individual depletions of condins I and II result in slower loss of neural stem cells with distinct mitotic defects, including chromosome missegregation in condin II-depleted cells and mitotic delays in condin I-depleted cells. Condin II plays a critical role in establishing interphase nuclear architecture, with its depletion leading to hyperclustering of pericentric heterochromatin and nucleoli. The study demonstrates overlapping and non-overlapping functions of condins I and II in neural stem cells and provides insight into their intricate balance. Results show condins I and II have almost equal contributions to neural stem cell division and survival, with loss of either inducing DNA damage and p53 accumulation, leading to apoptosis. Contrary to previous findings in embryonic stem cells, both condins are essential for neural cell survival, indicating cellular responses to condin depletion vary among cell types.
Schistosomes are unusual among hermaphroditic trematodes as they have evolved gonochorism, with sex determined by a female heterogametic system, and phenotypic sexual dimorphism appearing after infection of the vertebrate host. The molecular mechanisms triggering sexual differentiation in these species remain unknown. To study sex determination and differentiation, researchers investigated the transcriptome of Schistoma mansoni in a stage- and sex-comparative manner, performing RNA-seq on males and females for five developmental stages. 7,168 genes were differentially expressed between sexes, with 4,065 functionally annotated. Transcriptome data was completed with H3K27me histone modification analysis. Candidate determinants of sexual differentiation, sex-based interaction with the vertebrate host, and dynamics of H3K27me histone mark between sexes were identified. Results show distinct male and female transcriptional landscapes of host-parasite crosstalk, genetic determinants, and epigen regulators, suggesting a combination leading to optimized dimorphism. This study provides therapeutic targets and insights into parasite development and reproductive function, as S. mansoni is pathogenic for humans. The global transcriptome of S. mansoni was analyzed in five stages, from undifferentiated cercaria to phenically distinctive male and female worms, revealing different life-history traits between males and females and no phenic dimorphism from eggs to early schosomula stages despite genetic sex differences.
Researchers propose an approach to model disagreements among experts in large-scale annotation efforts by assigning a confidence value to each annotation, representing the probability of its correctness. Two probabilistic models were developed and compared using simulations, then tested on a dataset of 10,000 sentences annotated by eight experts. A subset of 1,000 sentences was further annotated by five new experts to validate the models. Results show the approach increases the probability of choosing the correct annotation, even when all annotators disagree. A corpus of 10,000 annotated sentences is made publicly available, representing a specialized curation task but with generalizable methodology. The study aims to quantify certainty in individual annotations for a group of annotators, allowing retention of the dataset for machine learning training. Annotators estimated error rates can be used to assign confidence to data annotated by a single expert, benefiting curation teams conducting small-scale experiments. The goal is to generate a manually annotated corpus for training computers to perform well-defined tasks at scale, distinguishing knowledge, certainty, evidence, and scientific statements. The approach enhances existing curation with experimental design and modeling, applicable to most annotation studies.
Researchers have developed a DNA vaccine platform using geese to produce antiviral biologics, including polyclonal neutralizing antibodies, to combat hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) caused by Andes virus (ANDV) and AND-like viruses. Geese were vaccinated with an ANDV DNA encoding virus envelope glycoproteins, resulting in high-titer neutralizing antibodies after the second vaccination, which were maintained for over a year. A booster vaccination led to extraordinarily high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Analysis showed these antibodies to be highly reactive to specific amino acid sequences of ANDV envelope glycoproteins. The efficacy of goose-derived antibody was tested in a hamster model of lethal HPS, where immune sera or IgY/IgΔ purified from eggs were passively transferred to hamsters after ANDV challenge, resulting in protection of 8 out of 8 and 7 of 8 hamsters, respectively. In contrast, hamsters receiving Ig/IgΔ from normal geese or no treatment developed lethal HPS. The findings demonstrate the DNA/goose platform can produce a candidate antiviral product capable of preventing lethal disease when administered post-exposure, offering an alternative to human convalescent sera or mammalian antibodies which are in short supply or have risks of reactogenicity in humans.
Changes in DNA methylation patterns play a crucial role in the etiology of human cancers. The Dnmta3 enzyme is required for establishing normal methylation patterns, and mutations in Dn3 have been described in leukemias. Deletion of Dn3 in a K-ras-dependent lung cancer model promotes tumor progression, suggesting the enzyme suppresses tumor development by stabilizing methylation patterns. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing characterized methylomes from D3 wildtype and D3-deficient mouse tumors, showing profound methylation changes in K-ras-induced cancer. D3 wildtype tumors had large hypomethylated domains corresponding to nuclear lamina-associated domains, while D3-deficient tumors had uniformly hypomethylated genomes. D3 is required for efficient methylation of active chromosome domains, and D3-deficient tumors show gene deregulation in these domains. D3 is expressed in normal lung tissue and K-dependent lung tumors, deletion promotes tumor progression. Immunoprecipitation of methylated DNA showed several thousand fragments hypomethylated in D3-deficient tumors. Whole-genome bisite sequencing generated genome-wide methylation maps, showing unambiguous loss of methylation marks in D3 mutant tumors. Large domains with reduced methylation are a feature of human cancer methylomes. A single oncogenic mutation induces hypomethylated domains in mouse tumors. D3 deficiency increases the fraction of advanced tumors, accompanied by complex changes. The results define the role of D3 in maintaining methylation patterns in cancer and uncover features of cancer methylomes, suggesting D3 acts as a tumor suppressor gene.
Researchers have investigated the neural mechanisms underlying sequence generation in the songbird premotor cortical microcircuit, revealing a spatial and temporal organization that supports sparse sequences of neural activity. Multi-channel electrophysiology and calcium imaging show that neural activity in the premotor cortex is correlated on a scale of 100 μm, with basal-ganglia-projecting excitatory neurons firing at a specific phase of a local 30 Hz rhythm. The premotor activity is inhomogeneous in time and space, with a mesoscopic pattern underlying the generation of neural sequences controlling song. In singing birds, the relationship between time and space in premotor area HVC is neither random nor globally organized, but clustered on a 100 μm scale, with a 30 Hz rhythm influencing the timing of projection neurons. Excitatory and inhibitory neurons are spatially clustered and fire in alternating phases, suggesting a microcircuit where multiple pools of excitatory neurons drive interneuron populations. The recurrence of these scales and rhythmic times across species raises the possibility that spatial clustering and 30 Hz rhythmic alternation may be a feature of cortical microcircuits critical for sequential behavior. These findings suggest future models of motor sequence generation in HVC should consider spatially correlated patterns of excitation and inhibition forming the basis of stereotyped sequences driving birdsong, moving away from abstract models of neuronal chains defined by excitatory cells.
Researchers investigated the role of evolutionarily conserved genes essential for viability in regulating lifespan, screening 2,700 genes in Caenorhabditis elegans and identifying 64 that extend lifespan when inactivated postdevelopmentally. These candidate regulators are highly conserved from yeast to humans and include insulin and metabolic pathways, as well as translation, RNA, and chromatin factors. Inactivation of these genes can extend lifespan as much as the strongest known regulators of aging. Early inactivation causes growth arrest at larval stages, with some arrested animals living longer than wild-type adults. DAF-16 is required for enhanced survival of arrested larvae, suggesting increased longevity is a physiological response to gene inactivation. Insulin-signaling pathways play a role in regulating aging at any life stage. Loss-of-function mutations in insulin/IGF1/DAF-2 pathway can double lifespan, with regulation occurring during adulthood. RNA targeting insulin receptor/DAF2 at any developmental stage extends lifespan, while conditional alleles cause dauer arrest if inactivated at L1 stage but increase longevity in adults. Null alleles are lethal, demonstrating necessity of uncoupling developmental and aging phenotypes. Caloric restriction, sir-2.1, and let-363 also regulate lifespan, with perturbations in mitochondrial function increasing lifespan. DAF16 activity is modulated by JNK, SIR-2.1, HSF-1, LIN-14, and SMK, with germline and somatic signals regulating lifespan.
Researchers have identified a critical role for laminin beta 1 (lamba) in zebrafish fin regeneration, specifically in the creation of a specialized epidermis that instructs growth from the underlying tissue stump. A genetic screen for mutations that impair this process revealed a temperature-sensitive allele of lama that blocks regeneration. Lama, but not its paralog lambb, is induced in a subset of epithelial cells after amputation, where it is required to establish and maintain a polarized basal epithelial layer. This facilitates expression of morphogenetic factors, such as shh and lef1, basolateral positioning of phosphorylated Igf, patterning of new osteoblasts, and regeneration of bone. Lama function is dispensable for juvenile growth, homeostatic tissue maintenance, repair of fins, or renewal of genetically ablated osteoblasts. Fgf20 mutations or transgenic Fgf receptor inhibition disrupt lama expression, linking a growth factor to epithelial maturation during regeneration. The findings reveal transient induction of lama in epithelial cells as a key growth-guided step in formation of a signaling-competent regeneration epidermis. The regeneration epidermis is shaped by a network of growth factor-ECM interactions and expresses markers of developmental pathways, including secreted factors such as Ffs, Igfs, Wnts, Hhs, Activin-β/TGF, retinoic acid, Bmps, and Notch. Lama induction is dependent on Fgf signaling, both after amputation and throughout regeneration, and is required to establish polarity in basal epithelial cells, induce basal epithelial markers, localize receptors, and align regenerating osteoblasts.
Researchers compared the performance of various linear mixed model approaches and software packages, including EMM, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, GMA, and MMM, in genome-wide association studies with family-based data. The methods were applied to a study of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families comprising 362 individuals, with 197 genotyped. The results showed strong concordance between different linear mixed model approaches, which successfully controlled the genome-wide error rate, except when applied naively to longitudinal data with repeated measures. High correlation was found between linear mixed models and alternative approaches, apart from transmission-based methods when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects. Linear mixed models performed well compared to competing approaches, with choice of implementation based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use rather than power or type I error. The methods were also compared to traditional family-based tests and alternative approaches in software MQLS, ROADTRIPS, and MAST. Simulations and real data demonstrated linear models offered a convenient and robust approach for family-based genome-wide association studies, controlling genomic inflation and offering higher power than traditional family-based analysis.
Researchers have identified three heteroaromatic compounds with activity against intracellular Trypanosoma cruzi through chemical library screening, a crucial step towards developing new treatments for Chagas disease. Current medicines have toxic effects, partial efficacy, and target only the acute phase, with no treatment available for the chronic stage. A whole-cell assay was optimized for high-throughput screening of compounds inhibiting mammalian cell infection by Trypanosoma cruzi trypastigotes. A 200-compound library was screened using recombinant T cruzi Tulahuen strain expressing β-galactidase. Three hits, PCH1, NT1, and CX1, showed high activity against T.cruzi and low toxicity to host cells in vitro with IC50 values of 54, 190, and 23 nM respectively. Each compound presents a different mechanism of action on intracellular proliferation of T.cruzi amastotes. The compounds also showed activity against intracellular T.cruzi from the Y strain and related kinetoplast species Leishmania major and amazonensis. Characterization of chemically related molecules allowed selection of two compounds, PCH6 and CX2, with IC50 values of 2nM, approximately 100 times lower than current medicines. These results provide candidate molecules for Chagas and leishmanias treatments.
A novel diagnostic platform, termed "Backpack PCR", has been developed for the detection of Brugia parasites in mosquitoes, utilizing a rapid NaOH-based DNA extraction methodology coupled with a portable, battery-powered PCR and test-based DNA assay. This platform eliminates the need for expensive thermal cyclers and real-time PCR instruments, making it suitable for use in resource-limited settings. The performance of the NaOH-based extraction was compared to silica-based techniques and demonstrated to be effective in extracting DNA from parasite-spiked mosquito pools. The test-based detection assay was compared to real-time PCR and conventional PCR with gel electrophoresis, showing sensitive and genus-specific detection of parasite DNA. Laboratory-based thermal cycling was compared to a field-friendly miniaturized PCR approach, demonstrating potential for point-of-collection use. The platform provides an alternative to cost-prohibitive column-dependent DNA extractions, increasing the feasibility of molecular xenomonitoring in Brugia-endemic locations. The development of a similar assay for Wuchereria bancrofti, responsible for 90% of the global lymphatic filariasis burden, is underway. The method could also be extended to other mosquito-borne infections such as malaria, Zika, deng fever, and Chikunya. The "Back PCR" platform amplifies a 132 base pair region of non-coding Hha repetitive sequence, selected due to its high copy number and reliability in molecular assays.
Researchers have developed a theoretical study to examine the impact of domain architecture on the assembly and integrity of elastomeric proteins, which have evolved multiple times through evolution to produce monomers that self-assemble into polymeric structures with stretch and recoil properties. The proteins are composed of alternating elastomeric and cross-linking domains, with the former providing elasticity and driving assembly and the latter stabilizing the polymer. A novel simulation environment using diffusion-limited aggregation models the self-assembly of rod-like particles with alternating architectures, generating various aggregates analyzed by graph-theoretic metrics to predict structural integrity. Results show the relative length and number of elastomeric and cross-link domains significantly impact morphology and integrity, with highly connected polymers formed from rods with large cross-link elements and smaller elastomeric domains. The study provides insights into the evolution of elastomeric proteins and may guide the design of novel biomaterials. Elastomeric proteins are composed of alternating domains of elastom and cross-link elements, with self-assembly driven by elastom domains and stabilized by cross-link domains. The simulation environment models the self-assembly of elastom molecules as circular rods of elast and cross-link domains in various architectures, providing insights into molecular basis of elastom evolution and guiding rational design of elastopeptides.
Ebolaviruses possess longer genomes than most non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses due to long 5′ and 3 untranslated regions in the seven transcriptional units, but specific functions have not been assigned to these regions. The Zaire ebolavirus 5′-UTRs lack internal ribosomal entry function and differentially regulate cap-dependent translation when placed upstream of a reporter gene, with the 5′-UTR from the polymerase mRNA strongly suppressing translation. The 5-UTR has upstream AUGs that initiate translation, surrounded by a weak Koz sequence, and suppress primary ORF translation in a position-dependent manner. Under conditions where eIF2α is phosphorylated, the presence of the uOR maintains translation of the primary ORF, indicating the uOR modulates translation in response to cellular stress. A recombinant EBO with the uAUG mutated to UCG showed attenuated virus growth titers 10-100-fold lower than wild-type in Vero and A549 cells, decreased RNA synthesis, and enhanced sensitivity to thapsigargin. The data identify mechanisms by which EBO regulates polymerase expression, demonstrate relevance to replication, and a potential therapeutic target. Mutating any of four uAUGs in the EBO genome enhances translation at the primary ORF, suggesting EBO encodes mechanisms to respond to cell stress. Regulating EBO levels may provide balance during replication as shown in EBO minplicon polymerase assays and the recomant EBO mutant virus lacking uAUG in 5-UTR.
Genome instability plays a crucial role in various biological processes and diseases, including cancer, and genome-wide mapping of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is essential for understanding chromosomal architecture and specific regions of DSs. Researchers developed a method for precise genome-wide mapping of blunt-ended DSs in human chromosomes and observed non-random fragmentation and DS hot spots scattered along chromosomes, delimiting 50-250 kb domains. Approximately 30% of these domains possess coordinately expressed genes and PAR1 and HNRPA2B1 specifically bind DNA sequences at the domain termini. Data suggest a novel type of gene regulation: coordinated transcription or silencing of gene clusters by DS hot spots and PAR1 and HNRPB1 binding sites. The study highlights the relationship between human chromosomal fragile sites, chromosomal organization, and gene regulation, which may be important for cancer genomics and gene therapy. DNA double-strand breaks have been studied due to aberrant repair and chromosomal damage leading to genomic rearrangements driving cancer development by deleting tumor suppressor genes or amplifying oncogenic regions. Deep sequencing indicates non-random DS distribution defining protected 50-250 kb domains containing coordinately expressed gene clusters. PAR1 and HRP1 binding at domain termini provide a clue to the mechanism, with PAR1 involved in chromatin regulation and HRP in nuclear processing. The findings suggest DS correspond to fragile sites and the technique can be used to study chromosomal sites in various human cells, influencing transcription within domains and promoting further study of HRP mechanistic roles in chromosomal domains.
Researchers studied trypanosomatid infection in bats from two areas with different levels of preservation in the Atlantic Forest of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Reserva Ecolica Guapia and Estação Fiocruz Mata Atlântica. The results showed no influence of preservation level on bat species richness, with 15 and 14 species respectively, and similar chiropterofuna and higher abundance of common fruit-eating bat species. Of 181 bat specimens analyzed, 24 were infected, including one Sturn lilium individual also positive by blood examination. Molecular characterization showed similar tryosomatid infection rates in both areas, 15% and 11%. Trypanosoma dion was the most detected parasite, followed by T. cruzi DTc and Tc and Tryosoma sp. Mixed infections were observed, including T. dionii/TcIII and T dion/TcI. The study also describes Crithidia mellae, a monoxenous parasite, infecting a vertebrate host in the Americas for the first time. Bats harbor a great diversity of tryosomatids, maintaining tryosomat diversity in sylv environment. Infection rates were slightly higher in preserved areas, 15%, than in degraded areas, 11%. High diversity of tryosomatid species and genotypes were isolated, indicating bats are resilient to infection and sources of vectors, maintaining high parasite diversity. The study provides an overview of tryosomatid diversity in areas with different human disturbance, highlighting the role of bats in maintaining tryosomatid species.
Ticks are the primary arthropod vectors of human and animal diseases in Europe, with the Ixodes ricinus species transmitting various bacteria, viruses, and parasites. A study of 267 Ixodes ricinus female specimens in the French Ardennes found 45% were co-infected, carrying up to five pathogens, and all were infected with at least one microorganism, including symbionts. High-throughput real-time PCR detected 37 pathogens, rRT-PCR detected Tick-Borne encephalitis virus, and nested PCR detected symbionts. Interactions between pathogens showed a strong association between Borrelia garinii and B. afzelli, but none between symbts and pathogens. The study reveals high pathogen co-infection rates, raising questions about co-transmission to humans and animals and health consequences. High symbt prevalence opens new avenues regarding effects on pathogen transmission and vector competence. Half the ticks carried at least one pathogen, with 54% of infected by two pathogens. Lyme disease spirochetes were most prevalent at 21.7%, including B. burgdorferi sensu. A novel high-throughput method identified major and neglected tick-borne pathogens in a single sample. Adult females were analyzed due to increased infection and co-infection chances. Ix ricinus is key in human and animal health due to long attachment to vertebrate hosts and blood meals during life stages.
Hematopoietic stem cell lineage decisions are determined by genetic networks that are turned on or off in a switch-like manner, but prior to commitment, genes are primed at low expression levels. A computational model of the hematopoietic erythroid-myoid lineage decision, involving the genes PU.1 and GATA1, reveals insights into cooperativity, priming, and irreversibility. The model suggests a mechanism involving a cofactor regulated and recruited by one of the master genes to bind to the antagonistic partner, necessary for bistability and switch-like behavior. Suppression of the cofactor can lead to loss of cooperativity and a primed state for PU1 and GATA. The PU1-GATA switch interacts with another mutually antagonistic pair, FOG1, which inherits the state of upstream genes and reinforces the decision through feedback loops, leading to irreversible commitment. The genetic switch handles the erythroid-myoid decision by regulating cooperativity through recruitment of cofactors. Perturbing feedback between master regulators and targets suggests reprogramming strategies. The approach provides a framework for lineage commitment studies and aids the search for lineage-determining genes. The model exhibits bistability, a desired feature for robust lineage determination, and demonstrates how lineage commitment can be achieved through layers of antagonistic gene pairs connected by positive feedback.
Enterococcus faecalis is an opportunistic pathogen with intrinsic resistance to lysozyme, a key effector of the innate immune system, which requires a complex network of transcriptional regulators and genes to inhibit enzymatic and antimicrobial activities. Researchers identified novel genes modulating E. faecalis resistance to lysozyme through random transposon mutagenesis in a quadruple oatA/pgA/dlt/sigV mutant, leading to insertions in the enteroccal polysaccharide antigen variable region. The epa region contributes to resistance to antimicrobials and underpins virulence, conferring resistance to phagocytosis in the zebrafish model of infection. Deletion of pgA in L. monocytogenes decreases resistance, while disruption of genes encoding EPA rhamnopolysaccharide decoration increases E. faalis resistance to lyzyme. The quadruple mutant oatA pgA dlt sigV strain displays high resistance to lysoe, and transposon mutagenesis identified additional genes involved in lysozyme resistance. EPA decoration plays an essential role in resistance to effectors of the innate system and virulence. Production of the rhamnopolysaccharide backbone is insufficient for E faec infections, and modification of the surface polymer is crucial for enteroccal pathogenesis.
Researchers developed RER, a regression analysis of combined expression, to integrate genetic and epigenetic data from Encyclopedia of DNA Elements and The Cancer Genome Atlas to study gene expression in Acute Myeloid Leukemia. RER infers sample-specific activities of transcription factors and microRNAs, then uses these to infer regulatory interactions, circumventing difficulties in integrating generic cell-line and sample-specific measurements. The model was verified through 10-fold cross-validation and outperformed existing methods in detecting microRNA targets. A feature selection procedure identified 18 regulators, including miR-548, whose targets were enriched for leukemia pathways, implicating a novel role in pathogenesis. Survival analysis identified C as a potential prognostic marker. The framework integrated data revealed an AML-specific regulatory program at a global level. The study used a two-stage regression framework to explain mRNA expression, incorporating copy number variation, DNA methylation, and microRNA from The Cancer Atlas, and transcription factor binding from Encyclopedia of DNA. Results demonstrated the model's statistical power in recovering regulatory interactions and predicting gene expression, providing a novel approach to understanding gene regulation in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.
Researchers investigated the role of RNA silencing in the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum higginsum, generating knock-out mutants affecting genes for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, Dicer-like, and Argonaute proteins. No effects on vegetative growth were observed in any mutant strain, but Δcl1, ΔclΔcl2, and Δago strains showed severe defects in conidiation and conidia morphology. Analysis of RNA populations revealed a previously uncharacterized dsRNA mycovirus, Colletotrichumhigginsian non-segmented dsRNA 1, which was derepressed in these strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed a close relationship between ChV1 and the Partitiviridae family. Immunoprecipitation of small RNAs associated with AGO showed abundant loading of 5' containing viral siRNA. Curing ChV from parental and Δcl mutant strains revealed coniation and spore defects were primarily caused by ChV. Results propose RNA silencing involving DCL and AGO functions as an antiviral mechanism. Mutant analysis revealed DCL and AGO affect conidia production and asexual spore morphology in Chiggins. Deletion of DCL and AG led to accumulation of ChV, while R1, R2, and R3 were not functional during growth and coniation or redundant. Curing ChV from Δcl strains increased conidia production by 8.8 times, demonstrating antiviral role of RNA silencing in Chiggins.
Histone acetyltransferase MOF plays a crucial role in meiotic expansion of H2AX phosphorylation and spermatogenesis in mice. Three waves of H2 phosphorylation occur in male meiotic prophase, with the first wave ATM-dependent at leptonema and the second and third ATR-dependent at zygonema and pachema. Germ-specific deletion of MOF in spermatocytes results in global loss of H4K16ac and defective chromatin-wide HAX phosphorylation. In leptene and zygene spermatocytes, γHAX signals are observed along chromosomal axes, while in early-mid pachene spermatocytes, γHAX and MDC are detected along unsynapsed sex chromosomes but fail to expand, leading to meiotic sex chromosome inactivation failure. MOF facilitates meiotic double-strand break repair after RAD51 recruitment, with proficient recruitment to double-strand break sites but defects in repair and crossover formation observed in MOF-deficient spermatocytes. The study demonstrates MOF regulates male meiosis, involved in the expansion of three waves of HAX phosphorylation from leptene to pachene stages initiated by ATM and ATR. Absence of HAX phosphorylation expansion is observed in 37.2% of MOF-deficient early-mid pachene spermatocytes. MOF deletion blocks chromatin-wide HAX phosphorylation in most leptene spermatocytes but γHAX foci are still observed, indicating MOF is not required for initiation of HAX phosphorylation at this stage. MOF is involved in expansion, not initiation, of the first two waves of HAX phosphorylation, preserved in MDC-deficient mice, and essential for the third wave of HAX phosphorylation in pachene spermatocytes.
Human T-cell leukemia type 1 (HTLV-1) infection has the potential to perturb thymic human αβ T-cell development. Researchers investigated the in vivo effects of HTLV1 infection in a "Human Immune System" (HIS) Rag2/-γ-c/- mouse model, where HTLV1 was found integrated in thymocytes and the proviral load increased with the length of infection. Alterations in T-cell development were observed, correlating with proviral load, with mature single-positive CD4 and CD8 cells increasing at the expense of immature double-positive thymocytes. Activated lymphocytes accumulated in the spleen, expressing CD25 and NF-κB dependent genes. Hepatosplenomegaly, lymphopathy, and lymphoma/thymoma were detected in HTLV-infected mice months post-infection. The study demonstrates the potential of the Rag2/-γ-/- model to elucidate the initial steps of leukemogenic process induced by HTLV1. Activated lymphocytes, mainly CD4, were found in peripheral blood, indicating HT1 induced expansion of mature T-cells. A positive correlation between proviral load and T-cell alterations was observed, with high proviral load favoring mature cell development. The model provides a suitable system for studying viral-induced malignancy and the involvement of HT1 genes in pathogenesis. Pathological features may be related to disturbances of αT development by HT1 infection.
A schistosomiasis control project was implemented in Al Jabain locality, White Nile State, Sudan from 2009-201, targeting 78,615 primary school students. The baseline prevalence of Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni was 28.5% and 0.4%, respectively. After 6-9 months post-treatment, the prevalence of S. haematium infection reduced to 13.5%. A higher reduction was observed among girls, moderately infected individuals, and rural residents. Health education increased awareness about schistosiasis and a water facility was constructed at Alida village, where the infection rate decreased. Approximately 200,000 subjects received praziquantel therapy, health education, or clean water supply. The project reduced S. haematium prevalence by over 50% compared to baseline. No significant change in S. mansoni prevalence was observed. The project demonstrated the importance of integrated control measures, including health education and clean water supply, in reducing schistosomis prevalence. The results support the Sudanese government's goal to reduce S. haematium prevalence to less than 10% by 2013. Continuous intervention is necessary to consolidate achievements.
Researchers investigated the role of the Nipah virus matrix protein in viral budding, finding that its nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking and post-translational modification are crucial for this process. The Nip virus, a highly pathogenic paramyxovirus causing fatal encephalitis, replicates in the cytoplasm and buds from the plasma membrane. The matrix protein was detected in the nucleus at early stages of infection before localizing to the cytoplasm and plasma. Mutations in the nuclear localization signal and leucine-rich export signal impaired nuclear-cytoplasm trafficking and abolished budding. A conserved lysine residue served dual functions, mediating nuclear import and regulating export via monoubitination. Overexpression of ubiquitin enhanced budding, while its depletion resulted in nuclear retention and blocked budding. Proteasome inhibitors, including bortezomib, reduced viral titers with an IC50 of 2.7 nM, suggesting potential therapeutic use against acute Nip infection. The study reveals nuclear-cytoplasm trafficking contributes to the ability of the Nip matrix to bud and highlights the efficient use of cellular machineries, where a single lysine residue serves as a signal for nuclear import and regulator of export. These findings open the possibility of using existing therapeutics against Nip infection, classified as a Biosafety Level 4 pathogen.
Poliovirus initiates infection by transferring its genetic material across a cellular membrane into the appropriate compartment of the cell. The mechanisms by which animal viruses deliver their genomes are poorly understood. Researchers combined an imaging assay that tracks the viral capsid and genome in live cells with an infectivity assay for RNA release to characterize early events in poliovirus infection. Effects of RNA delivery from inhibitors of cell pathways were probed systematically. Genome release by poliovirus is highly efficient and rapid, and does not limit overall infectivity or infection rate. Poliovirus binds to receptors on the cell surface and enters by a clathrin, caveolin, flotillin, and microtubule-independent but tyrosine kinase and actin-dependent endocytic mechanism. Immediately after internalization, genome release takes place from vesicles or sealed invaginations within 100-200 nm of the plasma membrane. This settles the debate of whether poliovirus breaks the plasma barrier or relies on endocytosis to deliver its genome. The study characterized the entry pathway using live-cell imaging of infectious dual-labeled poliovirus with biochemical assays measuring RNA release. Results suggest poliov must enter the cell before releasing its genome, which occurs quickly within 100-200 nm of the membrane. Poliovirus internalization is actin-dependent and genome release occurs after endocytosis in vesicles close to the plasma. The study proposes a model for viral entry and genome release where the virus is internalized through a clathrin, caveolin, flotillin-independent but actin and tyrosine kinase-dependent pathway after binding the cell surface.
Dengue fever remains a significant public health issue in Cambodia, particularly affecting children, and education is a key component of the National Dengue Control Program for prevention and control. Community and school-based health education is delivered through outreach activities and campaigns, but is under-funded, irregular, and lacks systematic evaluation. School-based education is restricted in time and lacks practical follow-up activities for prevention and control, resulting in partial adherence. Health education plays a crucial role in informing and encouraging people to participate in disease prevention, but its efficacy is complicated by economic and infrastructural factors in resource-poor countries. Local prevention activities involving community members through education can reduce dengue prevalence, but is hindered by poorly resourced and episodic education and lack of translation to practice. Outreach activities are impacted by political commitment and resource availability. Existing education materials and strategies must be redefined to be practical and applicable, and health practitioners lack training in education techniques, perceiving it as not part of their work. Sustained education for deng prevention and translation of knowledge into practice is necessary to address the gap in deng control in Cambodia.
Researchers investigated the presence of circulating microRNAs released by filarial nematodes into the host bloodstream, using deep sequencing and bioinformatics to identify over 200 mature microRNA sequences of potential nematode origin in Dirofilaria imis-infected dog plasma and 21 Onchocerca volulus-infected human serum. Stem-loop RT-qPCR assays targeting two microRNA candidates, miR-71 and miR34, discriminated infected samples from uninfected ones. The presence of miR71 and mi34 was detected in all samples from dogs infected with D. imitis and Brugia pahangi, but absolute microRNA numbers did not correlate with microfilaria. Over 245 and 261 candidate microRNAs were identified in independent samples of plasma from heartworm-infected dogs, with 96 sequences present in both samples. RT-qPCR assays efficiently discriminated infected versus uninfected samples but did not reflect microfilaria counts or reliable microRNA quantification. Two nematode microRNAs, miR71 and mi34, were detected in all samples from dogs infected with D. imitis, and were previously reported in whole-worm extracts. Two predicted candidates, PC-3-1323_725 and PC-3-2085, were among the top ten most abundant nematode microRNA candidates in infected plasma. The study found parasite-derived microRNAs in plasma or serum of species that do not live in the bloodstream, including Onchocerca volulus, which does not have direct contact with host blood.
Researchers have constructed a coarse-grained model of the catalytic domain of Src-family tyrosine kinases to investigate the dynamics of conformational transitions during activation. The model incorporates experimental structures of the inactive and active states and simulates the energy landscapes of conformation changes. Two major pathways for activation are identified: a coordinated switching mechanism involving the α helix, activation loop, and β strands, and a pathway coupled conformation change with partial unfolding of the N-lobe region. The study characterizes the switching mechanism of the α helix and activation loop in detail. A Markov model is tested for its ability to account for structural kinetics in the context of conformation changes. The results provide a framework for understanding conformation transitions in Src activation. A multi-state model with coarse-grained representations is used to characterize the dynamical process of conformation changes. The study suggests two parallel pathways, one with conformation switching coupled with local unfolding of the Nbe and a direct transition between the A-loop, α helix, and β strands. The connectivity of the network appears qualitatively robust. The large-scale motions in conformation activation occur on a slow timescale, beyond brute-force simulations, and a structure-based coarse-grained model investigates conformation changes on free energy landscapes. The study explores the conformation landscape by clustering configurational space and constructing a structural network from simulations, providing a broad framework for analyzing conformation transitions in Src activation.
Researchers investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying lethality of F1 hybrids between diverged parents, focusing on crosses between diploid and tetraploid individuals of the same genotype, which can result in F1 lethality due to dosage incompatibility. They identified variation in F1 lethality in interploidy crosses of Arabidopsis thaliana and determined the genetic architecture of maternally expressed variation via QTL mapping, finding a single large-effect QTL, DRANGELEVE1 (DSL1), and two QTLs with epistatic relationships to DSL1. DSL1 affects postzygotic lethality via expression in the maternal sporophyte, and fine mapping placed DSL1 in an interval encoding the maternal transcription factor TT2. Maternal parents carrying loss-of-function mutations in TT2 suppressed F1 lethality caused by paternal interploidy crosses. The frequency of cellularization in the endosperm was similarly affected by natural variation and tt2 loss-function mutants. Loss-of-function alleles at TT2 reduced the interploidy hybrid barrier, and allelic variation at TT2 could explain the DSL QTL. Loss-function mutations in TT2 improved interplo crossing success, suggesting F1 lethality in polyploids could evolve rapidly. The role of sporophytically active TT2 in interplo crosses indicates developmental programming of the mother regulates viability of interplo hybrid offspring.
Researchers conducted a comparative host-pathogen coevolution analysis of bacterial pathogens in bats and rodents using Bartonella and Leptospira as models. They analyzed genetic data from 51 Bartonella genotypes in 24 bat species, 129 Bartonella in 38 rodents, and 26 Leptira in 20 bats, generating maximum likelihood and Bayesian phylogenies to test coevolutionary congruence. Results showed significant coevolution between Bartonella and both bat and rodent hosts, but not between Leptira and bat hosts. Event-based cophylogeny analyses revealed Leptira had the most host switches per parasite, while Bartonella had the least. Separate analysis of New and Old World datasets yielded congruent results, with rodent-Barton and bat-Barton having the least host switches, indicating greater evolutionary congruence over time. Coevolution between Bartonella and mammalian hosts remained significant when analyzing New and Old datasets separately, driven by strong host-parasite interactions, with 51% of bat and 67% rodent-bacteria associations significant. The findings suggest differences in disease transmission and host ecology underlie variable coevary patterns, and understanding these patterns can help predict spillover between mammal reservoirs and humans.
A fundamental issue in locomotion is understanding how muscle forcing produces complex deformation leading to movement in undulatory swimmers. Researchers applied a forced damped oscillation framework to a chain-link model to understand how forcing leads to deformation and movement. The framework provides a unified understanding of swimming caused by muscle contractions or forces imparted by the surrounding fluid. Forcing triggers the first deformation modes of the body, causing translational motion, and simple patterns can trigger complex kinematics leading to movement. For muscle activation, the forcing frequency relative to the natural frequency of the damped oscillator is crucial for emergent deformation characteristics. The approach leads to a qualitative understanding of optimal deformation for fast swimming, confirmed by computational fluid dynamics simulations. Prior results on optimal stiffness for maximum speed are explained. The movement of undulatory swimmers is an emergent behavior from muscle activation, with two primary issues: understanding muscle leading to deformation and deformation producing movement. The forced damped oscillation formulation elucidates swimming motion generation, including active and passive swimming from different forcing types, and power transfer during the cycle. Muscle work creates body deformations dissipated into the fluid, with a closed expression for swimming velocity derived from equations of motion.
Genetic recombination between human and animal-derived pathogens can create novel strains of human pathogens, as seen in the influenza H1N1N1 pandemic. Researchers investigated whether recombination between subspecies of the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei from humans and animals can generate new strains of the human pathogen T. b. rhodesiense, responsible for sleeping sickness in East Africa. The trait of human infectivity in T. b. rhodesense is conferred by a single gene, SRA, which can be transferred to the animal pathogen T. b. brucei by sexual reproduction. Experiments showed SRA was readily transferred into new genetic backgrounds by reproduction between T. b. rhodes and T. bruce, creating new strains of the human pathogen. There was no evidence of diminished growth or transmissibility of hybrid trypanosomes carrying SRA. The mobility of SRA by genetic recombination explains the observed variability of T. b. rhodes in East Africa. New strains of the human pathogen T. b rhodes are generated continuously by recombination with the larger pool of animal-infective trypanosomes, presenting a risk for future outbreaks of human African trypanosomiasis.
Diabetes is caused by dysfunction of β-cells in the islets of Langerhans, disrupting insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. Gap junction-mediated electrical coupling between β-cells plays a major role in coordinating pulsatile insulin response at elevated glucose and suppressing secretion at basal glucose. Researchers investigated the mechanisms by which gap junction coupling contributes to islet dysfunction in Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (DM) involving expression of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. A computational model was verified against [Ca2+] and insulin secretion measurements in islets expressing ATP-sensitive K+ channels under different levels of gap coupling. The model predicted how different K+ channel mutations found in DM suppress [2] and the role of gap coupling in suppression. Reductions in gap coupling allowed greater glucose-stimulated [2] and insulin secretion following expression of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Significant recoveries in [2 and insulin secretion were predicted for many mutations upon reductions in gap coupling where stochastic played a role. Findings provide understanding of islet function as a multicellular system and the role of gap channels in exacerbating effects of decreased cellular excitability, suggesting therapeutic options for DM and monogenic diabetes. Gap junction coupling mediates suppression of islet [2 and insulin in presence of ATP-sensitive K+ channels and recovery can be achieved by reduced coupling. Reduction of gap coupling may recover islet function and blunt diabetes caused by KCNJ11 and ABCC8 mutations.
Researchers have established a framework for analyzing gene transcription networks that accounts for retroactivity, a phenomenon where the performance of a module is influenced by its connection to other modules. A module's properties are encoded by three retroactivity matrices: internal, scaling, and mixing, with physical interpretations that can be computed from macroscopic parameters and topology. Internal retroactivity quantifies the effect of intramodular connections on isolated dynamics, while scaling and mixing retroactivity establish how intermod connections change module dynamics. Based on these matrices and isolated module dynamics, the behavior of interconnected modules can be accurately predicted. The implications of internal, scaling, and mixing retroactivity are illustrated on network motifs, including negative autoregulation, combinatorial regulation, two-gene clocks, toggle switch, and single-input motif. A quantitative metric determines the robustness of module dynamics to interconnection, useful for evaluating modularity in natural networks and designing synthetic systems. The model captures effects of retroactivity using measurable biochemical parameters, concentrations, and topology, unlike standard regulatory models based on Hill functions. Accounting for retroactivity reveals surprising properties and aids design, with effects increasing with DNA copy number and decreased dissociation constants.
Researchers investigated recombination in the human pseudoautosomal region 1 (PAR1), a region of homology between the X and Y chromosomes essential for proper disjunction during meiosis. The PAR has an exceptionally high crossover rate, 17-fold higher than the genome-wide average, but the mechanism remains unknown. Using fine-scale genetic mapping, recombination rates, and DNA evolution signatures, and PRDM9 binding sites, the study found PR9 localizes peaks of recombination in human PAR1, unlike in mice. Recombination drives sequence evolution more rapidly in PAR1 than autosomes and hotspot activities differ among populations. PAR1 hotspots have changed between humans and chimpanzees with no shared hotspots. The study suggests PR9 positions recombination events but other factors contribute to the high crossover rate. Loss of PR9-binding motifs via biased gene conversion may lead to evolutionary pressure on PR9 to evolve. The findings have implications for how PAR maintains a high crossover rate, possibly due to chromatin configuration facilitating PR9 access to binding sites. The study provides genetic maps to aid research on this vital genome region.
Researchers have identified a new isoform of the histone demethylase JMJD2/KDM4, termed Δ-JMJD2, which lacks the N-terminal demethylase domain and is required for skeletal muscle differentiation. The amount of Δ-JM2 increases during differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes and is necessary for myotube formation and muscle-specific gene expression. Δ-JM2 promotes Myo-induced conversion of NIH3T cells into muscle cells and binds to genes involved in transcriptional control, leading to gene activation. It is recruited to the Myog promoter at the onset of differentiation, promoting demethylation of H3K9me2 and H3Kme3, allowing Myog expression and myotube differentiation. Genome-wide profiling and siRNA knockdown indicate Δ-J2 acts as a transcriptional coactivator for genes induced during skeletal differentiation. Δ2 regulates histone H3K9 methylation and histone acetylation at muscle-specific promoters, such as the Myog, during differentiation. Depletion of Δ2 impedes Myog induction and H3K9 demethylation, indicating its crucial role in muscle differentiation by directing removal of repressive chromatin marks at the Myog promoter, promoting transcriptional activation and muscle-specific expression. The study demonstrates Δ2 is essential for myotube formation and muscle gene expression, and its induction is crucial for muscle differentiation.
The Guinea Worm Eradication Programme is in its final stages, with only 25 cases reported in 2016, and global eradication requires certification by WHO of the absence of transmission in all countries. An economic evaluation of the programme from 1986-203 estimates the cost per case averted at $11, with a 95% uncertainty interval of $4.70-$12.49. The pre-certification and certification phases cost $0.004 and $0.001 per capita per year. The cost per disability-adjusted life year averted by the programme relative to doing nothing is $222-$372. The programme is more cost-effective than control by 203 if willingness to pay for one year lived without risk exceeds $0.10. Even if costs are twice as high as estimated, the programme remains cost-effective relative to doing nothing. Framed in terms of years lived without risk, a case can be made for finishing the programme, including certification of absence of transmission. The programme's cost-effectiveness against a threshold of half GDP per capita is below $500 in low-income countries, with all costs expressed in 2015 US dollars.
The carbox-terminal domain of the BBK32 protein from Borrelia burgdferi sensu stricto, termed BBK-C, binds and inhibits the initiating serine protease of the human complement pathway C1. Researchers investigated the function of BBK orthologs from Lyme-associated Borrelia burgdferi sensu lato, designated BAD16 from B. afzelii and BGD from B. garinii, and found that B. afii BAD16 exhibits BBK-like activities, including high-affinity binding to C1 protease and inhibition of the classical pathway. Recombinant B. garii BGD bound C1 with high-affinity but had reduced inhibitory activities, while native BGD weakly recognized C1 and did not confer protection from serum killing. Site-directed mutagenesis converted BB32 to resemble BGD, resulting in a chimera that mimicked BGD's properties. The crystal structure of BB32 was solved to 1.7Å resolution, revealing an anti-parallel four-helix bundle with a protruding alpha-helix, and surface-exposed residues relevant to C1 binding and inhibition. BB32 recognized C1 fragments containing the serine protease domain. The study improves understanding of BB32's recognition and inhibition of C1 and provides insight into complement evasion mechanisms of Lyme-associated spirochetes. The findings suggest BB32-mediated evasion is shared across major species of Lyme spirochetes and highlight the importance of determining if BB32-like inhibition is restricted to Lyme spiroches or common to pathogenic Borrelia.
Candida albicans, an opportunistic human fungal pathogen, undergoes morphological and transcriptional adaptations when switching from commensalism to pathogenicity. Researchers investigated morphogenetic control by post-translational phosphorylation, focusing on cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc28, and identified Fkh transcription factor as a regulatory target of Cdc and cell wall biosynthesis kinase Cbk. In stationary yeast cells, 2D gel electrophoresis shows diverse Fkh phospho-isoforms, which transform upon hyal induction before START in the cell cycle, reverting to yeast profile. Mass spectrometry and mutational analyses identified residues phosphorylated by Cdc and Cbk. Substitution with non-phosphlatable alanine altered yeast phosphorylation and abrogated transformation to hyal profile. Transcript profiling revealed hyal phosphorylation is required for expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, host interaction, and biofilm formation, resulting in defects in pathogenic processes. Fkh interacts with chromatin modifier Pob in phosphorylation-dependent manner, providing a mechanism by which phosphorylation regulates specificity. A novel cell-independent phospho-regulatory event subverts cell machinery to a role in commensal to pathogenic switch. Fkh undergoes radical shift in phosphorylation profile upon hyal induction, mediated by Cdc-C1 and Cbk, activating Fkh to promote pathogenic gene expression. Phosphorylation state of Fkh is qualitatively different after hyal induction compared to yeast or stationary cells, dependent on six Cdc target sites.
Trypanosoma brucei, a human pathogenic parasite, possesses both de novo and salvage routes for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, but surprisingly, thymidine kinase (TK) is essential for growth and infectivity. TK catalyzes the formation of dTMP and dUMP, and its catalytic activity is required for function. Unlike humans, T. brucei lacks dCMP deaminase (DCT), which provides an alternative route to dUMP formation. Ectopic expression of human DCT rescues the RNAi growth phenotype and allows selection of viable TK null cells. Metabolite profiling reveals a buildup of deoxypyrimidine nucleotides in TK depleted cells. Knockout of cytidine deaminase (DA) leads to thymidine/deoxyuridine auxotrophy, suggesting T. bruce encodes an unidentified 5'-nucleidase converting deoxypyrimidine nucleotides to their nucleosides. Bioinformatics identifies potential genes encoding 5'-nucleidase activity, including an HD-domain protein catalyzing dephosphorylation of deoxyribonucleotide 5-monophosphates. TK is essential for thymine nucleotide synthesis from de novo or salvage pathways. Reliance on TK in absence of DCT may be a vulnerability among trypanomatids, providing an opportunity for a pan-tryosomatid therapy. T. bruce encodes a complete de novo pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway and pyrimidine salvage enzymes, with TK and CDA essential for in vitro growth and TK essential for infectivity in vivo. Providing an alternative route to dUMP via DCT abolishes reliance on TK, with metabolomic analysis showing dead-end pyrimidine nucleotide formation depleting dTP, suggesting an unidentified 5'-nucleidase interconverting cytosine and thymine deoxynucleotide pools.
The initiation of translation in prokaryotic systems typically requires interaction between the ribosome and a sequence upstream of the initiation codon, known as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence. However, many genes lack this sequence, and the mechanism of start codon recognition in these mRNAs is unknown. Genome-wide searches in various prokaryotes identified sequence elements and RNA structural motifs that mediate translation in mRNAs lacking Shine-Dalgo sequences. Results show that mRNAs without Shine-Dalg sequences have less structure in their initiation region and minimal folding at the start codon. Reporter constructs in bacteria support local unfolded RNA determining start recognition in Shine-Dalg-independent translation. AUG codons reside in single-stranded regions, while internal codons are in structured regions. Bioinformatics and experimental data suggest local absence of RNA structure is necessary and sufficient for Shine-Dalg-independent translation. A large fraction of transcripts are translated in a Shine-Dalg-independent manner in prokaryotic systems, ranging from 15% in γ-proteobacteria to 100% in mitochondrial genomes. Unfolded RNA is the major requirement for efficient start codon recognition in SD-independent initiation, with no evidence for alternative motifs or structural requirements. Shine-Dalg sequences act as ribosome sites by recognizing a motif at the 3 end of 16S ribosomal RNA via base pairing, and their absence raises questions about start recognition in mRNAs lacking this sequence.
Post-Kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) occurs in up to 10% of patients treated for visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in India, with its pathogenesis not fully understood. A study in Bihar, India, treated 874 patients with 20mg/kg liposomal amphotericin B (Ambisome) for VL, resulting in a 99.3% cure rate and 0.3% default rate. Over 5 years, 24 patients (2.8%) returned with symptoms confirmed PKDL, with 89% having macular lesions and a median development time of 1.2 years post-treatment. No significant risk factors for PKDL were identified, but the time to develop PKDL was shorter with Ambome compared to sodium stibogluconate treatment. In this cohort, PKDL following 20mg Ambome treatment appears infrequent with no predictive factors. The median time to develop PKDL was 1.2 years, which should be considered when counseling patients treated with Ambome regimens. PKDL has been reported in up to 60% in Sudan, but presentation and characteristics differ from the Indian subcontinent. The cause, risk factors, and pathogenesis of PKDL are unknown, with host, parasite, and drug-related factors considered. This study demonstrates the possibility of PKDL following 20mg Ambome treatment in the Indian context.
Researchers investigated the re-establishment dynamics of Triatoma infestans, the main vector of Chagas disease, in three villages in northwest Argentina after community-wide insecticide spraying in 1992. Continuous and discrete-time models were fitted to patch-level infestation states to elucidate different aspects of re-establishment. The results showed a 6-month lag between detection of new infestation and dispersal events and a seasonal increase in bug establishment from May to November, coinciding with increased dispersal distance. The probability of new bug establishment increased with time since last infestation. Discrete and continuous-time Markov models showed strong seasonality in bug establishment and dispersal. The study addressed the establishment rate of new populations as a function of distance from existing populations, mechanisms for seasonality, and the effect of insecticide and previous infestation on establishment rates. A continuous model estimated within-season changes and time-dependent effects of insecticide but required assumptions about disperser sources. The contribution of each site to bug establishment was estimated by linear interpolation between bug numbers at t and t+1. Understanding seasonality of dispersal and distance is crucial to optimize vector control timing. Properties of individual sites, including distance, infestation, and spraying history contribute to bug establishment rates.
Researchers investigated the effects of polyomavirus SV40 microRNA on pathogenesis in Syrian hamsters, a model for studying SV40 infections. Hamsters were inoculated with 1×10^7 plaque-forming units of four SV40 variants and sacrificed from 3 to 270 days post-infection, with viral DNA loads in tissues determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. All SV strains displayed persistent infections and slow clearance, with broad tropism in liver, kidney, spleen, lung, and brain, and higher viral loads in liver and kidney. Expression of SV40 microRNA was demonstrated in wild-type SV40-infected tissues, while microRNA-negative mutants produced higher viral loads in liver and kidney. Viruses with complex regulatory regions had higher viral loads in kidney than those with simple regions. Early transcripts were detected at higher levels than late in liver and kidney, with limited clearance of microRNA-deficient viruses. Wild-type and microRNA mutants showed similar transformation rates of mouse cells in vitro and tumor induction in weanling hamsters in vivo. The study identified broad tissue tropism for SV40 in hamsters, expression and function of SV40 microRNA in vivo, dampening viral levels in infected tissues with simple or complex regulatory regions. Kidneys were the major site for long-term persistence, with livers as a secondary site, and viral microRNA reduced viral loads in infected tissues, but did not affect tumorigenicity in hamsters.
A comprehensive examination of positively selected genes in mammalian genomes has been conducted using six high-coverage genome assemblies of eutherian mammals, resulting in improved statistical power and new lineage-specific tests. Of 16,500 genes with high-confidence orthologs, 400 showed evidence of positive selection and 144 showed evidence on particular lineages or clades. Identified genes were enriched for roles in defense, immunity, chemosensory perception, reproduction, complement-mediated immunity, and taste. Several pathways were enriched for positively selected genes, suggesting co-evolution of interacting genes. Analysis indicated most genes switched between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting episodic positive selection. Positively selected genes are expressed at lower levels, in a tissue-specific manner, with enrichment in spleen, testes, liver, and breast but not brain. This study provides evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and insights into functional implications. Genome-wide scans have identified genes with strong evidence of selection, revealing differences in prevalence on lineages and classes. Non-trivial phylogeny allows examination of individual gene selection histories, gaining insight into branches with positive selection. Strong evidence has been found for genes in sensory perception, immunity, hostogen interactions, and reproduction, serving as tools for functional and evolutionary analysis.
Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic pathogen that forms surface-associated communities called biofilms on skin and mucosal surfaces of mammals. Researchers have discovered a novel extracellular fibril structure that promotes S. aureus biofilm integrity, composed of small peptides called phenol soluble modulins (PSMs) with amyloid-like properties. Biochemical and genetic analysis revealed that these fibers share morphological and biophysical characteristics with bacterial amyloids. Mutants unable to produce PSMs were susceptible to biofilm disassembly by degrading enzymes and mechanical stress. Soluble PSM peptides disperse biofilms, while polymerized peptides do not. The aggregation of PSM into amyloid fibers modulates their biological activity and role in biofilms. The S. aureus biofilm matrix contains polysaccharides, DNA, and structural proteins that interact with enzymatic proteins. Under certain conditions, S. aureus produces amyloid fibers contributing to biofilm integrity. Purification analysis revealed several small peptides of the phenol modulin family present. The ordered aggregation of PSM into amyloid fibers abrogates biofilm disassembly activity ascribed to monomeric PSM. Findings suggest PSM modulate biofilm disassembly using amyloid aggregation as control for activity. Synthetic S. aureus PSM self-assemble into amyloid fibers in vitro, demonstrating CR and ThT binding capacities similar to amyloid proteins, implicating fibril formation as a means of altering activity and function.
Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, infects approximately six million individuals in over 20 countries. Monitoring parasite persistence in infected individuals is crucial to develop and evaluate treatments to control the disease. Researchers evaluated a newly developed antibody profiling assay as an indirect method to assess parasite persistence based on waning antibodies following spontaneous or therapy-induced clearance of infection. A multiplex serology assay with 15 optimized T. cruzi antigens was used to evaluate antibody diversity in 165 serum samples from chronic Chagas patients. One specific antibody, Ab3, showed strong correlation with T. cruzi parasite persistence as determined by PCR results. High Ab3 signal was associated with PCR positivity in untreated patients, while decline in Ab3 was observed in benznidazole-treated patients who cleared parasitemia. Ab3 is a surrogate biomarker that correlates with parasite persistence in chronic and benznazole-treated Chagas patients. Ab3 is hypothesized to be induced by incessant stimulation of the immune system by tissue-based parasites undetectable by blood PCR. Immunoassay measurement of Ab3 could be beneficial for monitoring infectious status of seropositive patients. The study aimed to characterize serological profiles of T.cruzi-infected patients using an extended MultiCru assay, identifying Ab3 as a sensitive biomarker for monitoring parasite persistence regardless of PCR results. Ab3 has superior sensitivity for parasite clearance compared to PCR and outperforms standard serology in the tested population.
Chikungunya virus (CHV) is an arthogenic alphavirus that causes fever, severe joint and muscle pain, with chronic musculoskeletal pain persisting in some patients for months to years after infection. Researchers developed a recombinant CHV expressing Cre recomase (CHV-3ʹre) to identify cells contributing to chronic disease. CHV3ʹre replicated in myoblasts and fibroblasts, inducing arthritis in mice, and chronic disease with persistent RNA and myositis similar to wild-type virus. Infection of tdTom reporter mice resulted in a population of tdTom+ cells persisting for at least 112 days, predominantly myofibers and dermal fibroblasts. Treatment with an antibody against Mra reduced tdTom+ cells and viral RNA, implicating them as a reservoir of chronic RNA. Isolation of td+ fibroblasts revealed they harbor most persistent CHV RNA at chronic points. The CHV3ʹre and tdTom system identifies cells surviving CHV in vivo, enriched for persistent CHV RNA, providing a tool for studying CHV pathogenesis in acute and chronic stages. CHV causes debilitating disease with chronic arthgia and myalgia, with unclear mechanisms possibly related to RNA persistence in musculoskeletal tissues. The CHV3ʹre system provides evidence for musculoskeletal cells as targets in acute and chronic stages, with fibroblasts surviving CHV and harboring RNA.
Researchers investigated the scaling properties of dimensionality reduction in neural populations and network models to understand how multi-dimensional neural activity gives rise to brain function. They applied factor analysis to recordings in the visual cortex of non-human primates and spiking models that generate irregular activity through a balance of excitation and inhibition. The study compared scaling trends of dimensionality and shared variance with neuron and trial count, finding that networks with clustered and non-clustered connectivity differed, and in vivo recordings were consistent with clustered networks. Recordings from tens of neurons were sufficient to identify dominant modes of variability that generalize to larger portions of the network. The findings guide interpretation of dimensionality reduction in limited neuron and trial sampling and relate outputs to underlying structure. The study used V1 recordings and spiking models to understand dimensionality generalization to larger numbers of neurons and trials and relation to network structure. Spiking models allowed measurement of dimensionality variation over a range of neuron counts, assessing representativeness of results with limited neurons and trials, and influence of network structure on scaling trends. Clustered networks exhibited fewer dimensions representing large variance, providing nuanced characterization of single-trial activity.
Researchers have discovered that the quorum sensing molecule 2-aminoacetophen, produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, modulates host immune responses to promote coexistence with the pathogen. Mice treated with 2-aminoacetophen prior to infection had a 90% survival rate compared to 10% in non-treated mice. The molecule activates innate immune pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, nuclear factor NF-κB, and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but attenuates immune response upon pretreatment by upregulating anti-inflammatory cytokines. Pretreatment blocks c-JUN-terminal kinase and NFκB activation while preserving extracellular kinase activation, leading to CCA/enhancer-binding protein-β activation and preventing NFκB activation. This dampens inflammatory processes, increasing host survival and pathogen persistence, allowing bacteria to switch to chronic infection mode. The study reveals an immunomodulatory signal promoting interdomain communication, facilitating pathogen persistence and host tolerance. Unlike immune-suppressing QS molecules, 2-aminoaceten minimizes immune activation and increases survival, permitting long-term pathogen presence in vivo. Cytokine profiling shows 2-aminoaceten limits inflammation by dampening pro-inflammatory cytokine activation. This low-molecular QS molecule modulates mammalian-immune signaling, silencing acute virulence and increasing survival, enabling long-term survival within the host.
Mammalian genomes contain many active and fossilized retroelements, which can be domesticated for host purposes, leading to innovations in genome defense and placentation. The L1TD1 gene, derived from LINE-1 retroelement, plays a role in pluripotency maintenance in humans. Originating in the common ancestor of eutherian mammals, L1TD1 was lost or pseudogenized multiple times during mammalian evolution. Positive selection occurred during primate and mouse evolution, and prosimian L1TD replenished with a recent L1 ORF. L1 loss is associated with L1 extinction in megabats but not sigmodine rodents. L1TD may have evolved for genome defense against L1 elements and later incorporated into pluripotency maintenance in some lineages. The bipartite double-ORFp organization of L1 has been conserved since its birth. Genome searches revealed L1 loss on three occasions during placental evolution. Tracing evolutionary origins and selective pressures, L1 dates to at least 106 million years ago, making it more ancient than domesticated retrogenes syncin and F1. Retention of L1 in mammals without active L1 and role in pluripot maintenance may be due to idiosyncratic L insertion patterns. The study highlights the role of retroelement domestication in mammalian biology and adoption of different functions in lineages.
The highly conserved bacterial RNase YbeY is essential in Vibrio cholerae, playing a critical role in virulence, stress regulation, and RNA processing. Ybe is an endoribonuclease crucial for 16S rRNA 3' end maturation and ribosome quality control, and its depletion impedes subunit assembly into 70S ribosomes. Loss of Ybe results in complete loss of mice colonization and biofilm formation, reduced cholera toxin production, and altered expression of virulence-associated small RNAs. Phylogenetic comparison shows Ybe is part of a set of RNases essential in most pathogens. Analysis of rRNA and ribosome profiles of a V. cholera strain partially depleted for Ybe demonstrates accumulation of 16S rRNA precursors and free ribosomal subunits. Ybe is the only RNase crucial for 3' processing of 16S rRNA and its assembly into 70S ribosomes in V. cholera. The ybe genes of distantly related pathogens can complement an E. coli ΔyY strain under stress, demonstrating conservation of YY's activity in stress regulation. This work provides the first exploration of Ybe's physiological role in a human pathogen, showing conserved function across species in essential processes. Ybe's importance to V. cholera pathogenesis is demonstrated by its role in virulence, stress regulation, RNA processing, and ribosome control.
Researchers investigated the relationship between the assortativity signature of transcription factor networks and phenotypic robustness in humans. Transcription factor networks arise from the binding of sequence-specific transcription factors to DNA, regulating nearby genes that may encode transcription factors, forming a network where nodes represent transcription factors and edges denote interactions. Computational studies linked topological properties, such as degree distribution, with robustness to genetic and environmental perturbation, but little is known about assortativity's effect. Assortativity measures the tendency of nodes with similar edges to connect, comprising four components forming an assortativity signature. Using publicly available DNase-seq data, researchers measured the assortativity signatures of genome-wide transcription networks in 41 human cell types, finding all share a common signature conferring phenic robustness to model networks. Theoretical results suggest increased assortativity leads to increased robustness, but biological context was limited due to uncharacterized real-world networks. This study found the common signature and determined each component's contribution to robustness. Transcription factor networks with increased assortativity exhibit robustness to mutation and gene duplication due to shrinking nested subgraph size or increasing regulatory links, dampening phenic effects. Human transcription networks share an assortativity signature providing an additional structural source of robustness.
Researchers investigated how inhibitory and excitatory neurons in the somatosensory cortex collectively encode stimulus-related information by recording activity of up to 74 neurons in anesthetized adult rat barrel cortex using large-scale multi-electrode arrays. Results showed individual inhibitory neurons discriminated between restricted sets of stimuli better than excitatory neurons in granular and infra-granular layers. Ensembles of inhibitory cells provided as much information as comparable ensembles of the 20 most informative excitatory neurons but with less redundancy. This suggests inhibitory neurons dominate information conveyed to the neocortical network, efficiently processing sensory activity. Stimulus-related information was higher in individual and groups of inhibitory neurons compared to excitatory counterparts in granular and infra-granular layers, indicating sharper temporally-precise responses. Inhibitory cell ensembles had lower redundancy compared to excitatory ensembles. Inhibitory neurons conveyed more information about stimulus modalities due to higher spikes, precision, and lower adaptation. Findings propose inhibitory neurons are tuned to different stimuli and play key role in orchestrating cortical activity.
Researchers have engineered a binary adder in a living cell using riboregulation, a fundamental arithmetic unit that sums two bits of information encoded in molecular concentrations. The designer circuit performs the computation in Escherichia coli, encoding the result as fluorescence amplitudes, utilizing post-transcriptional control to switch on silenced genes with small RNAs and allosteric transcription factors to sense molecular signals. This demonstrates regulatory RNAs can be key players in synthetic biology, paving the way for more complex RNA-based biocomputers. The system exploits riboregulation of translation initiation to implement the design, allowing a bacterial cell to perform the sum of two bits of information encoded in IPTG and aTc signal molecules, reporting the sum as red fluorescence and carry as green fluorescence. The genetic system is more organized and scalable, with a reduced footprint due to the use of regulatory RNAs, compared to circuits implemented with transcription factors. This work goes beyond previous combinatorial logic gates, cascades, feed-forward loops, and pulse counters, achieving dynamic behavior through a novel mechanism of gene control with non-coding RNAs and chimeric molecules integrating different domains to transduce molecular signals.
Researchers investigated the inhibition of cytosolic 5′- nucleotidase II (cN-II) by ribonucleoside 5′monophosphate analogues to understand its role in cancer therapy resistance. C-II regulates intracellular nucleotide pools by dephosphorylating 6-hydroxypurine nucleoside 5′monophosphates, and high expression levels are correlated with poor patient outcomes when treated with cytotoxic nucleoside analogues. A class of compounds, ribonucleide phosphonates, with a chemically and enzymatically stable phosphorus-carbon linkage instead of a phosphoester bond, were screened as potential c-II inhibitors. Six compounds showed higher affinity than the natural substrate inosine 5′monophosphate (IMP). The study of purine and pyrimidine analogues and modifications in the phosphate chain defined rules governing ligand affinity, with van der Waals contacts highlighting the role of residues Phe 157, His 209, and Tyr 210. Docking predictions were confirmed by experimental measurements, showing total inhibition of c-II activity at 2mM with three phosphonate analogues. The results emphasize the importance of the non-hydroable phosphon bond in designing competitive c-II inhibitors and hydrophobic stacking by three residues. Thirty-four phosphonate analogues were designed, with twelve possessing a hydroxyl group, and six showing higher scores than IMP, suggesting they may be powerful c-II inhibitors. The phosphon analogues induced stronger inhibition than Fara-AMP, confirming modification of the phosphate chain as a suitable strategy for new c-II inhibitors, with complete inhibition observed at 1.5-2mM for some derivatives.
Researchers have detected prions in milk and colostrum from sheep incubating natural scrapie, a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, several months prior to clinical onset. Abnormal prion protein was found in lactal ducts and mammary acini, particularly in ewes with mammary ectopic lymphoid follicles developed due to Maedi lentivirus infection. Bioassay revealed prion infectivity in milk and colostrum from ewes with lymphoproliferative mastitis and those with lesion-free mammary glands. Infectivity was recovered in cellular, cream, and casein-whey fractions, with the highest titre equivalent to 6g of brain from a terminally scrapie-affected ewe. The findings indicate colostrum and milk from small ruminants incubating TSE could contribute to animal TSE transmission and raise concerns about human exposure to TSE through milk products from ovine and other susceptible dairy species. Prion infectivity was detected up to 20 months before clinical onset in a majority of ewes, with all tested colostrum and milk fractions transmitting disease. The results provide definitive evidence of the presence of infectivity in milk and colostrum from naturally incubating scrapie ewes, raising concerns about the potential infectious character of milk from TSE-affected small ruminant flocks entering the animal and human food chain.
An analysis of 16,370 laboratory samples from patients tested for Ebola virus disease in Liberia between April 2014 and March 2015 revealed significant differences in sex, age, and place of residence between confirmed and suspected cases. A total of 10,536 individuals were identified, with 3,897 confirmed cases positive for Ebola RNA. Young children, the elderly, and those from rural areas were at higher risk of death due to the disease. The case fatality rate decreased from 80% to 63% during the study period. Surveillance and reporting systems malfunctioned during the outbreak, resulting in inadequate data management, including missing and duplicate data. Patients were reported via telephone calls to Liberia's hotline and visited by case teams to ascertain suspected or probable EVD cases. Those meeting the definition were transferred to Ebola Treatment Units for further assessment. Statistical analysis yielded important findings about the outbreak, valuable for epidemiological investigations and understanding. The outbreak began in March 2014, with human-to-human transmission declared ended on January 14, 2016. Data was collected and managed using Microsoft Excel, EpiInfo Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Application, and DHIS2, providing insights into the outbreak in Liberia.
Tyrosinase, a copper-containing monooxygenase, catalyzes the conversion of phenol to ortho-quinone and is generated as a complex with a "cadd" protein that facilitates copper ion transport into the active center. The Tyr98 residue in the cadd protein is converted to reactive quin through μ-η2η-pero-dicopper(II) and Cu(II)-dasiquinone intermediates. Cryo-trapped crystal structures at high resolutions suggest hydroxylation is triggered by CuA movement, inducing syn-to-anti rearrangement of copper ligands after μ-η2η-pero-dicopper(II) core formation, placing hydroxyl in equatorial position for electrophilic attack by Cu2O oxidant. UV and Raman analyses indicate Tyr98 conversion to quin through μ-η2η-peroicopper(II) and Cu(II)dasin intermediates. Crystallographic results show CuA movement to Cu3 prior hydroxylation, indicating Cu3 as functional site, not artifact. Proposed catalytic mechanism of tyin toward cie Tyr98 involves coordination preference by copper oxidation and proton state triggering reaction intermediates. Tyin belongs to type 3 copper family including catechol oxidase and hemocyanin, with dicopper center taking three redox forms. The study provides chemically reasonable postulate of tyin mechanism toward cie Tyr98, with cie binding differing from genuine substrate.
The Npa1 complex chaperones the assembly of the earliest eukaryotic large ribosomal subunit precursor. The early steps of production of the large ribosomal subunit are the least understood stages of eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis. The first precursor to the large ribosomal subunit, the pre-60 particle, contains 30 assembly factors, including 8 helicases that drive conformational rearrangements but lack substrate specificity in vitro. Dbp6 helicase associates with a complex of four assembly factors, Npa1, Npa2, Nop, and Rsa, prior to incorporation into 90 pre-ribosomal particles. N1 forms the backbone of the complex and is essential for the insertion of Dbp6 helic within 90 pre-rib particles. N1 and N2 directly bind Db6 and N1 is essential for its integration. In vivo cross-link analysis maps N1 rRNA sites on 25 rRNA adjacent to the helices of the first and last structure of 25 rRNA. N1 crosslinks to snoRN involved in decoding and peptidyl transfer center modifications. Data suggest Db6 and N1 play key roles in compaction of the core 25RNA and control sno-pre interactions. The N1/N2/N8/R3 core is necessary for stable integration and modulation of Db6 enzymatic activities. All proteins, except R, are essential for growth and required for normal production of the large subunit. Formation of the pre60 particle involves co-transcription recruitment of 30 assembly factors and large subunit proteins. Enzymatic activity of Db6 is essential for large subunit production.
Researchers investigated the role of catecholamines, including norepinephrine and dopamine, in regulating learning rate in a dynamic environment. A study employing pharmacology, scalp electrophysiology, and computational modeling found that the P3 component of EEG, an index of outcome-evoked phasic catechamine release, predicted learning rate and mediated the effect of prediction-error magnitude on learning. P3 amplitude also mediated the effects of unexpectedness and uncertainty of preexisting beliefs on learning. Pharmacological manipulation of catechamine activity affected learning following unanticipated task changes, depending on participants' baseline learning rate. The findings provide evidence for a causal role of human catecholamine systems in learning-rate regulation as a function of environmental change. Trial-to-trial variation in P3 amplitude mediated the effect of prediction-error on learning, suggesting phasic catechamine response drives subsequent increases in learning. The results support the incorporation of unexpected observations into beliefs about the environment's causal structure. The study used correlational P3 analyses and pharmacological manipulation to provide converging evidence for the role of catechamine systems in learning regulation, using a predictive-inference task that measures prediction error and learning on each trial.
Infectious diseases remain a significant challenge for humanity, making surveillance critical. From 2010 to 2016, two Point-of-Care laboratories were implemented in rural Senegal. A homemade syndromic surveillance system, EPIC, was implemented to monitor infectious diseases using data from these laboratories. The study describes implementing EPIC using data from two rural Point-of-care laboratories. After improvement, 15 pathogens were monitored using the same methodology as in France. In five years, 2,577 patient samples from 775 patients were tested, with 739 positive for at least one pathogen. Retrospective analysis generated 443 alarms. Another laboratory processed 316 samples from 298 patients, with 56 positive and 14 alarms. EPIC has been successfully implemented using data from two rural laboratories in Senegal. Using 15 years of experience from Assistance Publique Hôpita de Marseille, EPIC was implemented in Senegal to monitor diseases. EPIC detected numerous events without heavy resources in Marseille and was tested in Senegal. Implementation took less than a month, demonstrating scalability. EPIC surveys 27 tests for 15 pathogens in real-time, an asset over other surveillance systems. Further improvements are needed to enhance the network. EPIC has been spread using data from two rural laboratories in Senegal, improving knowledge on infectious diseases.
Researchers investigated the role of cellular architecture in collective calcium signaling and contractility in multicellular systems, using a combination of computational modeling and plasma lithography micropatterning on endothelial cells. Under histamine stimulation, self-assembled microengineered networks exhibited calcium oscillations, whereas individual cells and monolayers did not. The study found that calcium oscillations depend on the number of neighboring cells coupled via gap junction intercellular communication, providing a mechanistic basis for architecture-dependent calcium signaling. The oscillations attenuated histamine-induced cytoskeletal reorganization and cell contraction, resulting in differential responses in an architecture-dependent manner. Histamine-induced calcium signaling was monitored in individual endothelial cells, monolayers, self-assembled capillary networks, and microengineered networks, showing a rapid increase followed by a slow decay of cytosolic calcium concentration in individual cells and monolayers. Computational models supported that calcium oscillation occurrence is negatively correlated with the number of neighboring cells in the network. The study suggests endothelial cells sense and respond to chemical stimuli according to vascular architecture via collective calcium signaling. The findings provide insights into the mechanism of architecture-dependent calcium signaling, where intracellular dynamics driven by calcium-induced release are sensitive to cyolic concentration, and membrane potential and current create oscillations in coupled cells.
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory disease in infants, and previous studies have elucidated the antibody repertoire following primary RSV infection. The current study examined the contribution of antigenic regions outside the central conserved cystine domain (CCD) of the RSV attachment protein G to RSV-specific immunity. Researchers evaluated the immunogenicity, neutralization, and protective efficacy of RSV antigen sites using recombinant E. coli-expressed ectodomain, CC-deleted ectodomain, N- and C-terminal subdomains, and antigenic peptides. Results showed that CC-deleted ectodomain, N and C-terminal subdomains generated antibody titers in rabbits and mice that bound glycosylated recombinant mammalian-expressed ectodomain and intact RSV particles but had minimal neutralization titers compared to the intact ectodomain. Vaccinated mice challenged with RSV-A2 showed reduced viral replication in the nasal cavity and lungs compared to unimmunized controls. Control of viral loads post-RSV correlated with serum binding to virus particles, and low Th2/Th1 cytokine ratios were found in lungs of CC-deleted vaccinated mice. Data demonstrate multiple protective sites in RSV protein outside the CC contribute to development of a bacterially produced unglycosylated protein as a safe vaccine against RSV disease.
During embryonic development, various genetic cues generate neuronal diversity, with intrinsic transcriptional cascades controlling cell fate and target-derived signals providing critical input. The specification of Drosophila FMRFamide neuropeptide neurons, Tv4, in the ventral nerve cord is triggered by a BMP signal from target cells, activating the FMa gene. A genetic screen identified brr2 and Prp, components of the U5 subunit of the spliceosome, involved in Tv specification. Brr and Prp control FMa neuropeptide expression in six VNC Tv neurons through two mechanisms: proper axonal pathfinding to receive the BMP ligand and RNA splicing of tk and Medea genes in the BMP pathway. Brr plays a cell-specific role in controlling Tv neuron specification through axon pathfinding, Dim expression, and BMP signaling activation. The Tv neuron requires a target-derived retrograde signal, mediated by BMP, to terminally differentiate and activate the FMa gene. Brr regulates the process at three points: axon pathfinding, BMP ligand reception, and splicing of tk and Medea, crucial for BMP signaling. Mutants of brr and prp show Tv cell differentiation defects due to their roles in the spliceosome, with selective effects on neurons contrasting their described roles as essential components.
The abundance of substrate receptor subunits of Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases is tightly controlled to maintain the full repertoire of CRLs, and unbalanced levels can lead to sequestration of CRL components. Misregulation of substrate components, particularly F-box proteins, has been associated with numerous diseases including cancer. A mechanism controlling F-box protein abundance is autocatalytic ubiquity by intact SCF complex followed by proteasome degradation. An additional pathway regulates F-box proteins, exemplified by yeast Met30, involves ubiquitylation and degradation acting on Met30 dissociated from Skp1, requiring cull component Cdc53/Cul1 but independent of Sk1. This non-canonical pathway is critical for chromosome stability and defense against heavy metal stress. Results assign biological functions to a subcomplex of cull-RING ligases comprising Cdc53/Rbx1/C34 independent of Sk1. Met30 is substrate for SCFMet30 ubiquitin ligase, regulating transcription factor Met4 by proteolysis-independent ubiquity. Sk1-free F-box degradation pathway targets Met30 detached from Sk1, involving SC core C53, Rbx1, and ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Cdc34. This Sk1-independent Cul-dependent ubiquity suggests a function of C53/Cul independent from Sk1 association. This pathway regulates F-box abundance in addition to autocatalytic ubiquity targeting F-box proteins dissociated Sk1.
Mammalian Kines-3 motors, specifically KIF1, are dimeric in their inactive state, contradicting the current model that they are monomeric and activated by cargo-induced dimerization. Instead, KIF1 motors are autoinhibited by two distinct mechanisms, which are released upon cargo binding, allowing for activation. Dimeric KIF1 motors undergo processive, ATP-dependent motility, while monomeric forms exhibit one-dimensional diffusion along the microtubule lattice. The motility of dic KIF1 motors is characterized by smooth, unidirectional movement along microtubules at a velocity comparable to vesicles in vivo. Loss of KIF1 function results in decreased synaptic vesicles and axonal growth, highlighting the importance of understanding kines regulation for cargo transport. In the absence of cargo, kines are inactive to prevent futile ATP hydrolysis and motility, with the cargo-binding domain either inhibiting the catalytic head or mediating dimerization on the membrane. Mammalian KIF1 is suited for both diffusive and processive motility, driving long-distance transport in neuronal cells, particularly important for sorting and transporting cargoes to pre- and postsynaptic destinations, such as synaptic vesicle precursors to axon terminals.
Metabolic profiling and network analysis of 76 homozygous tomato introgression lines grown in two consecutive seasons identified 30 metabolite quantitative trait loci and revealed high variability in amino acid content and seasonal fluctuations in sugar levels. Genotypic background was the main factor for metabolic polymorphism, with greater phenotypic plasticity in introgression lines than in the M82 cultivar. Broad-sense heritability suggested different modes of inheritance for seed and fruit metabolite traits. Correlation-based network analysis showed tighter interdependence in seed metabolic processes, with amino acids playing a central role. Six highly-regulated amino acids, Gly, Ser, Thr, Ile, Val, and Pro, were identified with strong interdependence confirmed by mQTL mapping. The results reflect extensive regulation of seed metabolism, coordination with fruit metabolism, and centrality of amino acids in the metabolic network. Statistical analysis indicated environmental and developmental effects on metabolite abundance. Metabolite profiling and genetic variability revealed regulatory mechanisms in seed metabolism, highlighting differences between seeds and fruit in metabolic structure and inheritance. Network analysis coupled with heritability and phenic plasticity tests showed hierarchy between morphological yield-related and metabolite traits.
Vibrio cholerae colonization factor Gbp possesses a modular structure that governs binding to different host surfaces, including the chitinous exoskeleton of zooplankton and the human gastrointestinal tract. The N-acetylglucosamine binding protein Gbp mediates bacterial attachment to marine chitin and mammalian mucin through a previously unknown mechanism. Structural studies reveal Gbp has an elongated, four-domain structure, with domains 1 and 4 showing homology to chitin binding domains. A glycan screening shows Gbp binds GlcNA oligosaccharides. Truncation mutants demonstrate domains 1 and 4 interact with chitin in vitro, while in vivo studies reveal domain 1 is crucial for mucin binding and intestinal colonization. Domains 2 and 3 bind the V. cholera surface. Mouse virulence assays show only the first three domains of Gbp are required for colonization. The three-dimensional structure of Gbp was determined using X-ray crystallography and small angle scattering. Domains 1 and 4 are responsible for chitin and mucin binding, while domains 2 and 3 possess homology to bacterial pili proteins binding the V. cholera surface. Gbp binds GlcNA oligomers and polymers but not GlcNA-beads or cellulose. The findings explain how Gbp provides structural and functional interactions between V. cholera, intestinal epithelium, and chitinous exoskeletons.
Chronic activation of T cells is a hallmark of pulmonary tuberculosis, and the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon rely on the control of effector T cells by regulatory T cells. Research shows that circulating regulatory T cells in adults with pulmonary tuberculosis preserve their suppressive potential, but effector cells from these subjects are resistant to regulatory T-mediated suppression due to the expansion of an activated effector subset identified by Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR expression. This resistance is linked to the expression of IFN-γ, IL-17, IL-22, PD-L1, and β-chemokines CCL3, C4. HLA-DR+ effector cells are resistant to regulatory suppression via CCR and PD1 pathways and express higher levels of Th1/Th17 cytokines, negatively regulating regulatory function. The presence of HLA-DR+ effector cells perturbs NF-κB activation downstream of CCR and PD1. The study provides insight into how HLA-DR+CD4+ effector cells contribute to disease-associated inflammation by compromising regulatory suppression in pulmonary tuberculosis. The data identifies HLA-DR+ effector cells resistant to regulatory suppression as a potential marker of disease with implications for monitoring and therapy, highlighting the role of CCR and PD1 in susceptibility to regulatory suppression and the negative regulation of regulatory function by Th1/17 cytokines.
Researchers investigated the propagation of prions in mice expressing prion protein (PrP) without a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, finding that certain prion strains, RML and ME7, but not 22L, propagated in these mice developed novel cell tropisms. The levels of proteinase-resistant PrP (PrPres) in RML or ME7-infected mice were 25-50 times higher than in wild-type mice. When ME7 prions were returned to wild-type mice, they recovered their original properties, but RML prions gave rise to a novel strain, S, which remained unchanged after passages in wild-type mice. Both RML PrP and S PrP are stably propagated in wild-type mice, suggesting two conformations separated by a high energy barrier abrogated in GPI mice. Analysis showed RML and ME7 prions in GPI mice produced unusually high levels of PrPres, likely due to greater stability of extracellular PrPres. Inoculation of GPI mice with various prion isolates determined cell tropism by Cell Panel Assay, showing prions formed from PrP with same sequence but different post-translational modifications retained strain characteristics. Disease signs in GPI mice occurred later than C57, with RML causing terminal disease at 300 days post-inoculation in GPI and 142 in C57 mice, indicating adaptation of RML to the novel environment.
The BMP signaling pathway plays a conserved role in dorsal-ventral axis patterning during embryonic development in Drosophila, where graded BMP signaling is transduced by the Mad transcription factor and opposed by the Brinker repressor. This study used RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to decipher the BMP-responsive transcriptional network underlying differentiation of the dorsal ectoderm during dorsal-ventral patterning, identifying multiple new BMP target genes, including positive and negative regulators of EGF signaling. Manipulation of EGF levels revealed that EGF negatively regulates embryonic BMP-responsive transcription. The BMP network has a self-regulating property that establishes a balance between its activity and the antagonistic EGF pathway to facilitate patterning. Key roles were identified for Zelda and Zerküll transcription factors in establishing expression and widespread binding of insulator proteins to Mad and Brinker-bound regions. Analysis of embryos lacking the BEAF-32 insulator showed reduced transcription of a BMP target gene and a reduction in the number of amnioseros cells, specified by peak BMP signaling. The findings were incorporated into a model for Mad-dependent activation, discussing relevance to BMP signal interpretation in vertebrates. The BMP pathway specifies epidermal fates during embryonic dorsal-ventral patterning, with Dpp-Scw heterimer forming a gradient to pattern the dorsal ecterm into epidermis and amniosa fates. Integration of ChIP and RNAseq data suggested the majority of Dpp-responsive genes in the early embryo are direct targets, with Dpp-EGF interplay important in other developmental contexts, such as the dorsal head region where overactivation of EGF antagonises Dpp signaling.
A study on the spatial and temporal genetic structuring of Leishmania major in Tunisia was conducted using microsatellite analysis to improve understanding of the parasite's evolution and population dynamics. Human isolates from Tunisian governorates where the disease is endemic, Gafsa, Kair, and Sidi Bouz, collected between 1991-1992 and 8-2012, were analyzed. Results show that Leishmania parasites in Sidi Bouz evolved into genetically differentiated populations over two decades. The 8-201 isolates from the three governorates indicate that L major did not spread from south to center according to geographical gradient, suggesting human activities may be the source of expansion. Genotype analysis suggests previous and current flows of genotypes between governorates and districts. Human activities, reservoir dynamics, and environmental changes could explain disease progression. The study provides insights into the evolution and spread of L major, improving understanding of parasite flow between geographically and temporally distinct populations. Genetic differentiation between L major from Sidi and North Africa, Central Asia, Middle East, Iran, and Pakistan was considerable. A decreasing genetic gradient from Gaf to Kair and Sidi between 8-201 was found, corresponding to the chronology of leishmanis emergence in Tunisia. Genetic differentiation was found between Gaf and Sidi, Gaf and Kair, but not Kair and Sidi.
A study evaluated the impact of anthelmintic chemotherapy and water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) interventions on helminth infection prevalence among HIV-infected adults in Kenya. The results showed that treatment with albendazole significantly reduced the odds of infection with any soil-transmitted helminth (STH) species, while access to safe flooring offered additional protection. For schistosomiasis, only treatment with praziquantel was protective. Among individuals not treated with albendazole or priquantel, safe flooring and latrine access reduced the probability of ST infections. There was no evidence of synergy or antagonism between anthintic chemotherapy and WASH. Deworming was effective in reducing helmin infections, but WASH offered minimal additional benefit except for safe flooring. However, WASH significantly reduced infections in adults not treated with chemotherapy. Approximately 22% of 701 stool samples were helmin-infected, mostly of low to moderate intensity. Odds of infection with any ST species were lower for individuals treated with albendazole and those with access to safe flooring. The study suggests deworming is effective, but WASH is essential for reducing helmin infections, particularly in the absence of anthint treatment, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals emphasizing access to WASH as a human necessity.
The structure of LlpA, a lectin-like bacteriocin from Pseudomonas putida, reveals an architecture of two monocot mannose-binding lectin domains and a C-terminal β-hairpin extension. The C-terminal domain adopts a fold similar to plant lectins and contains a binding site for mannose and oligosaccharides, with an intact sugar pocket crucial for bactericidal activity. The N-terminal domain has a similar fold but lacks a mannose-binding site and determines target specificity. Mutational analysis indicates the N-domain plays a major role in target selection. The bacteriocin is assembled from two structurally similar domains that evolved towards dedicated functions in target recognition and bacteriotoxicity. LlpA is the first prokaryotic member of the Ml lectin family, involved in general defense mechanisms, with antibacterial activity not assigned to eukaryotic Ml proteins. Defensive roles have been proposed for oligomannose-binding Ml lectins based on insecticidal, nematic, antifungal, or antiviral activities in plants and protective antimicrobial functions in fish and epithelial cells. The Xanthas Llp precursor is proteolytically processed, whereas Pseudas homologues lack the N-terminal sequence, indicating different secretory routes among producers. The amino sequence suggests two related domains belonging to the monoc mannose-binding lectin family.
Researchers have discovered a novel secretion apparatus in Bacillus subtilis that maintains spore integrity and developmental gene expression during sporulation. The developing spore, or forespore, resides within a mother cell and its transcription factor σG is regulated by eight mother-cell encoded proteins in the spoII operon and foresp protein SpoII. The SpoII proteins share similarity with components of specialized secretion systems, including an ATPase, which is required for σ activity. The SpoII proteins and SpoQ form a multimer complex spanning two membranes surrounding the foresp, essential for maintaining foresp integrity. Without these proteins, the foresp develops invaginations and collapses. Notably, σ is not required for maintaining foresp integrity. The SpoII-SpoQ complex forms a novel secretion apparatus allowing the mother cell to nurture the foresp, maintaining physiology and σ activity during spore maturation. SpoIIA resembles ATPases in type II and IV secretion systems and conserved motifs are required for σ activity and spore formation. The SpoII-Spo complex links mother and foresp, composed of components from various secretion systems in Gram-negative bacteria. The ATP motifs in SpoIA and SpoQ are necessary for proper foresp morphology, suggesting an enzymatic function for the complex. Overall, the findings support a model where the SpoII-Spo apparatus maintains foresp integrity and σ activity during sporulation.
Bipolar disorder is a highly heritable psychiatric condition affecting approximately 1% of the population, characterized by extreme mood swings between mania and depression, with a high suicide rate of 17. Despite its heritability, identifying genetic variants has been challenging. A genome-wide association study of 2,191 cases and 1,434 controls did not detect genome-wide significant associations for individual loci. However, analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms showed an association between power to detect effects from a previous genome-wide association and replication. Replication rates in a meta-analysis of height demonstrated that associations replicate as a function of power, approaching a linear relationship. Single nucleotide polymorphisms near exons exhibited greater probability of replication, supporting enrichment of reproducible associations near functional regions of genes. The results indicate common variation associated with bipolar disorder near exons could be identified in larger studies. The study provides a framework for assessing potential replication when combining results from multiple studies, suggesting genetic variation associated with bipolar disorder near exons could be identified in larger studies. The findings highlight the possibility of identifying replicable genetic signals in circumscribed regions of the genome not captured by single locus analyses in single genome-wide association studies.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide analysis to understand cell proliferation mechanisms, assigning a Prolifer Index (PI) to quantify the association between gene expression levels and growth rates across 60 cancer cell lines. Genes essential for cancer exhibited positive PI values, while tumor suppressors showed negative values. Cell cycle, DNA replication, and protein production processes were positively associated with cancer proliferation, while cellular migration was negatively associated. Analysis of non-cancer proliferation indices across 224 lymphoblast cell lines revealed differences between cancerous and non-cancer proliferation, highlighting translation and spliceosome machineries as selective cancer-associated proteins. A cross-species comparison showed cancer proliferation resembled microorganisms, while non-cancer did not. Combining cancer and non-cancer signatures enhanced prediction of patient outcome and gene essentiality in cancer. The study identified 200 genes with high PI values, enriched in translation and spliceosome machineries, and found cancer-related genes had higher absolute PI values. Tumor suppressor genes showed lower negative PI, indicating decreased functionality may enhance proliferation. The results suggest inherent differences between cancer and non-cancer proliferation determinants, contributing to the development of novel anti-proliferative drugs. The emerging PI signature is relevant with functional correlates, uncovering genes and processes associated with proliferation, positively or negatively, in cancers.
A retrospective study of 11 patients with cardiac and endovascular cystic echinococcosis, a rare condition where cysts affect the heart and vena cava, was conducted over 15 years. Main clinical manifestations included thoracic pain or dyspnea, although 2 patients were asymptomatic. Cysts were mostly located in the right atrium and inferior vena cava, with 9 patients previously diagnosed with disseminated echinoccosis. Echocardiography was the primary diagnostic method, aided by serology, electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and histology. 9 patients underwent surgery and received long-term antiparasitic treatment for a median 25 months. One patient died intraoperatively due to cyst rupture, 2 died 10 and 14 years post-diagnosis due to pulmonary embolism and cardiac failure. Patients with cardiac involvement had no complications post-surgery and were considered cured, while those with vena cava involvement developed embolism and multiple complications. Cardiovascular echinoccosis is associated with high risk of lethal complications, varying by cyst location. Isolated cardiac echinocis may be cured post-surgery, while extracardiac involvement has severe complications. The condition should be considered in differential diagnosis of cardiovascular disease in endemic areas.
Researchers investigated the role of TirS, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain mimic in Staphylococcus aureus, in modulating virulence and antimicrobial susceptibility. Ectopic expression of TirS in eukaryotic cells inhibited TLR signaling, downregulating the NF-kB pathway through inhibition of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR9. In a mouse model, skin lesions induced by the S. aureus knockout tirS mutant increased compared to wild-type and restored strains, despite no difference in bacterial load. Tir was associated with lower neutrophil and macrophage activity, confirming its role in virulence attenuation through inflammatory responses. Tir localizes within staphylococal chromosomal cassettes containing the fusC gene for fusid acid resistance but not the mec gene. Sub-inhibitory concentration of fusid acid increased tirS expression. Epidemiological studies found no link between this effector and clinical presentation but a selective advantage with SCC element SCC/fus/tir. Results showed Tir modulates bacterial virulence through attenuation of host inflammatory responses during infection. Tir is a potent inhibitor of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR, dependent on My88, a general adaptor in Toll/IL receptor signaling. S. aureus carrying tir induced no increased virulence in My88 knockout mice, suggesting Tir modulates inflammatory response at the site of infection through My88. The study links two key traits determining bacterial infection success and spread.
Researchers investigated evolutionary innovations driven by spatial and temporal changes in gene expression in the embryos of lower and higher Diptera, focusing on the reduction of the extraembryonic envelope in mosquitoes and fruit flies. Transcriptional datasets from Drosophila melanaster and Anophe gambia embryos revealed whole-genome changes in gene expression underlying their embryonic morphologies. Many orthologous gene pairs were clustered based on coincident discordances in temporal profiles, including a cluster expressed specifically in the mosquito serosa, redeployed later in development at cuticle synthesis. A striking difference in temporal expression of maternal genes was observed, with maternal transcripts reduced at the maternal-zyotic transition in Drosila but sustained in Anophe. Clustering by temporal discordance identified gene batteries underlying morphological diversity. Approximately 75% of ortholog pairs exhibited similar temporal profiles, with concordant expression revealing a correspondence during development. Discordant gene expression analysis identified a major cluster involved in serosa function, re-engaged in cuticle synthesis. Significant discordances were observed in maternally expressed genes, consistent with evolution of sharp maternal-zyotic transition in Diptera. The study provides a framework for cross-organism temporal alignments and comparisons of transcriptional datasets, identifying patterning properties in Dipteran embryos, including extra-embryonic tissues and maternal-zyotic transition.
Haemophilus duyi and Treponema pallidum subsp pertenue are major causes of ulcers in children in Africa and the Pacific Region. A cross-sectional study in rural villages of Lih Island, Papua Guinea found Haemophilus duyi DNA detectable on the skin of asymptomatic children, flies, and fomites. Of 78 asymptomatic participants, 16% had H.duyi PCR positivity and 1% T.pertene PCR positivity. H.duyi PCR positivity did not differ in participants exposed or not exposed to a case of H.duyi ulcer in the household. 12% of cultures from asymptomatic participants yielded a definitive diagnosis of H.duy, proving skin colonization. 90 of flies tested had H.duy DNA and 50 had T.pert DNA. 33 of bed sheets had H.duy DNA and 17 had T.pert DNA. This is the first time H.duy DNA colonization has been demonstrated on asymptomatic children and H.duy and T.pert DNA identified in flies and fomites. The ubiquity of H.duy in the environment contributes to the spread of the organism. Asymptomatic carriage of H.duy DNA on skin was found in 20 of children, with no evidence of cutaneous ulcer or symptoms. Similar positivity rates were found in households with and without ulcer cases. Flies caught outside houses with ulcers had 90 H.d and 50 T.p DNA, suggesting a potential environmental source of infection.
The International Society for Computational Biology Education Committee has developed a set of bioinformatics core competencies to provide a framework for training and curricula in bioinformatics education, addressing the diverse needs of various populations with different backgrounds and application areas. The competencies were refined through a multi-year community engagement process based on surveys of employers and training programs. The report presents the current status of the competencies and use cases illustrating their application in diverse training contexts, demonstrating how they can be used and refined. The effort aims to assist educators by providing a conceptual framework to share experiences and identify best practices in bioinformatics education. The competencies provide a basis for bioinformatics educators to design, refine, and evaluate training programs despite divergent goals and student populations. They are not intended to be a prescription for specific curricula or standards. Use cases highlight diverse training needs, user types, and educational settings, including bioinformatics users requiring basic understanding of methods and interpretation of outputs. The competencies have proven valuable in defining, refining, or assessing bioinformatics training mechanisms and provide a foundation for continuing refinement and application, addressing remaining challenges and future plans.
Researchers conducted a deep-sequencing study of the parasitic nematode Strongyloides stercis to investigate the mechanisms of developmentally arrested third-stage larva (L3) formation. The study generated 2.3 billion paired-end reads from seven developmental stages and constructed expression profiles for S. stercis homologs of Caenorhabditis elegans dauer genes. The results showed that genes encoding cGMP pathway components were coordinately upregulated in L3, while S. stercis has a paucity of genes encoding insulin/IGF-like signaling ligands. Seven S. stercis genes encoding homologs of the single C. elegans dauer TGF ligand were identified, with three only expressed in L3. Putative biosynthetic genes did not appear to be coordinately regulated in L3 development. The findings suggest that while dauer pathways are present in S. stercis and play a role in L3 development, there are significant differences between S. stis and C. elegans. Understanding the mechanisms governing L3 development may lead to novel treatment and control strategies for parasitic nematodes that afflict over one billion people globally. The study reveals divergent regulation of canonical dauer pathways in S. stis, differing from C. elegans, particularly in TGF ligands, which are upregulated in developmentally arrested L3 and downregulated in activated L3, opposite to the predicted dauer hypothesis.
Researchers investigated the effects of bacterial genotoxins, including Cytolethal Distending Toxin (CDT) and colibactin, on nuclear remodeling in the context of cell survival. Using Helicobacter-infected mice, coculture experiments, and xenograft-derived models, they found that CDT and colibin induced nuclear remodeling associated with the formation of deep cytoplasmic invaginations in the nucleus, corresponding to nucleoplasmic reticulum (NR). The core of NR concentrated ribosomes, proteins involved in mRNA translation, polyadenated RNA, and components of the mCR complex involved in mRNA turnover. These structures were active sites of translation, correlated with high ploidy and involved MAPK and calcium signaling. The formation of these ribonucleoprotein particles within the nucleus was dynamic, transient, and protected the cell until genotoxic stress was relieved. Bacterial genotox-induced NR allowed selected mRNA to be transported for local translation, offering insights into NR formation, a common in many cancers, not only in response to therapy-induced DNA damage but also to genotoxic bacteria. CD and colin triggered the formation of messenger ribonucleoprotein particles, invaginated into deep nuclear channels, with increased translation dependent on active translation. These reversible structures allowed cells to pause and repair DNA damage, maintaining survival, potentially contributing to cancer cell resistance to therapies inducing DNA damage.
Researchers utilized three-dimensional computed tomography to evaluate maxillary bone deformation in patients with leprosy, reconstructing 3D images of the maxilla in 10 patients and 5 controls using multiplanar reconstruction. The anterior-posterior length of the maxilla was measured, and differences between patients and controls were evaluated after compensating for individual skull size. Three patients with lepromous leprosy showed marked atrophy of the maxilla, corresponding with visual appearance and paleopathological findings. The study confirmed maxillary regression described in paleopathological studies and enabled precise calculation of bone defects for reconstructive surgery. Stereoscopic 3DCT images facilitated qualitative evaluation, revealing deformation of the nasal spine and alveolar process in four of ten patients. The method may become a tool for reconstructive surgery, estimating atrophied thickness of maxilla and needed prosthesis. Although limited by small sample size, the methodology represents a promising tool for quantitative evaluation of maxillary deformities associated with lepro and other lesions, potentially contributing to novel treatments for facial deformity and reducing social segregation attributed to lepro. Further analysis with larger samples is needed to confirm findings.
Researchers investigated how the auditory system constructs noise-invariant representations of sound by adapting to stimulus statistics. They measured neuronal responses to complex and natural sounds in the inferior colliculus and primary auditory cortex of anaestized ferrets and compared them to a model of the auditory nerve. The strength of adaptation to mean and contrast of auditory stimulation increases as it ascends the auditory pathway. To assess noise tolerance, they presented sounds embedded in stationary noise and used a decoding approach, finding the code for complex sounds in the periphery is more affected by noise than the cortical code. Noise tolerance is correlated with adaptation to stimulus statistics, with populations showing strongest adaptation being most noise-tolerant. The increase in adaptation from auditory nerve to midbrain to cortex is crucial in constructing noise-invariant sound representations. Neural responses become progressively independent of background noise level as one progresses through the pathway. By the cortex, neural populations represent signals in a noise-tolerant fashion, responding to common features between clean and noisy conditions. Adaptation to statistics enables the brain to build noise-invariant representations, driving construction of noise-toler representations of sound. Neurons shift from encoding low-level attributes towards mean, contrast, and noise-independent information about stimulus identity, resulting in context-invariant categorical representations seen in higher areas of the auditory cortex.
Researchers analyzed the yeast protein-protein interaction network in response to heat shock, a well-characterized stress model of cellular dynamics, using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. They calculated changes in interaction weights from mRNA expression levels and found a significant decrease in overlaps and connections between modules. The diameter of the interactome increased 4.9-fold under heat shock, with key proteins becoming centers of heat-induced communities and bridges connecting residual modules. The changes resemble a'stratus-cumulus' transition, shifting from a globally connected to multifocal organization. Heat shock induces partial disintegration of the interactome's global organization, which may be a general response to various stresses. Other complex systems may also decrease inter-modular links and display disintegration under crisis. The study provides a model of system-level adaptation to environmental changes. The interactomes of unstressed and heat-shocked yeast had different structures due to expression pattern changes, with a 14% decrease in median interaction weight in heat-shocked cells. Protein levels are regulated by degradation and transcriptional changes, and the disintegration is a non-trivial adaptation to stress at the system level, observed at multiple network topology levels. Bridges, or inter-modular proteins, play a key role in remaining connections after heat shock, with different behaviors before and after heat shock.
Chagas disease is a chronic condition caused by Trypanosoma cruzi with high prevalence in Latin America. Ventricular arrhythmias are common in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy and amiodarone has been widely used for treatment. A systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis assessed the effect of amiodone in patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy, including 9 studies with 3 before-after studies, 5 case series, and 1 randomized trial. Amiodone reduced ventricular tachycardia episodes by 99.9%, ventricular premature beats by 93.1%, and ventricular couplets by 79%. Adverse effects included corneal deposits 61.1%, gastrointestinal events 16.1%, sinus bradycardia 12.7%, dermatological events 10.6%, and drug discontinuation 7.68%. Quality of evidence ranged from moderate to low. Amiodone is effective in reducing ventricular arrhythmias but lacks evidence for hard endpoints such as sudden death and hospitalization. Benefits must be balanced against potential harms for individual decision-making. Other interventions may benefit patients with Chagas and arrhythm. Ongoing trials such as CHAGICS may provide further information in the future.
Seasonal patterns of dengue fever in rural Ecuador were studied using 2009-2016 medical records from patients diagnosed at two hospitals. Poisson linear modeling determined short and long-term seasonal patterns, day of the week, and public holiday effects. Annual sinusoidal fluctuations, long-term trends, day of week, and hospital were significant predictors of deng fever, with peaks in mid-March. Cases were more likely diagnosed on Tuesdays and Thursdays and less on Saturdays and Sundays. Public holidays had no effect except increased diagnoses the day after Christmas. School schedules did not impact deng in school-aged children. Climate variables, including precipitation, temperature, and interactions between precipitation and temperature, were significant. The study found intra-annual and long-term seasonality, decomposing into non-climate and climate-driven seasonality. Non-climate trends included short and long-term and effects of school, holidays, and weekdays on diagnoses. The results can inform local prevention, public planning, and global models of deng fever trends. This is the first report of long-term deng fever seasonality in Ecuador and one of few from rural patients, utilizing daily reports. Climate-diagnosis relationships presented estimate deng seasonality in these communities. Most variables exhibited small but significant effects on risk of deng fever diagnoses.
Researchers have discovered that transgenic expression of picornavirus-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) in mice can activate innate immunity, providing broad-spectrum antiviral protection without triggering autoimmunity or chronic inflammation. RRP-transgenic mice exhibit lifelong upregulation of 80 interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and show resistance to lethal viral challenge. The mechanism operates via MDA5 and MAVS, independent of the adaptive immune system. Human cell models recapitulated key features, with RRP inducing an ISG network and blocking HIV-1 infection. RRP-mediated antiviral mechanism does not depend on secondary structure within RRP mRNA but operates at protein level, requiring RRP catalysis. Lifelong ISG elevation in RRP mice is well-tolerated, with normal longevity. Results demonstrate a powerfully augmented MDA-mediated state can be a well-tolerated mammalian immune configuration, providing a foundation for augmenting innate immunity to achieve broad-spectrum antiral protection. RRP mice possess a maximally upregulated innate transcriptome, capable of effecting robust antiviral response, exceeding innate gene induction by virus itself. RRP-induced intrinsic upregulation of critical immune effectors confers marked resistance to viral infection, with 5-logs reduced viral loads and survival in EMC challenge. Knockout of MDA blocks RRP-induced IS activation, compromising murine survival. Transgenic RRP expression produces a sustained antiviral IS network, reconfiguring innate immunity in vertebrates.
The effective population size of a plant virus determines the strength of genetic drift and frequency of co-infection by multiple genotypes, making it a key factor in viral evolution. Researchers tested the independent hypothesis that each virion has a probability of infection and acts independently during the process using Tobacco etch virus variants with fluorescent markers in Nicotiana tabacum and Capsicum annuum plants. Results showed the number of primary infection foci increased linearly with dose and followed a Poisson distribution, with primary foci containing both genotypes found at low frequency at high doses. The probability of a genotype infecting the plant systemically was near 1, although some genotypes could be trapped in the inoculated leaf. The frequency of mixed-genotype infection could be predicted from primary foci using the independent-action model, indicating independent action holds for Tobacco etch virus and effective population size is dose-dependent. The number of virions causing systemic infection can be small, approaching 1 at low doses. Dose-dependency suggests comparisons of estimates for different viruses are not meaningful unless dose effects are considered. Effective population size can be extremely small, impacting genetic drift on virus populations, and relevant for experimental evolution with plant viruses.
Researchers have developed a Bayesian multi-tissue approach to analyze gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across multiple tissues, improving upon traditional single-tissue methods that ignore shared information. The proposed Sparse Regression model maps eQTLs within and across tissues, demonstrating increased power in revealing the complexity of the eQ landscape. Testing on 2,000 genes in four tissues, the method identified a two-eQTL model for the Hopx gene not detected by conventional approaches and showed common regulation of gene expression across tissues for 27% of transcripts, increasing eQTL detection fivefold. The approach uncovers polygenic regulation of gene expression, identifying secondary trans-eQs with greater power than traditional methods. Implementing a computationally efficient strategy, the model identifies cis- and trans-effects at the same false discovery rate as single marker eQ methods. The Bayesian selection method provides a list of eQs and addresses uncertainty in finding predictor subsets, allowing assessment of each eQ's marginal contribution to gene variability. The findings offer new insights into genetic mechanisms controlling global expression, adaptable to other systems and humans, with applications to multiple phenotypes analysis. The method's generality makes it suitable for analysis of intermediate and whole-body phenotypes, providing opportunities to uncover complex regulatory mechanisms controlling gene expression.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand the extrinsic apoptosis pathway, a process by which cells undergo programmed death in response to external stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor and TRAIL. The model reveals a variable-delay, snap-action switch mechanism where initiator caspases are active for a prolonged period before a sudden activation of effector casases leads to cell dismantling. The duration of the delay prior to effector casase activation is determined by initiator caspase-8 activity and downstream reactions, while sudden activation is achieved through mitochondrial permeabilization and relocalization of proteins like Smac. Interactions among Bcl-2 family members, partitioning of Smac from XIAP, and pore assembly mechanics are critical for snap control. The model accurately reproduces normal and perturbed cell behavior, making it possible to study switching mechanisms in detail. Analysis shows that failure in snap switching generates an indeterminate state and sublethal damage, predisposing cells to genomic instability. The study provides quantitative understanding of extrinsic apoptosis, highlighting the importance of initiator and effector caspase dynamics, and the need for further refinement to capture long-term outcomes and competing demands of pre-MOMP delay and fast-independent switching.
Listeria monocytogenes interacts with afadin and facilitates basement membrane crossing. The placenta protects the fetus against the maternal immune response and bacterial pathogens, but Listeria monocytogenes has evolved mechanisms to breach this barrier. The protein Internalin P (InP) is a secreted virulence factor critical for placental infection and binds to human afadin, a protein associated with cell junctions. The crystal structure of InP reveals a unique leucine-rich repeat domain with a Ca2+-binding site. MDCK epithelial cells expressing InP display decreased traction on deformable substrates, similar to AF-6 knock-out cells. L. monocogenes ΔInP mutants are deficient in forming actin protrusions from polarized epithelial monolayers, necessary for transcytosis. Afadin deletion in host cells does not rescue the transcytosis defect. InP targets cytosolic afadin to promote L. monocogenes transcyosis across epithelial monolayers, contributing to basement membrane crossing during placental infection. The InP-afadin interaction enhances L. monocogen transcyosis, the ability to exit the basal face of infected polarized epithelial monolayers, consistent with its contribution to placental infection. L. monocogen crossing the feto-maternal barrier involves multiple bottlenecks, from trafficking to the placenta to surviving innate defenses and crossing the trophoblast monolayer and basement membrane into fetal circulation.
Researchers utilized complementary mass spectrometry techniques to characterize the proteome of Treponema pallidum ssp pallidum, the bacterium responsible for syphilis, a chronic multistage disease. The study analyzed T pallidum ssp pallidum DAL1 strain isolated from rabbits using multidimensional peptide separation and protein identification via matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 603 peptides were detected, corresponding to 557 unique T pallum proteins, representing 54% of the predicted proteome. One hundred fourteen detected proteins were previously annotated as hypothetical or uncharacterized, with 116 identified as potential membrane proteins, including 16 with evidence of outer membrane localization. Eight proteins related to the paralogous tpr gene family were found. Protein abundance was semi-quantified using label-free spectral methods, showing low correlation with previous microarray data. The study detected 58 proteins previously identified in a gel-based proteome study, bringing the total detected proteins to 58% of the whole pallum predicted proteome using mass spectrometry methods. This comprehensive description provides insights into in vivo pallum protein expression and pathogenicity, paving the way for understanding the enigmatic organism.
Protein Kinase A (PKA) is a major receptor for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in eukaryotes, with cAMP binding to two tandem cAMP-binding domains (CBD-A and B) within the regulatory subunit PKA (R), unleashing the activity of the catalytic subunit (C). CBD-A is required for PKA inhibition and activation, while CBD-B functions as a "gatekeeper" modulating control exerted by CBD-A. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analysis of the two-domain construct RIα (91-379) in apo, cAMP, and C-bound forms reveals a double-conformation selection model where each CBD dynamically samples active and inactive states independently within a nearly degenerate energy landscape. Binding of cAMP eliminates this degeneracy, stabilizing the active conformation within each CBD and inter-CBD contacts, requiring cAMP and W260. The inter-CBD interface is dispensable for intra-CBD conformation selection but indispensable for full PKA activation, occluding C-unit recognition sites within CBD-A. Comparative NMR analysis supports a double-conformation selection model for cAMP-dependent activation of PKA RI, suggesting dynamics of nucleotide-free CBD-B are functionally critical. Results indicate conservation of structure does not imply conservation of dynamics, with structurally homologous cAMP-bound CBDs exhibiting differences in residual dynamics profiles. Overall, the study provides insight into the energy landscape of PKA inhibition and activation, highlighting the importance of CBD dynamics and inter-CBD interactions in cAMP-dependent activation of PKA.
The interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) plays a crucial role in antiviral immunity and its expression is associated with interferon. Analysis of proteomes of IS15- and IS15+ bone marrow-derived macrophages after vaccinia virus infection revealed altered mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative phosphorylation pathways in IS15- macrophages. Mitochondrial respiration, adenosine triphosphate, and reactive oxygen species production were higher in IS15+ macrophages, indicating IS15-dependent mechanisms. IS15 depletion led to changes in macroage polarization with IS- macroages showing a proinflammatory cytokine pattern but blocked nitric oxide production and arginase activation. Following interferon treatment, nitric oxide release was higher in IS+ macroages with decreased viral titer. IS15- macroages were permissive to vaccinia replication. Results demonstrate IS15 governs mitochondrial functionality, specifically oxidative phosphorylation and mitophagy, broadening its role as an antiviral agent. Mitochondrial functions, including oxidative phosphorylation and mitagy, decreased in IS- macroages with increased viral replication. Interferon treatment induced oxidative phosphorylation exclusively in IS+ macrophages. IS15 modulates macroage polarization, dependent on cellular metabolism, suggesting its antiviral effect is due to regulation of polarization. Overall, IS15 regulates mitochondrial stability essential for cellular homeostasis.
The HIV-1 protein Vpu has two functions in viral replication: degradation of the cellular receptor CD4 and enhancement of viral release. Vpu binds CD4 and recruits the βTrCP subunit of the SCFβTr ubiquitin ligase complex, escaping degradation while inhibiting the degradation of βTr natural targets. A novel phosphorylation site in Vpu, serine 61, adjacent to the βTr-binding motif, triggers Vpu degradation by a βTr-independent process when cells are arrested in mitosis. Mutation of Vpu S61 extends the protein's half-life and increases HIV-1 particle release from HeLa cells. The S61 determinant of Vpu is highly conserved within HIV-1 isolates. Phosphorylation of Vpu determines its fate as an adaptor or substrate of distinct ubiquitin ligases. Conservation of Vpu degradation, despite its negative effect on virion release, suggests a role in overall HIV-1 fitness. Phosphorylation of Vpu ser 61 is the triggering event for subsequent Vpu degradation. Mutation of Vpu ser61 into non-phosphlable residue stabilizes Vpu, increasing HIV-1 release. The slower Vpu turnover from S61 substitution increases release of HIV-1 virions, suggesting a selective advantage. The study highlights a mechanism where differential phosphorylation of Vpu determines its fate as an adaptor or substrate of distinct ubiquitin ligases.
Researchers investigated how developmental patterning in tissues is coordinated with whole-body development to ensure robustness against environmental and physiological perturbations. They proposed two hypotheses: tissue patterning is coordinated with whole-body development over time or aligns at developmental milestones. A staging scheme was developed for wing imaginal discs of Drosophila larvae using canonical patterning gene expression, linked to whole-body events: moulting, larval wandering, and pupation. The progression of patterning was explored under altered developmental time by temperature or hormone synthesis changes. Results showed patterning aligned at moulting and pupation, indicating key milestones, while progression between milestones showed variability in response to temperature and physiological changes. Wandering larvae discs showed greater patterning variability, suggesting it is not a developmental milestone. Findings indicate tissue patterning remains robust by aligning at milestones, providing insight into coordination between individual tissue and whole-body development. Developmental milestones coordinate wing and whole-body development to cope with environmental and physiological variation, ensuring adult phenotype robustness. Patterning and whole-body development are coordinated at moul and pupation, while wandering does not act as a milestone for wing disc patterning. The progression of patterning in wing discs is more plastic and can be slowed or sped up, underlying the robust adult phenotype.
The ESCRT regulator Did2 maintains the balance between long-distance endosomal transport and endocytic trafficking in highly polarized cells, such as fungal hyphae. Loss of Did2 results in defective vacuolar targeting, less processive long-distance transport, and abnormal shuttling of early endosomes. The late endosomal protein Rab7 and vacuolar protease Prc1 exhibit increased shuttling on aberrant endosomes, suggesting defects in endosomal maturation and identity. Molecular motors fail to attach efficiently, explaining disturbed processive movement. The endosomal mRNA linker protein Upa is hardly present on endosomes, resulting in defects in long-distance mRNA transport. Did2 coordinates precise maturation of endosomes, providing the correct membrane identity for efficient endosomal long-distance transport. Endosomal maturation and fusion with vacuoles depend on functional ESCRT machinery for vacolar sorting. The absence of Did2 leads to increased shuttling of late endosomal markers and cargo on early endosomes. Did2 is essential for endocytic functions, such as vacolar sorting of proteins, and efficient long-distance transport. Loss of Did2 causes reduced localisation of endosomal proteins and decreased processivity of endosomes. The ESCRT regulator determines the membrane identity of early endosomes, guaranteeing correct function in long-distance transport of cargos like mRNAs and septins. Did2 is crucial for undisturbed unipolar growth of hypha, suggesting a role in microtubule-dependent transport, enabling the study of ESCRT-III in polarized cells that depend on long-distance transport.
Researchers compared adenine riboswitches from Bacillus subtilis and Vibrio vulnificus, which regulate gene expression at transcriptional and translational levels, respectively. The study revealed differences in ligand binding properties and regulatory mechanisms between the two riboswitches. The B. subtilis pbuE riboswitch requires co-transcriptional binding of adenine to function, while the V. vulnific addoswitch can bind adenine after transcription is completed and still regulate translation. The rate of transcription is critical for the B. subis pbuE riboswitch to function efficiently, consistent with co-transcriptional regulation. In contrast, the V. vulific addoswitch operates under a thermodynamic regime, where ligand binding and regulation can occur post-transcriptionally without transcription-translation coupling. Experiments showed that adding adenine increased protein expression three-fold when transcription and translation were uncoupled. Mutant analysis demonstrated that riboswitch conformations are responsible for adenine-dependent translation modulation. The findings indicate that transcriptionally and translationally-acting adenine riboswitches employ distinct regulatory mechanisms, differing in aspects such as ligand binding and transcription-translation coupling. Overall, the study highlights the importance of the nature of gene control, transcription or translation, in riboswitch regulatory mechanisms.
Researchers have discovered a conserved pattern of primer-dependent transcription initiation in Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae using 5' RNA sequencing. Primer-dependent transcription involves the use of 2-4 nucleotide oligonucleotide primers and has been shown to be prevalent at promoters during stationary phase growth in E. coli. The study establishes a physiological role for primer-dependent initiation as a regulatory mechanism modulating biofilm formation in E. coli. High-throughput sequencing of RNA 5' ends reveals primer-dependent initiation occurs in pathogenic Vibrio cholera with a pattern strikingly similar to E. coli. Primer-dependent initiation is detected in stationary phase, not exponential phase, and preferentially at promoters carrying T1+A1 or G-1+1 start regions. The findings demonstrate a role for primer-dependent initiation and suggest it may be widespread among Gammaproteobacteria. Primer-dependent in E. coli and V. cholera occurs through a growth-dependent process generating linear dinucleotides 5'-UA-3' and 5'-GG-3'. Approximately 1% of transcripts in V. cholera and 7% in E. coli are generated from primer-dependent initiation. The results support an emerging model that primer-dependent may be widespread in bacteria, fluctuating as a function of growth state.
Parental genome imbalance deregulates imprinting in Arabidopsis, affecting embryo growth and potentially contributing to reproductive isolation between emerging species. Increased maternal genome dosage represses growth, while increased paternal dosage has the opposite effect, leading to the discovery of imprinted genes expressed by a single parental allele. Researchers investigated the effect of parental imbalance on Arabidopsis imprinted genes FIS2 and FWA, controlled by DNA methylation, and MEA and PHE, controlled by histone methylation. Genome imbalance deregulated expression of F2 and P1 in an antagonistic manner, with increased inactive alleles causing loss of imprinting of F2 and ME. F2 controls histone methylation, repressing ME and PHE expression, but changes in PHE and ME expression could not be fully accounted for by F2 fluctuations. Parental dosage imbalance deregulates imprinting mechanisms independent of known regulators. The complexity of regulations between expressed and silenced alleles does not support simple models from the parental conflict hypothesis. Measurements showed no global effect on transcription or regulators of DNA methylation controlling imprinting, with hardly any changes in WA expression levels. Parental imbalance led to non-symmetrical deregulation of imprinted genes and loss of imprinting in two of four studied genes, suggesting involvement in reproductive barriers as seen in Arabidopsis relatives.
Researchers investigated the relationship between brain rhythms and functional connectivity by constructing virtual networks with dynamics similar to EEG and MEG recordings. Applying mathematical techniques, they reverse-engineered network architectures that generate characteristic brain dynamics, including spindles and sharp waves, and found that all networks display similar topological features and dynamics. Reconstructed networks for diseased brains, such as epileptic and schizophrenic, showed consistent alterations in functional connectivity and dynamics. The complexity of the network, quantified by Tononi, Sporns, and Edelman, was found to be a good indicator of brain fitness, with virtual brains modeling diseased states displaying lower complexity than those modeling normal function. The study demonstrates that the power spectrum of neural recordings conveys information about functional connectivity and that virtual brains share structural features with real brains. The findings have implications for the neurobiology of health and disease, suggesting that brain rhythms reveal a hierarchical organization and that can be used to understand brain function and dysfunction. The approach focused on functional aspects of oscillatory dynamics rather than underlying mechanisms and used inverse problems to solve network configurations that recreate multi-oscillatory brain dynamics on a background.
A population structure analysis of 1,374 unrelated Hispanic individuals from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis was performed using approximately 60,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms selected for minimal linkage disequilibrium. The participants self-identified as Central American, Cuban, Dominican, Mexican, Puerto Rican, or South American. Principal component analysis showed the first two components quantified Caucasian, African, and Native American origins, while the third and fourth components aligned with the geographic location of Native American samples, separating Mexican and Central/South American samples. K-means clustering defined four subgroups that agreed with self-identification labels: Dominican/Cuban, Mexican, Central/South American, and Puerto Rican. Association analysis of triglycerides in the LPL and TRIB1 gene regions, previously reported in Caucasians but unconfirmed in Hispanics, showed statistically significant genetic association. The study highlights the importance of considering population structure and genetic heterogeneity in genetic studies in the US Hispanic population. Four distinct subgroups were identified: Central/South America, Dominican and Cuba, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, based on participant self-identification and principal component analysis. The study demonstrates the value of accounting for population structure in genetic analysis of Hispanic cohorts.
The Elongator complex, a histone acetyltransferase, interacts with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and modulates transcriptional silencing and sensitivity to DNA damage. Cells lacking Elp3, the catalytic subunit of the six-unit Elong complex, exhibit partial silencing loss of reporter genes and increased sensitivity to hydroxyurea and methanesulfonate. Deletion or mutation of Elong complex subunits or El3 compromises silencing and increases sensitivity. Epistasis analysis shows El3 mutant exacerbates sensitivity in cells lacking histone chaperones As1, CAF1, and H3 lysine acetylase Rtt. The El3 mutant has genetic interactions with POL30 encoding PCNA, which binds Elong complex in vivo and vitro. Results indicate the conserved Elong complex functions in multiple cellular processes, including transcription silencing, genome stability, DNA replication, and repair. Histone chaperones, such as CAF1 and As1, promote nucleosome assembly during DNA replication, DNA repair, and transcription. Emerging evidence suggests histone modifications, nucleosome assembly, and chromatin remodeling regulate chromatin during gene transcription, DNA replication, and repair. El3, the catalytic subunit of Elong histone acetylase, associates with hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II. As1 regulates acylation of H3 lysine 56 by presenting H3-H4 to Rtt-Vps complex, directly regulating H binding with histone chaperones CAF1 and Rtt. Multiple histone acetylases function during DNA-coupled nucleosome assembly in yeast, including As1, CAF, and Rtt, which cooperate to assemble modified histones during DNA synthesis. Factors like CAF, As1, and PC involved in DNA-coupled nucleosome assembly are required for transcriptional silencing and genome integrity.
Manually curating biomedical knowledge from publications is necessary to build a knowledge base that provides precise and organized information to users. A machine-learning assisted triage method is proposed to address the limitations of query-based methods, which often obtain unsatisfactory precision and recall. A gold-standard dataset was created using previously curated publications from UniProt/SwissProt and NHGRI-E GWAS Catalog to train deep learning models based on convolutional neural networks. The trained models classify and rank new publications for curation, achieving precision 1.81 and 2.99 times higher than query-based methods without compromising recall. The method retrieves additional relevant publications that query-based methods could not find, improving efficiency and enriching curated content. Evaluation on real-world curation of UniProt/SissProt and GWAS demonstrates the effectiveness of machine-assisted triage, allowing human curators to focus on challenging tasks to improve knowledge quality. Comparison with LinearSVC, a non-deep learning method, shows higher performance on GWAS dataset, attributed to the presence of specific terms like "GW" or "Genome association". Overall, the method achieves high performance on different datasets and settings, confirmed by UniProt/SissProt and GWAS manual curation teams, overcoming limitations of query-based and manual curation processes.
Gain-of-function mutations in KCNJ2-encoded Kir2.1 channels underlie variant 3 of the short QT syndrome, associated with atrial fibrillation. A study using biophysically-detailed human atria models investigated the mechanistic link between S3 mutations and atrial arrhythmogenesis, and potential ion channel targets for treatment. The D172 and E299 Kir2.1 mutations produced distinct effects on IK1 and AP shortening, decreasing re-entry wavelength through reduction in effective refractory period and conduction velocity. Stability of reentrant waves was mediated by changes to tissue excitability and AP dispersion in mutation conditions. Combined block of IK1 and IKr was effective in terminating re-entry in heterozygous D172 conditions, whereas IKr block may be safer for E299 mutation. Inhibition of IKr and IKur produced synergistic anti-arrhythmic effect in both S3 forms. The study provides mechanistic insights into atrial proarrhythm with S3 Kir2.1 mutations, highlighting pharmacological strategies for S3-linked AF management. Functional differences exist between S3 D172 and E299 mutations on human atrial electrophysiology, manifesting as distinct AP shortening mechanisms at single cell level and AP dispersion in human atria, influencing re-entry dynamics. Gain-of-function KCNJ mutations are life-threatening, underlying S3 and familial AF.
Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal strom cells (ASC) have been shown to protect mice infected with Trypanosoma cruzi from cardiac damage through modulation of anti-parasite immunity. Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan Tryosoma cruzi, is a complex endemic disease in Central and South America with increasing non-vector forms of transmission in developed countries. ASC injected intraperitoneally 3 days post-infection reduced blood parasitemia, followed by a decrease in cardiac inflammation, parasitism, and fibrosis at 30 days post-infection. Analyses of cytokine release indicated an anti-inflammatory response in ASC-treated animals, while splenocytes produced a pro-inflammatory response important for parasite control. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed right ventricular dilation was prevented in ASC-treated mice at 60 days post-infection. The administration of ASC early after T. cruzi infection prevents right ventricular remodeling through modulation of immune responses, promoting control of parasite burden in lymphoid organs and protection of the heart from damage due to improved inflammation. Four mechanisms are thought to be responsible for chasic cardiopathy, including parasite persistence, autoimmunity, dysautonom, and microvascular lesions, likely consequences of myocardial damage by the parasite. ASC homing to early parasite reservoirs may be due to inflammatory signals recruiting MSC. The study suggests ASC may be effective in association with antitryosomal drugs targeting parasite persistence and heart inflammation in Chagas disease.
Researchers investigated the effectiveness of structurally optimized analogs of Retro-2, a retrograde trafficking inhibitor, in limiting Leishmania infections in mammalian cells. Two analogs, DHZ36 and DHZ36.1, showed superior potency in inhibiting retrograde pathway-dependent phenomena and controlling Leishmania infections, with EC50 values of 13.63μM and 10.57μM, significantly lower than Retro-2's 40μM. These analogs limited Leishmania amazonensis infection in macrophages and reversed Leish-induced suppression of IL-6 release after LPS activation. Unlike Retro-2, which is Leish static, the analogs killed Leish parasites in axenic cultures, a desirable attribute for treating Leish infections. DHZ36 and DHZ36.1 were non-toxic to mammalian cells at these concentrations, suggesting the retrograde pathway is more sensitive in Leish. Results corroborate structure-activity relationship analyses and proposed mode of action of the compounds. The analogs suppressed infection of macroages by Leish, consistent with predictions that trafficking vesicles are important for Leish infections. DHZ36 and DH36.1 can kill axenic Leish promastigotes at low μM concentrations and promote clearance of parasites from established macroage infections, reversing inhibition of IL-6 production by infected cells.
Researchers have developed a computational method to evaluate nucleosome sensitivity for transcription factors across the genome, identifying those with binding sites preferentially contained within nucleosome boundaries and lacking 10 bp periodicity. The Acute Myeloid Leukemia-1 (AML1) transcription factor, a regulator of immune gene expression, was identified as potentially sensitive to nucleosomal regulation within the mouse Ly49 gene family. Analysis of a nucleosome map of chromosome 6, where the Ly49 gene is located, revealed a depletion of nucleosomes at AML1 binding sites in expressed Ly49 genes compared to silent genes. This suggests nucleosome-based regulation contributes to Ly49 expression. Whole-chromosome analysis revealed many transcription factors display nucleosome coverage and lack 10 bp periodicity, indicating potential nucleosome sensitivity. In a cell line expressing Ly49, expressed genes showed preferential nucleosome depletion at AML1 binding sites compared to inactive genes. AML1 sites were depleted of nucleosomes throughout promoter/enhancer regions of expressed Ly genes, implicating nucleosome positioning as a mechanism to affect Ly expression. The study proposes the method could aid in dissecting the regulatory role of nucleosomes and suggests AML1 sensitivity may be specific to Ly regulation or ubiquitously sensitive to nucleosome occupancy.
Cell cycle progression is orchestrated by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDs) which are activated by phosphorylation of their T-loop by CD-activating kinase (CA). The critical step in CD activation is dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites by Cdc phosphatases rather than unrestricted T-loop phosphorylation. Homolog CD4 and CD6 bound cyclins initiate mitogenic/oncogenic cascades by inactivating the oncospressor pRb and cell commitment at the restriction point. T-loop phosphorylation at T172 is highly regulated determining CD4 activity. Using chemical-genetics with analogue-sensitive CD7, CD7 inhibition prevented activating phosphorylations CD4/6 but CD4 was partly dependent on p21 binding. CD7 inhibition increased p21 binding to CD4 with disappearance of p21 phosphorylation at S130 catalyzed by CD4 and CD2. S130 mutation prevented CD4 phosphorylation and CD/CD2 impaired p21 phosphorylation. CD7 inhibition revealed indirect involvement in CD4/6 phosphorylation, existence of CD-activating kinases other than CD7, and CD7-dependent feedback by p21 phosphorylation to sustain CD4 activation and pR inactivation. CD4 T172 phosphorylation is central in a CD-dependent bidirectional interplay mediated by p21 phosphorylation at the restriction point.
Researchers have identified the chromatin protein DUET/MMD1 as a crucial regulator of meiotic gene expression in Arabidopsis, specifically controlling the meiotic gene TDM1 during male meiosis. DUET, a PHD finger protein, binds to H3K4me2 in vitro, which is essential for its function during meiosis, and regulates microtubule organization during meiosis II independently of its function in meiosis I. Expression of DU is stage-specific, confined to the diplotene stage of prophase I. The protein targets of DU include TDM and JAS, critical for cell cycle transitions and spindle organization in meiosis, with T1 being a direct target. The du mutant shows reduced expression of about 12% of known meiosis-preferred genes. DU functions as a transcription activator of meiotic gene T1 and regulates microtub organization and cell transitions during meiosis. T1 expression in male meiosis directly depends on DU and is not detected in female meiosis, suggesting DU's role in activating male meiotic genes contributing to sexual dimorphism. The study reveals the action of DU as a transcriptional regulator during male meiosis and suggests transcription of meiotic genes is under stagewise control in plants, similar to yeast.
Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXT) is a neurodegenerative disorder seen in Fragile X premutation carriers. Research found that Fragile X CG repeats cause neurogeneration and the CG-binding proteins Pur and hnRNP A2/B modulate CG-mediated neuronal toxicity. A proteomic approach identified over 100 proteins interacting with Pur, including R62, the Drosophila ortholog of p68 RNA helicase, which modulates CG-mediated neurogeneration. CG repeats decrease R62 expression post-transcriptionally, leading to nuclear accumulation of Hsp transcript and additional mRNAs involved in stress and immune responses. The nuclear accumulation of these mRNAs, likely due to impaired export, contributes to FAS pathogenesis. R62 physically interacts with Pur, modulating CG-mediated neurogeneration, and CG repeats decrease R62 expression, accumulating Hsp transcript in the nucleus. Reduced R62 viability in heterozygous mutant flies supports a genetic interaction between R62 and CG repeat neuronal death. Systematic, genetic, and microarray analyses show nuclear accumulation of select mAs by CG repeats contributes to FAS, via impaired export due to decreased R62. Altered Hsp transcript distribution and turnover is similar to R62/p68 mutation, indicating CG repeats produce deficits in nuclear export of selective transcripts, interfering with neurons' ability to respond to cellular stress.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms environmentally and clinically relevant biofilms and is a paradigm for the study of biofilms. The extracellular polymeric substance of P. aeruginosa biofilms is an ill-defined mix of polysaccharides, nucleic acids, and proteins. Research directly visualized the product of polysaccharide synthesis, Psl, at different stages of biofilm development. During attachment, Psl is anchored on the cell surface in a helical pattern, promoting cell-cell interactions and assembly of the matrix, holding bacteria in the biofilm on the surface. Chemical dissociation of P from the surface disrupted the P matrix and biofilm structure. During biofilm maturation, P accumulates on the periphery of 3-D structured microcolonies, resulting in a Psl-free cavity in the microcolony center. At dispersion, swimming cells appear in the matrix, with dead cells and extracellular DNA concentrated in the Psl-free area. Deletion of genes controlling cell death and autolysis affects the formation of the cavity and microcolony dispersion. The data provide a mechanism for how P. aerugin builds a matrix and a cavity to free portion of cells for seeding dispersal. Psl is a key scaffolding matrix component, opening avenues for therapeutics of biofilm-related complications. P. aerugin biofilms develop in a five-stage multicellular cycle initiated by attachment of free cells to a surface, followed by microcolony formation and dispersal. The Psl matrix remains intact at all stages, facilitating surface adherence and maintaining biofilm architecture. Psl associates with cells on the surface at early stages and accumulates on microcolony periphery at later stages, playing a critical role in P. aerugin persistence.
Researchers conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumors and matched patient-derived xenografts (PDX) from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PD) and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 'trios' of primary tumor, DX, and patient-derived organoids (PDO). The study aimed to evaluate the concordance between PD models and paired human tumors for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. The results showed single-gene concordance across major PD driver genes but poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide analysis of structural variation events highlighted previously unrecognized concord across chromosomes with clustered events. Polyploidy presented a challenge when assessing copy changes, however, ploidy-corrected copy states suggested good agreement between donor-model pairs. The findings indicate that DX and PDO recapitulate primary and metastatic disease at the level of somatic mutations mainly in driver genes but not across the greater expanse of mutations. The study provides the first quantitative assessment of whole-genome comparisons between human PD, both primary and metastasis, and matched systems, demonstrating that DX and PDO may serve as tractable systems for probing molecular properties of PD but may best serve selective analyses across different levels of genomic complexity. Overall, the study highlights the potential of DX and PDO as preclinical platforms for investigating the molecular landscape of cancer and testing candidate treatments, but also emphasizes the need for further evaluation of their genomic fidelity to patient tumors.
A genome-wide association study conducted in 19,091 East Asian breast cancer cases and 20,606 controls identified novel susceptibility loci for breast cancer. The study analyzed 690,947 SNPs in 2,918 cases and 2,324 controls, with 5,365 SNPs evaluated for replication in 3,972 cases and 3,852 controls, and 94 SNPs further evaluated in 5,203 and 5,138 controls. The top 22 SNPs were investigated in 17,423 additional subjects. SNP rs9482 near the TGF-β activated kinase gene on chromosome 6q25.1 showed a consistent association with breast risk across all stages with a P-value of 3.8×10−12. Adjusted odds ratios were 0.89 and 0.80 for A/G and A genotypes compared to G/G. SNPs rs3951 and rs7107 also showed consistent associations. This study provides strong evidence for a novel breast susceptibility locus represented by rs9482 near the TAB2 gene and identifies possible loci in the ESR gene and 11q24.3. The study represents the largest breast genetic association in East Asian women with approximately 40,000 cases and controls, providing valuable resources to identify additional susceptibility loci. The findings support previous reports of genetic loci at 6q25 for breast risk.
Cryptocococcal meningitis is a major cause of mortality worldwide, particularly in developing countries. A study of 230 Cryptococcus neoformans isolates from HIV-positive patients in South Africa revealed high genetic diversity, with 50 sequence types identified. Spatial analysis showed no geographical clustering, suggesting reactivation of latent infection rather than recent acquisition. Patients infected with the VNB lineage had worse survival rates, with a hazard ratio of 3.35, even after adjusting for prognostic indicators and treatment. The VNII lineage displayed increased lacc activity and ex vivo CSF survival, indicating lineage-associated virulence. The findings show Cryptoccus neoform is phenotypically heterogeneous and lineage plays a role in virulence during human infection. The study highlights the importance of understanding genetic diversity in Southern Africa to assess risks of different ecotypes and infection. Overall mortality was 27% at 10 weeks and 41% at one year, with long-term outcome data available for all patients. The relationship between patient outcome and cryptoccal genotype was explored, showing significant differences in survival between MLST types, particularly poor survival in ST32-infected patients, although not statistically significant due to small sample size.
Researchers have identified the transcription factor Tec1 as a key component of a newly evolved signal transduction pathway regulating the pheromone response of the white phenotype in Candida albicans. The elucidation of Tec1 provides a comprehensive description of the pherone pathway, offering insights into how signal transduction pathways evolve. The pathway appears to have derived from three ancestral programs: the upstream portion from the opaque pherone response, Tec1 from the filamentation pathway, and downstream genes from an ancestral biofilm process. Characterization of the TEC deletion mutant confirmed Tec1 as the target transcription factor in the white pherone pathway. The evolution of the pherone response provides a paradigm for signal transduction evolution. The white pathway is considered young, with insufficient time to duplicate or modify components in response to selective pressures. Tec1 activates genes involved in signal transduction and membrane processes, including adhesion and biofilm formation. The white and opaque pathways have distinct relationships, with the opaque pherone pathway sharing components with Saccharomyces cerevisiae haploid pherone response. The study suggests the evolution of the white pherone pathway in Candida albicans offers a glimpse into signal transduction evolution, providing a paradigm for how pathways may evolve.
Researchers investigated the variation in genomic GC-content in bacteria, which ranges from less than 20% to more than 70%, by examining patterns of synonymous polymorphism in 149 species. A large excess of GC→AT mutations over AT→GC mutations was found in all but the most AT-rich bacteria across diverse species. This excess is inconsistent with mutation bias as it would imply GC-rich bacteria are declining in GC-content, a pattern that would be unsustainable. The patterns are not due to translational selection or biased conversion as optimal codons tend to be AT-rich and excess GC→SNPs are observed in datasets with no evidence of recombination. The study concludes there is selection to increase synonymous-content in many species and since synonymous-content is correlated to genomic-content, there is selection on base composition in bacteria. A dataset of 149 species from 8 phyla, 15 classes, and 77 genera was assembled with at least 8 sequences, 10 synonymous polymorphisms, and nucleotide diversity less than 0.1. GC-rich bacteria have a genuine excess of GC→AT mutations, while AT-rich may be due to infinite sites assumption violation. Half of species have Z<0.5 with low site diversity, reducing assumption violations, 14 of 25 for diversity 0. The findings suggest selection acts on genomic base composition in many bacteria.
Researchers developed a spatial modeling approach to map the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infections in Kenya, using data from 106,370 individuals across 945 cross-sectional surveys between 1974 and 2009. Bayesian space-time geostatistical models were created for hookworm, Ascaris lumbricoid, and Trichis trichi, and used to estimate the probability of infection exceeding 20% across the country in 198 and 200. Maps for each species were integrated to estimate combined prevalence, incorporating a correction for associations between species. Results showed high endemicity below 20% in most areas in 200, except around Lake Victoria and the coast. Comparison between 198 and 200 showed a decrease in STH prevalence over time. An estimated 2.8 million school-age children live in districts warranting mass treatment. Bayesian models estimated a quarter of Kenya's school children live in areas of high prevalence warranting mass treatment. The approach provides decision-makers with information to prioritize districts for targeted control among school-aged children, following WHO recommendations. The work is part of the Global Atlas of Helminth Infection project, aiming to guide control parasitic disease implementation with accurate maps at policy-relevant scales.
Cellular immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis requires a coordinated response between the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system, resulting in a type 1 cytokine response associated with infection control. Researchers established an in vitro system to study the contribution of innate lymphocytes to immunity against Mtb and found that interferon-γ is produced when splenocytes from uninfected mice are cultured with Mtb-infected macrophages, suppressing bacterial replication. This control is dependent on CD1-restricted invariant NKT cells and their activation requires CD1 expression by infected macrophages as well as IL12 and IL18. Adoptive transfer of iNKT cells into mice reduced bacterial burden in lungs infected with virulent Mtb, demonstrating a direct bactericidal effect even without synthetic ligands. The findings show CD1-restricted NKT cells mediate protection against Mtb in vivo. Inhibition of mycobacterial growth is dependent on CD1-restricted NKT cells, with splenocytes from mice lacking NKT unable to reduce Mtb. The main source of interferonγ is NK and T cells, with infected macrophages stimulating production correlated with reduced Mtb recovery. The results indicate iNKT cells restrict Mtb replication and contribute to host defense against tuberculosis, with adoptive transfer of primary splenic iNKT reducing bacterial burden in infected mice.
Researchers investigated the temporal and spatial regulation of protein cross-linking by the pre-assembled substrates of Bacillus subtilis spore transglutaminase, an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of intra- or intermolecular ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysyl cross-links. Unlike other transglutaminases, Tgl is produced in an active form and efficiently catalyzes amine incorporation and protein-linking in vitro with no additional requirements. The study found that substrates assembled onto the spore coat prior to Tgl production govern the localization of Tgl to the surface of the developing spore. Tgl residues important for substrate recognition are crucial for its localization, with glutamyl and lysyl docking sites identified as key for assembly. The interaction with Q-substrates and formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate is the determinant in localization of T. The enzyme exerts a "spot-welding" activity, cross-linking pre-formed assemblies, and becomes part of the cross-linked products. The dependency of Tgl on its substrates controls the time, location, and extent of enzyme activity, directed at covalent fortification of preassembled complexes at the surface of the developing spore. This mechanism ensures proper temporal and spatial control of spore protein-linking, specificity, and extent of action. The findings suggest substrate-dependent localization may control the activity of T orthologs in other spore-forming bacteria, with Tgl embodying minimal structural requirements for protein-linking. The results indicate preassembled complexes recruit Tgl, and cross-linking by T may be self-limiting as the enzyme becomes cross-linked into the forming structure, restricting further catalysis.
Opisthoris vivini, a food-borne trematode, infects an estimated 2.5 million individuals in Lao PDR, causing biliary diseases and cholangiocarcinoma. A cross-sectional survey in 51 villages in Champasak province found a 61.1% prevalence among 3,371 participants. Bayesian geostatistical models identified age, Lao Loum ethnic group, low educational attainment, and occupation as risk factors, while history of praziquant treatment, access to sanitation, and distance to freshwater were protective. Spatial patterns were mainly governed by environmental factors, predicting low risk in mountains and high risk in the Mekong corridor. The study presents the first risk map of Opisthoris vivini in Champak, targeting control efforts. Infection is associated with exposure to intermediate host fish, human behavior, and culture, sustained by lack of sanitation. Environmental factors predict Opistis vivini prevalence, with low rates at high altitudes above 500m. Freshwater accessibility and preference for raw fish increase risk, while lack of sanitation sustains transmission. The high prevalence calls for urgent public health interventions.
The city of Dar es Salaam has an extensive network of drains, mostly with inadequate water flow and blocked by waste, causing flooding after rainfall, which contributes to the presence of Anopheles and Cule larvae, impacting the transmission of lymphatic filariasis and malaria. Over 70% of larval habitats in Dar Salaam are human-made, with aquatic habitats associated with agriculture having the highest proportion of Anopheles presence and second-highest Cx presence. Drains account for 42% of aquatic habitats, with 43% of culicine and 33% anopheline habitats being drains. Stagnant water in drains increases the odds of finding Anophe and Cx larvae by 8.8 and 6.3 times, respectively. Vegetation is positively associated with the presence of mosquito larvae. The proportion of habitats with larvae is spatially correlated. Restoring and maintaining drains could eliminate over 40% of potential larval habitats currently treated with larvicides. Human-made habitats are crucial for lymphatic filari and malaria vectors, underscoring the need for synergy between control efforts. Drains, borrow pits, and house foundations comprise 55% of habitats with Anophe and 69% with Cx larvae. Coordinated vector control could foster synergy between programs controlling LF and malaria in Dar es Sala.
Dengue virus (DENV) infection impairs AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation, leading to increased 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) activity and cholesterol accumulation in the endoplasmic retic reticulum, creating a favorable environment for viral replication. Studies using enzymatic assays, ELISA, and Western blotting found higher HCR activity in DENV-infected cells, associated with reduced AMPK activation. Metformin, an AMP activator, decreased HCR activity, while compound C, an AMP inhibitor, augmented viral replication. HCR and cholesterol colocalized with viral proteins NS3, NS4, and E, suggesting a role in replicative complex formation. Metform and lovastatin, an HCR inhibitor, altered colocalization and replication, indicating active HCR is necessary. Metform showed dose-dependent antiviral effects, while compound C increased viral genome and infected cells. The phosphatase PP2 activity was unaffected by DENV. Inhibition of this phosphatase showed antiviral effects independent of HCR. Results indicate DENV increases HCR through AMP inactivation, leading to higher cholesterol for replicative complex formation, providing insights into host lipid metabolism during DENV replication and potential antiviral targets.
Researchers utilized all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 70S ribosome to investigate the kinetics and energy landscape of tRNA translocation, providing a bridge between state-like kinetic measurements and continuous energy landscape. Starting from a pre-translocation configuration, collective rearrangements of residues implicated in ribosome function were identified, and estimates of diffusion coefficients were used to interconvert experimental rates and energy measures. This analysis yielded an upper-bound estimate of free-energy barriers associated with translocation. The study decomposed tRNA translocation into slow, large-scale movements and rapid fluctuations, identifying regions of the ribosome undergoing each class of motion, with many residues exhibiting coordinated displacements reminiscent of rigid body movement. Collective coordinates captured 30-body rotation, 30-head swivel, and tRNA displacements essential for substrate translocation. The diffusion provides a unifying foundation for understanding biological processes, and this study established a framework for tRNA translocation in the ribosome, probing diffusive characteristics of subunit rotations and tRNA displacements that facilitate protein elongation in cells. The framework is general and applicable to energetic and kinetic descriptions including multiple intermediates and transition states.
Researchers investigated the genetic landscape of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) by sequencing 84 sporadic MTC and 36 paired normal thyroid tissues using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Panel v2, discovering 101 hotspot mutations in 18 genes. The most common mutation occurred in the RET proto-oncogene, followed by mutations in genes encoding Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene, serine/threonine kinase, v-kit, and MET proto-oncogene. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization, identifying two cases positive for ALK FISH. Customized cancer sequencing revealed glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate transaminase 1 (GFPT1)-ALK and echoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusions. Additional analysis confirmed the GF1-ALK fusion as a result of intra-chromosomal translocation or deletion. Notably, a metastatic MTC case with E4-ALK fusion showed a response to ALK inhibitor crizotib. The study identified several genetic mutations in MTC, including the first ALK fusions, suggesting E4-ALK as a potential driver mutation and valid target for ALK inhibitors, and GF1-ALK as a candidate for molecular therapy. The findings contribute to understanding the genetic landscape of MTC and potential therapeutic targets.
Asymptomatic leishmaniasis poses a significant challenge to the goal of Visceral Leishiasis elimination in endemic areas. A study in Malda district, West Bengal, India, detected antileishial antibody in 185 individuals, with 96 having a history of VL/PK and 89 without. Seventy-nine were classified as asymptomatic leishias and ten as active VL with a ratio of 7.9:1. Among asymptomatic cases, 10.39% transformed to disease and 80.52% seroconverted within three years. Seven remained seropositive after three years. Progression to clinical disease occurred up to three years after baseline. The study observed a prevalence of 3.16% asymptomatic leishial infection, lower than 5.62-13.8% detected in Bihar. The ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic cases was 7.9:1. Asymptomatic individuals without history of kalaazar were examined for fever, pallor, and hepato-splenomegaly. Positive cases were referred for parasitological investigation and treatment. The presence of asymptomatic cases indicates the area is not free from leishiasis even with no VL/PK cases for two years. Asymptomatic individuals require attention for VL elimination to prevent future epidemics.
Aneuploidy and gross chromosomal rearrangements can lead to genetic diseases and cancer development. Introduction of the retrotranson Ty912 onto a nonessential arm of Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to increased genome instability due to increased rates of monocentric nonrecipro translocations. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Amplification was used to analyze these rearrangements, finding the distribution of translocations induced by Ty912 was nonrandom, with the majority mediated by six targets on four chromosomes. Most Ty-mediated translocations resulted from RAD52-dependent recombination, while some nonrecipro translocations were mediated by RAD52-independent recombination between Ty elements. The formation of RAD-independent translocations did not require Rad51 or Rad59 homolog pairing or Rad1-Rad10 endonuclease. Defects in ASF1-RT109-dependent acetylation of histone H3 lysine 56 resulted in accumulation of gross chromosomal rearrangements, whole-chromosome duplications, and aneuploidy that occurred with rearrangements. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Amplification is a technique for rapid analysis of gross chromosomal rearrangements, facilitating genetic analysis of pathways that prevent and promote them and aneupidy. The majority of Ty-mediated arm duplications were accounted for by six target regions on four arms, contrasting with 254 potential targets in the S cerevisiae genome, indicating Ty preferential recombination with high sequence homology regions. Four chromosome arms were targets of 70% of translocations, containing hotspots for Ty-mediated events, suggesting physical proximity does not play a large role in target selection. Most gross chromosomal rearrangements result from RAD52-dependent Ty-mediated nonrecipro translocations, primarily through RAD51 and RAD59 pathways.
The association of two proteins is driven by a free energy funnel determined by favorable interactions in the neighborhood of the native state, similar to protein folding. A method called semi-definite-based underestimation (SD) employs a quadratic function to underestimate a set of local energy minima and uses the resulting underimator to bias sampling, effectively minimizing functions with funnel-shaped basins. However, its application to docking in rotational and translational space is not straightforward due to the geometry. A strategy is introduced using separate variables for side-chain optimization, center-to-center distance, and angular descriptors of relative orientations. Removing the center-to-center distance improves efficiency as the five-dimensional space exhibits a well-behaved energy surface suitable for underestimation. The algorithm explores the free energy surface spanned by encounter complexes corresponding to local minima, showing macromolecular association through collisions. Results establish the free landscape is a funnel in a broad neighborhood of the native state and SD generates predictions with less than 5 Å ligand interface Cα root-mean-square deviation, achieving a 20-fold efficiency gain compared to Monte Carlo methods. The method validates the assumption the free landscape is a funnel and produces high-quality predictions with substantial efficiency gains.
