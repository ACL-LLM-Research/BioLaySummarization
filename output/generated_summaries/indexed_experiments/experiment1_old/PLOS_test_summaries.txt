Sleeping sickness, also known as gambiense human African trypanosomiasis ( gHAT ), is a fatal vector-borne disease that has seen a significant decline in reported cases over the last two decades due to intensified intervention efforts. However, pockets of infection remain, and it becomes increasingly important to assess if different regions are on track for elimination and where intervention efforts should be focused. We present a previously developed stochastic mathematical model for gHAT in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) and show that it is able to capture the dynamics of gHAT observed at the health area level. This is the first time any stochastic gHAT model has been fitted directly to case data, allowing us to better quantify the uncertainty in our results. We use a particle filter Markov chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) methodology to fit the model to the data from 16 health areas of Mosango health zone in Kwilu province as a case study. We find that the health area of Kinzamba II, which has approximately one third of the health zone’s cases, will have the latest expected year for elimination of transmission ( EoT ) under the current intervention strategies.
Tumor microenvironments ( TMEs ) contain a vast amount of information on a patient’s cancer through their cellular composition and spatial distribution of tumor cells and immune cell populations. We present an approach to summarize spatial relationships in the TME using spatial K functions, and then apply functional data analysis and random forest models to predict outcomes of interest and identify important spatial relationships. This approach is shown to be effective in simulation experiments at both identifying important spatial interactions and controlling the false discovery rate. We further apply this approach to two real data sets of Multiplexed Ion Beam Images of TMEs in triple negative breast cancer and lung cancer patients. Our approach begins by producing K functions for the different cell-cell or marker-marker interactions within images, followed by dimension reduction using functional principal components analysis. We then combine these data with non-functional patient meta-data, such as age or sex, and use a modified random forest model to predict the patient outcome.
In the present study, we computationally investigate how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure co-emerge during synchronization and desynchronization processes in neuronal networks. We combine a network of excitatory integrate-and-fire neurons with different synaptic weight and/or structural plasticity mechanisms, including spike-timing-dependent plasticity ( STDP ), homeostatic structural plasticity ( hSP ), and structural plasticity ( SP ) that includes hSP and weight-dependent pruning. To accommodate the diverse time scales of neuronal firing, STDP, and SP, we introduce a simple stochastic SP model that enables detailed numerical analyses. Our results show that structural reorganization may remarkably enhance the network’s level of synchrony, and that the strengthening of contacts from neurons with higher natural firing rates to those with lower rates and the weakening of contacts in the opposite direction, followed by selective removal of weak contacts, allows for strong synchrony with fewer connections. This activity-led network reorganization results in the emergence of degree-frequency, degree-degree correlations, and a mixture of degree assortativity. We compare the stimulation-induced desynchronization of synchronized states in the STDP-only model with the desynchronization of models that combine STDP with hSP and SP, and show that the latter require stimuli of significantly higher intensity to achieve long-term desynchronization.
Planarians have the ability to regenerate large parts of their nervous system from an unlimited number of starting points. This process requires the coordinated regeneration of neurons and glia from distinct progenitors. We found that in planarians, neurons expressing a Delta-encoding gene, delta-2, are regenerated first at key positions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Subsequently, planarian glia are specified from dispersed Notch-1-expressing mesoderm-like phagocytic progenitors. Inhibition of delta-2 or notch-1 severely reduced glia in planarians, but did not affect the specification of other phagocytic cell types. Loss of several delta-2-expressing neuron classes prevented differentiation of the glia associated with them, whereas transplantation of delta-2-expressing photoreceptor neurons was sufficient for glia formation at an ectopic location. Our results suggest a model in which patterned delta-2-expressing neurons instruct phagocytic progenitors to locally differentiate into glia, presenting a mechanism for coordinated regeneration of numbers and pattern of cell types.
In this study, we investigated the role of gamma-delta ( γδ ) T cells in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bNAbs ) against HIV-1. We characterized γδ T cell responses starting from pre-acquisition and during acute HIV infection ( AHI ) in participants previously identified as ‘broad’ and ‘non-broad’ neutralizers. We found significant differences in γδ T cell surface marker expression in participants that developed neutralization breadth compared to those that did not. Activation of γδ T cells occurred within the first weeks of HIV acquisition and was associated with viral load. Expression of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells and CD57 on Vδ2 T cells were found to be significantly higher in broad neutralizers during AHI, and associated with the development of neutralization breadth years later. In addition, the levels of CD16 on Vδ1 T cells were associated with early production of founder virus Env-specific IgM. These findings suggest that γδ T cells may promote the development of neutralization breadth, which has implications for HIV vaccine strategies. Understanding the mechanism by which γδ T cells promote the development of bNAbs could help develop strategies targeting these cells to improve vaccine-induced humoral immune responses.
Metastasis, the spread of cancer from one organ to another, is responsible for the majority of cancer deaths. However, most anti-cancer drugs are designed to arrest or reverse tumor growth without directly addressing metastasis. Recently, it was discovered that tumor cell-secreted interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) and interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) synergize to enhance cancer metastasis in a cell-density dependent manner. A novel bispecific antibody, BS1, was engineered to block the IL-6 and IL-8 receptors ( IL-6R and IL-8R ) and was shown to significantly reduce metastatic burden in multiple preclinical mouse models of cancer. Here, we describe a quantitative, computational model of the BS1 bispecific antibody that provides key insights into antibody affinity and avidity effects and can guide therapeutic design. The model is comprised of a series of ordinary differential equations ( ODEs ) for each of the receptors, antibodies, and antibody-receptor complexes studied. Our results demonstrate how the balance of binary ( antibody-receptor ) and ternary ( receptor-antibody-receptor ) complexes drives receptor inhibition, providing important and generalizable predictions for effective therapeutic design.
ZYG-8, a conserved doublecortin-family kinase, is a microtubule-associated protein that has been implicated in cell division and is upregulated in many cancers. In C. elegans oocytes, ZYG-8 is required for both the assembly and stability of the acentrosomal spindle. Depletion of ZYG-8 from oocytes results in overelongated spindles with pole and midspindle defects, suggesting that ZYG-8 plays a role in regulating the force-generating motor BMK-1/kinesin-5. We propose that ZYG-8 regulates microtubule dynamics to facilitate the proper turnover of microtubules within the spindle, and influences the activity of motors that walk along those microtubules to tune the forces that build and stabilize the spindle. ZYG-8 contains a microtubule-binding doublecortin domain and a kinase domain, and its kinase activity is required for its functions in both mitosis and meiosis. Depletion of ZYG-8 leads to reduced microtubule growth rates and increased nucleation rates, demonstrating that ZYG-8 modulates microtubule dynamics in both mitosis and meiosis. Our findings reveal new roles for ZYG-8 in oocytes and provide insights into how acentrosomal spindles are stabilized to promote faithful meiosis.
Metabolite levels have been associated with type 2 diabetes ( T2D ), but the extent to which T2D affects metabolite levels and their genetic regulation remains to be elucidated. We investigated the interplay between genetics, metabolomics, and T2D risk in the UK Biobank dataset using the Nightingale panel composed of 249 metabolites, 92% of which correspond to lipids and lipoproteins. We found 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2D, all spanning lipid-related classes except for Glucose and Tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2D liability, spanning almost all tested classes, including branched-chain amino acids. Using an interaction quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) analysis, we described four metabolites consistently replicated in an independent dataset from the Estonian Biobank, for which genetic loci in two different genomic regions show attenuated regulation in T2D cases compared to controls. The significant variants from the interaction QTL analysis are significant QTLs for the corresponding metabolites in the general population but are not associated with T2D risk, pointing towards consequences of T2D on the genetic regulation of metabolite levels. Finally, we found 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macrovascular, or both types of T2D complications, with only a few discriminating between complication classes.
Staphylococcus aureus ( S. aureus ) is a bacterium that can cause a range of infections in humans, from mild skin infections to severe life-threatening conditions. In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of tolerance to S. aureus infection in mice. Tolerance is the ability of a host to limit the health impact of a given pathogen burden, as opposed to resistance, which is the ability to limit the pathogen burden itself. We previously identified two mouse strains, CC061 and CC024, which differ in their susceptibility to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) infection. CC061 mice are highly susceptible to MRSA, while CC024 mice are tolerant. We generated F1 and F2 populations by crossing CC061 and CC024 mice to identify host genes involved in tolerance after S. aureus infection. We found that survival after MRSA infection in the F1 and F2 generations followed a complex dominant inheritance pattern for the CC024 increased survival phenotype. We identified a Quantitative Trait Locus ( QTL ) peak on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection, and found that the WSB/EiJ allele present in CC024 mice contributed to their MRSA tolerant phenotype. We also identified two genes, C5ar1 and C5ar2, which are receptors for the complement factor C5a, an anaphylatoxin that can trigger a massive immune response. We hypothesize that C5a may have altered binding to variant receptors in CC024 mice, reducing damage caused by the cytokine storm and resulting in the ability to tolerate a higher pathogen burden and longer survival.
The distribution of fitness effects ( DFE ) among beneficial mutations during adaptive walks is a fundamental concept in evolutionary theory. However, current models of adaptation often rely on additive genotype-phenotype ( GP ) relationships, ignoring the contribution of gene interactions to phenotypic variance. In this study, we model a quantitative trait as the product of a simple gene regulatory network, the negative autoregulation motif, and use forward-time genetic simulations to measure adaptive walks towards a phenotypic optimum in both additive and network models. We found that both models deviated from the classical expectation of an exponential distribution of fitness effects, with fewer large-effect beneficial alleles than expected. The network model also exhibited a complex and bimodal distribution of fitness effects among all mutations, with a considerable density at deleterious selection coefficients. This behavior is reminiscent of the cost of complexity, where correlations among traits constrain adaptation. Our results suggest that the interactions emerging from genetic networks can generate complex and multimodal distributions of fitness effects. We observed that both network and additive models exhibit similarities in key aspects of their adaptive walks, including the number of adaptive steps and the distribution of fitness effects among both fixations and beneficial mutations. However, the network model approached the optimum more slowly than additive models on average.
We propose a novel Bayesian view on the dynamics of conductance-based neurons and synapses which suggests that they are naturally equipped to optimally perform information integration. According to this view, apical dendrites represent prior expectations over somatic potentials, while basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials. These are parametrized by local quantities, the effective reversal potentials and membrane conductances. We formally demonstrate that under these assumptions the somatic compartment naturally computes the corresponding posterior. We derive a gradient-based plasticity rule, allowing neurons to learn desired target distributions and weight synaptic inputs by their relative reliabilities. Our theory explains various experimental findings on the system and single-cell level related to multi-sensory integration, which we illustrate with simulations. Furthermore, we make experimentally testable predictions on Bayesian dendritic integration and synaptic plasticity. We demonstrate that the dynamics of conductance-based neuron models naturally computes posterior distributions from Gaussian likelihood functions and prior represented in dendritic compartments. We derive somatic membrane dynamics from stochastic gradient ascent on this posterior distribution, and synaptic plasticity from matching the posterior to a target distribution.
Protein structure prediction has now been widely deployed across several large protein sets. Using the Evolutionary Classification of Protein Domains ( ECOD ) from experimental structures as a basis for classification, we describe the detection and cataloging of domains from 48 whole proteomes deposited in the AlphaFold Database. On average, we can provide positive classification ( either of domains or other identifiable non-domain regions ) for 90% of residues in all proteomes. We classified 746, 349 domains from 536, 808 proteins comprised of over 226, 424, 000 amino acid residues. We examine the varying populations of homologous groups in both eukaryotes and bacteria. In addition to containing a higher fraction of disordered regions and unassigned domains, eukaryotes show a higher proportion of repeated proteins, both globular and small repeats. We enumerate those highly populated domains that are shared in both eukaryotes and bacteria, such as the Rossmann domains, TIM barrels, and P-loop domains. We compare the sampling of homologous groups from this whole proteome set against our stable ECOD reference and discuss groups that have been enriched by structure predictions. Finally, we discuss the implication of these results for protein target selection for future classification strategies for very large protein sets.
BK polyomavirus ( BKPyV ) is a major cause of kidney transplant failure, for which there are no antivirals. BKPyV is known to promote cellular re-replication, where the cell re-enters S phase from G2 phase without passing through mitosis or G1 phase to prolong S phase for viral replication. This results in cells with greater than 4N DNA content. Using single-cell techniques, we found that BKPyV depends on the host cell cycle for TAg expression and viral production. Our data contrasts with the model where TAg is expressed early and pushes cells into the initial S phase for viral replication. Instead, our data supports a new model whereby BKPyV requires an initial host S phase to replicate. We found that robust TAg expression was consistently observed in ≥4N cells, suggesting that BKPyV production is dependent on an initial S phase. To determine if viral replication depended on an initial host S phase, we used chemical inhibitors to specifically prevent cellular DNA replication. Our findings suggest that BKPyV primarily replicates during host re-replication and that robust viral TAg expression depends on an initial host S phase. Together, these findings change our understanding of the BKPyV life cycle to include the requirement of an initial S phase for robust TAg expression and viral production.
We present FABIO, a novel transcriptome-wide association study ( TWAS ) fine-mapping method specifically designed for binary traits. Unlike existing approaches, FABIO jointly models all genes on the same chromosome to account for genetically regulated expression ( GReX ) correlation across genes in different linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) blocks. FABIO employs a probit model to directly link GReX of genes to binary outcomes while controlling for GReX correlation among all genes on a chromosome. This approach effectively controls false discoveries and offers substantial power gains over existing TWAS fine-mapping methods. We evaluated the performance of FABIO through extensive simulations and applied it to in-depth analyses of six binary disease traits in the UK Biobank. In real datasets, FABIO significantly reduced the size of the causal gene sets by 27. 9%-36. 9% over existing approaches across traits. FABIO successfully prioritized multiple potentially causal genes associated with the diseases, including GATA3 for asthma, ABCG2 for gout, and SH2B3 for hypertension. Overall, FABIO represents an effective tool for TWAS fine-mapping of disease traits.
Misfolded proteins are usually refolded to their functional conformations or degraded by quality control mechanisms. However, when misfolded proteins evade quality control, they can be sequestered to specific sites within cells to prevent dysfunction and toxicity. Btn2 and Hsp42 are compartment-specific sequestrases that play key roles in the assembly of these deposition sites. We show that Btn2 and Hsp42 are required for tolerance to oxidative stress conditions induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide. They act to sequester oxidized proteins into defined PQC sites following ROS exposure and their absence leads to an accumulation of protein aggregates. The toxicity of protein aggregate accumulation causes oxidant sensitivity in btn2 hsp42 sequestrase mutants since overexpression of the Hsp104 disaggregase rescues oxidant tolerance. We have identified the Sup35 translation termination factor as an in vivo sequestrase substrate and show that Btn2 and Hsp42 act to suppress oxidant-induced formation of the yeast [PSI+] prion, which is the amyloid form of Sup35. Our data identify protein sequestration as a key antioxidant defence mechanism that functions to mitigate the damaging consequences of protein oxidation-induced aggregation.
Glioblastoma ( GBM ) is the most aggressive form of primary brain cancer, characterized by rapid growth and invasion into surrounding brain tissue. While the role of coding genes in GBM invasion has been extensively studied, little is known about the role of long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) in this process. Here, we report the first large-scale CRISPR-interference ( CRISPRi ) screen to identify lncRNAs associated with GBM invasion. We screened 2, 307 candidate lncRNAs and identified 48 lncRNAs that were significantly associated with a 33–83% decrease in invasion upon knockdown. The top candidate, LINC03045, demonstrated an 82. 7% decrease in tumor cell invasion upon knockdown, and its expression was significantly associated with patient survival and tumor grade. RNAseq analysis revealed that LINC03045 expression was highly correlated with WASF3, a gene previously implicated in tumor invasion. Knockdown of WASF3 was associated with a significant decrease in invasion, and overexpression of WASF3 rescued the invasive function lost with LINC03045 knockdown. These results suggest that LINC03045 is a novel lncRNA that regulates GBM invasion via WASF3.
It has been proposed that the brain assigns probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli, but the classes of models used by the brain to perform this task remain unknown. To address this issue, we introduce a new clustering procedure for sets of electroencephalographic ( EEG ) data recorded from participants exposed to a sequence of auditory stimuli generated by a stochastic chain. The goal is to retrieve from the EEG data the fingerprints of the putative model that the brain assigns to the sequence of auditory stimuli. We propose to address this question by using a new clustering procedure for sets of EEG data collected while participants were exposed to sequences of auditory stimuli driven by a context tree. This approach allows us to select a more parsimonious model of the EEG data. Employing this approach, it was possible to extract, from EEG data, the regularities matching the algorithm used to generate the random sequence of stimuli. We show evidence that the brain uses the occurrence of strong beat of a stochastic sequence of auditory stimuli to select a model of a random sequence of stimuli. Our results indicate that the brain uses the recurrent occurrences of a regular auditory stimulus in order to build a model.
Single-cell RNA-sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) is a powerful tool for analyzing gene expression and cellular composition at the single-cell level. However, it has limitations, including the failure to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcriptome size ( the total number of transcripts per cell ) and cell dissociation/processing-induced cryptic gene expression. This is particularly a problem when analyzing highly heterogeneous solid tissues/organs, which require cell dissociation for analysis. As a result, there is a discrepancy between bulk RNA-seq results and virtually reconstituted bulk RNA-seq results using composite scRNA-seq data. To address this problem, we propose a computationally calculated coefficient, the cell type-specific weighting-factor ( cWF ). We introduce a concept and method for computing cWFs and report cWFs for 76 cell-types across 10 solid organs. We validate the fidelity of cWFs by accurately reconstituting and deconvolving bulk RNA-seq data of diverse solid organs using scRNA-seq data and cWFs of their composite cells. We also show that cWFs effectively predict aging-progression and suggest a diagnostic utility and biological significance of cWFs. Our study provides an important method to solve critical limitations of scRNA-seq analysis of complex solid tissues/organs.
Mendelian randomization ( MR ) and multivariable Mendelian randomization ( MVMR ) are statistical approaches that use genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the causal effects of a single or multiple exposures on an outcome. However, the presence of pleiotropic genetic variants in the set of instrumental variables can lead to biased estimates, violating one of the core assumptions of MR and MVMR. We propose a radial formulation of MVMR and an adapted Galbraith radial plot that allows for the visualisation of the estimated effect of each exposure within an MVMR analysis. Radial MVMR also includes an option for the removal of outlying SNPs that may violate one or more assumptions of MVMR. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the radial MVMR approach through simulations and applied analyses. We highlight how outliers with respect to all exposures can be visualised and removed through Radial MVMR. We present simulations that illustrate how outlier removal decreases the bias in estimated effects under various forms of pleiotropy. We apply Radial MVMR to estimate the effect of lipid fractions on coronary heart disease ( CHD ) and highlight how important features of MVMR analyses can be explored using a range of tools incorporated within the RMVMR R package. Radial MVMR effectively visualises causal effect estimates and provides valuable diagnostic information with respect to the underlying assumptions of MVMR.
Drosophila melanogaster were continuously recorded at 100 frames per second for up to 7 days at a time in featureless arenas on sucrose-agarose media to investigate their behavior across multiple timescales. We used the deep learning framework SLEAP to produce a full-body postural dataset for 47 individuals, resulting in nearly 2 billion pose instances. We identified stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, proboscis extension, and locomotion, and used the resulting ethograms to explore how the flies’ behavior varies across time of day and days in the experiment. We found distinct daily patterns in all stereotyped behaviors, including specific trends in different grooming modalities, proboscis extension duration, and locomotion speed. We also found that the hour after dawn is a unique time point in the flies’ daily pattern of behavior, and that the behavioral composition of this hour tracks well with other indicators of health such as locomotion speed and the fraction of time spent moving vs. resting. We found a general decline in proboscis extension and locomotion speed as the fraction of time spent in an idle state increases across days, and a difference in behavioral patterns during the morning and evening peaks of activity, primarily appearing in the grooming component of behavior.
Protein tyrosine phosphatases non-receptor type ( PTPNs ) have been extensively studied in the context of the adaptive immune system; however, their roles beyond immunoregulation are less well explored. Here we identify novel functions for the conserved C. elegans phosphatase PTPN-22, establishing its role in nematode molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. Through a non-biased genetic screen, we found that loss of PTPN-22 phosphatase activity suppressed molting defects caused by loss-of-function mutations in the conserved NIMA-related kinases NEKL-2 ( human NEK8/NEK9 ) and NEKL-3 ( human NEK6/NEK7 ), which act at the interface of membrane trafficking and actin regulation. We identified the CDC42 guanine-nucleotide exchange factor DNBP-1 ( human DNMBP ) as an in vivo partner of PTPN-22 through proximity labeling studies. Loss of DNBP-1 also suppressed nekl-associated molting defects. Genetic analysis, co-localization studies, and proximity labeling revealed roles for PTPN-22 in several epidermal adhesion complexes, including C. elegans hemidesmosomes, suggesting that PTPN-22 plays a broad role in maintaining the structural integrity of tissues.
Malaria elimination efforts in Southeast Asia are threatened by the spread of artemisinin resistance. The WorldWide Antimalarial Resistance Network ( WWARN ) provides a comprehensive database on the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kelch 13 ( K13 ) gene, known to be associated with artemisinin resistance. We use this database and a Bayesian geostatistical model to produce spatio-temporal predictions of artemisinin resistance across the Greater Mekong Subregion. Our results show an expansion of the K13 mutation across the region from 2000 to 2022, with the period between 2010 and 2015 demonstrating the most spatial change. We provide the first data-driven, predictive maps of the changing landscape of resistance to artemisinin derivatives in the Greater Mekong Subregion. These maps provide estimates of drug resistance for locations where no data are available and can be used by health agencies to guide the prioritisation of surveillance for resistance and policies to improve treatment and prevent the further spread of resistance. Our model and maps provide important insights into the spatial and temporal trends of artemisinin resistance, enabling improved spatial decision support systems on an unprecedented fine-scale spatial resolution.
NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 are vital components of the inflammasome signaling pathway, critical for the innate immune response. These proteins exist in various forms due to autoproteolysis within the FIIND domain, resulting in full-length ( FL ), cleaved N-terminal ( NT ), and cleaved C-terminal ( CT ) peptides, which form autoinhibitory complexes in the steady state. We found that both NLRP1 paralogs and CARD8 form two conserved autoinhibitory complexes involving NT-CT interactions and FL-CT interactions, but with distinct mechanisms. Specifically, the Linker3 region in murine NLRP1b ( mNLRP1b ) and the ZU5 of rat NLRP1 ( rNLRP1 ) and CARD8 mediate their NT-CT interactions. In addition, we explored the involvement of the cellular protease dipeptidyl peptidases 9 ( DPP9 ) in these complexes, revealing differential interactions and the significance of domain structure. DPP9 interacts with NTs of mNLRP1b, rNLRP1, and CARD8 through their ZU5 subdomains, forming NT-DPP9-CT complexes. However, DPP9 cannot bind to NTs of human NLRP1 ( hNLRP1 ). Our study enhanced the understanding of the regulatory functions of FIIND-containing proteins in inflammasome autoinhibition and activation and underscored the complexity of their interactions within the immune response.
Defects in protein homeostasis can lead to proteotoxic stress, affecting cellular fitness and overall tissue health. In developing tissues, cell competition mechanisms facilitate the detection and elimination of compromised cells by their healthier neighbors. However, the connection between proteotoxic stress and competitive cell survival remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and Golgi localized protein Rer1 regulates protein homeostasis in the developing Drosophila wing epithelium. Loss of Rer1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PERK-mediated phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α ( eIF2α ). Clonal analysis reveals that rer1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through cell competition. Interestingly, we find that Rer1 levels are upregulated upon Myc-overexpression, which causes overgrowth under high proteotoxic stress. Our results suggest that increased levels of Rer1 provide cytoprotection to Myc-overexpressing cells by alleviating proteotoxic stress and supporting Myc-driven overgrowth.
Loss of function mutations in the checkpoint kinase gene CHEK2 are associated with an increased risk of breast and other cancers. However, most of the 3, 188 unique amino acid changes that can result from non-synonymous single nucleotide variants ( SNVs ) of CHEK2 have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHEK2-encoded protein ( CHK2 ). We used a high throughput technique of deep mutational scanning ( DMS ) to test all but two of the 4, 887 possible SNVs in the CHEK2 open reading frame for their ability to complement mutations in the yeast ortholog of CHEK2, RAD53. Among the non-synonymous changes, 770 were damaging to protein function while 2, 417 were tolerated. The results correlate well with previous structure and function data and provide a first or additional functional assay for all the variants of uncertain significance identified in clinical databases. This approach can be used to help predict the pathogenicity of CHEK2 variants of uncertain significance that are found in susceptibility screening and could be applied to other cancer risk genes.
Streptococcus pneumoniae, a human pathogen, forms multiple epigenetically and phenotypically distinct intra-populations by invertase PsrA-driven inversions of DNA methyltransferase hsdS genes in the colony opacity-determinant ( cod ) locus. These inversions result in different genome methylation patterns or epigenomes that confer pathogenesis-associated traits. Here, we report that the SpxA1-TenA toxin-antitoxin ( TA ) system regulates the orientations of hsdS inversions, and thereby bacterial epigenome and associated traits, by targeting pneumococcal protein synthesis. The SpxA1-TenA system is a highly conserved type II TA system in S. pneumoniae, in which the toxin TenA is transcriptionally repressed by its antitoxin SpxA1. When the transcription of tenA is de-repressed, TenA binds to the ribosome maturation factor RimM, reducing the cellular level of alternative sigma factor ComX. This in turn enhances the transcription of the invertase gene psrA, favoring the formation of the transparent colony phase-associated hsdS allelic configurations in the cod locus. The SpxA1-TenA system acts as a programmed genetic switch that generates pneumococcal subpopulations with epigenetic and phenotypic diversity due to spontaneous variations in the number of AT di-nucleotides in the promoter region of the spxA1-tenA operon.
High-dimensional data are ubiquitous in the biological sciences, and it is often desirable to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions to extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one condition. However, traditional dimensionality reduction techniques cannot accomplish this because they operate on only one dataset. To address this problem, contrastive principal component analysis ( cPCA ) has been proposed, but it has seen little adoption because it requires tuning a hyperparameter resulting in multiple solutions, with no way of knowing which is correct. Moreover, cPCA uses foreground and background conditions that are treated differently, making it ill-suited to compare two experimental conditions symmetrically. Here we describe the development of generalized contrastive PCA ( gcPCA ), a flexible hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. We first provide analyses explaining why cPCA requires a hyperparameter and how gcPCA avoids this requirement. We then describe an open-source gcPCA toolbox containing Python and MATLAB implementations of several variants of gcPCA tailored for different scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of gcPCA in analyzing diverse high-dimensional biological data, revealing unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II diabetes in single-cell RNA sequencing data. As a fast, robust, and easy-to-use comparison method, gcPCA provides a valuable resource facilitating the analysis of diverse high-dimensional datasets to gain new insights into complex biological phenomena.
B cell receptor ( BCR ) signaling plays a crucial role in the survival and maturation of B cells and is deregulated in B cell lymphomas. However, little is known about the crosstalk of downstream effector pathways. Here, we modelled BCR signaling in Burkitt lymphoma ( BL ) cells using systematically perturbed phosphorylation data of BL-2 and BL-41 cells. The models unveiled feedback and crosstalk structures in the BCR signaling network, including a negative crosstalk from p38 to MEK/ERK. The relevance of the crosstalk was verified for BCR and CD40 signaling in different BL cells and confirmed by global phosphoproteomics on ERK itself and known ERK target sites. The trained network for BL-2 cells was better transferable to BL-41 cells, and the BL-2 network was also suited to model BCR signaling in Diffuse large B cell lymphoma cells lines with aberrant BCR signaling.
Angiogenic sprouting, the process by which new blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels, is tightly regulated by the Notch receptor signalling network. Notch signalling is controlled by two principal mechanisms: intercellular transactivation and intracellular cis inhibition. In this study, we explore the opposing actions of the Notch ligands DLL4 and JAG1, which control angiogenic sprouting. Through a combination of experimental approaches and mathematical modelling, we provide evidence that two mechanisms could underpin this process: 1 ) DLL4 rather than JAG1 induces efficient Notch1 receptor transactivation; 2 ) JAG1 directly blocks DLL4-dependent cis-inhibition of Notch signalling through the formation of a JAG1/DLL4 complex. We propose a new model of Notch signalling that recapitulates the formation of tip and stalk cells, which is necessary for sprouting angiogenesis. Our data argue that a heteromeric JAG1/DLL4 complex, formed when the ligands are expressed in the same cell, relieves Notch1 receptor cis inhibition and thereby enables efficient Notch1 receptor signalling. We further propose a new theoretical model of DLL4/JAG1-Notch-VEGF signalling that incorporates the novel finding that JAG1 directly antagonizes the function of DLL4 through the formation of heteromeric DLL4-JAG1 complexes, which could underlie the observed opposing effects of JAG1 and DLL4 in sprouting angiogenesis.
We present Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty ( DPMUnc ), an extension of a Bayesian nonparametric clustering algorithm that makes use of the uncertainty associated with data points. We show that DPMUnc out-performs existing methods on simulated data. We apply DPMUnc to cluster immune-mediated diseases ( IMD ) using GWAS summary statistics, which have uncertainty linked with the sample size of the study. DPMUnc separates autoimmune from autoinflammatory diseases and isolates other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. We also consider how DPMUnc can be used to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarised using gene signatures. We introduce a novel procedure for generating a summary of a gene signature on a dataset different to the one where it was discovered, which incorporates a measure of the variability in expression across signature genes within each individual. We summarise three public gene expression datasets containing patients with a range of IMD, using three relevant gene signatures. We find association between disease and the clusters returned by DPMUnc, with clustering structure replicated across the datasets.
Deep neural networks have been successful models of the primate visual system, but they fail to account for the strong shape-dependence of primate vision. While humans rely heavily on shape to make judgements of category membership, deep networks rely more strongly on other features such as color and texture. We designed artificial image datasets in which shape, color, and texture features can be used to predict the image class. By training networks from scratch to classify images with single features and feature combinations, we show that some network architectures are unable to learn to use shape features, whereas others are able to use shape in principle but are biased towards the other features. We show that the bias can be explained by the interactions between the weight updates for many images in mini-batch gradient descent. This suggests that different learning algorithms with sparser, more local weight changes are required to make networks more sensitive to shape and improve their capability to describe human vision.
Hepatic stellate cells ( HSCs ) are the main source of extracellular matrix ( ECM ) during liver fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver functions in chronic liver diseases. We developed rule-based models to study HSC dynamics during fibrosis progression and reversion using the Kappa graph rewriting language. We modeled HSCs as agents that present seven physiological cellular states and interact with transforming growth factor β 1 ( TGFβ1 ) molecules, which regulate HSC activation and type I collagen secretion. Simulation studies revealed the critical role of HSC inactivation during fibrosis progression and reversion. While inactivation allows elimination of activated HSCs during reversion steps, reactivation loops of inactivated HSCs ( iHSCs ) are required to sustain fibrosis. We demonstrated the model’s sensitivity to TGFβ1 parameters and validated the predicted ECM dynamics using experimental data from a mouse model of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis. Our model also predicts the accumulation of iHSCs during chronic liver disease. By analyzing RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associated with liver fibrosis, we confirmed this accumulation, identifying iHSCs as novel markers of fibrosis progression.
We have developed a novel meta-analysis framework to estimate the total mediation effect of high-dimensional omics mediators in the presence of inter-study heterogeneity. This framework is particularly useful for large-scale genomic consortia, such as the Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine ( TOPMed ) program, which comprises multiple cohorts with diverse technologies to elucidate the genetic architecture and biological mechanisms underlying complex human traits and diseases. Our method leverages the recently established asymptotic standard error of the R-squared ( R2 ) -based mediation effect estimation for high-dimensional omics mediators and requires only summary statistics. We have shown that our method is more computationally efficient and yields satisfactory operating characteristics comparable to analysis of the pooled individual-level data when there is no inter-study heterogeneity. We applied our method to 5 TOPMed studies with over 5800 participants to estimate the mediation effects of gene expression on age-related variation in systolic blood pressure and sex-related variation in high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol. Our method can uniquely evaluate and account for potential effect heterogeneity across studies due to, for example, varying genomic profiling platforms. The proposed method is available in R package MetaR2M on GitHub.
Cancer development is driven by a small number of driver genetic mutations that confer a selective growth advantage to the cell, while most passenger mutations do not contribute to tumor progression. The identification of these driver genes is a crucial step in designing effective cancer treatments. However, most existing computational methods only provide a single driver gene list for the entire cohort of patients, ignoring the high heterogeneity of driver events across patients. Here, we propose a novel method, PDRWH, which aims to prioritize the mutated genes of a single patient based on their impact on the abnormal expression of downstream genes across a group of patients who share the co-mutation genes and similar gene expression profiles. Our results on 16 cancer datasets from TCGA showed that PDRWH excels in identifying known general driver genes and tumor-specific drivers. In comparative testing across five cancer types, PDRWH outperformed existing individual-level methods as well as cohort-level methods. Our results also demonstrated that PDRWH could identify both common and rare drivers.
The Virtual Epileptic Patient ( VEP ) is a computer-based representation of a patient with epilepsy that combines personalized anatomical data with dynamical models of abnormal brain activities. The VEP is capable of generating spatio-temporal seizure patterns that resemble those recorded with invasive methods such as stereoelectro EEG data, allowing for the evaluation of clinical hypotheses before planning surgery. This study highlights the effectiveness of calibrating VEP models using a global optimization approach. The approach utilizes SaCeSS, a cooperative metaheuristic algorithm capable of parallel computation, to yield high-quality solutions without requiring excessive computational time. Through extensive benchmarking on synthetic data, our proposal successfully solved a set of different configurations of VEP models, demonstrating better scalability and superior performance against other parallel solvers. These results were further enhanced using a Bayesian optimization framework for hyperparameter tuning, with significant gains in terms of both accuracy and computational cost. Additionally, we added a scalable uncertainty quantification phase after model calibration, and used it to assess the variability in estimated parameters across different problems. Overall, this study has the potential to improve the estimation of pathological brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, thereby to inform the clinical decision-making process.
Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ), is a major global health problem with 10. 6 million cases and 1. 6 million deaths in 2021. We investigated the dynamics of Mtb growth in the lungs of rabbits infected with a virulent clinical isolate, HN878, carrying an unstable plasmid pBP10. In vitro experiments showed that pBP10 is more stable in HN878 than in a commonly used laboratory strain, H37Rv. However, the kinetics of plasmid-bearing bacteria in rabbit lungs did not follow an expected monotonic decline. Instead, the percent of plasmid-bearing cells increased between 28 and 56 days post-infection and remained stable between 84 and 112 days post-infection, despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late time points. Mathematical modeling suggested that this non-monotonic change can be explained by the presence of multiple sub-populations of Mtb with different replication/death kinetics. One sub-population expands early and is controlled/eliminated, while another sub-population expands at later times, causing a counterintuitive increase in the percent of plasmid-bearing cells. Importantly, a model with one kinetically homogeneous Mtb population could not explain the data, even when run stochastically.
Glycans and glycoproteins play important roles in biological functions, but experimental structure determination of sugar polymers is notoriously difficult. Computational approaches can aid in carbohydrate structure prediction, structure determination, and design. Here, we present GlycanTreeModeler, a glycan-modeling algorithm that computationally builds glycans layer-by-layer using adaptive kernel density estimates ( KDE ) of common glycan conformations derived from data in the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) and from quantum mechanics ( QM ) calculations. We benchmarked GlycanTreeModeler on a test set of glycan structures of varying lengths, or “trees”, and found that structures predicted by GlycanTreeModeler agreed with native structures at high accuracy for both de novo modeling and experimental density-guided building. We employed GlycanTreeModeler to design de novo glycan trees into a protein nanoparticle vaccine to shield regions of the scaffold from antibody recognition, and experimentally verified shielding. This work will inform glycoprotein model prediction, glycan masking, and further aid computational methods in experimental structure determination and refinement.
Ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF ( Skp1-Cullin-F-box ) complexes play a crucial role in regulating protein quality by coupling ubiquitination with proteasomal degradation. In this study, we identified a ubiquitin ligase-substrate pair, SCFFbx23-Ace1, in the filamentous fungus Penicillium oxalicum. The F-box protein, PoFbx23, recognizes and activates the transcription factor, PoAce1, within the nucleus. PoAce1 is a ubiquitinated protein that negatively regulates the expression of ( hemi ) cellulase genes in P. oxalicum. Unexpectedly, deletion of the Pofbx23 gene resulted in the upregulation of ( hemi ) cellulase genes, suggesting that PoFbx23 acts as a transcriptional coactivator of PoAce1. PoFbx23 recognizes and activates PoAce1, allowing it to regulate the transcription of target genes with different effects under different signals. PoAce1 exists as a full-length version and several low-molecular-weight degraded versions when PoFbx23 is present. Deleting the Pofbx23 gene results in the accumulation of all versions of the PoAce1 protein, which is a dysfunctional form that no longer binds promoters of target genes.
Drosophila melanogaster follicular epithelium relies on a basement membrane ( BM ) composed of oriented BM fibrils and a more homogenous matrix. Here, we determined the specific molecular identity and cell exit sites of BM protein secretory routes. We found that Rab10 and Rab8 define two parallel routes for BM protein secretion. Rab10 promotes lateral and planar-polarized secretion, whereas Rab8 promotes basal secretion, leading to the formation of BM fibrils and homogenous BM, respectively. We also found that the dystrophin-associated protein complex ( DAPC ) and Rab10 are both present in a planar-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins. DAPC is essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards the Rab10 route. Moreover, we identified a dual function for the exocyst complex in this context. First, the Exo70 subunit directly interacts with dystrophin to limit its planar polarization. Second, the exocyst complex is also required for the Rab8 route. Altogether, these results highlight important mechanistic aspects of BM protein secretion and illustrate how BM diversity can emerge from the spatial control of distinct traffic routes. We propose the co-existence of parallel secretory routes orchestrated by these Rab proteins with different cell exit sites defined by cell polarity axes as the basic mechanism to explain BM diversification during development.
The ability to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies ( bnAbs ) is crucial for increasing the therapeutic benefits of bnAb therapy. Machine learning is a powerful approach for such prediction, but it is challenged by the underrepresentation of some HIV-1 subtypes in available training datasets and the need to determine optimal combinations of bnAbs to avoid resistance to a single bnAb. Recently, machine learning models trained using resistance outcomes for multiple antibodies at once, a strategy called multi-task learning ( MTL ), have been shown to improve predictions. Here, we develop a new model, named a language-based universal model ( LBUM ), which uses MTL to predict the neutralization of different HIV-1 Env sequences by different bnAbs. The LBUM was pretrained using Env sequences with no associated neutralization data and fine-tuned with Env sequences with both non-bnAb and bnAb outcome data. We show that MTL can mitigate bias against underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes and allow the model to learn patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, thus providing tools to predict antibodies’ epitopes and to potentially select optimal bnAb combinations. Our model outperforms classical machine learning algorithms, such as random forests and gradient boosting machines, in predicting HIV-1 resistance to 33 bnAbs.
Multiple myeloma ( MM ) is a hematological disease characterized by aberrant clonal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. The effects of treatments for MM vary between patients, highlighting the importance of developing prognostic models for informed therapeutic decision-making. Most previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that the dysfunction of the pathway is closely associated with disease development and progression. In the present study, we constructed predictive models by taking pathway information into consideration using two strategies: pathway score method and group lasso. We considered three methods for pathway score calculation ( ssGSEA, GSVA, and z-scores ) and 14 data sources providing pathway information. We implemented these methods in microarray data for MM ( GSE136324 ) and obtained a candidate model with the best prediction performance in interval validation. Our results showed that group lasso incorporating Vax pathway information ( Vax ( grp ) ) was more competitive in prediction than the gene model in both internal and external validation. Vax ( grp ) also outperformed the previously published models. Moreover, the new model was more resistant to missing values, and the presence of missing values ( <5% ) would not evidently deteriorate its prediction accuracy using our missing data imputation method.
Mitochondrial fission, the process by which a mitochondrion divides into two daughter organelles, plays a critical role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. However, mitochondrial hyperfission is associated with reduced energy production and programmed cell death. Thus, there is a need to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial fission. Here, we develop a nonlinear dynamical systems model of Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fission and use it to identify parameters which can regulate the total fission rate ( TFR ) as a function of time. The TFR, defined from a nondimensionalization of the model, undergoes a Hopf bifurcation with bifurcation parameter μ = k + M k−, where M is the total concentration of mitochondrial fission factor ( Mff ) and k+ and k− are the association and dissociation rate constants between oligomers on the outer mitochondrial membrane. We found that the cumulative total fission ( TF ), which is the total number of fission events over a set time period, depends strongly on only one dimensionless parameter, μ. Interestingly, the cumulative TF does not monotonically increase as μ increases. Instead, it increases with μ to a certain point and then begins to decrease as μ continues to increase. This non-monotone dependence on μ suggests that interventions targeting k+, k−, or M may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission mechanism. Thus, understanding the impact of regulatory parameters, such as μ, may assist future therapeutic target selection.
CRISPR-based gene drives offer a promising tool for controlling disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. However, a significant challenge for successful suppression-type drives is the rapid evolution of resistance alleles. To mitigate this, we constructed a 3-gRNA homing gene drive system targeting the recessive female fertility gene Tyrosine decarboxylase 2 ( Tdc2 ) in Drosophila suzukii, a notorious fruit pest. Our results showed only a low level of homing in the germline, but feeding octopamine restored the egg-laying defects in Tdc2 mutant females, allowing easier line maintenance than for other suppression drive targets. We tested the effectiveness of a similar system in Drosophila melanogaster and constructed additional split drive systems by introducing promoter-Cas9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. Our findings show that genetic polymorphisms in wild populations may limit the spread of gene drive alleles, and the position effect profoundly influences Cas9 activity. Furthermore, this study highlights the potential of conditionally rescuing the female infertility caused by the gene drive, offering a valuable tool for the industrial-scale production of gene drive transgenic insects.
The brain is not only constrained by the energy needed to fuel computation, but also by the energy needed to form memories. Experiments have shown that even simple learning tasks require a significant metabolic cost, and learning a task like MNIST to 95% accuracy requires at least 108 synaptic updates. Therefore, it is likely that the brain has evolved to be able to learn using as little energy as possible. We explored the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks using a parsimonious energy model. We propose two plasticity restricting algorithms that save energy: 1 ) only modifying synapses with large updates, and 2 ) restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. We find that competitively restricting plasticity helps to save metabolic energy associated with synaptic plasticity. Our results might lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a better match between artificial and biological learning. Moreover, the algorithms might benefit hardware because electronic memory storage is also energetically costly.
In this study, we investigated how and to what extent laboratory evolution can overcome fitness defects in reduced-genome strains of the bacterium Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx. We examined six variants of ADP1-ISx that each had a deletion of a different 22- to 42-kilobase region and two strains with larger deletions of 70 and 293 kilobases. We evolved replicate populations of ADP1-ISx and each deletion strain for ~300 generations in a chemically defined minimal medium or a complex medium and sequenced the genomes of endpoint clonal isolates. Fitness increased in all cases that were examined except for two ancestors that each failed to improve in one of the two environments. Mutations affecting nine protein-coding genes and two small RNAs were significantly associated with one of the two environments or with certain deletion ancestors. The global post-transcriptional regulators rnd, csrA, and hfq were frequently mutated across all strains, though the incidence and effects of these mutations on gene function and bacterial fitness varied with the ancestral deletion and evolution environment. Mutations in this regulatory network likely compensate for how an earlier deletion of a transposon in the ADP1-ISx ancestor of all the deletion strains restored csrA function. Our results demonstrate that fitness lost during genome streamlining can usually be regained rapidly through laboratory evolution and that recovery tends to occur through a combination of deletion-specific compensation and global regulatory adjustments.
Here, we report the development of a self-cleaving ribozyme-based tool to control mRNA levels of endogenous targets in zebrafish. The T3H48 self-cleaving ribozyme was shown to induce rapid pre-mRNA cleavage, with up to 20-fold reduction in expression, and displayed superior activity compared with other ribozymes. We then inserted the T3H48 ribozyme in the second intron of the albino gene using a CRISPR/Cas9 strategy and observed a pigmentation phenotype similar to that in the mutant. Using a base-editing strategy to inactivate the ribozyme, we showed that this phenotype is reversible, illustrating the specificity of the approach. Furthermore, we generated a Flippase- and Cre-activatable version of the T3H48 ribozyme, called RiboFlip, to control the mRNA levels of the albino gene. RiboFlip activation induced mRNA knockdown and also recapitulated the albino mutant phenotype. In addition, we show that a Cre- and Dre-controllable Gal4/UAS reporter in the RiboFlip cassette can label knocked-down cells independently of the expression of the target gene. Altogether, we introduce the RiboFlip cassette as a flexible tool to control endogenous gene expression in a vertebrate model and as an alternative to existing conditional knockdown strategies.
Segmentation of cellular structures in microscopic images is an essential step in quantifying cellular features. However, this process typically requires fluorescent labeling of cells, which can be time consuming and expensive. Here, we introduce aiSEGcell, a user-friendly software that can segment nuclei and cells in bright field ( BF ) images without the need for fluorescent labeling. aiSEGcell is based on convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ) that can detect cellular structures in transmitted light images. We extensively evaluated aiSEGcell for nucleus segmentation in different primary cell types in 2D cultures from different imaging modalities in hand-curated published and novel imaging data sets. We provide a curated ground-truth data set with 1. 1 million nuclei in 20, 000 images. aiSEGcell accurately segments nuclei from even challenging BF images, similar to manual segmentation, and retains biologically relevant information. Importantly, aiSEGcell is readily adaptable to new use cases with only 32 images required for retraining. The software is accessible through both a command line interface and a graphical user interface, and does not require user expert coding experience.
In two experiments and one preregistered replication, 295 human participants were asked to learn the rewards of two-dimensional bandits when either a slowly or quickly changing feature of the bandit predicted reward. We found that participants accrued more reward when a bandit’s relevant feature changed slowly, and its irrelevant feature quickly, as compared to the opposite. The results indicate that participants learned the value of stimuli faster when the reward-predictive feature changed slowly and the irrelevant feature changed quickly, compared to when the opposite was the case. After learning, participants could generalise the learned values to new stimuli equally well in both conditions. By comparing models with different structures for the learning rates, we showed that participants adjusted their learning to the speed of the features. We found that participants had a higher learning rate for the slow feature, and adjusted their learning to both the relevance and the speed of feature changes. The larger the improvement in participants’ performance for slow compared to fast bandits, the more strongly they adjusted their learning rates. These results provide evidence that human reinforcement learning favours slower features, suggesting a bias in how humans approach reward learning.
Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in most solid tumors, including ER-negative breast cancer, which has the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes. Using a mouse systems genetics approach, we previously identified 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility. Here, we extend those studies to identify Resf1, a poorly characterized gene, as a novel metastasis susceptibility gene in ER- breast cancer. Resf1 is a large, unstructured protein with an evolutionarily conserved intron-exon structure, but with poor amino acid conservation. Using CRISPR or gene trap mouse models crossed to the Polyoma Middle-T antigen genetically engineered mouse model ( MMTV-PyMT ), we demonstrated that reduction of Resf1 resulted in a significant increase in tumor growth, a shortened overall survival time, and increased incidence and number of lung metastases, consistent with patient data. Furthermore, an analysis of matched tail and primary tissues revealed loss of the wildtype copy in tumor tissue, consistent with Resf1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed a potential role of Resf1 in transcriptional control through association with compound G4 quadruplexes in expressed sequences, particularly those associated with ribosomal biogenesis. These results suggest that loss of Resf1 enhances tumor progression in ER- breast cancer through multiple alterations in both transcriptional and translational control.
Meiotic DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ) are formed by the topoisomerase-like enzyme Spo11 and activate the DNA damage response ( DDR ) kinase Mec1ATR via the checkpoint clamp loader, Rad24RAD17. Here, we examine the genome-wide roles of Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination by mapping meiotic progeny in rad24Δ and mec1-mn ( ’meiotic null’ ) backgrounds. In line with previous studies, we observe severely impacted spore viability and a reduction in recombination upon deletion of RAD24, driven by a shortened prophase. By contrast, loss of Mec1 function increases recombination frequency, consistent with its role in DSB trans-interference, and has less effect on spore viability. Despite these differences, complex multi-chromatid events initiated by closely spaced DSBs occur more frequently in the absence of either Rad24 or Mec1, suggesting a loss of spatial regulation at the level of DSB formation in both. Mec1 and Rad24 also have important roles in the spatial regulation of crossovers ( COs ). Upon loss of either Mec1 or Rad24, CO distributions become more random—suggesting reductions in the global manifestation of interference. Our results highlight separable roles for Rad24 as a pro-CO factor, and for Mec1 as a regulator of recombination frequency, the loss of which helps to suppress any broader defects in CO regulation caused by abrogation of the DDR.
Pneumocystis jirovecii is a deadly fungal pathogen that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. Despite its major impact on human health, limited progress has been made in dissecting the pathobiology of this fungus due to the inability to culture it in vitro. To address this major bottleneck in Pneumocystis research, we have developed a comprehensive in silico genome-scale metabolic model of Pneumocystis growth and metabolism. This model identifies metabolic requirements and imbalances that hinder growth in vitro and offers insights into the biology of Pneumocystis. The model was developed using recently published genome data and available information in the literature, as well as bioinformatics and software tools. We employed relaxed Flux Balance Analysis and Reinforcement Learning approaches to make predictions regarding metabolic fluxes and to identify critical components of the Pneumocystis growth medium. Our findings provide a novel strategy to overcome the longstanding challenge of culturing this pathogen in vitro.
YAP/TAZ is a transcriptional coactivator that regulates cell proliferation. At low cell density, YAP/TAZ is localized in the nucleus and promotes cell proliferation. However, at high cell density, the Hippo pathway is activated, leading to YAP/TAZ translocation into the cytoplasm and cell cycle arrest. Cancer cells have higher levels of YAP/TAZ than normal cells, but it is unclear whether this increase alone is sufficient to overcome contact inhibition. To investigate this, we constructed a 3D mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-YAP/TAZ pathway and cell-cell interactions. The model simulates cell proliferation as the output response to cell density and YAP/TAZ levels. We performed simulations at various YAP/TAZ levels to investigate the extent of YAP/TAZ increase required for sustained proliferation at high density. The results show that a twofold increase in YAP/TAZ levels in cancer cells is sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest compared to normal cells, enabling cells to continue proliferating even under high-density conditions. This model may be applicable for evaluating cancer malignancy based on YAP/TAZ levels, developing drugs to suppress the abnormal proliferation of cancer cells, and determining appropriate drug dosages.
Many eukaryotic proteins and RNAs contain low-complexity domains ( LCDs ) with a strong propensity for binding and driving phase separation into biomolecular condensates. Mutations in LCDs frequently disrupt condensate dynamics, resulting in pathological transitions to solid-like states. To understand how the molecular sequence grammar of LCDs governs condensate dynamics, we present an energy landscape framework that operates on a continuous ‘stickiness’ energy scale rather than relying on an explicit alphabet-based sequence. We characterize sequences by Wasserstein distance relative to thoroughly shuffled or random counterparts. Armed with this framework, we map diagrams of material and dynamical properties governed by key energy landscape features modulated by the degree of complexity in LCD arrangements, including the periodicity and local disorder in LCDs. We find that highly periodic LCD patterns promote elasticity-dominated behavior, while random sequences exhibit viscosity-dominated properties. Our results reveal that minimum sticker periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluidity in condensates, thereby avoiding transitions to glassy or solid-like states. Moreover, we demonstrate that the energy landscape framework explains recent experimental findings on prion domains and predicts systematic alterations in condensate viscoelasticity.
The development of ectodermal organs begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that progressively invaginates into the underlying mesenchyme as the organ takes its shape. In the mouse dentition, we show that non-muscle myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination. Myosin II functions by promoting cell-cell adhesion and persistent convergent cell movements in the suprabasal layer. Shh signaling controls these processes by inducing myosin II activation via AKT. Pharmacological induction of AKT and myosin II can also rescue defects caused by the inhibition of Shh. Our results support a model in which the Shh signal is transmitted through myosin II to power effective cellular rearrangement for proper dental epithelial invagination. In the mouse molar placode, Shh is required for the narrowing of the dental epithelium at the neck region and for proper invagination. We show that Shh signaling does so in part through promotion of MyoII activity. The Shh-PI3K/AKT-MyoII axis thus promotes proper cell-cell adhesion and cell movement to propel incisor invagination.
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell chromatin accessibility sequencing (scATAC-seq) are powerful tools for understanding complex biological mechanisms. However, current methods for transferring labels from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq have limited performance due to their inability to preserve fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic or extrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. Here, we present scTGCN, a robust deep transfer model based on graph convolutional networks, which achieves versatile performance in preserving biological variation and integrating hundreds of thousands of cells in minutes with low memory consumption. We show that scTGCN is powerful in integrating mouse atlas data and multimodal data generated from APSA-seq and CITE-seq, and achieves high label transfer accuracy and effective knowledge transfer across different modalities. scTGCN regards the label transfer from scRNA-seq to scATAC-seq as a domain adaptation problem in transfer learning, and uses an efficient multistage transfer learning strategy to integrate gene expression and chromatin accessibility data into a unified multi-omics mouse cell atlas. We explore the idea of MK-MMD-based adaptation for learning transferable features in common embedding of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, and provide evidence that scTGCN can accurately transfer cell type annotations across datasets from different tissues, species, and molecular layers, such as scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq.
Proteins with nuclear localization sequences ( NLSs ) are directed into the cell nucleus through interactions between the NLS and importin proteins. NLSs are generally short motifs rich in basic amino acids; however, identifying NLSs can be challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence. In this study, we characterized the sequence specificity of an essential and conserved NLS in Mcm3, a subunit of the replicative DNA helicase. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 ( AF3 ) modeling, we demonstrate that the precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mcm3 through optimal interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mcm3, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the MCM complex and poor cell growth. Our results provide a structure-guided framework for predicting and analyzing monopartite NLSs, which, despite lacking a single consensus sequence, retain key characteristics shared between the NLSs of Mcm3 and the SV40 large T antigen. Further characterization of Mcm3’s NLS will not only help elucidate its cell cycle dependent nuclear import and subsequent loading, but also refine predictions of other putative NLSs that may exist in many nuclear proteins.
Spinocerebellar ataxia type II ( SCA2 ), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) and Parkinsonism are neurodegenerative diseases associated with mutations in the ataxin-2 ( ATXN2 ) gene. ATXN2 encodes a protein that functions in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability, and the assembly of mRNP-granules, a process mediated by intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ). The LSm ( Like-Sm ) domain of ATXN2 can stimulate mRNA translation and antagonize mRNP-granule assembly. Here, we show that the PAM2 motif of ATXN2, which interacts with polyA-binding protein ( PABP ), is a major determinant of the mRNA and protein content of ATXN2 mRNP granules. In Drosophila, the PAM2 motif is required to efficiently recruit ATXN2-target mRNAs and specific protein components into ATXN2 granules, but is not essential for granule assembly. In contrast, the LSm-domain of ATXN2 may protect against neurodegeneration, while structured PAM2- and unstructured IDR- interactions both contribute to ATXN2-induced cytotoxicity.
Muscle stem cells ( MuSCs ) in the extraocular muscles ( EOMs ) are distinct from those in limb muscles. We show that Pitx2 is dispensable for specification and maintenance of the MuSC pool in EOMs, despite being a major upstream regulator during early development. In contrast, Pax7 is required for MuSC maintenance in EOMs. We propose a relay between Pitx2, Myf5, and Pax7 for EOM stem cell maintenance. MuSCs in EOMs adopt a quiescent state earlier than those in limb muscles and do not spontaneously proliferate in the adult. Despite this, EOMs have a higher content of Pax7+ MuSCs per area pre- and post-natally. In the mdx mouse model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, significantly fewer MuSCs were present in the EOMs of mdx mice compared to controls, and they were not proliferative. Our study provides a comprehensive in vivo characterisation of MuSC heterogeneity along the body axis and brings further insights into the unusual sparing of EOMs during muscular dystrophy.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 ) continues to evolve, with several variants of concern ( VOCs ) and variants of interest ( VOIs ) identified since late 2020. These variants exhibit distinct levels of virulence, antigenicity, and infectivity, necessitating specific defense and control measures. In this study, we propose an SI1…InR infectious disease model to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among the human population. We combine the proposed epidemic model with physical information neural networks ( PINNs ) to develop a novel mechanism called VOCs-informed neural network ( VOCs-INN ). The VOCs-INN algorithm integrates epidemiological data, deep learning, and epidemiological models to estimate the transmission intensity of various COVID-19 strains during the pandemic. It emphasizes learning underlying patterns in multivariate data to improve model optimization and achieve accurate fitting. Our experiments demonstrate that VOCs-INN can accurately fit the reported data of the British Columbia province and its five internal health agencies in Canada, as well as simulate observed or unobserved dynamics, infer time-dependent parameters, and enable short-term predictions. Furthermore, VOCs-INN performs well in fitting and forecasting when analyzing long-term or multi-wave data.
CytoSummaryNet is a Deep Sets-based approach that improves mechanism of action prediction by 30–68% in mean average precision compared to average profiling on a public dataset. The model uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple-instance learning framework to provide an easier-to-apply method for aggregating single-cell feature data than previously published strategies. CytoSummaryNet learns an aggregation strategy by receiving single-cell morphological feature input data and providing the aggregated profile as an output. The model achieves this improvement by downweighting small mitotic cells or those with debris and prioritizing large uncrowded cells. CytoSummaryNet requires only perturbation labels for training, which are readily available in all cell profiling datasets. The approach offers a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost retrieval performance on image-based profiling datasets. CytoSummaryNet provides an easier-to-apply and better-performing method for aggregating single-cell image feature data compared to previously published strategies and the average profiling baseline.
In this study, we propose a novel framework to associate cognitive effort during task performance with electroencephalography ( EEG ) activation patterns. The framework relies on the identification of discrete dynamical states ( EEG microstates ) and optimal transport theory. We apply this framework to a dataset collected during a spatial version of the Stroop task, a cognitive test that requires participants to respond to one aspect of a stimulus while ignoring another, often conflicting, aspect. Our findings reveal an increased cost linked to cognitive effort, thus confirming the framework’s effectiveness in capturing and quantifying cognitive transitions. This is the first application of such a framework to EEG data, providing a computational pipeline to quantify cognitive demand in EEG experiments. Our results highlight the value of characterizing brain dynamics and transition costs in understanding cognitive processes and offer insights into the relationship between neural activity patterns, cognitive effort, and behavioral performance.
Infections with Plasmodium vivax elicit the development of atypical memory B cells ( aMBCs ), which persist through the recovery phase of infections. Here, we demonstrate that P. vivax Duffy Binding Protein II ( PvDBPII ) -specific aMBCs are elicited during malaria illness and are capable of producing neutralizing antibodies. We generated PvDBPII probes to detect the development and durability of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs, and to demonstrate their capacity to produce neutralizing antibodies following natural infections. PvDBPII-specific aMBCs were elicited during malaria illness, and they persisted through the recovery phase of infections. To address the biology and function of P. vivax-specific aMBCs in producing protective antibodies, a single MBC was cultured, and the secreted IgG was tested for binding and inhibition activity. The aMBC-derived clones produced antibodies with variable levels of anti-PvDBPII IgG in cultures, and some produced high antibody levels comparable to classical MBC clones. Among the aMBC clones, A1F12 and B4E11 produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against a panel of PvDBPII variants. Notably, B cell receptors ( BCRs ) of PvDBPII-specific aMBCs expressed unique IGHV genes, with similar usage of IGHV1-3, comparable to classical MBCs. Our findings highlight a protective role of aMBCs in humoral immune response to malaria by differentiating into antibody-secreting cells for producing broadly neutralizing antibodies against P. vivax invasion into human erythrocytes.
We introduce mr. mash-rss, an extension of the mr. mash model that enables polygenic prediction of complex trait phenotypes using only summary statistics from Genome-Wide Association Studies ( GWAS ) and linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) estimates from a reference panel. Unlike mr. mash, which requires individual-level data, mr. mash-rss is computationally efficient and scalable to biobank-size data. Through simulations, we show that mr. mash-rss is competitive with, and often outperforms, current state-of-the-art methods for single- and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in a variety of scenarios that differ in the pattern of effect sharing across phenotypes, the number of phenotypes, the number of causal variants, and the genomic heritability. We also present a real data analysis of 16 blood cell phenotypes in the UK Biobank, showing that mr. mash-rss achieves higher prediction accuracy than competing methods for the majority of traits, especially when the data set has smaller sample size.
In this study, we propose a novel modelling framework that integrates the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of susceptible individuals into homogeneous models. We introduce a continuous recruitment process for the susceptibles and approximate the recruitment rate using a neural network to develop a Universal Differential Equations ( UDE ) model. We also pre-set a specific form for the recruitment rate and develop a mechanistic model. Using data from a COVID-19 Omicron variant outbreak in Shanghai, we train the UDE model using deep learning methods and calibrate the mechanistic model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) methods. We project the attack rate and peak of new infections for the first Omicron wave in China after the adjustment of the dynamic zero-COVID policy. Our projections indicate an attack rate and a peak of new infections of 80. 06% and 3. 17% of the population, respectively, compared with the homogeneous model’s projections of 99. 97% and 32. 78%. Our simulations demonstrate that heterogeneity in the susceptibles decreases herd immunity for ~37. 36% of the population and prolongs the outbreak period from ~30 days to ~70 days.
Synapses in the brain are highly noisy, which leads to a large trial-by-trial variability. Here, we propose that synapses use noise to represent uncertainties about the somatic activity of the postsynaptic neuron. We developed a mathematical framework in which the synapse as a whole interacts with the soma of the postsynaptic neuron in a similar way to an agent that is situated and behaves in an uncertain, dynamic environment. This framework suggests that synapses use an implicit internal model of the somatic membrane dynamics that is being updated by a synaptic learning rule, which resembles experimentally well-established LTP/LTD mechanisms. We show that the emergent dynamics of many synapses in a neuronal network can resolve different learning problems such as pattern classification or closed-loop control in a dynamic environment. We further show that synapses can exploit noisy synaptic transmission to encode their uncertainty about the somatic membrane potential of the postsynaptic neuron. This enables a neuronal network to encode and utilize uncertainties on the network level in behaviorally ambiguous situations.
Single-cell DNA sequencing technologies enable detailed analyses of development and cell differentiation. We present Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method that uses bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Scuphr is designed to address common challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. The method computes the distance between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. With its embarrassingly parallel design, Scuphr can perform faster analysis than the state-of-the-art methods while obtaining better accuracy. We investigate the method’s robustness using various synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells with a known lineage tree topology.
Malawi is a low-income country with limited health system capacity. To improve population health outcomes, health benefits packages ( HBPs ) are used to determine which services the public healthcare system should include in its provision. However, analytic approaches used to weigh evidence in support of different interventions and inform the broader HBP deliberative process have limitations. We propose the individual-based Thanzi La Onse ( TLO ) model as a tool to assist in the evaluation of Malawi-specific HBPs. The TLO model mechanistically models and calibrates the incidence of disease, health-seeking behaviour, and the capacity of the healthcare system to meet the demand for care under realistic constraints on human resources for health. We used the TLO model to simulate the health gains achievable under a number of plausible HBP strategies for Malawi. We found that the HBP emerging from a linear constrained optimisation analysis ( LCOA ) achieved the largest health gain—∼8% reduction in disability adjusted life years ( DALYs ) between 2023 and 2042 compared to the benchmark scenario—by concentrating resources on high-impact treatments. However, this HBP incurred a relative excess in DALYs in the first few years of its implementation. We also assessed other feasible approaches to prioritisation, including service prioritisation based on patient characteristics, rather than service type. This approach achieved consistent health gains relative to the benchmark scenario on a year-to-year basis, and a 5% reduction in DALYs over the whole period.
Meiotic chromosome dynamics in the holocentric pantry moth, Plodia interpunctella, and the silkworm moth, Bombyx mori, were investigated using the Oligopaint DNA FISH technology. We found that meiotic homolog pairing in both species is initiated at gene-rich chromosome ends, suggesting that this mechanism may be broadly conserved in Lepidopteran insects. In addition, both species form rod-shaped cruciform-like bivalents at metaphase I. However, unlike Bombyx, Plodia can orient bivalents in multiple different ways at metaphase I. We found that kinetochores consistently assemble at non-telomeric loci toward the center of chromosomes in both species, regardless of where chromosome centers are located in the bivalent. Sister kinetochores do not seem to be paired in these species, and instead, four distinct kinetochores are easily observed at metaphase I. Despite this, we found clear end-on microtubule attachments and not lateral microtubule attachments co-orienting these separated kinetochores. These findings challenge the classical view of segregation where paired, poleward-facing kinetochores are required for accurate homolog separation in meiosis I.
The median eminence ( ME ), located at the base of the hypothalamus, plays a crucial role in the exchange of information between the brain and the pituitary. Mutations and duplications affecting the transcription factor SOX3/Sox3 result in hypopituitarism, which is likely of hypothalamic origin. Here, we show that the absence of Sox3 predominantly affects the ME with phenotypes that first occur in juvenile animals, despite the embryonic onset of SOX3 expression. In the pituitary, reduction in hormone levels correlates with a lack of endocrine cell maturation. In parallel, ME NG2-glia renewal and oligodendrocytic differentiation potential are affected. We further show that low-dose aspirin treatment, which is known to affect NG2-glia, or changes in gut microbiota, rescue both proliferative defects and hypopituitarism in Sox3 mutants. Our study highlights a central role of NG2-glia for ME function during a transitional period of post-natal development and indicates their sensitivity to extrinsic signals. We propose that sufficient numbers of NG2-glia are required in the ME to support pituitary cell maturation as the animal becomes independent at weaning.
CED-5/CED-12 is a two-component guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) known to activate CED-10/Rac1 during corpse engulfment and larval Distal Tip Cell (DTC) migration in Caenorhabditis elegans. However, we show that CED-5/CED-12 is also involved in embryonic epidermal cell migrations, and that loss of CED-5/CED-12 leads to embryonic lethality due to failed epidermal cell migrations. Surprisingly, CED-5/CED-12 inhibits F-actin in the migrating epidermis, which is opposite of what was expected for a CED-10 GEF. To address this paradox, we investigated if CED-12 harbors GTPase-activating protein (GAP) functions. We identified a candidate GAP region in CED-12 that faces away from the CED-5 GEF catalytic region. Mutating a candidate catalytic Arginine in the CED-12 GAP region ( R537A ) altered the epidermal cell migration function, but not the corpse engulfment function. In contrast, interfering with CED-5’s ability to bind Rac1/CED-10 resulted in loss of both ventral enclosure and corpse engulfment. We propose that CED-5/CED-12 support the cycling of multiple GTPases by using distinct domains to both promote and inhibit F-actin nucleation.
In the rodent visual system, information and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. This suggests that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. We used an optimized information-theoretic and classical autocorrelation analysis to show that information- and correlation timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the mouse visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. Moreover, intrinsic timescales for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, whereas the hierarchy of predictability was stimulus-dependent. We could reproduce these observations in a basic recurrent network model with correlated sensory input. Our findings suggest that the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms to achieve longer integration for higher cortical areas, while simultaneously reducing predictability for an efficient neural code.
Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) is a non-invasive, FDA-cleared treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders with broad potential for new applications. However, the neural circuits that are engaged during TMS are still poorly understood. This study aimed to develop a computational model of a motor cortical macrocolumn through which the mechanisms underlying the response to TMS, including direct and indirect waves, could be investigated. We used epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a model of the motor cortical macrocolumn. An in-depth sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify important pathways, and machine learning was used to identify common circuit features among these pathways. The results support the hypothesis that different pathways of circuit activation contribute to different corticospinal waves with participation of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Moreover, activation of both afferents to the motor cortex as well as specific neuron types within the motor cortex initiated different I-waves, and the results were interpreted to propose the cortical origins of afferents that may give rise to certain I-waves. The methodology provides a workflow for performing computationally tractable sensitivity analyses on complex models and relating the results to the network structure to both identify and understand mechanisms underlying the response to acute stimulation.
Cell-free placental DNA ( cfpDNA ) is present in the maternal circulation throughout pregnancy and has been widely used in the clinical setting for noninvasive prenatal testing ( NIPT ) to screen for fetal genetic aberrations. CfpDNA has been detected as early as the fourth week of gestation and comprises up to approximately 40% of total maternal plasma cell-free DNA. While cfpDNA has great potential as a research and clinical tool, the basic biology of cfpDNA remains poorly understood, limiting its research and clinical utility. CfpDNA is representative of the full placental genome and provides a means for noninvasive genome-wide characterization of the placenta. This can be a powerful research tool for longitudinal studies of placental development and disease, which are currently hindered by ethical constraints and limited availability of early- and mid-gestation tissue samples. CfpDNA has been used to screen for common fetal aneuploidies, including Trisomies 13, 18, and 21, by assessing for overrepresentation of the affected chromosomes in maternal plasma cell-free DNA. However, it is essential to distinguish between cell-free “fetal” DNA and cell-free “placental” DNA, especially when discussing clinical applications of cfpDNA, due to the possibility of confined placental mosaicism.
Hormone-dependent cancers (HDCs), including breast, endometrial, ovarian, and prostate cancers, share several risk factors, suggesting a common aetiology. Using genome-wide association studies ( GWAS ), we identified 44 multi-HDC risk regions across the genome, defined as overlapping risk regions for at least two HDCs. Two regions contained risk variants for all four HDCs, 13 for three HDCs, and 28 for two HDCs. Integrating GWAS data, epigenomic profiling, and promoter capture HiC maps from diverse cell line models, we annotated 53 candidate risk genes at 22 multi-HDC risk regions. These targets were enriched for established genes from the COSMIC Cancer Gene Census, but many had no previously reported pleiotropic roles. We also pinpointed long non-coding RNAs ( lncRNAs ) as potential HDC targets and identified risk alleles in several regions that altered transcription factor motifs, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known drug targets were over-represented among the candidate multi-HDC risk genes, implying that some may serve as targets for therapeutic development or facilitate the repurposing of existing treatments for HDCs.
Polymyositis in the Dutch Kooiker dog has been found to be associated with a deletion of a 39 kb DNA fragment located 10–49 kb upstream of the interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. A genome-wide association study of 33 cases and 106 controls implicated a region on chromosome CFA19 ( p = 4. 7*10−10 ). Haplotype analysis revealed that the cases shared a 2. 9 Mb region in the homozygous or heterozygous state. Next Generation Sequencing of genomic DNA identified the 39 kb deletion as a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs. The frequency of the deletion allele was 0. 81 in the available cases and 0. 25 in a random sample of the Kooiker dog breed. Leukocytes of affected, untreated dogs that were homozygous for the deletion overexpressed IL21 and IL2 upon stimulation with mitogens. We suggest that elements located 10–49 kb upstream of the IL21/IL2 locus play an important role in the regulation of the canine genes and that deletion of these elements is a risk factor for polymyositis in Kooiker dogs. The penetrance of the disease phenotype was estimated at 10–20% for homozygous dogs and 0. 5–2% for dogs that were heterozygous for the deletion. Our results suggest that distant variants upstream of IL21 could also be important for human autoimmune diseases that have been found to be associated with the IL21/IL2 chromosome region.
In this work, we present ESMtherm, a protein language model optimized for folding stability prediction. ESMtherm is trained on a mega-scale dataset of 528k natural and de novo sequences derived from 461 protein domains and can accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple-point mutations. We show that a protein language model can be fine-tuned to predict folding stability. ESMtherm performs reasonably on small protein domains and generalizes to sequences distal from the training set. We also demonstrate that training on an ensemble of protein domains, instead of mutagenesis studies of a single domain, improves the performance of the fine-tuned protein language model for folding stability prediction. Our results highlight the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths commonly observed in nature. Although ESMtherm’s performance on larger protein scaffolds is lagging behind state-of-the-art methods, a folding stability dataset of larger proteins might be vital to improving the generalizability of ESMtherm.
Inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors ( iKIRs ) are a family of inhibitory receptors expressed by natural killer ( NK ) cells and late-stage differentiated T cells. We investigated the role of iKIRs in autoimmunity, specifically in the context of Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ). T1D is a paradigmatic example of autoimmunity where T cells have a major role in the disease etiopathogenesis. We conducted an immunogenetic analysis of a case-control T1D dataset ( N = 11, 961 ) and found that iKIR genes, in the presence of genes encoding their ligands, have a consistent and significant effect on protective HLA class II genetic associations. This suggests that iKIRs regulate CD4+ T cell responses in T1D. Our results were validated in an independent data set. We conclude that iKIRs significantly decrease HLA class II protective associations in T1D.
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy ( FECD ) is an age-related cause of vision loss and the most common repeat expansion-mediated disease in humans. The majority of European FECD cases have been attributed to the expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat element ( CTG18. 1 ) within the TCF4 gene, which encodes a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease have been challenging to decipher due to the non-coding nature of the repeat and the transcriptomic complexity of TCF4. Here, we describe the CTG18. 1 expansion-driven molecular components of disease within primary patient-derived corneal endothelial cells ( CECs ) from a large cohort of individuals with CTG18. 1-expanded ( Exp+ ) and CTG 18. 1-independent ( Exp- ) FECD. We employed long-read, short-read, and spatial transcriptomic techniques to interrogate expansion-specific transcriptomic biomarkers. Our results reveal the global extent of altered splicing occurring within Exp+ FECD and unique transcripts associated with CTG18. 1 expansions. We also identified rare and potentially deleterious TCF4 variants in 7/134 Exp- FECD cases, suggesting that TCF4 variants independent of CTG18. 1 may increase FECD risk. Our study supports the hypothesis that at least two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and TCF4 isoform-specific dysregulation, both underpin the pathophysiology of FECD.
In this study, we investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination ( LTG ) in rice ( Oryza sativa ). We identified the quantitative trait locus ( QTL ) qLTG11 from the Portuguese rice variety Arroz da Terra, which shows rapid seed germination at lower temperatures. Using QTL-seq, we delineated the candidate region to a 52-kb interval containing the GENERAL REGULATORY FACTOR14h ( GF14h ) gene, which is expressed during seed germination. We found that the Arroz da Terra GF14h allele encodes functional GF14h, whereas the Japanese rice variety Hitomebore harbors a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out functional GF14h in a near-isogenic line ( NIL ) carrying the Arroz da Terra allele decreased LTG, whereas overexpressing functional GF14h in Hitomebore increased LTG, indicating that GF14h is the causal gene behind qLTG11. Analysis of numerous Japanese rice accessions revealed that the functional GF14h allele was lost from popular varieties during modern breeding. We generated a NIL in the Hitomebore background carrying a 172-kb genomic fragment from Arroz da Terra including GF14h. The NIL showed superior LTG compared to Hitomebore, with otherwise comparable agronomic traits.
Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) relaxed circular DNA ( rcDNA ) contains an 8–9 nucleotide-long terminal redundancy ( TR ) on the negative ( - ) strand DNA derived from the reverse transcription of viral pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ). To investigate the structure of HBV rcDNA and the mechanism of covalently closed circular DNA ( cccDNA ) formation, a mutant HBV cell line HepDES-C1822G was established with a C1822G mutation in the pgRNA coding sequence. This mutation altered the sequence of the 3’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA, while the 5’ TR remained wild type ( wt ). The production of HBV rcDNA and cccDNA in HepDES-C1822G cells was comparable to wt levels. Next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) analysis revealed that the positive ( + ) strand DNA of rcDNA and both strands of cccDNA predominantly carried the wt nt1822 residue, indicating that the 5’ TR of ( - ) strand DNA serves as the template during rcDNA replication, forming a duplex with the ( + ) strand DNA, while the 3’ TR forms a flap-like structure, which is subsequently removed during cccDNA formation. We found that the 3’ flap endonuclease Mus81 plays a critical role in cccDNA formation in wild-type HBV replicating cells, alongside the 5’ flap endonuclease FEN1.
The efficiency of microbial fuel cells ( MFCs ) in industrial wastewater treatment is influenced by the microbial community, which can be disrupted by variable industrial operations. We developed a microbe-microbe interaction genome-scale metabolic model ( mmGEM ) to study the adaptation of microbial communities in MFCs treating sulfide-containing wastewater from a canned-pineapple factory. The model encompassed three major microbial guilds: sulfate-reducing bacteria ( SRB ), methanogens ( MET ), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria ( SOB ). Our findings revealed a shift from an SOB-dominant to MET-dominant community as organic loading rates ( OLRs ) increased, along with a decline in MFC performance. The mmGEM accurately predicted microbial relative abundance at low OLRs ( L-OLRs ) and adaptation to high OLRs ( H-OLRs ). The simulations revealed constraints on SOB growth under H-OLRs due to reduced sulfate-sulfide ( S ) cycling and acetate cross-feeding with SRB. More cross-fed metabolites from SRB were diverted to MET, facilitating their competitive dominance.
Machine learning ( ML ) is increasingly being used to guide biological discovery in biomedicine, such as prioritizing promising small molecules in drug discovery. However, when applied to unseen situations, ML models can be overconfident and produce a large number of false positives. To address this issue, we propose CPEC, an ML framework for FDR-controlled biological discovery. CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool known as conformal prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled function predictions for a given protein enzyme. Conformal prediction provides rigorous statistical guarantees to the predictive model and ensures that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. We demonstrate CPEC’s effectiveness using enzyme function annotation as a case study, simulating the discovery process of identifying the functions of less-characterized enzymes. Evaluation experiments show that CPEC achieves reliable FDR control, better or comparable prediction performance at a lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate predictions for enzymes under-represented in the training data. We expect CPEC to be a useful tool for biological discovery applications where a high yield rate in validation experiments is desired but the experimental budget is limited.
In this study, we explore the role of the C. elegans hsp-90/daf-21 chaperone in an animal model of TDP-43 proteinopathy that expresses full length human TDP-43 containing ALS-causing mutations pan-neuronally. We found that disrupting HSP-90 functions genetically or with small molecule inhibitors is sufficient to protect against TDP-43 neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration. We utilized C. elegans models which express human fALS mutant TDP-43, ( TDP-43 ( M337V ), TDP-43 ( A315T ), or TDP-43 ( G290A ) ) pan-neuronally. These animals exhibit progressive motility defects that worsen with age, selective degeneration of motor neurons, and accumulation of phosphorylated TDP-43. We found that loss of function of HSP-90 protects against TDP-43 neurotoxicity and subsequent neurodegeneration in adult animals. This protection is accompanied by a decrease in both total and phosphorylated TDP-43 protein. We also found that hsp-90 mutation or inhibition upregulates key stress responsive heat shock pathway gene expression, including hsp-70 and hsp-16. 1, and that normal levels of hsp-16. 1 are required for hsp-90 mutation effects on TDP-43.
The female reproductive system of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, is characterized by a high degree of morphological, reproductive, and sex chromosome diversity. However, our understanding of the molecular pathways that regulate oogenesis and define cellular identity in this system is currently limited. To address this knowledge gap, we generated a comprehensive single nucleus atlas of the adult Artemia franciscana female reproductive system using single-nucleus RNA and ATAC sequencing. We mapped our data to the Fly Cell Atlas single-nucleus dataset of the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, revealing conserved regulatory programs between the two distantly related Arthropod species. We identified the major cell types present in the Artemia ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and ovarian muscle cells, and used the germ cells to explore gene regulation and expression of the Z chromosome during meiosis. We further combined RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data to investigate the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics of germ cells during oogenesis. Our results suggest that many of the expression programs that give rise to cellular identity and function are highly conserved between Artemia and Drosophila, and that single-nucleus RNA sequencing is a useful alternative to traditional approaches for identifying promising models for the study of meiotic sex chromosome regulation in species where it is difficult to isolate/identify nuclei of meiotic cells.
Allodynia, a common symptom of chronic pain, is hypothesized to be caused by the dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory ( E-I ) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. In this work, we analyze biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures that represent common motifs in neural circuits in laminae I-II of the dorsal horn. These circuits are hypothesized to be part of the neural pathways that mediate two different types of allodynia: static and dynamic. We use neural firing rate models to describe the activity of populations of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within each subcircuit. By accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions, we specify model parameters defining populations of subcircuits that yield typical behavior under normal conditions. Then, we implement a sensitivity analysis approach to identify the mechanisms most likely to cause allodynia-producing dysregulation of the subcircuit’s E-I signaling. We find that disruption of E-I balance generally occurs either due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling so that excitatory neurons are “released” from inhibitory control, or due to upregulation of excitatory neuron responses so that excitatory neurons “escape” their inhibitory control. These results suggest specific hypotheses about diverse mechanisms that may be most likely responsible for allodynia, thus offering predictions for the high interindividual variability observed in allodynia and identifying targets for further experimental studies on the underlying mechanisms of this chronic pain symptom.
Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 ( eEF2 ) is an essential protein that promotes GTP-dependent translocation of the ribosome during translation. eEF2 folding is dependent on Hsp90 as well as the cochaperones Hgh1, Cns1, and Cpr7. We examined the role of Hsp90 and cochaperones in regulating eEF2 function and found that they have two distinct roles. Yeast expressing one group of Hsp90 mutations or one group of cochaperone mutations had reduced steady-state levels of eEF2. The growth of Hsp90 mutants that affected eEF2 accumulation was also negatively affected by deletion of the gene encoding Hgh1. In contrast, yeast expressing different groups of Hsp90 mutations or a different cochaperone mutation had altered sensitivity to diphtheria toxin, which is dictated by a unique posttranslational modification on eEF2. Our results provide further evidence that Hsp90 contributes to proteostasis not just by assisting protein folding, but also by enabling accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. We also provide evidence that defects in classes of Hsp90 mutants are linked to subsets of cochaperones, suggesting that there may be distinct versions of the Hsp90 folding pathway that chaperone different types of clients.
Individuals with lesions in the insular or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, key brain regions involved in risky decision-making, showed disrupted use of standard utility-based computations about risky options. When making decisions in social contexts, these individuals showed increased conformity with the choices of others, independent from social utility-based computations. This suggests that in social contexts, following others’ choices may be a heuristic for decision-making when utility-based risk processing is disrupted. We investigated how risky decisions are made in social contexts when utility-based risk preferences are disrupted or inaccessible, as might be the case for individuals with certain psychopathologies or who are confronting novel options. We used a risky decision-making task and examined whether such heuristics facilitate socially situated decision-making about risk when utility processing is disrupted. Our findings suggest that social conformity can serve as a heuristic alternative to using social information in a utility-based way during socially situated decision-making when individuals’ risk processing is impaired. We found a parametric relationship between the degree of impairment in utility-based risky decision-making and the use of the ‘follow others’ choices’ heuristic.
Biomorphs, a model of morphological evolution developed by Richard Dawkins, have traditionally been used to demonstrate the power of natural selection to generate biological order from random mutations. Here, we show that biomorphs can also be used to illustrate how developmental bias shapes adaptive evolutionary outcomes. We find that biomorphs exhibit phenotype bias, a type of developmental bias where certain phenotypes are many orders of magnitude more likely to appear through random mutations than others. Moreover, this bias exhibits a strong preference for simpler phenotypes with low descriptional complexity. This bias towards simplicity is formalised by an information-theoretic principle that can be intuitively understood from a picture of evolution randomly searching in the space of algorithms. Using population genetics simulations, we demonstrate how moderately adaptive phenotypic variation that appears more frequently upon random mutations can fix at the expense of more highly adaptive biomorph phenotypes that are less frequent.
The ability of humans to intuitively tune to system dynamics and excite motions that the system prefers intrinsically has been experimentally supported for interactions with simple linear systems. However, it remains a challenge to validate this ability in more complex scenarios where nonlinear dynamics cannot be predicted analytically. Using a recently developed numerical mode tool, we compared the motions that humans excite in nonlinear systems with the predicted nonlinear normal modes ( NNM ) of energy-conservative systems. In a user study consisting of three experiment parts, participants commanded differently configured virtual double pendula with joint compliance through a haptic joystick. The task was to alternately hit two targets, which were either aligned with the NNM ( Experiments 1 and 2 ) or purposefully arranged offset ( Experiment 3 ). In all tested experiment variations, participants intuitively applied a control strategy that excited the resonance and stabilized an orbit close to the ideal NNM of the conservative systems. Even for increased task accuracy ( Experiment 2 ) and targets located away from the NNM ( Experiment 3 ), participants could successfully accomplish the task, likely by adjusting their arm stiffness to alter the system dynamics to better align the resonant motions to the task. Our findings emphasize the human capabilities to apply control strategies to excite and exploit resonant motions in dynamic object interactions, including possibly shaping the dynamics through changes in muscle stiffness.
In the soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis, a group of transcription factors called transition state regulators ( TSRs ), including ScoC and AbrB, and the MarR-family transcription factor PchR, play a crucial role in regulating gene expression during the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase. Here, we demonstrate that these regulators negatively control the production of the iron chelator pulcherrimin in B. subtilis. Our results indicate that all three regulators are necessary to limit pulcherrimin production during exponential phase and influence the rate and total amount of pulcherrimin produced. We further show that expression of the pulcherrimin biosynthesis gene yvmC is under control of ScoC, AbrB, and PchR and correlates with the amount of pulcherrimin produced by each background. Our biochemical analysis shows that ScoC, AbrB, and PchR bind to the yvmC promoter with differing apparent off-rates, indicating that pulcherrimin regulation in B. subtilis is under tight regulation and repressed during exponential growth by two distinct regulatory systems. We further establish the roles of PchR and AbrB in direct regulation of gene expression and provide evidence that ScoC can bind directly to the yvmC promoter in vitro. Our results establish a model where pulcherrimin biosynthesis is regulated by nutrient levels during the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase in addition to input from PchR, linking stationary phase with extracellular iron sequestration.
After a spinal cord injury ( SCI ), patients may develop either detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia ( DSD ) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the injury. DSD and incontinence reflect the loss of coordinated neural control among the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination, and urethral sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit bladder emptying. We developed a computational model of the neural circuit of micturition based on Hodgkin-Huxley equations that replicated normal bladder function. We added interneurons and increased network complexity to reproduce dysfunctional micturition after SCI, and we increased the density and complexity of interactions of both inhibitory and excitatory lumbar spinal interneurons responsive to TMS to provide a more diverse set of spinal responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of spinal interneurons that remains after SCI. The model reproduced the re-emergence of a spinal voiding reflex after SCI. When we investigated the effect of monophasic and biphasic TMS at two frequencies applied at or below T10, the model replicated the improved coordination between detrusor and external urethral sphincter activity that has been observed clinically: low-frequency TMS ( 1 Hz ) within the model normalized control of voiding after SCI, whereas high-frequency TMS ( 30 Hz ) enhanced urine storage.
Aspergillus fumigatus, a filamentous fungus, is a common cause of severe fungal infections. Accurate quantification of fungal growth is essential for effective treatment, but current methods require time-course morphology-specific data, such as hyphal length measurements, which are difficult to obtain in most clinical microbiology laboratories. We propose a mathematical model that estimates morphology-specific growth rates from optical density ( OD600 ) data, an indirect measure of fungal growth. Our model explicitly accounts for the relationship between OD600 and true fungal growth, eliminating the need for calibration data. We demonstrate that our model outperforms reference models in fitting to and predicting OD600 growth curves and overcomes discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD600 versus directly measured data. Our model treats OD600 as an observed variable distributed around a linear transform of the true unobserved fungal concentration. We apply our model to time-course OD600 data for A. fumigatus and evaluate the estimated morphology-specific growth rate using directly measured data. Our method is accessible to all microbiology laboratories that collect OD600 data, rather than just specialist laboratories.
Beetles are the most species-rich group of animals and harbor diverse karyotypes. Most species have XY sex chromosomes, but X0 sex determination mechanisms are also common in some groups. We generated a whole-chromosome assembly of Tribolium confusum, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and utilized eleven additional beetle genomes to reconstruct karyotype evolution across Coleoptera. We identified ancestral linkage groups, termed Stevens elements, that share a conserved set of genes across beetles. While the ancestral X chromosome is maintained across beetles, we find independent additions of autosomes to the ancestral sex chromosomes. These neo-sex chromosomes evolve the stereotypical properties of sex chromosomes, including the evolution of dosage compensation and a non-random distribution of genes with sex-biased expression. Beetles thus provide a novel model to gain a better understanding of the diverse forces driving sex chromosome evolution.
H2A. Z is an evolutionarily conserved H2A histone variant encoded by the non-essential HTZ1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR1-complex ( SWR1-C ) and has been implicated in transcription regulation. However, htz1Δ mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. We examined the mRNA transcript profiles of htz1Δ, swr1Δ, and htz1Δswr1Δ mutants before and after exposure to hydroxyurea ( HU ), which induces DNA replication stress. Our data showed that H2A. Z played a more prominent role in gene activation than repression during HU exposure, and its incorporation was important for proper upregulation of several HU-induced genes. We also observed that apo-SWR1-C contributed to gene expression defects in the htz1Δ mutant, particularly for genes involved in phosphate homeostasis regulation. Mapping H2A. Z incorporation before and after treatment with HU revealed that decreases in H2A. Z enrichment at transcription start sites were correlated with, but generally not required for, the upregulation of genes during HU exposure.
Single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNASeq ) is a powerful tool for advancing our understanding of developmental biology. However, due to the high dimensionality and rapid accumulation of datasets, it has become challenging to explore and annotate single-cell transcriptomic profiles by hand. To overcome this challenge, we propose to take advantage of partial label learning strategies for the problem of automated single-cell transcriptomics profile annotation. This approach assumes that we can obtain a set of candidate labels containing the correct one for each data point, a simpler setting than requiring a fully supervised training dataset. We study and extend state-of-the-art multi-class classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype-based, logistic regression and ensemble methods, to the partial label learning framework. We focus particularly on the hierarchical structure of the labels, as commonly observed in developmental processes. Our results show that these extensions enable to learn from partially labeled data, and perform predictions with high accuracy, particularly with a nonlinear prototype-based method. We demonstrate that the performances of our methods trained with partially annotated data reach the same performance as fully supervised data. Overall, our findings show how hierarchical and non-hierarchical partial label learning strategies can help solve the problem of automated classification of single-cell transcriptomic profiles, relying on a much less stringent type of annotated datasets compared to fully supervised learning methods.
Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5-bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) is a phospholipid found in nuclear speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipid islets ( NLIs ) and plays a role in RNA polymerase I/II transcription. The nuclear localization of PIP2 is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA, suggesting an intimate relationship between PIP2 and RNA in the nucleus. We identified the RNA-dependent PIP2-associated ( RDPA ) proteome in human cells by mass spectrometry and found that intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) with polybasic PIP2-binding K/R motifs are prevalent features of RDPA proteins. These IDRs exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. We show that the RDPA protein Bromodomain-containing protein 4 ( BRD4 ) associates with PIP2 in an RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions, and that altered PIP2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BRD4 protein. We propose that PIP2 spatiotemporally orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RDPA proteins and affects their ability to form foci presumably via phase separation. This suggests a pivotal role of PIP2 in the establishment of a functional nuclear architecture competent for gene expression.
Phenotypic plasticity is an important driver of diversification and adaptation to environmental variation, yet the genomic mechanisms mediating plastic trait development and evolution remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the evolutionary basis for horns and other key traits in dung beetles via comparative genomic and developmental assays. We present chromosome-level genome assemblies of three dung beetle species in the tribe Onthophagini, including Onthophagus taurus, O. sagittarius, and Digitonthophagus gazella, and identify evolutionary changes in coding sequence associated with metabolic regulation of plasticity and metamorphosis. We then contrast chromatin accessibility in developing head horn tissues of high- and low-nutrition O. taurus males and females and identify distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition- compared to sex-responsive development. Our work highlights the importance of chromatin state regulation in mediating the development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrates gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals, and provides new reference-quality genomes for three species that will bolster future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this insect group.
The pathogenesis of Lassa fever has not been fully elucidated, particularly concerning the mechanisms that determine whether acute infection is controlled or leads to severe illness and death. Using a cynomolgus monkey model of Lassa virus ( LASV ) infection that reproduces the different outcomes of the disease, we investigated the dynamics of LASV infection and the immune mechanisms associated with survival or death. Our results show that lymphoid organs are an early major reservoir for replicating virus during Lassa fever, with LASV entering through the cortical sinus of draining lymph nodes regardless of disease outcome. However, subsequent viral tropism varies considerably with disease severity, with viral dissemination limited almost entirely to lymphoid organs and immune cells during nonfatal Lassa fever. In contrast, the systemic dissemination of LASV to all organs and diverse cell types, leading to infiltrations with macrophages and neutrophils and an excessive inflammatory response, is associated with a fatal outcome.
Neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ), frontal temporal dementia and frontal temporal lobar degeneration ( FTD/FTLD ), and Alzheimer’s and Alzheimer’s Related Dementias ( AD/ADRD ) have been associated with pathological disruptions of nucleocytoplasmic transport ( NCT ). These disruptions include the mis-localization of nuclear pore complex proteins, nuclear transport receptors, Ran-GTPase, and RanGAP1. However, the question of whether these alterations are a primary cause or a downstream consequence of disease is unclear. Here, we report four key findings that shed light on the upstream causal role of Importin-β-specific nuclear transport defects in disease onset. First, we find an Importin-β-specific nuclear import block in two novel mouse models of NEMF neurodegeneration ( NemfR86S and NemfR487G ) that recapitulate many cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. Second, we observe cytoplasmic mis-localization and aggregation of multiple proteins implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS/FTD and AD/ADRD, including TDP43, Importin-β, RanGap1, and Ran. Third, we identify similar transcriptional dysregulation in key genes associated with neurodegenerative disease. Lastly, we show that even transient pharmaceutical inhibition of Importin-β in both mouse and human neuronal and non-neuronal cells induces key proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in our mouse models and in neurodegeneration.
Lytic bacteriophages have the potential to be used in medical and biotechnological applications. However, a comprehensive understanding of phage infection mechanisms is necessary to realize this potential. CRISPR-Cas systems can be used to explore these mechanisms via site-specific phage mutagenesis. However, phages can resist Cas-mediated cleavage through extensive DNA modifications, such as cytosine glycosylation, which hinders mutagenesis efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we used the eukaryotic enzyme NgTET to temporarily reduce phage DNA modifications, facilitating Cas nuclease cleavage and enhancing mutagenesis efficiency. This approach enables precise DNA targeting and seamless point mutation integration, exemplified by deactivating specific ADP-ribosyltransferases crucial for phage infection. Furthermore, by temporally removing DNA modifications, we elucidated the effects of these modifications on T4 phage infections without necessitating gene deletions. Our results present a strategy enabling the investigation of phage epigenome functions and streamlining the engineering of phages with cytosine DNA modifications.
Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair ( TC-NER ) is a sub-pathway of nucleotide excision repair ( NER ) that removes bulky DNA lesions, such as those induced by UV light or the DNA-damaging agent 4-nitroquinoline oxide ( 4-NQO ), from the transcribed strand of active genes. Here, we show that histone variant H2A. Z is an important component of TC-NER in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using a genetic screen, we identified H2A. Z as a gene required for efficient TC-NER and RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) clearance following UV irradiation. In the absence of H2A. Z, repair by TC-NER is severely impaired and RNAPII clearance is reduced, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks ( DSBs ). Thus, H2A. Z is needed for proficient TC-NER and plays a major role in the maintenance of genome stability upon UV irradiation. Importantly, UV-irradiation of H2A. Z-depleted cells leads to an accumulation of DSBs, which constitute a major threat to genome stability.
Drosophila melanogaster strains from two divergent populations, one from the ancestral African range and one from the derived European range, were used to investigate how gene expression variation affects the evolution of regulatory architecture among closely related tissues during population divergence. We analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpighian tubule as well as microbiome composition in the two gut tissues in four D. melanogaster strains and their F1 hybrids. We detected extensive tissue- and genetic background-specific effects, including effects of genetic background on overall tissue specificity. Tissue-specific effects were typically stronger than genetic background-specific effects, although the two gut tissues were not more similar to each other than to the Malpighian tubules. An examination of allele-specific expression revealed that, while both cis and trans effects were more tissue-specific in genes expressed differentially between populations than in genes with conserved expression, trans effects were more tissue-specific than cis effects. This observation was robust across tissues and genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the expression of trans variation can be spatially fine-tuned as well as or better than cis variation during population divergence. Overall, our findings yield insight into the evolution of regulatory architecture, the effects of regulatory variation on tissue specificity, the effects of genetic background on expression and microbiome variation, as well as the importance of accounting for context-specificity in evolutionary studies.
While the exact date of the first SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to the COVID-19 pandemic is unknown, previous studies have used genomic data to estimate the emergence of the virus. Here, we use a population dynamics approach to estimate the delay from the first infection to the Nth symptomatic case. We first validate our model using simulated data and then apply it to two examples: the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK in 2020 and the first human SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan in late 2019. We estimate that the first Alpha variant infection occurred on August 21, 2020 ( 95% interpercentile range: July 23–September 5, 2020 ) and the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan occurred on November 28, 2019 ( 95% interpercentile range: November 2–December 9, 2019 ). Our results fall within ranges previously estimated by studies relying on genomic data. We also estimate that the median number of days between the first SARS-CoV-2 infection and the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case recorded is 52 days ( 95% interpercentile range: 41–78 days ). Our population dynamics-based modelling framework is generic and flexible, and thus can be applied to estimate the starting time of outbreaks in contexts other than COVID-19.
Meiosis is the process by which diploid precursor cells give rise to haploid gametes, a prerequisite for sexual reproduction. During meiotic prophase I, homologous chromosomes ( homologs ) pair to facilitate crossover recombination and homolog segregation. However, the mechanisms that ensure stable homolog alignment in the presence of an excess of non-homologous chromosomes have remained elusive. Here, we have developed an agent-based model for homolog pairing derived from the dynamics of a naturally occurring chromosome ensemble. The model simulates unidirectional chromosome movements, as well as collision dynamics determined by attractive and repulsive forces arising from close-range physical interactions. We find that chromosome number and size, as well as movement velocity and repulsive forces, are key factors in the kinetics and efficiency of homologous pairing in addition to homolog attraction. Dissociation of interactions between non-homologous chromosomes may contribute to pairing by crowding homologs into a limited nuclear area, thus creating preconditions for close-range homolog attraction. Our model accurately recapitulates the efficiency and kinetics of homolog pairing observed for wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to nuclear dimensions and chromosome sets of other organisms. The model suggests that homolog pairing is achieved by two mechanistically distinct, yet temporally coinciding processes: homologs become confined to a nuclear area due to dissociation of interactions with the entire non-homologous chromosome set achieved via a repulsive force, and confinement to smaller areas enables homologs to assess similarities modeled as an attractive force.
Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by inherited mutations in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. MicroRNA miR-34a, a p53 target and modifier gene, plays an important role in cancer development. In zebrafish, miR-34 triple-null mutants exhibit normal p53 responses and no overt cancer development, but the lack of miR-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. Interestingly, miR-34 genes are highly conserved and syntenic between zebrafish and humans. DNA damage by camptothecin leads to p53-dependent induction of miR-34 genes, while miR-34a mutants are adult-viable and have normal DNA damage-induced apoptosis. However, miR-34a-/- compound mutants with a gain-of-function tp53R217H/R217H or tp53-/- mutants are more cancer-prone than tp53 mutants alone, confirming the tumor-suppressive function of miR-34a.
Sex determination in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is controlled by the master regulator XOL-1 during embryogenesis. The expression of xol-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes and autosomes, which differs between XX hermaphrodites and XO males. In males, xol-1 is highly expressed and in hermaphrodites, it is expressed at very low levels. However, our study reveals that xol-1 plays an important role as a regulator of developmental timing during hermaphrodite embryogenesis. Using a combination of imaging and bioinformatics techniques, we found that hermaphrodite embryos have an accelerated rate of cell division and a more developmentally advanced transcriptional program when xol-1 is lost. Further analyses reveal that xol-1 is responsible for regulating the timing of initiation of dosage compensation on the X chromosomes and the appropriate expression of sex-biased transcriptional programs in hermaphrodites. We found that xol-1 mutant embryos overexpress the H3K9 methyltransferase MET-2 and have an altered H3K9me landscape. Some of these effects of the loss of xol-1 were reversed by the loss of met-2. These findings demonstrate that xol-1 plays an important role as a developmental regulator in embryos of both sexes, and that met-2 acts as a downstream effector of xol-1 activity in hermaphrodites.
We present MGSurvE, a computational framework that optimizes trap placement for genetic surveillance of mosquito populations such that the time to detection of an allele of interest is minimized. MGSurvE accounts for important biological features of mosquitoes and the landscapes they inhabit, including resources required by mosquitoes, movement of mosquitoes, and trap attractiveness profiles. We demonstrate the application of MGSurvE to optimize trap placement for Anopheles gambiae populations on the island of São Tomé, São Tomé and Príncipe, and for Aedes aegypti populations in the suburb of Yorkeys Knob, Queensland, Australia. MGSurvE optimizes trap placement according to a fitness function that minimizes the mean expected time for a given mosquito to be trapped, considering all possible origins on the landscape. We use discrete optimization due to the spatial scale at which traps are most likely to be placed within localities. MGSurvE is intended as a resource for both field and computational researchers interested in mosquito gene surveillance.
Symbiomonas scintillans Guillou et Chrétiennot-Dinet, 1999 is a small ( 1. 4 μm ) heterotrophic microbial eukaryote that was previously thought to harbour an endosymbiotic bacterium in its endoplasmic reticulum. We sequenced two strains of S. scintillans, RCC257 and RCC24, using both amplification-free shotgun metagenomics and whole genome amplification sequencing, but were unable to detect any sequences from known lineages of endosymbiotic bacteria. Fluorescence in situ hybridization ( FISH ) analyses further supported the absence of endosymbiotic bacteria. Instead, we found numerous contigs in assemblies from both strains that were closely related to prasinoviruses infecting the green algae Ostreococcus lucimarinus, Bathycoccus prasinos, and Micromonas pusilla ( OlV, BpV, and MpV, respectively ). Using the BpV genome as a reference, we assembled a near-complete 190 kbp draft genome encoding all hallmark prasinovirus genes, as well as two additional incomplete assemblies of closely related but distinct viruses from RCC257, and three similar draft viral genomes from RCC24, which we collectively call SsVs. A multi-gene tree showed the three SsV genome types branched within highly supported clades with each of BpV2, OlVs, and MpVs, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy also revealed a 190 nm virus-like particle similar in morphology and size to the endosymbiont originally reported in S. scintillans.
Mutations in the leiomodin ( LMOD ) family of actin-binding proteins, which play a critical role in muscle function, are associated with human myopathies. Mutations in the cardiac predominant isoform, LMOD2, lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations in the LMOD gene family are nonsense or frameshift mutations predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of disease, little to no LMOD protein is expressed. We show that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay ( NMD ) underlies loss of mutant protein from two independent LMOD2 disease-causing mutations. NMD is a cellular mechanism that eliminates mRNAs with premature termination codons. We generated steric-blocking oligonucleotides ( SBOs ) that obstruct the deposition of the exon junction complex, thereby preventing NMD of mutant LMOD2 transcripts and restoring mutant protein expression. Our investigation lays the groundwork for potential therapeutic intervention in LMOD-linked myopathies. We demonstrate that multiple human LMOD2 mutations associated with dilated cardiomyopathy lead to a lack of LMOD2 protein expression through NMD. We also show that SBOs can specifically inhibit NMD of LMOD2 transcripts, increasing the levels of mutant-truncated protein.
Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE ) polymorphisms have been shown to modify the risk of Alzheimer’s disease, with ApoE4 strongly increasing and ApoE2 modestly decreasing risk relative to the control ApoE3. To investigate how ApoE isoforms alter risk, we measured changes in proteome homeostasis in transgenic mice expressing a human ApoE gene ( isoform 2, 3, or 4 ). We identified 4849 proteins and tested for ApoE isoform-dependent changes in the homeostatic regulation of ~2700 ontologies. In the brain, we found that ApoE4 and ApoE2 both lead to modified regulation of mitochondrial membrane proteins relative to the wild-type control ApoE3. In ApoE4 mice, lack of cohesion between mitochondrial membrane and matrix proteins suggests that dysregulation of proteasome and autophagy is reducing protein quality. In ApoE2, proteins of the mitochondrial matrix and the membrane, including oxidative phosphorylation complexes, had a similar increase in degradation which suggests coordinated replacement of the entire organelle. In the liver we did not observe these changes suggesting that the ApoE-effect on proteostasis is amplified in the brain relative to other tissues.
The Drosophila neuromuscular junction ( NMJ ) is a powerful model for studying many biological processes, such as axon development, synaptogenesis, synaptic function and plasticity, and locomotion. Although CRISPR has been used to tag endogenous proteins at the NMJ, tissue-specific CRISPR has not yet been successfully applied to the fly NMJ. Here, we present a CRISPR-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis ( CRISPR-TRiM ) toolkit for knocking out genes in motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells. We validated the efficacy of CRISPR-TRiM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue, demonstrated its orthogonal use with the Gal4/UAS binary expression system, and showed simultaneous knockout of multiple redundant genes. We used CRISPR-TRiM to discover an essential role for SNARE components in NMJ maintenance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the canonical ESCRT pathway suppresses NMJ bouton growth by downregulating retrograde Gbb signaling. Lastly, we found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESCRT-mediated intra-axonal membrane trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at the NMJ. Thus, we have successfully developed an NMJ CRISPR mutagenesis approach which we used to reveal genes important for NMJ structural plasticity.
During the larval stages of Drosophila, the lymph gland progenitors gradually accumulate reactive oxygen species ( ROS ), which is essential to prime them for differentiation. ROS triggers the activation of JNK ( c-Jun Kinase ), which upregulates fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) to facilitate progenitor differentiation. However, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in the late larval stages. We found that the Drosophila NF-κB transcription factor Relish ( Rel ) shields the progenitor pool from the metabolic pathway that inducts them into the differentiation program by curtailing the activation of JNK. Although ROS serves as the metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, the input from ROS is monitored by the developmental signal TAK1, which is regulated by Relish. This developmental circuit ensures that the stockpile of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted entirely.
Taybi-Linder syndrome ( TALS ) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, severe growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. Here, we report a patient presenting with TALS features but no pathogenic variants were found in the RNU4ATAC gene. Instead, the homozygous RTTN c. 2953A>G variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing. We investigated the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the pathogenicity of the RTTN c. 2953A>G variant in patient fibroblasts, engineered RPE1 cells, and CRISPR/Cas9-edited induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSC ) that were differentiated into neural stem cells ( NSC ) or cortical organoids ( CO ). We demonstrated that RTTN-mutated NSC accumulated in G2-M phase due to numerous mitotic abnormalities that likely result in aneuploidy, cell arrest, or cell apoptosis. These mitotic defects were associated with slight misorientation of the mitotic spindles that may favour premature differentiation of NSC into neurons. In cortical organoids, we discovered an additional function of RTTN in the self-organisation of NSC into neural rosettes, by observing delayed apico-basal polarization of NSC. Altogether, these defects contributed to a marked delay of rosette formation in RTTN-mutated organoids, thus impeding their overall growth and shedding light on mechanisms leading to microcephaly.
E. coli, a non-sporulating bacterial species, is able to survive prolonged periods of resource exhaustion by entering a state of growth called long-term stationary phase ( LTSP ). In order to characterize the dynamics of E. coli adaptation under LTSP, a set of evolutionary experiments was initiated in July 2015. Populations of E. coli were allowed to grow on fresh rich media, but were not provided with any new external growth resources since their establishment. Utilizing whole genome sequencing data obtained for hundreds of clones sampled at 12 time points spanning the first six years of these experiments, we reveal several novel aspects of the dynamics of adaptation. We show that E. coli continuously adapts genetically, up to six years under resource exhaustion, through the highly convergent accumulation of mutations. We further show that upon entry into LTSP, long-lasting lineages are established. This lineage structure is in itself convergent, with similar lineages arising across independently evolving populations. The high parallelism with which adaptations occur under LTSP, combined with the LTSP populations’ lineage structure, enable us to screen for pairs of loci displaying a significant association in the occurrence of mutations, suggestive of a historical contingency. We find that such associations are highly frequent and that a third of convergently mutated loci are involved in at least one such association.
The male-specific abdominal ( MSA ) transcript from the Drosophila melanogaster bithorax complex has recently been shown to code for a micropeptide that plays a vital role in determining how mated females use stored sperm after mating. Interestingly, the MSA transcript is a male-specific version of another transcript produced in both sexes within the posterior central nervous system from an alternative promoter, called the iab-8 lncRNA. However, while the MSA transcript produces a small peptide, it seems that the iab-8 transcript does not. Here, we show that the absence of iab-8 translation is due to a repressive mechanism requiring the two unique 5’ exons of the iab-8 lncRNA. Through cell culture and transgenic analysis, we show that this mechanism relies on the presence of upstream open reading frames present in these two exons that prevent the production of proteins from downstream open reading frames.
Congenital disorders of glycosylation ( CDG ) are a group of ultra-rare multisystemic disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and neurodevelopmental delays. CDG are caused by loss-of-function mutations in 189 glycosylation genes, which are involved in protein glycosylation pathways such as N-linked glycosylation, O-linked glycosylation, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) anchor synthesis. Because of the ubiquity of glycosylation, symptoms of CDG can affect most organ systems, and the different CDG are likely connected because they all affect protein glycosylation and show similar symptoms in patients. Because of their relatedness, it is probable that common modifiers affect multiple CDG. Here, we used evolutionary tools to analyze all glycosylation genes and identify potential modifiers for all CDG genes. We used evolutionary rate covariation ( ERC ) to identify proteins with similar evolutionary rates that indicate shared biological functions and pathways. We identified strong evolutionary rate signatures between proteins in the same and different glycosylation pathways, including between N-linked glycosylation and GPI anchor synthesis. Genome-wide analysis of proteins showing significant ERC with GPI anchor synthesis proteins revealed strong signatures with non-coding RNA modification proteins and DNA repair proteins. We also identified strong patterns of ERC based on cellular sub-localization of the GPI anchor synthesis enzymes. Functional testing of the highest scoring candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel genetic modifiers of CDG genes.
Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) core ( HBc ) protein is composed of an N-terminal domain ( NTD ) for capsid assembly and an arginine-rich C-terminal domain ( CTD ) for pregenomic RNA ( pgRNA ) encapsidation. Phosphorylation of the HBc CTD, especially at Ser162 and Ser170, is essential for nucleation with the polymerase ( Pol ) to initiate pgRNA encapsidation. As capsids mature, the HBc CTD undergoes dephosphorylation, suggesting the involvement of a phosphatase in the late stage of encapsidation. Using a C-S170 antibody specific for non-phosphorylated HBc-Ser170, we observed a transition from a phosphorylated to a dephosphorylated state during pgRNA packaging. The Pol-dependent dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 was confirmed by the substitution of one single amino acid at Val782 in the RNase H domain, which abolished the dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170. Immunoprecipitation, mass spectrometry analyses, and protein structural analyses showed that the recruitment of the host phosphatase PP1 is dependent on the Pol-Val782 domain. This recruitment does not require HBc but does require Pol via epsilon RNA signal, suggesting that the Pol-pgRNA complex plays a key role in PP1 recruitment. Pol-pgRNA-PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of HBc-Ser170 is essential for the completion of pgRNA encapsidation and appears to be associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ).
The closure of the Isthmus of Panama created distinct environmental conditions in the Tropical Eastern Pacific ( TEP ) and Caribbean Sea, allowing for a natural experiment to study how closely related animals evolve and adapt under environmental change. We investigated the role of bacterial symbionts in this process by sequencing the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbiotic bivalves from the genera Codakia and Ctena ( family Lucinidae ) collected on either side of the Isthmus. We found that the lucinid sister species hosted different Candidatus Thiodiazotropha symbionts, and only those from the Caribbean had the genetic potential for nitrogen fixation. This ability did not correspond to symbiont phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution of nitrogen fixation potential under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of the nifHDKT operon revealed that the last common ancestor of Ca. Thiodiazotropha lacked nif genes, and populations in oligotrophic habitats later re-acquired the nif operon through horizontal gene transfer ( HGT ) from the Sedimenticola symbiont lineage. Our study suggests that HGT of the nif operon has facilitated niche diversification of the globally distributed Ca. Thiodiazotropha endolucinida species clade, and highlights the importance of nitrogen availability in driving the ecological diversification of chemosynthetic symbiont species and the role that bacterial symbionts may play in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions.
TAS2Rs are a family of G protein-coupled receptors that function as bitter taste receptors in vertebrates. We identified 9, 291 TAS2Rs from 661 vertebrate genomes and found that frogs and salamanders have an unusually high TAS2R gene content compared to other vertebrates. In most species, TAS2R genes are found in clusters; however, amphibians have additional clusters and more genes per cluster. We found that vertebrate TAS2Rs have few one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, although total TAS2R count is stable in most lineages. Interestingly, TAS2R count is proportional to the receptors expressed solely in extra-oral tissues. In vitro receptor activity assays revealed that many amphibian TAS2Rs function as tissue-specific chemosensors to detect ecologically important xenobiotics.
Notch dimerization plays a crucial role in the regulation of intestinal and colonic stem cells. The Notch dimerization-deficient ( NDD ) mouse model, which expresses Notch dimerization-deficient alleles of Notch1 and Notch2, is sensitized to environmental insults but otherwise develops and ages normally. Transcriptomic analysis of colonic spheroids from NDD mice revealed no evidence of dimer-dependent target gene misregulation, but rather an elevated signature of epithelial innate immune response to symbionts, which is likely the underlying cause for the heightened sensitivity in NDD mice. Notch dimerization-deficient mice show an environmentally modulated susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium ( DSS ) and a decrease in colonic stem cells, but the mechanism linking Notch dimerization with the stem cell niche remains unknown. To investigate this further, we used TurboID and quantitative nano-spray MS/MS mass-spectrometry analyses in a human colon carcinoma cell line expressing either NOTCH2DD or NOTCH2 and discovered an unbalanced interactome, with reduced interaction of NOTCH2DD with the transcription machinery but relatively preserved interaction with the histone deacetylase 2 ( HDAC2 ) interactome, suggesting modulation via cooperativity. Furthermore, we used the HDAC2 inhibitor Valproic acid ( VPA ) and discovered it could prevent the intestinal consequences of NDD and gamma secretase inhibitor treatment in mice and spheroids, suggesting synergy between HDAC activity and the pro-differentiation program in intestinal stem cells.
Background selection is a process by which selection on deleterious alleles reduces genetic diversity at linked neutral sites. The theory of background selection can be split into two regimes: the background selection regime, where selection pressures are strong and deleterious alleles are at a deterministic mutation-selection balance, and the interference selection regime, where selection pressures are weak and deleterious alleles accumulate and interfere with each other. Previous work has quantified the effects of background selection on total neutral diversity, πT, and genetic differentiation, FST, only for deleterious alleles in the background selection regime. Here, we derive novel theory to predict the effects of migration on background selection experienced by a subpopulation and extend previous theory from the interference selection regime to make predictions in an island model. Using simulations, we show that this theory best predicts FST and πT. We demonstrate that background selection may generate minimal increases in FST under sufficiently high migration rates, because migration reduces correlated effects on fitness over generations within subpopulations. However, we show that background selection may still cause substantial reductions in πT, particularly for metapopulations with a larger effective population size. Our work further extends the theory of background selection into structured populations, and suggests that background selection will minimally confound locus-to-locus FST scans.
Genomic and phenotypic data is becoming increasingly important for understanding the genetic determinants of diseases. However, the lack of practical means for collaboration and data sharing among institutions is a major methodological barrier for performing high-powered studies. To address this issue, we developed FedGMMAT, a federated genetic association testing tool that utilizes a federated statistical testing approach for efficient association tests that can correct for confounding fixed and additive polygenic random effects among different collaborating sites. FedGMMAT never shares genetic data among collaborating sites, and intermediate statistics are protected by encryption. Using simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that FedGMMAT can achieve virtually the same results as pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical resource requirements. Our approach is flexible to integrate multiple subject-level random effects and can be used in different study designs without explicit changes to the algorithmic setup and formulations. FedGMMAT adopts an efficient and flexible two-step score testing and integrates homomorphic encryption and a symmetric One-Time Pad-like encryption mechanism to protect intermediate statistics efficiently while being aggregated in the federated setting.
Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with ancestry-biased incidence and mortality rates. Polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ) have shown promise in predicting disease risk, including prostate cancer. However, the accuracy of PRSs in diverse populations, such as African and Asian populations, remains a concern for equitable use. In this study, we assessed the predictive power of six widely used PRS derivation algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biobank and All of Us cohorts. We find modest improvement in discriminatory ability when compared with a simple method that prioritizes variants, clumping, and published polygenic risk scores. Our findings underscore the importance of improving upon risk prediction algorithms and the sampling of diverse cohorts. We find that hierarchical clustering is adequate to stratify polygenic scores by ancestry and that PRS-stratified prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening may help reduce overdiagnosis and subsequent over-treatment associated with PSA screening alone. We demonstrate the utility of scores generated from the UK Biobank dataset and show that genetic risk coupled with participant age is sufficient to predict prostate cancer.
DPAGT1-CDG is a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by mutations in the DPAGT1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-linked glycosylation. We used a Drosophila model of DPAGT1-CDG with an improperly developed, small eye phenotype to perform a drug repurposing screen on 1, 520 small molecules that are 98% FDA/EMA-approved. We identified 42 candidate drugs that improved the DPAGT1-CDG model. Notably, we found that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DPAGT1-CDG model, suggesting that dopaminergic flux and subsequent binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DPAGT1 deficiency. This links dopamine signaling to N-glycosylation and represents a new potential therapeutic target for treating DPAGT1-CDG. We also genetically validated other top drug categories, including acetylcholine-related drugs, COX inhibitors, and an inhibitor of NKCC1. These drugs and subsequent analyses reveal novel biology in DPAGT1 mechanisms and may represent new therapeutic options for DPAGT1-CDG.
Proprioception, one of the least understood senses, plays a fundamental role in the control of movement. However, even basic questions about how limb pose is represented in the somatosensory cortex remain unclear. To address this, we developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity ( topo-VAE ) to compute a putative cortical map from a large set of natural movement data. Although not fitted to neural data, our model reproduces two sets of observations from monkey centre-out reaching: 1 ) the shape and velocity dependence of proprioceptive receptive fields in hand-centered coordinates, and 2 ) the distribution of neuronal preferred directions ( PDs ) recorded from multi-electrode arrays. Our model makes several testable predictions: 1 ) encoding across the cortex has a blob-and-pinwheel-type geometry of PDs, and 2 ) few neurons will encode just a single joint. Our model provides a principled basis for understanding of sensorimotor representations, and the theoretical basis of neural manifolds, with applications to the restoration of sensory feedback in brain-computer interfaces and the control of humanoid robots.
The role of ethylene in plant-microbe interactions has been extensively studied from the plant perspective, but only a small number of studies have examined the role of ethylene in microbes. Here, we demonstrate that Azospirillum brasilense, a plant-associated bacterium, contains a functional ethylene receptor that we call Azospirillum Ethylene Response1 ( AzoEtr1 ). AzoEtr1 directly binds ethylene with high affinity, and treating cells with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and colonization of plant root surfaces. Additionally, RNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics showed that ethylene causes wide-spread metabolic changes that affect carbon and nitrogen metabolism. One result is the accumulation of poly-hydroxybutyrate. Our data suggest a model in which ethylene from host plants alters the density of colonization by A. brasilense and re-wires its metabolism, suggesting that the bacterium implements an adaptation program upon sensing ethylene. These data provide potential new targets to regulate beneficial plant-microbe interactions.
In this study, we investigated the role of the INO80 protein in silencing genes on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. INO80 is the main catalytic subunit of the INO80-chromatin remodeling complex, which is critical for DNA repair and transcription regulation in murine spermatocytes. We found that INO80 immunolocalization at the XY body in pachytene spermatocytes suggested a role for INO80 in the meiotic sex body. Subsequent deletion of Ino80 resulted in high expression of sex-linked genes, and the active form of RNA polymerase II at the sex chromosomes of Ino80-null pachytene spermatocytes indicates incomplete inactivation of sex-linked genes. Furthermore, the recruitment of initiators of meiotic sex chromosome inhibition ( MSCI ) was reduced in Ino80-null pachytene spermatocytes, suggesting that INO80 facilitates the recruitment of DNA repair factors required for silencing sex-linked genes. This role of INO80 is independent of a common INO80 target, H2A. Z. Instead, in the absence of INO80, a reduction in chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites occurs on the sex chromosomes. These data suggest a role for INO80 in DNA repair factor localization, thereby facilitating the silencing of sex-linked genes during the onset of pachynema.
Axon regeneration in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is mediated by SVH-1, a dual-function growth factor belonging to the HGF/plasminogen family. SVH-1 acts as an HGF-like growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a plasminogen-like protease required for larval development. However, it is unclear how SVH-1 is converted from a protease to a growth factor for axon regeneration. In this study, we demonstrate that cytidine deaminase ( CDD ) SVH-17/CDD-2 plays a role in the functional conversion of SVH-1. We find that the codon exchange of His-755 to Tyr in the Asp–His–Ser catalytic triad of SVH-1 can suppress the cdd-2 defect in axon regeneration. Furthermore, the stem hairpin structure around the His-755 site in svh-1 mRNA is required for the activation of axon regeneration by SVH-1. These results suggest that CDD-2 promotes axon regeneration by transforming the function of SVH-1 from a protease to a growth factor through modification of svh-1 mRNA.
Collective behaviour in zebrafish is a valuable tool for assessing their physical and mental state, as well as the impact of ageing, disease genetics, and drug effects. The collective behaviour of zebrafish can be represented by active matter models, where the individuals are abstracted as interactive self-propelling agents. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of controlling the collective behaviour of biological active matter systems at the level of the constituents by genetically modifying zebrafish. We show that zebrafish carrying a homozygous deleterious mutation in the col11a2 gene ( col11a2-/- ) exhibit compromised vertebral column properties, bent their body less while swimming, and took longer to change their orientations. Surprisingly, a group of 25 mutant fish exhibited more orderly collective motion than the wildtype. We capture the collective behaviour of wildtype and col11a2-/- zebrafish with a simple active matter model, in which the mutant fish are modelled by self–propelling agents with a higher orientational noise on average. This demonstrates the possibility of tuning a biological system by changing the state space it occupies when interpreted with a simple active matter model.
Capillary plexus cultivation is a crucial aspect of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this paper, we developed a hybrid model for simulating short-term in vitro capillary incubations. We used the Cellular Potts model to predict individual cell migration, morphology change, and continuum mechanics to quantify biogel deformation and VEGF transport dynamics. The results showed good agreement between the predicted network topology and experiments, in which elongated cells connected, forming network cords and round cells gathered, creating cobblestone-like aggregates. The results revealed that the capillary-like networks could develop in high integrity only when the mechanical and chemical couplings worked adequately, with the cell morphology and haptotaxis driven by the soluble and bound forms of VEGF, respectively, functioning simultaneously. The capillary-like network development relied on adequate biogel deformation, a sufficient amount of bound VEGF, and the gradient of bound VEGF to offer spatial cues for the endothelial cells.
C. elegans has five TGF-β-like ligands: DBL-1, DAF-7, UNC-129, TIG-2, and TIG-3. We show that all five TGF-β ligands play a role in survival on bacterial pathogens and that multiple TGF-β ligand pairs act nonredundantly as part of this response. The two BMP-like ligands, DBL-1 and TIG-2, function independently of each other in the immune response, while TIG-2/BMP and the TGF-β/Activin-like ligand TIG-3 function together. Structural modeling supports the potential for TIG-2 and TIG-3 to form heterodimers. We identify TIG-2 and TIG-3 as members of a rare subset of TGF-β ligands lacking the conserved cysteine responsible for disulfide linking mature dimers. Canonical DBL-1/BMP receptor and Smad signal transducers function in the response to bacterial pathogens, while components of the DAF-7 TGF-β/Activin signaling pathway do not play a major role in survival. These results demonstrate a novel potential for BMP and TGF-β/Activin subfamily ligands to interact and may provide a mechanism for distinguishing the developmental and homeostatic functions of these ligands from an acute response such as the innate immune response to bacterial pathogens.
Here, we show that the epigenetic modifier N-terminal acetyltransferase 4 ( Nat4 ) is implicated in the response to DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nat4 is known to acetylate the alpha-amino group of serine 1 on histones H4 and H2A. We demonstrate that yeast cells lacking Nat4 have an increased sensitivity to DNA damage and accumulate more DNA breaks than wild-type cells. Upon DNA damage, NAT4 gene expression is elevated, and the enzyme is specifically recruited at double-strand breaks. Nat4-deleted cells exhibit lower levels of the damage-induced modification H2AS129ph ( γH2A ), accompanied by diminished binding of the checkpoint control protein Rad9 surrounding the double-strand break. Consequently, Mec1 kinase recruitment at double-strand breaks, critical for H2AS129ph deposition and Rad9 retention, is significantly impaired in nat4Δ cells. Importantly, we found that the effects of Nat4 in regulating the checkpoint signaling cascade are mediated by its N-terminal acetyltransferase activity targeted specifically towards histone H4. Overall, this study points towards a novel functional link between histone N-terminal acetyltransferase Nat4 and the DNA damage response ( DDR ), associating a new histone-modifying activity in the maintenance of genome integrity.
Cancer phylogenies, which describe the evolutionary history of genetically heterogeneous subpopulations of cells from the same cancer, offer valuable insights about cancer development and guide treatment strategies. However, existing methods for reconstructing cancer phylogenies using point mutations detected with bulk DNA sequencing become inaccurate when reconstructing phylogenies with more than 30 mutations, or fail to recover a phylogeny altogether. Here, we introduce Orchard, a cancer phylogeny reconstruction algorithm that is fast and accurate using up to 1000 mutations. Orchard samples without replacement from a factorized approximation of the posterior distribution over phylogenies, a novel result derived in this paper. Each factor in this approximate posterior corresponds to a conditional distribution for adding a new mutation to a partially built phylogeny. Orchard optimizes each factor sequentially, generating a sequence of incrementally larger phylogenies that ultimately culminate in a complete tree containing all mutations. Our evaluations demonstrate that Orchard outperforms state-of-the-art cancer phylogeny reconstruction methods in reconstructing more plausible phylogenies across 90 simulated cancers and 14 B-progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemias ( B-ALLs ). Additionally, we demonstrate that the large and accurate phylogenies reconstructed by Orchard are useful for identifying patterns of somatic mutations and genetic variations among distinct cancer cell subpopulations.
Immunogenicity prediction for CD8+ reactive epitopes is a challenging problem in the development of personalised medicines. Here, we describe ImmugenX, a modular protein language modelling approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance on pMHC immunogenicity prediction. ImmugenX comprises a pMHC encoding module trained on three pMHC prediction tasks, an optional TCR encoding module, and a set of context specific immunogenicity prediction head modules. The pMHC encoding module performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art models on pMHC binding affinity, eluted ligand prediction, and stability tasks. On pMHC immunogenicity prediction, ImmugenX outperforms all compared models with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0. 619 and average precision of 0. 514, a 7% increase in average precision compared to the next best model. The integration of TCR context information further improves ImmugenX’s performance on immunogenicity prediction.
Meat color is a primary indicator of meat quality and is characterized by lightness, redness, and yellowness. In this study, we used a genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) and gene-based association analysis with whole-genome resequencing of 230 fast-growing white-feathered chickens to map genes related to meat lightness and redness. We identified a 6. 24 kb QTL region ( GGA15: 6298. 34–6304. 58 kb ) and found that only the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit gamma ( PPP1CC ) was associated with meat color ( P = 8. 65E-08 ). The causal relationships between PPP1CC expression and meat lightness/redness were further validated through Mendelian randomization analyses ( P < 2. 9E-12 ). Inducible skeletal muscle-specific PPP1CC knockout ( PPP1CC-SSKO ) mice were generated and these mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin content in the limb muscles. In addition, the predominant myofiber shifted from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Through transcriptome and targeted metabolome evidence, we found that inhibition of PPP1CC decreased the expression of typical slow-twitch myofiber and myofiber-type specification genes and enhanced the glycolysis pathway. We also found that a SNP ( rs315520807, C > T ) located in the intron of PPP1CC could regulate the gene transcription activity.
Spatially nonlinear stimulus integration by retinal ganglion cells arises from the nonlinear transmission of signals that ganglion cells receive from bipolar cells, which constitute functional subunits within a ganglion cell’s receptive field. Inferring these subunits from recorded ganglion cell activity promises a new avenue for studying the functional architecture of the retina. Here, we introduce super-resolved tomographic reconstruction ( STR ) as a technique to efficiently stimulate and locate receptive field subunits. STR combines concepts from super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography and can potentially reveal comprehensive subunit layouts within only a few tens of minutes of recording time. This makes it ideal for online analysis and closed-loop investigations of receptive field substructure in retina recordings. In this manuscript, we investigate the potential of STR via comprehensive modelling and electrophysiological recordings from primate retinal ganglion cells. Simulations demonstrate that STR can reliably identify subunits across a wide range of model variations, and application in recordings of primate parasol ganglion cells validates the experimental feasibility of STR. By knowing the subunit locations, targeted stimuli can be manufactured to characterize the spatiotemporal integration properties, nonlinearities and functional synaptic weight of each subunit, and evaluate their similarity across multiple subunits within one ganglion cell receptive field.
CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) is a powerful tool for identifying chemical-genetic interactions ( CGIs ), which can provide insights into drug targets and mechanisms of action or resistance. Here, we describe a novel statistical method called CRISPRi-DR ( for Dose-Response model ) that incorporates both sgRNA efficiencies and drug concentrations in a modified dose-response equation. CRISPRi-DR captures the non-linear interaction between sgRNA efficiency and drug sensitivity, where the effect of drug concentration on relative abundance of mutants is maximized for sgRNAs of intermediate strength. We show that the most efficient sgRNAs are not always optimal for detecting synergies with drugs, and that the actual growth phenotype depends on the sensitivity of cells to depletion of the target protein. CRISPRi-DR can be used to re-analyze data from a recent CGI experiment in Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify genes that interact with antibiotics. We also show that CRISPRi-DR can be generalized to non-CGI datasets, such as a CRISPRi dataset for E. coli growth on different carbon sources. The performance of CRISPRi-DR is competitive with the best of several related analytical methods. However, for noisier datasets, CRISPRi-DR maintains higher precision, which we observed in both empirical and simulated data. CRISPRi-DR requires that there are multiple sgRNAs for each target in the library, that the sgRNAs vary in predicted strength, and that the actual efficiencies of the sgRNAs have been experimentally quantified in control conditions.
Gene co-expression networks are a common tool for extracting biological insight from gene expression data. However, most community detection algorithms assume that genes are organized into assortative modules, that is, groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. Here, we use a recently developed community detection method, the weighted degree corrected stochastic block model ( SBM ), that does not assume that assortative modules exist. Instead, the SBM attempts to efficiently use all information contained in the co-expression network to separate the genes into hierarchically organized blocks of genes. Using RNAseq gene expression data measured in two tissues derived from an outbred population of Drosophila melanogaster, we show that ( a ) the SBM is able to find ten times as many groups as competing methods, that ( b ) several of those gene groups are not modular, and that ( c ) the functional enrichment for non-modular groups is as strong as for modular communities. These results show that the transcriptome is structured in more complex ways than traditionally thought and that we should revisit the long-standing assumption that modularity is the main driver of the structuring of gene co-expression networks.
PABPC, also known as Pab1 in yeast, is a protein involved in multiple steps of post-transcriptional control, including translation initiation, translation termination, and mRNA decay. To understand both the direct and indirect roles of PABPC in more detail, we have employed mass spectrometry to assess the abundance of the components of the yeast proteome, as well as RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq to analyze changes in the abundance and translation of the yeast transcriptome, in cells lacking the PAB1 gene. We find that pab1Δ cells manifest drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, as well as defects in translation initiation and termination. Defects in translation initiation and the stabilization of specific classes of mRNAs in pab1Δ cells appear to be partly indirect consequences of reduced levels of specific initiation factors, decapping activators, and components of the deadenylation complex in addition to the general loss of Pab1’s direct role in these processes. Cells devoid of Pab1 also manifested a nonsense codon readthrough phenotype indicative of a defect in translation termination. Our results indicate that, unlike the loss of simpler regulatory proteins, elimination of cellular Pab1 is profoundly pleiotropic and disruptive to numerous aspects of post-transcriptional regulation.
Slow brain rhythms, such as those occurring during slow-wave sleep or pathological conditions like seizures and spreading depolarization, can be accompanied by oscillations in extracellular potassium concentration. These slow brain rhythms typically have a lower frequency than tonic action-potential firing and are assumed to arise from network-level mechanisms or intrinsically bursting neurons. Here, we explore an alternative mechanism for generating slow brain rhythms based on the interplay of fast-spiking voltage dynamics with a one-dimensional slow dynamics of the extracellular potassium concentration, mediated by the activity of the Na+/K+-ATPase. We use bifurcation analysis of the complete system as well as the slow-fast method to reveal that this coupling suffices to generate a hysteresis loop organized around a bistable region that emerges from a saddle-node loop bifurcation–a common feature of class I excitable neurons. Depending on the strength of the Na+/K+-ATPase, bursts are generated from pump-induced shearing of the bifurcation structure, spiking is tonic, or cells are silenced via depolarization block. We suggest that transitions between these dynamics can result from disturbances in extracellular potassium regulation, such as glial malfunction or hypoxia affecting the Na+/K+-ATPase activity. The identified minimal mechanistic model outlining the sodium-potassium pump’s generic contribution to burst dynamics can contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of pathologies such as epilepsy syndromes and inform therapeutic strategies.
We present COPS, a novel R-package for robust evaluation of single and multi-omics clustering results. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel-based approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway knowledge integration. We rigorously applied COPS to multi-omics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, using mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and DNA methylation data. Unlike previous studies, our approach contrasts data- and knowledge-driven multi-view clustering methods and incorporates cross-fold validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using the ARI score, survival analysis via Cox regression models including relevant covariates, and the stability of the results. We applied the Pareto efficiency concept to gauge the equilibrium of evaluation metrics in each cancer case-study. Affinity Network Fusion, Integrative Non-negative Matrix Factorization, and Multiple Kernel K-Means with linear or Pathway Induced Kernels were the most stable and effective in discerning groups with significantly different survival outcomes in several case studies. Our findings provide insights into the potential of multi-omics clustering analysis for cancer subtyping and may have implications for improving patient stratification and personalized treatment. We emphasize the importance of assessing multi-view clustering methods using multiple criteria, from cluster stability to prognostic relevance, and provide ways of comparing these metrics simultaneously to select the optimal approach for disease subtype discovery in novel datasets.
In C. elegans, the SoxC transcription factor SEM-2 is essential for embryonic development and for specifying the sex myoblast ( SM ) fate in the postembryonic mesoderm, the M lineage. We have identified a novel partial loss-of-function sem-2 allele that has a proline to serine change in the C-terminal tail of the highly conserved DNA-binding domain. Detailed analyses of mutant animals harboring this point mutation uncovered new functions of SEM-2 in the M lineage. SEM-2 functions antagonistically with LET-381, the sole C. elegans FoxF/C forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the M lineage. In addition to specifying the SM fate, SEM-2 is essential for the proliferation and diversification of the SM lineage. Furthermore, SEM-2 appears to directly regulate the expression of hlh-8, which encodes a basic helix-loop-helix Twist transcription factor and plays critical roles in proper patterning of the M lineage. Our data, along with previous studies, suggest an evolutionarily conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins. Our work identified new interactions in the gene regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembryonic development and adds to the general understanding of the structure-function relationship of SoxC proteins.
