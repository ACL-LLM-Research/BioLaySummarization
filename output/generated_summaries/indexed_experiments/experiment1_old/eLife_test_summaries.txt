Electrical synapses are a modality of neuronal communication mediated by structures known as gap junctions ( GJs ). While the molecular complexity of chemical synapses has long been recognized, less is known regarding the molecular and structural complexity of electrical synapses. In this study, we investigated the structural organization of electrical synapses at single synaptic contacts on the zebrafish Mauthner cells, at which gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release. We used expansion microscopy to expose the presence and spatial arrangement of synaptic components in these contacts. Our results revealed that most of the synaptic contact’s surface was occupied by interleaving gap junctions and components of adherens junctions, suggesting a close functional association between these two structures. In contrast, glutamate receptors were confined to small peripheral portions of the contact, indicating that most of the synaptic area functions as an electrical synapse. Thus, our results revealed the overarching organization of an electrical synapse that operates with not one, but multiple gap junctions, in close association with structural and signaling molecules known to be components of adherens junctions. The relationship between these intercellular structures will aid in establishing the boundaries of electrical synapses found throughout animal connectomes and provide insight into the structural organization and functional diversity of electrical synapses.
The pre-Bötzinger complex ( preBötC ) is a primary generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm and contains neurons that project directly to facial nucleus ( 7n ) motoneurons to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. To further understand the identity of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons, we used a combination of optogenetic viral transgenic approaches to demonstrate that selective photoinhibition of these neurons affects mystacial pad activity, with minimal effects on breathing. These effects are altered by the type of anesthetic employed and also between anesthetized and conscious states. The population of 7n-projecting preBötC neurons we transduced consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons that also send collaterals to multiple brainstem nuclei involved with the regulation of autonomic activity. We show that modulation of subgroups of preBötC neurons, based on their axonal projections, is a useful strategy to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that coordinate and integrate breathing with different motor and physiological behaviors. This is of fundamental importance, given that abnormal respiratory modulation of autonomic activity and orofacial behaviors have been associated with the development and progression of diseases.
Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide ( CGRP ) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus ( PBN ) represent aversive information and signal a general alarm to the forebrain. These neurons are thought to modulate both passive and active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. However, most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably by amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception, and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger.
The relationship between obesity and the structure of the human brain is not yet fully understood. Using diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data from approximately 30, 000 participants in the UK Biobank, we tested the hypothesis that obesity, as measured by waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ), is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction ( ISOVF ), an index of free water, and intra-cellular volume fraction ( ICVF ), an index of neurite density. We found significant associations between obesity and two distinct brain systems: a prefrontal/temporal/striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal/occipital/striatal system associated with ICVF. The ISOVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high density of mu opioid ( MOR ) and other neurotransmitter receptors. In contrast, the ICVF~WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. We estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF ( rg = 0. 026, P = 0. 36 ) and ICVF ( rg = 0. 112, P < 9×10−4 ), as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein ( CRP ) for ISOVF and ICVF ( P<0. 05 ). These results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation.
Cancer stem cells ( CSCs ) are known to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) to drive metastatic dissemination in experimental cancer models. However, the relevance of EMT CSCs to human cancer has been uncertain, as tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating into the tissue surrounding human tumour specimens. We have previously identified EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers that, alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin, identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines. In this study, we investigated whether the combination of these three markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours. We stained for EpCAM and CD24 alongside Vimentin in over 12, 000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours, stratified on metastatic status, and identified cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the stromal region surrounding metastatic primary tumours. Using an image-based machine learning approach, we show that the presence of these EMT CSCs in the tumour stroma is predictive of metastasis. Importantly, the presence of these disseminating stem cells is strongly correlated with tumour metastasis. Using an image-based machine learning approach, we have demonstrated the ability to predict metastasis with high accuracy through staining for EMT CSCs. We have also shown that retention of EpCAM is not on its own sufficient alongside Vimentin to mark disseminating EMT CSCs that correlate with metastasis. We have identified single EMT CSCs disseminating into the stroma surrounding oral tumours, and used these to train an artificial neural network ( ANN ) to predict metastasis with high accuracy ( cross-validated accuracy of 87–89% ).
Apoptosis and clearance of apoptotic cells via efferocytosis are evolutionarily conserved processes that drive tissue repair. However, the mechanisms by which recognition and clearance of apoptotic cells regulate repair are not fully understood. Here, we use single-cell RNA sequencing to provide a map of the cellular dynamics during early inflammation in mouse skin wounds. We find that apoptotic pathways and efferocytosis receptors are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident Lyve1+ macrophages, during inflammation. Interestingly, human diabetic foot wounds upregulate mRNAs for efferocytosis pathway genes and display altered efferocytosis signaling via the receptor Axl and its ligand Gas6. During early inflammation in mouse wounds, we detect upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR3-independent mechanisms. Inhibition studies in vivo in mice reveal that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but is dispensable for efferocytosis. By contrast, inhibition of another efferocytosis receptor, Timd4, in mouse wounds decreases efferocytosis and abrogates wound repair. These data highlight the distinct mechanisms by which apoptotic cell detection coordinates tissue repair and provide potential therapeutic targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients. We provide an atlas for the dynamic changes that occur in the early inflammatory stage of wound repair in the skin at the single-cell level. We found that apoptotic and efferocytosis pathways were upregulated in distinct cell types in mouse wounds and in diabetic foot wounds of human patients. Using functional inhibition studies in mouse wounds, our data show that efferocytosis receptors, Axl and Timd4, have differential effects on efferocytosis and wound repair. We also found that mRNAs encoding efferocytosis receptors and signaling pathways are upregulated in the early skin wound beds and in diabetic foot wounds, and confirmed protein upregulation of the efferocytosis receptors Axl and Timd4 in murine wounds.
Advances in single-cell sequencing technologies have greatly improved our understanding of gene expression and cellular heterogeneity within tissues. However, linking anatomical information to transcriptomic data and identifying the cell types that correspond to gene expression clusters in single-cell sequencing data sets remains a challenge. To address this challenge, we describe a novel genetic barcoding approach called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplexing ( TaG-EM ) that enables in vivo tagging of defined cell populations in Drosophila. TaG-EM involves inserting a DNA barcode just upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal4-inducible UAS-GFP construct so that the barcode sequence can be read out during single-cell sequencing, labeling a cell population of interest. By creating many independently barcoded fly strains, TaG-EM enables positive identification of cell types in cell atlas projects, identification of multiplet droplets, and barcoding of experimental timepoints, conditions, and replicates. Furthermore, we demonstrate that TaG-EM barcodes can be read out using next-generation sequencing to facilitate population-scale behavioral measurements. Thus, TaG-EM has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens in addition to improving the ability to multiplex and reliably annotate single-cell transcriptomic experiments. We have developed a straightforward genetic barcoding approach that takes advantage of the powerful genetic tools available in Drosophila to allow deterministic in vivo tagging of defined cell populations. TaG-EM provides a means to target and label cells in vivo for subsequent detection in single-cell sequencing. Moreover, these genetic barcodes can be used to multiplex behavioral or other phenotypic measurements. Thus, TaG-EM provides a flexible system for barcoding cells and organisms.
Poison frogs of the family Dendrobatidae have evolved the novel ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for chemical defense at least three times. However, our understanding of how chemical defense evolved in this group is incomplete due to a lack of attention paid to inconspicuous species that are often assumed to be undefended. Here, we provide new data showing that, in contrast to previous studies, species from each undefended poison frog clade have measurable yet low amounts of alkaloids. We confirm that undefended dendrobatids regularly consume mites and ants, which are known sources of alkaloids. Thus, our data suggest that diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. We propose the existence of a phenotypic intermediate between toxin consumption and sequestration — passive accumulation — that differs from sequestration in that it involves no derived forms of transport and storage mechanisms yet results in low levels of toxin accumulation. We discuss the concept of passive accumulation and its potential role in the origin of chemical defenses in poison frogs and other toxin-sequestering organisms. In light of ideas from pharmacokinetics, we incorporate new and old data from poison frogs into an evolutionary model that could help explain the origins of acquired chemical defenses in animals and provide insight into the molecular processes that govern the fate of ingested toxins. We propose that passive accumulation of consumed alkaloids is an ancestral state in Dendrobatidae, and possibly in related taxa, and that selection acts on toxin elimination and resistance to result in toxin accumulation and chemical defense.
Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition ( EMT ) is a process by which epithelial cells acquire a mesenchymal phenotype, contributing to chemotherapy resistance and metastasis in advanced breast cancer. EMT is a complex process involving redundant signaling pathways and its reversal, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition ( MET ), which has hindered the development of effective treatments. In this study, we utilized a Tri-PyMT EMT lineage-tracing model in mice and single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) to analyze the EMT status of tumor cells. Our findings revealed that ribosome biogenesis ( RiBi ) is elevated during the transitioning phases of both EMT and MET processes. RiBi and its subsequent nascent protein synthesis, mediated by ERK and mTOR signaling, are essential for EMT/MET completion. Importantly, inhibiting excessive RiBi genetically or pharmacologically impaired the EMT/MET capability of tumor cells. Combining RiBi inhibition with chemotherapy drugs synergistically reduced metastatic outgrowth of epithelial and mesenchymal tumor cells under chemotherapies. Our study suggests that targeting the RiBi pathway presents a promising strategy for treating patients with advanced breast cancer.
Pearl millet is one of the most heat and drought tolerant cereal crops that provides a vital food source across the sub-Saharan Sahel region. We hypothesize that the fast-growing primary root of pearl millet is an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Using crop modeling, we demonstrate that early drought stress is an important constraint in agrosystems in the Sahel where pearl millet was domesticated. Furthermore, we show that increased pearl millet primary root growth is correlated with increased early water stress tolerance in field conditions. Genetics including genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) approaches identify genomic regions controlling this key root trait. Combining gene expression data, re-sequencing and re-annotation of one of these genomic regions identified a glutaredoxin-encoding gene PgGRXC9 as the candidate stress resilience root growth regulator. Functional characterization of its closest Arabidopsis homolog AtROXY19 revealed a novel role for this glutaredoxin ( GRX ) gene clade in regulating cell elongation. In summary, our study suggests a conserved function for GRX genes in conferring root cell elongation and enhancing resilience of pearl millet to its Sahelian environment. Our analysis confirms that early drought episodes are a major constraint in Sahelian agrosystems of West Africa affecting crops during the vegetative stage. In order to test if a fast-growing primary root after germination might be an adaptive trait to early drought stress, we first phenotyped a diversity panel of pearl millet inbred lines representative of the genetic diversity of the crop. We show that early drought stress after germination is a major constraint in Sahelian environments and that primary root growth is correlated with increased tolerance to this stress under field conditions in pearl millet. Correlations between variables adjusted means across the two field trials showed a strong and significant relationship between early primary root growth and stay-green at the vegetative stage, an indicator of plant tolerance to drought stress. Hence, our field experiments support the hypothesis that rapid growth of the primary root is beneficial for pearl millet plants to cope with early drought stress episodes after germination. Differences in root growth seem to be mainly regulated by changes in cell elongation.
The brain is capable of integrating information from multiple sensory modalities to form coherent conceptual representations, a process that is essential for navigating the complex nature of real-world experiences. However, how words and their associated concepts are encoded in the brain during real-world processing is still unknown. Here, we investigated the representational structure of concrete and abstract concepts during movie watching to address the extent to which brain responses dynamically change depending on visual context. We found that across contexts, concrete and abstract concepts encode different experience-based information in separable sets of brain regions. However, these differences are reduced when multimodal context is considered. Specifically, the response profile of abstract words becomes more concrete-like when processed in visual scenes highly related to their meaning. Conversely, when the visual context is unrelated to a given concrete word, the activation pattern resembles more that of abstract conceptual processing. These results suggest that while concepts generally encode habitual experiences, the underlying neurobiological organisation is not fixed but depends dynamically on available contextual information.
Nonsense-mediated decay ( NMD ) is an intrinsic cellular pathway that conceals neoantigens through the destruction of the RNA products from genes harboring truncating mutations. This limits the broad application of cancer immunotherapy. We developed and conducted a high-throughput screen to identify critical mediators of NMD in human cells. This screen implicated disruption of kinase SMG1’s phosphorylation of UPF1 as a potential disruptor of NMD. We designed a novel SMG1 inhibitor, KVS0001, that elevates the expression of transcripts and proteins resulting from human and murine truncating mutations in vitro and murine cells in vivo. Most importantly, KVS0001 concomitantly increases the presentation of immune-targetable human leukocyte antigens ( HLA ) class I-associated peptides from NMD-downregulated proteins on the surface of human cancer cells. KVS0001 provides new opportunities for studying NMD and the diseases in which NMD plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases. Inhibition of NMD with KVS0001 at concentrations as low as 600 nM led to equal expression of wild-type and mutant transcripts, suggesting near total blockade of the NMD pathway. Western blotting showed that KVS0001 substantially decreases the amount of phosphorylated UPF1, the downstream target of SMG1 kinase activity, in three different cell lines. We investigated whether KVS0001 could similarly alter the cell surface presentation of proteins from genes harboring truncating mutations in NCI-H358 and LS180 cells. Treatment of NCI-H358 and LS180 cancer cell lines with a previously reported SMG1-specific small molecule inhibitor, SMG1i-11, resulted in specific increases in the transcripts and proteins from genes with truncating mutations, just as did KVS0001. KVS0001 was a specific inhibitor of SMG1 that was soluble and could easily be administered to mice.
In the UK Biobank, we examined the association of Phenotypic Age Acceleration ( PhenoAgeAccel ) with cancer incidence by genetic risk group among 374, 463 participants. We generated PhenoAge using chronological age and nine biomarkers, and PhenoAgeAccel after subtracting the effect of chronological age by regression residual. We also generated an incidence-weighted overall cancer polygenic risk score ( CPRS ) based on 20 cancer site-specific polygenic risk scores ( PRSs ). Compared with biologically younger participants, those older had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer, with hazard ratios ( HRs ) of 1. 22 ( 95% confidence interval, 1. 18–1. 27 ) in men, and 1. 26 ( 1. 22–1. 31 ) in women, respectively. A joint effect of genetic risk and PhenoAgeAccel was observed on overall cancer risk, with HRs of 2. 29 ( 2. 10–2. 51 ) for men and 1. 94 ( 1. 78–2. 11 ) for women with high genetic risk and older PhenoAge compared with those with low genetic risk and younger PhenoAge. PhenoAgeAccel was negatively associated with the number of healthy lifestyle factors ( Beta = –1. 01 in men, p<0. 001; Beta = –0. 98 in women, p<0. 001 ). Within and across genetic risk groups, older PhenoAge was consistently related to an increased risk of incident cancer with adjustment for chronological age. Our study showed that accelerated aging, which was measured by PhenoAgeAccel, was consistently related to an increased risk of several site-specific cancer and overall cancer with adjustment for chronological age, within and across genetic risk groups. In further stratification analyses by genetic risk category with younger PhenoAge as the reference group, we confirmed that older PhenoAge was significantly associated with a higher incident cancer risk across genetic risk groups. Among participants at high genetic risk, the standardized 5 year incident cancer rates were 5. 78% and 4. 58% for biologically younger men and women versus 6. 90% and 5. 17% for those older, respectively.
Species distribution models ( SDMs ) are statistical tools used to assess biodiversity at specific sites while accounting for biases in survey efforts. SDMs use species occurrence records and environmental conditions to estimate the potential geographic ranges and suitable habitats for species. Here, we investigated the quality of community-based data gathered through the smartphone app Biome and its impact on SDM performance in Japan. We assessed the quality of occurrence records by investigating the fractions of non-wild and misidentified records. Species identification accuracy exceeded 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but was below 90% for seed plants, molluscs, and fishes. Our SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan revealed that incorporating Biome data into traditional survey data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional survey data required >2000 records for accurate models ( Boyce index ≥ 0. 9 ), while blending the two data sources reduced this to around 300. The uniform coverage of urban-natural gradients by Biome data, compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas, may explain this improvement. Combining multiple data sources better estimates species distributions, aiding in protected area designation and ecosystem service assessment. The inclusion of Biome data resulted in improved accuracy of SDMs. The most accurate model predictions were obtained when the training data consisted of 50–70% Biome data, highlighting the necessity of incorporating both traditional surveys and citizen observations for a comprehensive understanding of species distributions.
Congenital pulmonary cysts are a result of abnormal lung development, but the mechanisms underlying this process are not well understood. In this study, we used genetic mouse models to investigate the role of bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) receptor 1a ( Bmpr1a ) -mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchyme during prenatal lung development. We found that abrogation of mesenchymal Bmpr1a disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial elastin fibers were found in the cystic airways of the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. In addition, ectopic mesenchymal expression of BMP ligands and airway epithelial perturbation of the Sox2-Sox9 proximal-distal axis were detected in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs. However, deletion of Smad1/5, two major BMP signaling downstream effectors, from the lung mesenchyme did not phenocopy the cystic abnormalities observed in the mesenchymal Bmpr1a knockout lungs, suggesting that a Smad-independent mechanism contributes to prenatal pulmonary cystic lesions. These findings reveal for the first time the role of mesenchymal BMP signaling in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital pulmonary cysts. Our study provides solid in vivo evidence for the first time that Bmpr1a-mediated BMP signaling in lung mesenchymal cells is indispensable in lung development. Lung mesenchymal deletion of Bmpr1a at an early developmental stage causes abnormal branching morphogenesis and then severe lung cysts at late gestation in mice. This aberrant epithelial growth may also contribute to airway cyst formation, as multiple mouse models have suggested that loss of Sox2+ or expansion of Sox9+ in airway epithelia are associated with altered epithelial differentiation and branching, as well as cystic pathology in fetal lungs ( Wang et al., 2013; Liberti et al., 2019; Rockich et al., 2013 ). In summary, mesenchymal Bmpr1a is essential for lung development, particularly airway branching morphogenesis.
Lipid molecules, including phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate ( PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 ), have been implicated in the regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ). However, the role of the spatiotemporal dynamics of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 in the regulation of EGFR activity in living cells has not been fully understood. Here, we used super-resolution single-molecule microscopy to visualize both EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. We found that EGFR and PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains aggregated before stimulation with epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) through transient visits of EGFR to the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EGF stimulation and depended on phospholipase Cγ ( PLCγ ), the EGFR effector that hydrolyzes PI ( 4, 5 ) P2. Artificial reduction in the PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 content of the plasma membrane reduced both the dimerization and autophosphorylation of EGFR after stimulation with EGF. Inhibition of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 hydrolysis after EGF stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EGFR-Thr654. Thus, EGFR kinase activity and the density of PI ( 4, 5 ) P2 around EGFR molecules were found to be mutually regulated.
Stramenopiles are a clade of diverse eukaryotic organisms that include multicellular algae, fish and plant pathogenic oomycetes, and the human intestinal protozoan Blastocystis. In contrast to most eukaryotes, stramenopiles have a branched glycolysis in which the enzymes of the pay-off phase are located in both the cytosol and the mitochondrial matrix. Here, we identify a mitochondrial carrier in Blastocystis that can transport glycolytic intermediates, such as dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial inner membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. The glycolytic intermediate carrier has lost its ability to transport the canonical substrates malate and oxoglutarate. Blastocystis lacks several key components of oxidative phosphorylation required for the generation of mitochondrial ATP, such as complexes III and IV, ATP synthase, and ADP/ATP carriers. The presence of the glycolytic pay-off phase in the mitochondrial matrix generates ATP, which powers energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, as well as NADH, used by mitochondrial complex I to generate a proton motive force to drive the import of proteins and molecules. Given its unique substrate specificity and central role in carbon and energy metabolism, the carrier for glycolytic intermediates identified here represents a specific drug and pesticide target against stramenopile pathogens, which are of great economic importance.
We propose a new framework for human genetic association studies: the Haplotype Function Score ( HFS ). This framework uses a deep learning model to calculate a functional genomic activity score for each haplotype in an individual, replacing the original genotype in association studies. We applied the HFS framework to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank and identified 3619 independent HFS–trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10−8. Fine-mapping revealed 2699 causal associations, corresponding to a median increase of 63 causal findings per trait compared with single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) -based analysis. HFS-based enrichment analysis uncovered 727 pathway–trait associations and 153 tissue–trait associations with strong biological interpretability, including ‘circadian pathway-chronotype’ and ‘arachidonic acid-intelligence’. We also applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( LASSO ) regression to integrate HFS prediction score with SNP-based polygenic risk scores, which showed an improvement of 16. 1–39. 8% in cross-ancestry polygenic prediction. Our results demonstrate that the HFS framework offers a unique improvement in the biological interpretation and polygenic prediction of complex traits compared to classic SNP-based methods.
The hippocampus plays a central role in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is responsible for the body's response to stress. The current study investigated the effects of three different types of 3-month mental training modules on hippocampal structure and function in healthy adults. The training modules targeted either attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective skills, or socio-cognitive skills. We evaluated changes in hippocampal subfield volume and intrinsic functional connectivity, as well as diurnal and chronic cortisol levels, in 332 healthy adults. We found that only the socio-affective training module, which focused on cultivating compassion and care, was associated with an increase in hippocampal CA1-3 subfield volume, as well as corresponding changes in functional connectivity and a reduction in total diurnal cortisol output. These changes were not observed in the attention-based or socio-cognitive training modules, or in a waitlist cohort with no training intervention. Furthermore, we found that training-induced changes in CA1-3 structure and function consistently correlated with reductions in cortisol output. Using a multivariate approach, we also found that other hippocampal subfields that did not show group-level changes also contributed to changes in cortisol levels. Overall, we provide a link between a socio-emotional behavioral intervention, changes in hippocampal subfield structure and function, and reductions in cortisol in healthy adults.
Local adaptation is a process by which populations become better suited to their environment over time. It often involves alleles of large effect, which experience fitness advantages when in positive linkage disequilibrium ( LD ). Segregating inversions, which suppress recombination and facilitate the maintenance of LD between locally adapted loci, are commonly found to be associated with adaptive divergence. However, it is unclear what fraction of an adaptive response can be attributed to inversions and alleles of large effect, and whether the loci within an inversion could still drive adaptation in the absence of its recombination-suppressing effect. Here, we use genome-wide association studies to explore patterns of local adaptation in three species of sunflower: Helianthus annuus, Helianthus argophyllus, and Helianthus petiolaris, which each harbour a large number of species-specific inversions. We find evidence of significant genome-wide repeatability in signatures of association to phenotypes and environments, which are particularly enriched within regions of the genome harbouring an inversion in one species. This shows that while inversions may facilitate local adaptation, at least some of the loci can still harbour mutations that make substantial contributions without the benefit of recombination suppression in species lacking a segregating inversion. While a large number of genomic regions show evidence of repeated adaptation, most of the strongest signatures of association still tend to be species-specific, indicating substantial genotypic redundancy for local adaptation in these species. We estimate the number of regions genome-wide that could potentially contribute to local adaptation for each variable and phenotype, which is related to the genotypic redundancy. Our results show that local adaptation in sunflowers tends to involve both strong repeatability at a small number of genes, often associated with inversions, coupled with high redundancy and non-repeated responses across a much larger number of loci. Most of the sunflower inversions are >1 My old, and therefore predate any current local adaptation patterns, but likely do not predate the genes underlying local adaptation ( which appear to be shared among the species we studied ). Taken together, these results suggest that some fraction of the genome contributes to adaptation with low redundancy and high repeatability ( which tends to be enriched within genomic regions where there exist inversions in at least one species ), while the remainder of the adaptive response is driven by loci with high redundancy and species-specific contributions. The observed repeatability associated with inversions further supports the local adaptation model as an explanation for the long-term persistence of segregating inversions ( at least in sunflower ), rather than mechanisms based on dominance or meiotic drive.
Mammary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells are the two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages of the mammary epithelium. These cells are the putative cells-of-origin for breast cancers, and we hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increase susceptibility to cancer initiation. We generated and analyzed transcriptomes from primary luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells from younger ( <30 years old ) and older ( >55 years old ) women. In addition to age-dependent directional changes in gene expression, we observed increased transcriptional variance with age that contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and involved altered regulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1. Epithelial expression variance of gap junction protein GJB6 increased with age, and modulation of GJB6 expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells. Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal that could be detected in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was highly predictive of breast cancer subtype. We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue, and that their emergent phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and represents a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility.
Plant scientists have long sought to understand the genetic basis of natural variation in plant resistance to pests. However, this usually requires large and labor-intensive phenotyping experiments. In this study, we explored the possibility that non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing can serve as phenotyping proxies for addressing such questions. We used data from a whole-genome and -epigenome sequencing study of 207 natural lines of field pennycress ( Thlaspi arvense ) that were grown in a common environment and spontaneously colonized by aphids, mildew, and other microbes. We found that the numbers of non-target reads assigned to the pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP-based heritability, and were associated with climate of origin and baseline glucosinolate contents. Specifically, pennycress lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, presumably less favorable to aphids, showed higher aphid DNA load, i. e., decreased aphid resistance. Genome-wide association analyses identified genetic variants at known defense genes but also novel genomic regions associated with variation in aphid and mildew DNA load. Moreover, we found several differentially methylated regions associated with pathogen loads, in particular differential methylation at transposons and hypomethylation in the promoter of a gene involved in stomatal closure, likely induced by pathogens. Our study provides first insights into the defense mechanisms of Thlaspi arvense, a rising crop and model species, and demonstrates that non-target whole-genome sequencing reads, usually discarded, can be leveraged to estimate intensities of plant biotic interactions.
Malaria control and eradication efforts are hindered by the emergence of drug resistance, necessitating the development of novel therapeutic strategies. Drug combinations based on collateral sensitivity, wherein resistance to one drug causes increased sensitivity to the partner drug, have been proposed as an evolutionary strategy to suppress the emergence of resistance in pathogen populations. In this study, we explore collateral sensitivity between compounds targeting the Plasmodium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ( DHODH ). We profiled the cross-resistance and collateral sensitivity phenotypes of several DHODH mutant lines to a diverse panel of DHODH inhibitors. We focus on one compound, TCMDC-125334, which was active against all mutant lines tested, including the DHODH C276Y line, which arose in selections with the clinical candidate DSM265. In six selections with TCMDC-125334, the most common mechanism of resistance to this compound was copy number variation of the dhodh locus, although we did identify one mutation, DHODH I263S, which conferred resistance to TCMDC-125334 but not DSM265. We found that selection of the DHODH C276Y mutant with TCMDC-125334 yielded additional genetic changes in the dhodh locus. These double mutant parasites exhibited decreased sensitivity to TCMDC-125334 and were highly resistant to DSM265. Finally, we tested whether collateral sensitivity could be exploited to suppress the emergence of resistance in the context of combination treatment by exposing wildtype parasites to both DSM265 and TCMDC-125334 simultaneously. This selected for parasites with a DHODH V532A mutation which were cross-resistant to both compounds and were as fit as the wildtype parent in vitro. The emergence of these cross-resistant, evolutionarily fit parasites highlights the mutational flexibility of the DHODH enzyme.
Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the deadliest form of malaria, is a major public health concern in sub-Saharan Africa, where most infections occur. However, resistance to antimalarial drugs often emerges in low-transmission regions outside of Africa. The relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance is not well understood, possibly due to the lack of consideration of antigenic diversity, host immunity, and selection for resistance in existing models. To address this, we developed a novel compartmental model that tracks sensitive and resistant parasite strains, as well as the host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. Our results show that there is a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance frequency, regardless of resistance cost or efficacy. This trend is supported by validation using chloroquine-resistant marker data. We also show that post-discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while it steadily decreases in high-diversity, high-transmission regions. Our study underscores the critical role of malaria strain diversity in the biogeographic patterns of resistance evolution. We show that strain diversity and associated strain-specific host immunity, dynamically tracked through the macroparasitic structure, can predict the complex relationship between transmission intensity and drug resistance frequencies. Our model implies that control protocols should vary from region to region and that there is no one-size-fits-all cure for malaria control worldwide. The inclusion of strain diversity in the model provides a new mechanistic explanation as to why Southeast Asia has persisting resistance to certain antimalarial drugs, including chloroquine, despite a lower transmission intensity than Africa. In these regions with low strain diversity, parasites cannot repeatedly reinfect hosts, and clinically immune hosts do not carry infections very often.
Cannabis is the most consumed illicit psychoactive drug in the world and is increasingly used by pregnant women. However, the impact of phytocannabinoids, such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( Δ9-THC ), on early embryonic development is not well understood. Here, we investigate the effects of Δ9-THC on early embryonic development using a stepwise in vitro differentiation system that captures the early embryonic developmental cascade. We demonstrate that Δ9-THC increases the proliferation of naive mouse embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) but not of their primed counterpart. This increased proliferation is dependent on the CB1 receptor binding and is associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ9-THC capitalizes on ESCs’ metabolic bivalence by increasing their glycolytic rates and anabolic capabilities. A memory of this metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Primordial Germ Cell-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with an alteration of their transcriptional profile. These results represent the first in-depth molecular characterization of the impact of Δ9-THC exposure on early stages of germline development.
Zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) is an ideal species for studying copy number variation ( CNV ) in large gene families because it has hundreds of NLR immune genes. By sequencing 93 zebrafish from multiple wild and laboratory populations, we identified a total of 1513 NLRs, many more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of those are present in all wild populations, but only 4% were found in 80% or more of the individual fish. Wild fish have up to two times as many NLRs per individual and up to four times as many NLRs per population than laboratory strains. In contrast to the massive variability of gene copies, nucleotide diversity in zebrafish NLR genes is very low: around half of the copies are monomorphic and the remaining ones have very few polymorphisms, likely a signature of purifying selection. The fact that hundreds of NLR gene copies are maintained in zebrafish, together with a signature of purifying selection, suggests that the evolution of these genes is far from neutral. We have previously demonstrated a substantial reduction in single-nucleotide variation in zebrafish laboratory strains compared to wild populations. Here, we showed that the copy numbers of the NLRome and their variation are also heavily reduced. The most obvious explanation for this observation is the recent population bottleneck which marks the establishment of laboratory strains. The sheer amount of copy number variation that appears to be present in a single gene family of zebrafish is staggering, with different individuals each having numerous genes that are not present in all others. This can only be caused by diversity-generating mechanisms that are active even now. In this study, we have laid the groundwork for future studies investigating the molecular basis and evolutionary mechanisms contributing to the diversity of large, vertebrate gene families.
In the Famennian period of the Late Devonian ( 372–359 million years ago ), ovules or seeds with wings were rare and usually surrounded by a cupule. However, we now report a new taxon of Famennian ovules, Alasemenia tria gen. et sp. nov., from Xinhang, Anhui, China. Each ovule of this taxon possesses three integumentary wings that extend outwards and fold inwards along the abaxial side, enclosing most of the nucellus. The ovule is borne terminally on smooth dichotomous branches and lacks a cupule. Alasemenia suggests that the integuments of the earliest ovules without a cupule evolved functions in probable photosynthetic nutrition and wind dispersal. It indicates that the seed wing originated earlier than other wind dispersal mechanisms such as seed plume and pappus, and that three- or four-winged seeds were followed by seeds with fewer wings. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one, two, or four wings under the same conditions. Alasemenia represents the second acupulate ovule in the Famennian and suggests that the evolutionarily novel wings, as integument outgrowths and the most important mechanism for seed dispersal by wind, appeared early in the spermatophytes and had been manifested in younger lineages. Other wind dispersal mechanisms including plumes, pappi and parachutes of seeds appeared later in the Permo-Carboniferous and Mesozoic, respectively.
Leukemia is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow, and Philadelphia chromosome-positive ( Ph+ ) leukemia is a particularly aggressive and fatal form of the disease. While tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) have been effective in prolonging the survival of patients with Ph+ leukemia, many patients eventually develop intolerance, relapse, or resistance to these treatments. Here, we report a new mechanism of leukemogenesis in which the proteins RAPSYN and BCR-ABL co-occur in Ph+ leukemia, and RAPSYN mediates the neddylation of BCR-ABL. Neddylation is a post-translational modification in which a ubiquitin-like protein called NEDD8 is attached to a target protein. In this case, the neddylation of BCR-ABL by RAPSYN enhances the stability of BCR-ABL by competing with its ubiquitination-dependent degradation. This results in increased levels of BCR-ABL and enhanced leukemogenesis. Furthermore, we show that SRC, a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, phosphorylates RAPSYN to activate its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity, which in turn promotes BCR-ABL stabilization and disease progression. In contrast, depletion of RAPSYN expression or inhibition of its NEDD8 E3 ligase activity results in decreased BCR-ABL stability and inhibition of tumor formation and growth. These findings suggest that RAPSYN is a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of Ph+ leukemia, and that targeting RAPSYN-mediated BCR-ABL neddylation may provide an alternative to TKIs for the treatment of this disease.
Phage-derived peptidoglycan hydrolases, also known as lysins, have emerged as promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics due to their direct peptidoglycan degradation activity and low risk of resistance development. However, the discovery of these enzymes is often hampered by the limited availability of phage genomes. Herein, we report a new strategy to mine active peptidoglycan hydrolases from bacterial proteomes by using lysin-derived antimicrobial peptide-primed screening. As a proof-of-concept, we identified five peptidoglycan hydrolases from the Acinetobacter baumannii proteome ( PHAb7-PHAb11 ) using PlyF307 lysin-derived peptide as a template. Among them, PHAb10 and PHAb11 showed potent bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after treatment at 100°C for 1 hr, while the other three were thermosensitive. We solved the crystal structures of PHAb8, PHAb10, and PHAb11 and unveiled that hyper-thermostable PHAb10 underwent a unique folding-refolding thermodynamic scheme mediated by a dimer-monomer transition, while thermosensitive PHAb8 formed a monomer. Two mouse models of bacterial infection further demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHAb10. Our antimicrobial peptide-primed strategy provides new clues for the discovery of promising antimicrobial drugs.
Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal forms of cancer with limited treatment options. Early detection of symptoms and disease correlations is crucial for improving the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. In this retrospective study, we analyzed symptom and disease codes from the Danish National Patient Registry ( NPR ) for 6. 9 million patients from 1994 to 2018, of whom 23, 592 were diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We also used a text mining approach to extract symptoms from free text clinical notes in electronic health records ( EHRs ) for 3078 pancreatic cancer patients and 30, 780 controls. We used both data sources to generate and compare symptom disease trajectories to uncover temporal patterns of symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis for the same patients. We found that text mining of clinical notes was able to complement registry-based symptoms by capturing more symptoms prior to pancreatic cancer diagnosis. For example, ‘Blood pressure reading without diagnosis’, ‘Abnormalities of heartbeat’, and ‘Intestinal obstruction’ were not found for the registry-based analysis. Chaining symptoms together in trajectories identified two groups of patients with lower median survival ( <90 days ) following the trajectories ‘Cough→Jaundice→Intestinal obstruction’ and ‘Pain→Jaundice→Abnormal results of function studies’. These results provide a comprehensive comparison of the two types of pancreatic cancer symptom trajectories, which in combination can leverage the full potential of the health data and ultimately provide a fuller picture for detection of early risk factors for pancreatic cancer.
Sleep spindles and slow oscillations are two essential features of adult non-rapid eye movement ( NREM ) sleep. Sleep spindles are short bursts of brain activity that occur in the frequency range of 12. 5–16 Hz, while slow oscillations occur in the frequency range of 0. 5–1 Hz. In adults, sleep spindles and slow oscillations are precisely synchronized, with sleep spindles occurring during the peak of slow oscillations. However, little is known about how this synchronization develops in children and adolescents. In this study, we investigated the development of sleep spindles and slow oscillations in children and adolescents aged 5–6, 8–11, and 14–18 years, and an adult sample of 20- to 26-year-olds. We used individualized detection of single events to characterize age-specific patterns of slow and fast sleep spindles, slow oscillations, and their coupling. We found that the predominant type of fast spindles was development-specific in that it was still nested in a frequency range below the canonical fast spindle range for the majority of children. However, the well-known slow oscillation-spindle coupling pattern was evident for sleep spindles in the adult-like canonical fast spindle range in all four age groups, but was less precise in children. We found that fast spindle maturity, which indicates the similarity between the prevailing development-specific and adult-like canonical fast spindles, was uniquely associated with enhanced slow oscillation-spindle coupling strength and temporal precision across the four age groups. Our results suggest that the increasing ability to generate adult-like canonical fast sleep spindles actuates precise slow oscillation-spindle coupling patterns from childhood through adolescence and into young adulthood.
Genes that have not been extensively studied in the past are systematically abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of high-throughput experiments and the reporting of results, according to an analysis of publications on human genes. Despite the adoption of high-throughput technologies, which are capable of identifying novel genes associated with biological processes and disease, the majority of genes featured in present-day publications are those that have already been extensively studied prior to the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003. This phenomenon persists despite the fact that several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the bias in the selection of genes as research targets, but their explanatory powers have not yet been compared. Our analysis suggests that understudied genes are abandoned in favor of better-studied genes between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results. We also find that publications on understudied genes may even accrue a greater number of citations. Among 45 biological and experimental factors previously proposed to affect which genes are being studied, we find that 33 are significantly associated with the choice of hit genes presented in titles and abstracts of -omics studies. To promote the investigation of understudied genes, we have developed a tool called find my understudied genes ( FMUG ) that allows scientists to engage with potential bias during the selection of hits. We demonstrate the utility of FMUG through the identification of genes that remain understudied in vertebrate aging. FMUG is developed in Flutter and is available for download at fmug. amaral. northwestern. edu as a MacOS/Windows app. Our findings reinforce that understudied genes become abandoned between the completion of -omics experiments and the reporting of results, rather than being abandoned by later research. The abandonment of understudied genes could be driven by the valid concern of biomedical researchers that focusing on less-investigated genes will yield articles with lower impact.
Proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) is a complication of diabetes characterized by the formation of new blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to vision loss. Previous studies have suggested that artificially sweetened beverages containing noncaloric monosaccharides could be a healthier alternative to sugar-sweetened beverages. However, the effects of these noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel function remain poorly understood. We have established a zebrafish model that exhibits excessive angiogenesis, similar to the hyperangiogenic characteristics observed in PDR. Using this model, we have investigated the effects of glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides on blood vessel development and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Our results show that both glucose and noncaloric monosaccharides induce excessive formation of blood vessels, especially intersegmental vessels, by activating quiescent endothelial cells ( ECs ) into proliferating tip cells. Single-cell transcriptomic sequencing analysis revealed an increased ratio of capillary ECs, proliferating ECs, and a series of upregulated proangiogenic genes in ECs exposed to high glucose. Further analysis and experiments validated that reduced foxo1a mediated the excessive angiogenesis induced by monosaccharides via upregulating the expression of marcksl1a. Our results suggest that both caloric and noncaloric monosaccharides can lead to excessive angiogenesis by promoting the differentiation of quiescent ECs into tip cells through the foxo1a-marcksl1a pathway. These findings have provided new insights into the negative effects of noncaloric monosaccharides on the vascular system and the underlying mechanisms.
In this study, participants were asked to memorize a sequence of items with different colors and spatial locations and later reproduce the full color and location sequences one after another. We manipulated the consistency between location and color sequence trajectories and found that sequences with consistent trajectories demonstrate improved memory performance and a trajectory correlation between reproduced color and location sequences. Furthermore, sequences with consistent trajectories show neural reactivation of common trajectories, and display spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. Importantly, neural reactivation correlates with working memory ( WM ) behavior. Our findings suggest that a shared common structure is leveraged for the storage of multiple sequences through compressed encoding and neural replay, together facilitating efficient information organization in WM. We provide converging behavioral and neural evidence for spontaneously leveraging common structures to facilitate WM. Behaviorally, sequences with consistent color-location trajectories ( aligned condition ) show enhanced memory precision and a significant correlation between reproduced color and location sequence trajectories. Importantly, neural replay has been posited to represent abstract structure ( Huang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2019 ), structure-based inference ( Liu et al., 2021b ), and generalization ( Barry and Love, 2022 ). Here, when subjects prepare to recall location sequences ( ‘location recall’ ), neural replay occurs for color sequences but not for location sequences, supporting the spontaneous nature of neural replay, since color features are not task-relevant right now.
Mutations in the human PURA gene cause the neurodevelopmental disorder known as PURA syndrome, which is characterized by full disease penetrance in almost all reported cases. In this study, we investigated how genetic variations causing PURA syndrome affect the functional and structural integrity of the human PURA ( hsPURA ) protein. We observed that patient mutations across PURA impair its previously reported co-localization with processing bodies. These mutations either destroyed the folding integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization of PURA. We also solved the crystal structures of the N- and C-terminal PUR domains of human PURA and combined them with molecular dynamics simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. The results indicated that PURA is particularly susceptible to mutations impairing its structural integrity due to its unusually high dynamics and structural promiscuity. This offers an explanation for why even conservative mutations across PURA result in the full penetrance of symptoms in patients with PURA syndrome. In contrast to several other monogenetic disorders, pathogenic variations in PURA syndrome patients are found along the entire protein sequence. To date, we fail to understand why there is such an underrepresentation of mild phenotypes in patients with PURA syndrome. In this study, we experimentally assessed the structure and function of human PURA as well as the impact of representative PURA syndrome-causing mutations on the protein’s integrity. Our results provide the first functional and experimental structural assessment of the effects of PURA syndrome-causing variants on folding, nucleic acid binding, and unwinding, as well as on subcellular localization to stress granules and P-bodies. Some of the selected patient variants of hsPURA were previously predicted to have folding defects.
TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 ( ANO1 ) have been shown to interact and play a role in the water efflux of exocrine glands, suggesting that this interaction could be involved in perspiration. In mouse foot pads, TRPV4 colocalized with cytokeratin 8, ANO1, and aquaporin-5 ( AQP5 ) in secretory cells of sweat glands. TRPV4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases were observed in mouse sweat glands and were inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot pads was temperature-dependent in wild-type mice, but not in TRPV4-deficient mice, and was inhibited by menthol in both wild-type and TRPM8KO mice. Basal sweating without acetylcholine stimulation was inhibited by an ANO1 inhibitor. Furthermore, TRPV4 expression was significantly higher in controls and normohidrotic skin from patients with acquired idiopathic generalized anhidrosis ( AIGA ) compared to anhidrotic skin from patients with AIGA. These results suggest that TRPV4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interactions with ANO1, and that TRPV4 or the TRPV4/ANO1 complex could be targeted to develop agents that regulate perspiration.
All primate cortices can be described as a set of nested folds of different sizes, and as neighbouring folds are gradually merged, the cortices of 11 primate species follow a common scale-free morphometric trajectory. This trajectory also overlaps with over 70 other mammalian species. Our results indicate that all cerebral cortices are approximations of the same archetypal fractal shape with a fractal dimension of df = 2. 5. This new understanding enables a more precise quantification of brain morphology as a function of scale. To demonstrate the importance of this new understanding, we show a scale-dependent effect of ageing on brain morphology. We observe a more than fourfold increase in effect size ( from two standard deviations to eight standard deviations ) at a spatial scale of approximately 2 mm compared to standard morphological analyses. Our new understanding may, therefore, generate superior biomarkers for a range of conditions in the future. We propose this new syntax as the basis for a more rigorous characterisation of brain morphology and morphological changes. Expressing cortical morphology as a function of scale is more detailed than a list of summary morphometric measures, and more informative than the mere listing of every sulcus and gyrus. Our novel method of deriving multiscale metrics can differentiate subtle morphological changes much better ( four times the effect size ) than the metrics we have been using so far at a single native scale. We show that representative primate brains and mammalian brains indeed share a range of other key shape properties, on top of agreeing in fractal dimension. The main result of this paper is the demonstration of a universal self-similar scaling for primate, and presumably mammalian cortices.
RELA is a master regulator of immune and stress responses that is upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) tumours. In this study, we characterised the dynamics of endogenous RELA-GFP in PDAC cell lines through live single-cell imaging. We found that TNFα stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA. Through Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA, we predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells, including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells, establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα. Additionally, we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells, identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα. Our results provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC.
Mutations in Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog ( PTEN ), the main negative regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase/Akt pathway, are strongly associated with autism spectrum disorders ( ASDs ). However, it is unclear whether PTEN deficiencies can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using the Caenorhabditis elegans neuromuscular system, where both excitatory ( cholinergic ) and inhibitory ( GABAergic ) inputs regulate muscle activity, we found that daf-18/PTEN mutations impact GABAergic ( but not cholinergic ) neurodevelopment and function. This selective impact results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. The defects observed in the GABAergic system in daf-18/PTEN mutants are due to reduced activity of DAF-16/FOXO during development. We found that a diet enriched with the ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate during early development induces DAF-16/FOXO activity, therefore improving GABAergic neurodevelopment and function in daf-18/PTEN mutants. Our study provides valuable insights into the link between PTEN mutations and neurodevelopmental defects and delves into the mechanisms underlying the potential therapeutic effects of ketogenic diets.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, triggers an innate immune response that plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of the disease. In addition to the virus itself, host factors such as proinflammatory cytokines are critical for viral containment. In this study, we discovered that soluble factors secreted by human monocytes potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2-induced cell-cell fusion in viral-infected cells. Through cytokine screening, we identified that interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ), a key mediator of inflammation, inhibits syncytia formation mediated by various SARS-CoV-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1β activates RhoA/ROCK signaling through a non-canonical IL-1 receptor-dependent pathway, which drives the enrichment of actin bundles at the cell-cell junctions, thus preventing syncytia formation. Notably, in vivo infection experiments in mice confirmed that IL-1β significantly restricted SARS-CoV-2 spread in the lung epithelium. These findings highlight an unprecedented antiviral function for cytokines during viral infection.
Insulin-producing cells ( IPCs ) in Drosophila are functionally analogous to mammalian pancreatic beta cells and play a key role in metabolic homeostasis. We investigated the in vivo dynamics of IPC activity in response to nutritional and internal state changes using electrophysiological recordings. We found that IPC activity is strongly modulated by the nutritional state, decreasing with increasing periods of starvation and increasing after refeeding with glucose or fructose, but not with non-nutritive sugars. In contrast, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, which is reminiscent of the mammalian incretin effect, where glucose ingestion drives higher insulin release than intravenous application. In contrast to IPCs, Diuretic hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerebralis ( DH44PINs ) responded to glucose perfusion. Functional connectivity experiments demonstrated that these DH44PINs do not affect IPC activity, while other DH44Ns inhibit them. This suggests that populations of autonomously and systemically sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain metabolic homeostasis. We also found that activating IPCs had a small, satiety-like effect on food-searching behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, whereas activating DH44Ns strongly increased hyperactivity. Our findings suggest that IPCs and DH44Ns are an integral part of a modulatory network that orchestrates glucose homeostasis and adaptive behavior in response to shifts in the metabolic state.
Endogenous tags are invaluable tools for visualizing and studying native proteins in live cells. However, generating human cell lines carrying endogenous tags is difficult due to the low efficiency of homology-directed repair. Recently, an engineered split mNeonGreen protein was used to generate a large-scale endogenous tag library in HEK293 cells. Here, we report the use of split mNeonGreen for large-scale endogenous tagging in human induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ). We engineered an iPS cell line to express the large fragment of the split mNeonGreen protein ( mNG21-10 ) and showed that it enables fast and efficient endogenous tagging of proteins with the short fragment ( mNG211 ). We also demonstrate that neural network-based image restoration enables live imaging studies of highly dynamic cellular processes such as cytokinesis in iPSCs. Altogether, this work provides the basis for a high-quality endogenous tag library in human iPSCs, which will be used to study protein function in human stem cells and across human cell types in vitro. This work represents the first step towards a genome-wide endogenous tag library in human stem cells and provides protocols to efficiently generate and study endogenous tags in human iPSCs.
We present a novel method for creating electrolytic lesions through chronically implanted, intracortical multielectrode probes without compromising the ability to acquire neuroelectrophysiology. A custom-built current source provides stable current and allows for controlled, repeatable lesions in awake-behaving animals. This novel lesioning technique has been validated using histology from ex vivo and in vivo testing, current and voltage traces from the device, and measurements of spiking activity before and after lesioning. The method avoids disruptive procedures, provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining neuronal population after lesioning. This technique can be used in many areas of cortex, in several species, and theoretically with any multielectrode probe. The low-cost, external lesioning device can also easily be adopted into an existing electrophysiology recording setup. This technique is expected to enable future causal investigations of the recorded neuronal population’s role in neuronal circuit function, while simultaneously providing new insight into local reorganization after neuron loss. We demonstrated that our electrolytic lesioning technique works with a linear multicontact probe by testing with a U-Probe in ex vivo rabbit cortex. There are no particular limitations that would prevent our specific electrolytic lesioning technique and device from working with any passive multielectrode probe. This method enables small, permanent inactivation volumes while maintaining reliable neuroelectrophysiological recordings. Selection of the electrical current pattern, amplitude, and duration, as well as the specific lesion electrodes’ shape and location, offers many different combinations for complementary investigations into the causal role of cortical activity.
Bees are important pollinators of agricultural crops, but their populations are at risk when pesticides are used. One of the largest risks bees face is poisoning of floral nectar and pollen by insecticides. Here, we use an assay for the detection of food aversion combined with single-sensillum electrophysiology to test whether the mouthparts of the buff-tailed bumblebee ( Bombus terrestris ) detect the presence of pesticides in a solution that mimicked the nectar of oilseed rape ( Brassica napus ). We tested whether bumblebees can detect and avoid field-relevant concentrations of four neonicotinoid pesticides: imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, and sulfoxaflor. Bees did not avoid consuming solutions containing concentrations of these pesticides spanning six orders of magnitude, even when these solutions contained lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations of the pesticides altered spiking in gustatory neurons through a slight reduction in firing rate or change in the rate of adaptation. These data provide strong evidence that bumblebees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant concentrations of pesticides using information from their mouthparts. As bees rarely contact floral nectar with other body parts, we predict that they are at high risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in the nectar of pesticide-treated crops.
Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria parasite of public health concern in Southeast Asia, is primarily maintained in non-human primate ( NHP ) reservoirs. However, the dynamics of P. knowlesi infection in NHPs are rarely quantified at macroecological scales due to the lack of systematic surveys. Here, we systematically assemble reports of P. knowlesi in NHPs from 148 sites across Southeast Asia and investigate geographic determinants of prevalence in reservoir species. Our meta-analysis of 6322 NHPs reveals that P. knowlesi prevalence is heterogeneous across the region, with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo. We find that regions with higher prevalence in NHPs overlap with human infection hotspots, and that parasite transmission is linked to land conversion and fragmentation. By combining remote sensing data and statistical models, we identify novel relationships between P. knowlesi in NHPs and forest fragmentation, suggesting that higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity. These findings address critical gaps in understanding regional P. knowlesi epidemiology and indicate that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key spatial driver of human spillover risk.
Belidae, a family of phytophagous weevils, originated approximately 138 million years ago in Gondwana, a supercontinent that began to break apart during the Mesozoic era. Our analysis of molecular data and the fossil record indicates that Belidae originated in association with Pinopsida ( conifer ) host plants, with larvae likely developing in dead or decaying branches. As Gondwana broke apart, Belidae tracked their host plants to distant, disjunct landmasses, where they survived and evolved new trophic interactions. These interactions included brood-pollination mutualisms with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous parasitic angiosperms. The two extant subfamilies of Belidae, Belinae and Oxycoryninae, originated in the Australian and Neotropical regions, respectively. The most likely ancestral host plants of Belidae were reconstructed as Pinopsida or angiosperms. In Belinae, Pinopsida were the most likely ancestral host plants. Belidae are indicated to have originated during the Jurassic in association with gymnosperms and subsequently colonized angiosperms as the latter diversified and rose to ecological dominance during the Late Cretaceous and Paleogene. The two subfamilies, Belinae and Oxycoryninae, originated and diverged during the separation of East and West Gondwana. Both subfamilies have lineages that still develop on their ancestral host plant. In the East Gondwana clade, Belinae, the divergence time between Agnesiotis and Dicordylus was estimated at 44. 7 million years ago, during the Paleocene–Eocene separation of South America and Australia.
Tumour evolution is a complex process that can be studied by analysing mutations in growing cell populations, such as tumours. Mutations can serve as markers that allow us to track the past evolution of a tumour from current samples. However, little is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of tumour evolution. Here, we use published data from resected hepatocellular carcinomas, each with several hundred samples taken in two and three dimensions. We find that tumour cells grow predominantly uniformly within the tumour volume instead of at the surface. We determine how mutations and cells are dispersed throughout the tumour and how cell death contributes to the overall tumour growth. Our methods shed light on the early evolution of tumours in vivo and can be applied to high-resolution data in the emerging field of spatial biology. We have used genetic data taken from hepatocellular tumours at high spatial resolution to analyse the early evolution of a tumour in vivo. We are not the first to link spatial tumour sampling with evolution: on a larger spatial scale, phylogenetic comparison of samples from primary and metastatic tumours has elucidated the dynamics of metastasis. To tell between these two different evolutionary dynamics, we use high-resolution data on the spatial distribution of mutations found in solid tumours. From the observed spatial distribution of mutations, it should in principle be possible to infer the spatio-temporal principles of tumour evolution: Is the growth rate uniform across the tumour, or does growth predominantly take place near the edge of the tumour? What is the interplay between the tissue dynamics of the tumour and its genetic evolution? We use whole-exome mutation data obtained from hepatocellular carcinomas and published previously. From these snapshots of late-stage tumours we infer how the tumours grew in earlier stages. To this end, we develop metrics of intra-tumour heterogeneity which leverage the information from the spatial position of all samples.
Bursicon, also known as the tanning hormone, is a neuropeptide that plays a crucial role in the hardening and darkening of the insect cuticle. In this study, we report for the first time on the novel function of Bursicon and its receptor in the transition from summer-form to winter-form in Cacopsylla chinensis, a species that exhibits remarkable seasonal polyphenism. We identified CcBurs-α and CcBurs-β as two typical subunits of Bursicon in C. chinensis, which were regulated by low temperature ( 10 °C ) and the temperature receptor CcTRPM. These subunits form a heterodimer that mediates the transition from summer-form to winter-form by influencing the cuticle chitin contents and cuticle thickness. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CcBurs-R acts as the Bursicon receptor and plays a critical role in the up-stream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway, regulating the transition from summer-form to winter-form. Finally, we discovered that miR-6012 directly targets CcBurs-R, contributing to the regulation of Bursicon signaling in the seasonal polyphenism of C. chinensis. These findings reveal the novel function of the neuroendocrine regulatory mechanism underlying seasonal polyphenism and provide critical insights into the insect Bursicon and its receptor.
Diffuse midline gliomas ( DMGs ) are aggressive and fatal pediatric tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatments. The H3-K27M mutation is a driver mutation in DMGs that reshapes the epigenetic landscape of these cells to promote tumorigenesis. H3-K27M gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. In search of effective treatment, we examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) and MYC in these tumors. Treatment of H3-K27M patient-derived cells with Sulfopin, an inhibitor shown to block MYC-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HDAC inhibitor Vorinostat, resulted in substantial decrease in cell viability. Moreover, transcriptome and epigenome profiling revealed synergistic effect of this drug combination in downregulation of prominent oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. Finally, in vivo studies of patient-derived orthotopic xenograft models showed significant tumor growth reduction in mice treated with the drug combination. These results highlight the combined treatment with PIN1 and HDAC inhibitors as a promising therapeutic approach for these aggressive tumors.
The white-footed deermouse Peromyscus leucopus is a long-lived rodent that serves as a key reservoir for several zoonoses in North America, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasmosis, and a viral encephalitis. While persistently infected with these pathogens, P. leucopus does not display apparent disability or diminished fitness. To investigate the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we compared the genome-wide transcriptional responses of P. leucopus, Mus musculus, and Rattus norvegicus to the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ), a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens. We found that LPS-treated P. leucopus displayed a distinct transcriptional profile compared to mice and rats, consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. In contrast to mice and rats, P. leucopus showed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower magnitude fold-changes in type 1 interferon-stimulated genes. These characteristics were also observed in a Borrelia hermsii infection model. Furthermore, we found that P. leucopus had reduced transcription of endogenous retrovirus sequences and cytoplasmic pattern recognition receptors. These results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in P. leucopus and perhaps other animal reservoirs for agents of human disease.
Caspase ( CASP ) is a family of proteases involved in the cleavage and activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis. In humans, CASP3 and CASP7 recognize the same consensus motif DxxD, which is present in gasdermin E ( GSDME ). However, human GSDME is cleaved by CASP3 but not by CASP7. In this study, we identified a pyroptotic pufferfish GSDME that was cleaved by both pufferfish CASP3/7 and human CASP3/7. Domain swapping between pufferfish and human CASP and GSDME showed that the GSDME C-terminus and the CASP7 p10 subunit determined the cleavability of GSDME by CASP7. The CASP7 p10 subunit contains a key residue that governs CASP7 substrate discrimination. This key residue is highly conserved in vertebrate CASP3 and in most vertebrate CASP7. In mammals, the key residue is conserved in non-primates ( e. g., mouse ) but not in primates. However, mouse CASP7 cleaved human GSDME but not mouse GSDME. These findings revealed the molecular mechanism of CASP7 substrate discrimination and the divergence of CASP3/7-mediated GSDME activation in vertebrate. These results also suggested that mutation-mediated functional alteration of CASP probably enabled the divergence and specialization of different CASP members in the regulation of complex cellular activities in mammals.
Ketamine has emerged as one of the most promising therapies for treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ). However, inter-individual variability in response to ketamine is still not well understood, and it is unclear how ketamine’s molecular mechanisms connect to its neural and behavioral effects. We conducted a single-blind placebo-controlled study with 40 healthy participants who received an acute ketamine infusion ( initial bolus 0. 23 mg/kg, continuous infusion 0. 58 mg/kg/hr ). We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via data-driven global brain connectivity and related it to individual ketamine-induced symptom variation and cortical gene expression targets. We found that both the neural and behavioral effects of acute ketamine are multi-dimensional, reflecting robust inter-individual variability. We also found that ketamine’s data-driven principal neural gradient effect matched somatostatin ( SST ) and parvalbumin ( PVALB ) cortical gene expression patterns in humans, while the mean effect did not. Furthermore, we found that behavioral data-driven individual symptom variation mapped onto distinct neural gradients of ketamine, which were resolvable at the single-subject level. These results highlight the importance of considering individual behavioral and neural variation in response to ketamine. They also have implications for the development of individually precise pharmacological biomarkers for treatment selection in psychiatry.
The RNA world hypothesis proposes that the first self-propagating evolutionary units existed in the form of RNA-like polymers during the early evolution of life. However, the autonomous, non-enzymatic, and sustained replication of such information carriers presents a problem, because product formation and hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication speed, resulting in parabolic growth kinetics. Here, we test the information-maintaining ability of parabolic growth in stochastic multispecies population models under the constraints of constant total population size and chemostat conditions. We find that large population sizes and small differences in the replication rates favor the stable coexistence of the vast majority of replicator species ( ‘genes’ ), while the error threshold problem is alleviated relative to exponential amplification. In addition, sequence properties ( GC content ) and the strength of resource competition mediated by the rate of resource inflow determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting that fluctuations in building block availability favored repeated cycles of exploration and exploitation. Stochastic parabolic growth could thus have played a pivotal role in preserving viable sequences generated by random abiotic synthesis and providing diverse genetic raw material to the early evolution of functional ribozymes. We demonstrate that parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates assumed for template-directed, enzyme-free replication, thereby proposing a simple biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in hypothetical information storage systems of the RNA world. Finally, we show that increased competition, mediated by a decrease in the resource influx rate, can induce a switch from the coexistence ensured by parabolic dynamics to survival of the fittest in a chemostat model of parabolic replication.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, has a main protease called nonstructural protein 5 ( Nsp5 ) that cleaves viral polyproteins into individual polypeptides necessary for viral replication. Here, we show that Nsp5 binds and cleaves human tRNA methyltransferase 1 ( TRMT1 ), a host enzyme required for a prevalent post-transcriptional modification in tRNAs. TRMT1 is a tRNA modification enzyme that catalyzes the formation of dimethylguanosine ( m2, 2G ) at position 26 in more than half of all human tRNAs. We find that human cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 exhibit a decrease in TRMT1 protein levels and TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications, consistent with TRMT1 cleavage and inactivation by Nsp5. Nsp5 cleaves TRMT1 at a specific position that matches the consensus sequence of SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a single mutation within the sequence inhibits Nsp5-dependent proteolysis of TRMT1. The TRMT1 cleavage fragments exhibit altered RNA binding activity and are unable to rescue tRNA modification in TRMT1-deficient human cells. Moreover, we find that SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates with decreased TRMT1 levels and a reduction in m2, 2G-modified tRNAs. In addition, we provide evidence that TRMT1 expression is required for efficient SARS-CoV-2 replication in human cells. These studies uncover TRMT1 as a novel proteolytic cleavage target of Nsp5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection and suggest possible pathological mechanisms associated with perturbations in TRMT1-catalyzed tRNA modifications.
Many disease-causing microbes are not obligate pathogens, but rather environmental microbes that take advantage of an ecological opportunity. The existence of microbes whose life cycle does not require a host and are not normally pathogenic, yet are well-suited to host exploitation, is an evolutionary puzzle. One hypothesis posits that selection in the environment may favor traits that incidentally lead to pathogenicity and virulence, or serve as pre-adaptations for survival in a host. To experimentally test the idea of ‘accidental virulence’, we evolved replicate populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to attach to a plastic bead for hundreds of generations. Along with plastic adherence, two multicellular phenotypes— biofilm formation and flor formation— increased; another phenotype, pseudohyphal growth, responded to the nutrient limitation. Thus, experimental selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hyper-multicellular strains. We then tested the virulence of these evolved strains against wax moth larvae and found that they were significantly more likely to die than those injected with evolved non-multicellular strains. Our results support the idea that selection for a trait beneficial in the open environment can inadvertently generate opportunistic, ‘accidental’ pathogens.
Proteins containing prion-like low complexity domains ( PLDs ) are common drivers of the formation of biomolecular condensates and are prone to misregulation due to amino acid mutations. Here, we investigate whether there are scaling laws that can predict how the critical parameters of a broader set of PLDs change in response to amino acid sequence mutations. We exploit the accuracy of our residue-resolution coarse-grained model, Mpipi, to quantify the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of 140 PLD mutants from six proteins ( hnRNPA1, TDP43, FUS, EWSR1, RBM14, and TIA1 ). Our simulations reveal the existence of scaling laws that quantify the range of change in the critical solution temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations. These rules are consistent with the physicochemical properties of the mutations and extend across the entire family tested, suggesting that scaling laws can be used as tools to predict changes in the stability of PLD condensates. Our work offers a quantitative lens into how the emergent behavior of PLD solutions vary in response to physicochemical changes of single PLD molecules. We reveal that the changes in the critical solution temperatures of PLDs, as a function of the number and type of amino acid sequence mutations ( e. g. aromatic, positively charged, etc ), can indeed be quantified by scaling laws, which are conserved across the family of PLDs we investigate. We have organized the data in Table 1, which illustrates the effect of single point mutations on the critical solution temperatures of the family of PLDs, as a function of the PLD length. Consistent with experimental evidence and computational predictions, interactions involving aromatic residues—namely, π–π and cation –π— are dominant in stabilizing condensates formed by PLDs.
Predicting an individual’s cognitive traits or clinical condition using brain signals is a central goal in modern neuroscience. This is commonly done using either structural aspects, such as structural connectivity or cortical thickness, or aggregated measures of brain activity that average over time. However, these approaches are missing a central aspect of brain function: the unique ways in which an individual’s brain activity unfolds over time. We here propose an approach that describes dynamic functional connectivity and amplitude patterns using a Hidden Markov model ( HMM ) and combines it with the Fisher kernel, which can be used to predict individual traits. The Fisher kernel is constructed from the HMM in a mathematically principled manner, thereby preserving the structure of the underlying model. We show here, in fMRI data, that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach is accurate and reliable. We compare the Fisher kernel to other prediction methods, both time-varying and time-averaged functional connectivity-based models. Our approach leverages information about an individual’s time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity for prediction and has broad applications in cognitive neuroscience and personalised medicine. In this work, we aimed to establish an approach that allows leveraging a rich description of the patterns in which brain activity unfolds over time to predict individual traits. We showed that the HMM-Fisher kernel approach accurately and reliably predicts traits from brain dynamics models trained on neuroimaging data. It preserves the structure of the underlying brain dynamics model, making it ideal for combining generative and predictive models. This is an important consideration as it may affect studies with small sample sizes and with heterogeneous training and test sets. We here aimed to show the potential of the HMM-Fisher kernel approach to leverage information from patterns of brain dynamics to predict individual traits in an example fMRI dataset as well as simulated data. We focus on models of brain dynamics that capture within-session changes in functional connectivity and amplitude from fMRI scans, in this case acquired during wakeful rest, and how the parameters from these models can be used to predict behavioural variables or traits. In particular, we use the Hidden Markov Model ( HMM ), which is a probabilistic generative model of time-varying amplitude and functional connectivity ( FC ) dynamics. We show that using the Fisher kernel approach, which preserves the mathematical structure of the underlying HMM, we can predict individual traits from patterns of brain dynamics accurately and reliably. We compared the Fisher kernel to kernels which ignore the structure of the brain dynamics model ( ‘naïve’ kernels ), to a previously used method based on Kullback-Leibler divergence ( Vidaurre et al., 2021 ), and to methods based on time-averaged functional connectivity.
Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 ( LRRK2 ) variants associated with Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) and Crohn’s disease lead to increased phosphorylation of its Rab substrates. The molecular mechanisms by which LRRK2 activity is regulated have remained poorly defined. Here, we identify Rab12 as a novel modulator of LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of one of its substrates, Rab10. Using a combination of imaging and immunopurification methods to isolate lysosomes, we demonstrate that Rab12 is actively recruited to damaged lysosomes and leads to a local and LRRK2-dependent increase in Rab10 phosphorylation. PD-linked variants, including LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, lead to increased recruitment of LRRK2 to the lysosome and a local elevation in lysosomal levels of pT73 Rab10. Together, these data suggest a conserved mechanism by which Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LRRK2 and phosphorylation of its Rab substrate ( s ) at the lysosome. Enhanced recruitment of LRRK2 to lysosomes may promote Rab phosphorylation by effectively increasing the local concentration of LRRK2 in proximity to its Rab substrates, and we hypothesized that such a mechanism might explain LRRK2 activation observed in additional contexts beyond lysosomal damage. We next examined whether two PD-linked genetic variants associated with increased LRRK2 kinase activity, LRRK2 R1441G and VPS35 D620N, also had increased levels of LRRK2 on lysosomes. Here, we used endogenous expression conditions to demonstrate that Rab12, but not Rab29, regulates LRRK2-mediated phosphorylation of Rab10 and that Rab12 regulates the localization and activation of LRRK2 on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress. The PD-linked pathogenic LRRK2 variant R1441G, which lies outside of LRRK2’s kinase domain, and the VPS35 D620N variant have been shown in previous studies and confirmed here to increase LRRK2 activity. There is a clear need to better define how LRRK2 is recruited to lysosomes upon damage, how these steps translate to LRRK2 activation, and how broadly conserved these mechanisms are in PD. Here, we identify Rab12 as a novel regulator of LRRK2 activity. Rab12 regulates LRRK2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10 and mediates LRRK2 activation in response to lysosomal damage.
Understanding the cell cycle at the single-cell level is a crucial aspect of cellular biology and cancer research. Current methods for studying adherent cells have been improved by the use of fluorescent markers, but non-adherent cells remain challenging to analyze. To address this gap, we have developed a novel approach that combines a specialized surface to enhance cell attachment, the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 sensor, an automated image analysis pipeline, and a custom machine learning algorithm. This approach enables precise measurement of cell cycle phase durations in non-adherent cells. We have validated this method in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi-1, which have unique cell cycle characteristics, and tested the impact of cell cycle-modulating drugs on NB4 cells. Our cell cycle analysis system, which is also compatible with adherent cells, is fully automated and freely available, providing detailed insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This report presents a valuable tool for advancing cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive, automated cell cycle analysis in both adherent and non-adherent cells. We have developed a complete protocol for the cell cycle analysis of adherent and non-adherent cells expressing the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 technology in a fully automated manner. The protocol is explained in Box 1 and illustrated in Figure 5. We were able to follow single cells and the manual annotation of cell cycle phases according to the color of the red and green merged images in Figure 1A, qualitatively confirming the impact of CDK inhibitors. Furthermore, the expected difference in cell cycle progression of NB4 vs Kasumi-1 cells was evident. The original time-lapse images were composed by red and green channels, detecting respectively the mCherry and mVenus markers of the FUCCI ( CA ) 2 indicator.
The evolution of cognitive skills in primates is a complex issue that has been the subject of much debate. Recent studies have provided conflicting results regarding the relative contributions of social and ecological constraints to the evolution of cognition. Here, we used an interdisciplinary approach combining comparative cognitive neurosciences and behavioral ecology to examine the relation between brain structure and socio-ecological variables in 16 primate species. We measured the size of two prefrontal brain regions, the frontal pole ( FP ) and the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ), which are involved in metacognition and working memory, respectively. Our results show that the size of these prefrontal regions, as well as the whole brain, is best explained by three variables: body mass, daily traveled distance ( an index of ecological constraints ), and population density ( an index of social constraints ). The strong influence of ecological constraints on FP and DLPFC volumes suggests that both metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging in primates. Interestingly, FP volume was much more sensitive to social constraints than DLPFC volume, in line with laboratory studies showing an implication of FP in complex social interactions. Our data highlights the relative weight of social vs ecological constraints on the evolution of specific prefrontal brain regions and their associated cognitive operations in primates.
Muscle growth in response to increased mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise, has been shown to result in an increase in the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers. However, it is not known whether this growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils ( myofibril hypertrophy ) or the number of myofibrils ( myofibrillogenesis ). To address this question, we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope, called fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution ( FIM-ID ). This method enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number. We extensively validated the accuracy of these measurements by comparing them to manual measurements obtained with electron microscopy ( EM ), and found that they were indistinguishable. We then used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to determine whether the radial growth of muscle fibers is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis. Our results show that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis, i. e. an increase in the number of myofibrils, rather than myofibril hypertrophy, i. e. an increase in the size of the myofibrils. This is a fundamentally important question in the field of muscle growth, and our results provide new insight into this topic.
Synaptosomal-associated protein of 25 kDa ( SNAP25 ) is one of the three neuronal SNAREs that drive synaptic vesicle exocytosis. We studied three mutations in SNAP25 that cause epileptic encephalopathy: V48F and D166Y in the synaptotagmin-1 ( Syt1 )-binding interface, and I67N, which destabilizes the SNARE complex. All three mutations reduced Syt1-dependent vesicle docking to SNARE-carrying liposomes and Ca2+-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and when expressed in mouse hippocampal neurons. The V48F and D166Y mutants led to reduced readily releasable pool ( RRP ) size due to increased spontaneous release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy barrier for fusion and increased the release probability, which are gain-of-function features not found in Syt1 knockout ( KO ) neurons. The V48F and D166Y mutants increased spontaneous association to partner SNAREs, resulting in unregulated membrane fusion. In contrast, the I67N mutant decreased miniature excitatory postsynaptic current ( mEPSC ) frequency and evoked excitatory postsynaptic current ( EPSC ) amplitudes due to an increase in the height of the energy barrier for fusion, whereas the RRP size was unaffected. This could be partly compensated by positive charges lowering the energy barrier. Overall, pathogenic mutations in SNAP25 cause complex changes in the energy landscape for priming and fusion. The preserved overall charge of evoked release in V48F and mild reduction in D166Y might point to a compensatory gain-of-function aspect to these mutations, in addition to the impaired Syt1 interaction. The role of Syt1 and Syt1:SNARE interactions in vesicle priming has been controversially discussed. The RRP is often assessed by applying a pulse of hypertonic solution to the neurons, usually 0. 5 M sucrose ( Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996; Schotten et al., 2015 ). We confirmed the increase in spontaneous release rate and decrease in evoked release by V48F and D166Y reported previously ( Alten et al., 2021 ). Through in vitro analysis we find that both mutations lower Syt1 association to SNARE-protein liposomes. These findings have consequences for our understanding of the simultaneous role of the primary SNARE:Syt1 interface in vesicle priming and release clamping. It further demonstrates the challenge faced by finding mechanism-based treatments of these disorders in the presence of multiple effects caused by single-point mutations. Indeed, part of the role of Syt1:SNARE interaction might be catalytic, lowering the energy level of a transition state along the path to priming, which will affect both rates ( Walter et al., 2013 ). This might happen because transient binding to Syt1 might structure SNAP25 and assist in formation of the SNARE complex, whereas SNAP25 mutants might prestructure the protein, bypassing the need for Syt1.
In a study spanning 30 countries and thousands of researchers, we find that the proportion of women in a discipline is correlated with lower research quality evaluations and funding success rates for both men and women. This finding is robust to age, number of research outputs, and bibliometric measures where such data are available. Our work builds on previous findings that women’s work is valued less, regardless of who performs that work. We use independent datasets to look separately at research funding success rates and holistic research quality scores. We find a strong correlation between the evaluated quality of a researcher’s work and the gender balance of the researcher’s discipline. Researchers, both male and female, in female-dominated disciplines receive lower evaluations. This finding is robust to bibliometric differences across disciplines. We also find that funding success rates display a similar correlation. Where possible, we account for researcher characteristics like age, research institution, and publishing patterns. We consistently find that researchers in male-dominated disciplines have both higher funding success rates and higher research quality scores than researchers in female-dominated disciplines. This applies to both men and women. Our findings do not suggest that research done in disciplines dominated by women is of lower quality, but rather that we consistently evaluate research from female-dominated disciplines as lower quality than research from male-dominated disciplines. This has a detrimental effect on everyone in those disciplines, but will adversely affect more women than men.
One of the main goals of synthetic biology is to enable the design of arbitrary molecular circuits with programmable inputs and outputs that can process information in a predictable manner within living cells. Genome editing is a potentially powerful component of synthetic molecular circuits, whether for modulating the expression of a target gene or for stably recording information to genomic DNA. However, programming molecular events such as protein-protein interactions or induced proximity as triggers for genome editing remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a strategy termed ‘P3 editing’, which links protein-protein proximity to the formation of a functional CRISPR-Cas9 dual-component guide RNA. By engineering the crRNA:tracrRNA interaction, we demonstrate that various known protein-protein interactions, as well as the chemically induced dimerization of protein domains, can be used to activate prime editing or base editing in human cells. Additionally, we explore how P3 editing can incorporate outputs from ADAR-based RNA sensors, potentially allowing specific RNAs to induce specific genome edits within a larger circuit. Our strategy enhances the controllability of CRISPR-based genome editing, facilitating its use in synthetic molecular circuits deployed in living cells. We also explore whether P3 editing can be coupled to ADAR-based RNA sensors to control genome editing based on RNA expression, potentially expanding the range of inputs that can be used to drive signal-specific editing in synthetic molecular circuits.
Long QT syndrome ( LQTS ) is a life-threatening condition caused by mutations in the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex, which mediates the slow delayed-rectifier current ( IKs ) during the repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential. The IKs current is crucial for the repolarization of the ventricular action potential, and loss-of-function mutations in the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex lead to a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. One potential therapeutic strategy for LQTS is to restore the function of the KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel complex. Polyunsaturated fatty acids ( PUFAs ) are known to activate KCNQ1 channels and increase IKs currents by binding to two different sites, one in the voltage sensor domain and the other in the pore domain. However, the mechanism by which PUFAs increase the maximal conductance of the IKs channels is still poorly understood. Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KCNQ1 is normally unstable, contributing to the low open probability of the channel, and that the PUFA-induced increase in maximal conductance is caused by a stabilization of the selectivity filter in an open-conductive state. PUFAs are known to exert a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended in the diet at least twice a week. PUFAs have been shown to increase IKs currents by a dual mechanism of action, characteristically described as a ‘Lipoelectric mechanism’. According to this mechanism, PUFAs can increase IKs currents by shifting the voltage dependence of activation and increasing the maximal conductance of the channels. Our studies suggest that the mechanism of PUFAs to increase KCNQ1/KCNE1 maximum conductance relies on the ability of PUFAs to favor the conductive conformation of the selectivity filter: PUFAs promote interactions between residues in the selectivity filter that stabilize the channel pore.
Vitamin B6 is an essential micronutrient that plays a crucial role in the nervous system, and its deficiency has been associated with cognitive impairment in human brain disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms linking vitamin B6 to these pathologies remain poorly understood, and whether vitamin B6 supplementation improves cognition is unclear. We now identify a pyridoxal 5’-phosphate phosphatase ( PDXP ) and age-dependent decline of pyridoxal 5’-phosphate ( PLP ) levels in the murine hippocampus, which provides a rationale for the development of PDXP inhibitors. Using a combination of small-molecule screening, protein crystallography, and biolayer interferometry, we discover 7, 8-dihydroxyflavone ( 7, 8-DHF ) as a direct and potent PDXP inhibitor. 7, 8-DHF binds and reversibly inhibits PDXP with low micromolar affinity and sub-micromolar potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7, 8-DHF increases PLP levels in a PDXP-dependent manner. These findings validate PDXP as a druggable target. Our discovery of 7, 8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor offers novel mechanistic insights into the controversy surrounding 7, 8-DHF-mediated effects in the brain. Our observation that the expression of PDXP is substantially upregulated in hippocampi of middle-aged mice suggests that a therapeutic vitamin B6 supplementation alone may not suffice to elevate intracellular PLP levels under conditions where the PLP-degrading phosphatase is hyperactive. The discovery of 7, 8-DHF as a direct PDXP inhibitor was unexpected. The identification of 7, 8-DHF as a PDXP inhibitor indicates that this flavone may modulate vitamin B6-dependent processes and suggests that PDXP could be explored as a pharmacological entry point into brain disorders.
The development of the gonad in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans ( C. elegans ) is a complex process that requires the coordinated production of diverse cell types and their precise positioning/migration. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure, which is guided by the migration of distal tip cells ( DTCs ). These DTCs result from the asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors ( SGPs ), Z1 and Z4, which possess mirror-symmetric orientation. We found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4 is controlled by the redundant functions of the LIN-17/Frizzled receptor and three Wnt proteins ( CWN-1, CWN-2, and EGL-20 ) with distinct functions. In lin-17 mutants, CWN-2 promotes normal polarity in both Z1 and Z4, while CWN-1 promotes reverse and normal polarity in Z1 and Z4, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. In lin-17 egl-20 cwn-2 triple mutants with a polarity reversal of Z1, DTCs from Z1 frequently miss-migrate to the posterior side. Our further analysis demonstrates that the mis-positioning of DTCs in the gonad due to the polarity reversal of Z1 leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in cki-1 ( RNAi ) animals producing ectopic DTCs. These results highlight the role of Wnt signaling in coordinating the production and migration of DTCs to establish a mirror-symmetric organ. In C. elegans, DTCs function as niche cells for germline stem cells, inhibiting their entry into meiosis by expressing the Notch ligand LAG-2. In lin-17; egl-20 cwn-2 animals, both Z1 and Z4 show HL polarity disrupting the mirror symmetry of polarity. Notably, in this genotype, we observed that the DTC from Z1 frequently migrates posteriorly similar to that from Z4. We further demonstrated that the ectopic positions of DTCs in the center of the gonad cause mis-migration. CWN-1 induces HL polarity for both Z1 and Z4. CWN-2 induces the opposite polarity; LH for Z1 and HL for Z4. EGL-20 inhibits the polarization of both Z1 and Z4. The distinct responses of Z1 and Z4 to CWN-2 appear to be a key for their opposite polarity orientation and mirror-symmetric gonadogenesis.
To combat drug resistance, there is a growing interest in designing multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs. Tradeoffs occur when resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. However, the extent to which tradeoffs are reliable is not well understood, specifically whether the mutants that provide resistance to a given drug all suffer similar tradeoffs. To address this question, we performed evolution experiments using lineage-tracking to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells a fitness advantage in fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. We then quantified fitness tradeoffs for each of 774 evolved mutants across 12 environments, finding that they group into classes with characteristically different tradeoffs. These unique tradeoffs may imply that each group of mutants affects fitness through different underlying mechanisms. For example, we found that some mutants that resist single drugs do not resist their combination, while others do, and some mutants to the same gene have different tradeoffs than others. These findings demonstrate the difficulty in relying on consistent or intuitive tradeoffs when designing multidrug treatments. However, by grouping mutants that likely affect fitness through similar underlying mechanisms, our findings may yet empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. We reduced the number of unique drug-resistant mutants from more than 774 to a manageable panel of six types for investigating the molecular mechanisms by which mutations impact fitness.
The central tendency bias, also known as contraction bias, is a phenomenon where the magnitude of items held in working memory appears to be biased toward the average of past observations. This bias is thought to be an optimal strategy by the brain to learn the statistical structure of sensory input. However, recency biases such as serial dependence are also commonly observed and are thought to reflect the content of working memory. Recent results from an auditory delayed comparison task in rats suggest that both biases may be more related than previously thought. When the posterior parietal cortex ( PPC ) was silenced, both short-term and contraction biases were reduced. We propose a model of the circuit that may be involved in generating the behavior and show that a volatile working memory content susceptible to shifting to the past sensory experience – producing short-term sensory history biases – naturally leads to contraction bias. The errors occurring at the level of individual trials are sampled from the full distribution of the stimuli and are not due to a gradual shift of the memory toward the sensory distribution’s mean. Our results are consistent with a broad set of behavioral findings and provide predictions of performance across different stimulus distributions and timings, delay intervals, as well as neuronal dynamics in putative working memory areas. We validate our model by performing a set of human psychophysics experiments of an auditory parametric working memory task. The central tendency bias has been repeatedly observed across species and sensory modalities, where performance in perceptual tasks seems to reflect a shift of the working memory representation toward the mean of the sensory history. A key feature emerging from these studies is contraction bias, where the averaged performance is as if the memory of the first stimulus progressively shifts toward the center of a prior distribution built from past sensory history. Additionally, biases toward the most recent sensory stimuli have also been documented.
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with most patients failing to respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) and their combination with other therapies such as chemotherapy. We previously identified the PDZ-LIM domain-containing protein 2 ( PDLIM2 ) as a bona fide tumor suppressor that is repressed in lung cancer to drive cancer and its chemo and immunotherapy resistance. In this study, we investigated PDLIM2 genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer using human clinical samples and an endogenous mouse lung cancer model that faithfully recapitulates refractory human lung cancer. We found that PDLIM2 repression in human lung cancer involves both genetic deletion and epigenetic alteration. To restore PDLIM2 expression, we encapsulated PDLIM2 expression plasmids in nanoparticles ( nanoPDLIM2 ) and investigated their therapeutic efficacy, action mechanism, and safety in combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. We found that nanoPDLIM2 showed low toxicity, high tumor specificity, antitumor activity, and greatly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete tumor remission in most mice and substantial tumor reduction in the remaining mice by their triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoPDLIM2 increased major histocompatibility complex class I ( MHC-I ) expression, suppressed multi-drug resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) induction and survival genes and other tumor-related genes expression in tumor cells, and enhanced lymphocyte tumor infiltration, turning the cold tumors hot and sensitive to ICIs and rendering them vulnerable to chemotherapeutic drugs and activated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) including those unleashed by ICIs. These findings provide a firm basis to combine ICIs and chemotherapeutic drugs with PDLIM2-targeted therapy for the treatment of lung and other cancers.
Animals must be able to assess food quality and adjust their feeding behavior to survive in challenging environments. However, the mechanisms that regulate this chronic physiological food evaluation system are still not fully understood. In this study, we established a low-quality food evaluation assay system and found that heat-killed E. coli ( HK-E. coli ), a low-sugar food, triggers a cellular unfolded protein response ( UPRER ) and immune response. This response encourages animals to avoid low-quality food. The physiological system for evaluating low-quality food depends on the UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis, particularly its neuronal function, which subsequently regulates feeding behaviors. Moreover, animals can adapt to a low-quality food environment through sugar supplementation, which inhibits the UPRER -PMK-1 regulated stress response by increasing vitamin C biosynthesis. This study reveals the role of the cellular stress response pathway as a physiological food evaluation system for assessing nutritional deficiencies in food, thereby enhancing survival in natural environments. The UPRER pathway assesses the deficiency of D-glucose in food and the subsequent vitamin C content in animals through the UPRER - innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) axis. This study identified a physiological food evaluation mechanism by which animals recognize food quality through UPRER ( IRE-1/XBP-1 ) - innate immunity ( PMK-1/p38 MAPK ) regulated cellular stress response program in neurons that dictates food avoidance and selection behaviors.
G-protein coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) are a major class of drug targets, but the role of carbohydrates in modulating these receptors remains poorly understood. Here, we investigated the activation of P2Y purinoceptor 14 ( P2Y14 ), a drug target for inflammation and immune responses, by sugar nucleotides. P2Y14 is a member of the P2Y purinoceptor subfamily, which responds to nucleotides such as adenosine diphosphate ( ADP ) and UDP ( Ralevic and Burnstock, 1998 ). Unlike other purinoceptors, P2Y14 is potently activated by UDP and a class of carbohydrates, UDP-sugars ( Abbracchio et al., 2006; Jacobson et al., 2020 ). We employed a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and functional study to identify the UDP-sugar-binding site on P2Y14. We found that UDP-glucose might activate the receptor by bridging the transmembrane ( TM ) helices 2 and 7. We also identified a conserved salt bridging chain ( K2. 60-D2. 64-K7. 35-E7. 36 [KDKE] ) between TM2 and TM7 that distinguishes different UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDP-galactose, UDP-glucuronic acid, and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine. The KDKE chain is a conserved functional motif of sugar binding for both P2Y14 and P2Y purinoceptor 12 ( P2Y12 ), and we designed three sugar nucleotides as agonists of P2Y12. These results not only expand our understanding of the activation of purinergic receptors but also provide insights for the carbohydrate drug development for GPCRs.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the role of glial cells in regulating the behavior of neural stem cells ( Neuroblasts, NBs ) remains unclear. Here, we show that glial cells produce ferritin, which cooperates with Zip13 to transport iron into NBs for energy production. This process is essential for the self-renewal and proliferation of NBs. Knockdown of glial ferritin encoding genes leads to energy shortage in NBs via downregulation of aconitase activity and NAD+ level, resulting in low proliferation and premature differentiation of NBs mediated by Prospero entering nuclei. Moreover, ferritin is a potential target for tumor suppression. In addition, the level of glial ferritin production is affected by the status of NBs, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. In this study, we demonstrate that glial cells are indispensable for maintaining the self-renewal of NBs, unveiling a novel role of the NB glial niche during brain development.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, cancer was considered a risk factor for increased mortality. However, several countries reported that deaths with a primary code of cancer remained within historic levels during the pandemic. To further elucidate the relationship between cancer mortality and COVID-19 on a population level in the US, we compared pandemic-related mortality patterns from underlying and multiple cause ( MC ) death data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer’s. We found that nationally in 2020, MC cancer mortality rose by only 3% over a pre-pandemic baseline, corresponding to ~13, 600 excess deaths. Mortality elevation was measurably higher for less deadly cancers ( breast, colorectal, and hematological, 2–7% ) than cancers with a poor survival rate ( lung and pancreatic, 0–1% ). In comparison, there was substantial elevation in MC deaths from diabetes ( 37% ) and Alzheimer’s ( 19% ). To understand these differences, we simulated the expected excess mortality for each condition using COVID-19 attack rates, life expectancy, population size, and mean age of individuals living with each condition. We find that the observed mortality differences are primarily explained by differences in life expectancy, with the risk of death from deadly cancers outcompeting the risk of death from COVID-19. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering MC-of-death records to accurately reflect changes in coding practices associated with the emergence of a new pathogen.
The Smc5/6 complex is a core regulator of chromosome architecture that plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loops from eukaryotic genomes. R-loops are common transcriptional by-products that consist of an RNA-DNA duplex joined to a displaced strand of genomic DNA. While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established, there is still an incomplete understanding of the cellular processes responsible for their removal. Here, we show that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme in vitro. We demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to RNA-DNA hybrid structures formed during active gene transcription and telomere length regulation, and subsequently promotes the removal of these toxic structures via the stimulation of RNase H2 enzymatic activity. We also show that the Smc5/6 complex is directly involved in the repair of unscheduled R-loops generated by a diverse set of genomic transactions. In particular, we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to R-loop structures formed during active gene transcription and promotes RNase H2-mediated degradation of the RNA component of R-loops. These results suggest that the severe growth defects of yeast defective in both RNase H and the Smc5/6 complex can be linked to an accumulation of R-loops in the chromosomes of these cells. R-loops are most frequently observed at highly transcribed genes but can also be formed at telomeres and near DNA replication forks. We favor a model where the Smc5/6 complex acts at two distinct levels –within and between pathways– in the cellular response to R-loop formation. First, Smc5/6 contributes to RNase H-dependent removal of RNA-DNA hybrids from genomic DNA, as shown in Figures 1 and 2. In the execution of this function, the Smc5/6 role is substantial but not as extensive as that of RNase H enzymes.
Preserved communication abilities are important for healthy ageing, and the age-typical loss of sensory acuity might be compensated for by an individual’s preserved attentional neural filtering. Here, we investigated whether such a compensatory brain–behaviour link is longitudinally stable and can predict individual change in listening behaviour. We modelled electroencephalographic and behavioural data of N = 105 ageing individuals ( 39–82 y ) over 2 years. First, despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity, listening-task performance proved stable over 2 years. Second, neural filtering and behaviour were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint ( T1, T2 ). Longitudinally, however, our results raise caution on attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour: neither neural filtering at T1 nor its 2-year change could predict individual 2-year behavioural change, under a combination of modelling strategies. We aimed to replicate our key T1 results and test whether the previously observed between-subjects brain–behaviour relationship would hold across time: we expected an individual’s neural filtering ability to impact their listening performance ( accuracy and response speed ) independently of age or hearing status. However, when analysed in our longitudinal sample of ageing listeners, irrespective of the precise definition of neural filtering, we did not find evidence for a predictive role of neural filtering despite supporting brain–behaviour links observed within each timepoint. We characterised how hearing acuity, neural filtering, and listening performance change across the middle to older adult lifespan and analysed longitudinal change from timepoint 1 ( T1 ) to timepoint 2 ( T2 ). We used the same linear mixed-effect models to test cross-sectional effects of age and longitudinal changes with time. We additionally quantified each measure’s test–retest reliability as their T1–T2 Pearson’s correlation. Importantly, the behavioural outcome of interest, that is, the speed and accuracy with which an ageing individual solves a difficult listening situation, involves the orchestration of different perceptual and cognitive processes. We here focused on one candidate neurobiological implementation of an auditory attentional filter to help explain inter-individual differences in listening behaviour and its lifespan trajectories.
Chemosensation, the combination of taste, smell, and chemesthesis, plays a crucial role in the ability of animals to find high-value foods and avoid toxins. In humans, chemosensation has been exploited to use unpalatable and toxic substances as medicines, yet the importance of chemosensation in this process is poorly understood. Here, we investigate whether chemosensory qualities can predict the therapeutic use of botanical drugs in ancient Graeco-Roman times. We generated tasting-panel data for botanical drugs and applied phylogenetic generalised linear mixed models to test whether intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities, as well as particular tastes and flavours, can predict ancient drug use. Our results show that chemosensation is strongly predictive of therapeutic use: botanical drugs with high therapeutic versatility have simple yet intense tastes and flavours, and 21 of 22 chemosensory qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use. In addition to the common notion of bitter tasting medicines, we also found starchy, musky, sweet, and soapy drugs associated with versatility. These findings suggest that the uses of drugs in ancient Greece and Rome were based on observed physiological effects that are often consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology. Our study proposes that chemosensation and underlying physiological effects mediated by chemesthesis and taste receptor pharmacology co-explain the diversity of therapeutic uses of botanical drugs in ancient times. This is an unprecedented insight into how chemosensation in combination with physiological effects guided human behaviour in pre-historic times and conditioned therapeutic expectations and humoral theory in historic times. Our approach demonstrates the power of phylogenetic methods applied to human behaviour and assessment of plant properties, and shows that chemosensory perception connects ancient therapeutic knowledge with modern science.
Bacteria of the family Enterobacteriaceae, such as non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica serovars, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter koseri, are associated with gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding and bacteremia, and are a leading cause of death from sepsis in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. These bacteria are prone to bloodstream entry, but the mechanisms underlying this behavior remain poorly understood. Herein, we report that clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae are rapidly attracted toward sources of human serum and that this response is orchestrated through chemotaxis and the chemoattractant L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum that is recognized through direct binding by the chemoreceptor Tsr. We report the first crystal structures of Salmonella Typhimurium Tsr in complex with L-serine and identify a conserved amino acid recognition motif for L-serine shared among Tsr orthologues. We find that Tsr is widely conserved among Enterobacteriaceae and numerous World Health Organization priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. Furthermore, we find that Enterobacteriaceae use human serum as a source of nutrients for growth and that chemotaxis and the chemoreceptor Tsr provide a competitive advantage for migration into enterohemorrhagic lesions. We define this bacterial behavior of taxis toward serum, colonization of hemorrhagic lesions, and consumption of serum nutrients as ‘bacterial vampirism’, which may relate to the proclivity of Enterobacteriaceae for bloodstream infections.
Male germ cells share a conserved genetic program that defines their cellular identity across animal species. However, the unique evolutionary dynamics of male germ cells coupled with their widespread leaky transcription pose significant obstacles to the identification of the core spermatogenic program. Through network analysis of the spermatocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and invertebrate species, we describe the conserved evolutionary origin of metazoan male germ cells at the molecular level. We estimate the average functional requirement of a metazoan male germ cell to correspond to the expression of approximately 10, 000 protein-coding genes, a third of which defines a genetic scaffold of deeply conserved genes that has been retained throughout evolution. Such scaffold contains a set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene expression regulators that represent a core component of the conserved genetic program of metazoan spermatogenesis. By genetically interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male germ cell identity, we uncover 161 previously unknown spermatogenesis genes and three new potential genetic causes of human infertility. These findings emphasize the importance of evolutionary history on human reproductive disease and establish a cross-species analytical pipeline that can be repurposed to other cell types and pathologies.
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a model organism for studying flagellate motility, employs synchronous, breaststroke-like flagellar beating to swim and modulate the beating amplitudes to steer. The synchrony of beating is known to be supported by a mechanical connection between flagella, but how flagellar asymmetries persist in the synchrony remains elusive. It has been speculated that one flagellum leads the beating, as its dynamic properties appear to be copied by the other one. To elucidate the roles played by each flagellum in synchronous beating, we combine experiments, computations, and modeling efforts. We show that the coordinated beating essentially only responds to load exerted on the cis flagellum, and that such asymmetry in response derives from a unilateral coupling between the two flagella. Our results highlight a distinct role for each flagellum in coordination and have implications for biflagellates’ tactic behaviors. Dynamic modulation of flagellar dominance during synchronous beating is the basis of C. reinhardtii’s tactic motility. Calcium has been speculated to facilitate such dynamic modulation because it is involved in switching the beating mode. We develop a reduced stochastic model for the system to elucidate the mechanisms at the origin of this asymmetry. The model shows that selective hydrodynamic loading and flagellar dominance in the coordinated beating are respectively represented by ϵc≠ϵt and λct≠λtc. We test this hypothesis by employing oscillatory flows applied from an angle with respect to the cells’ symmetry axis and thus exert biased loads on one flagellum. Using this model, we express f and ε, which we can measure experimentally, as a function of fc, t, ϵc, t, λct and λtc to illustrate how the flagellar dominance and selective loading affect the coordinated flagellar beating. Moreover, with Monte-Carlo simulations, we clarify the interplay between flows and flagella and reproduce all experimental observations.
Intermittent fasting has been shown to have beneficial effects on metabolism, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we report that intermittent fasting promotes the production of interleukin-22 ( IL-22 ) by type 3 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC3s ) in the intestine, which in turn leads to the beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Beigeing is a process by which white adipose tissue is converted into a more metabolically active brown adipose tissue-like state, leading to increased energy expenditure and improved metabolic health. We found that adoptive transfer of intestinal ILC3s into diet-induced obese mice increased beigeing of white adipose tissue, and that exogenous IL-22 significantly increased beigeing of subcutaneous white adipose tissue. Furthermore, we found that deficiency of the IL-22 receptor ( IL-22R ) attenuated the beigeing induced by intermittent fasting, suggesting that the IL-22/IL-22R axis plays a critical role in the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting. We also found that intermittent fasting increased aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling in ILC3s, and that it may stimulate the interaction of ILC3s with dendritic cells and macrophages. These results establish the role of intestinal ILC3s in beigeing of white adipose tissue, and suggest that the ILC3/IL-22/IL-22R axis contributes to the metabolic benefit of intermittent fasting.
Pavlovian fear conditioning is a well-studied phenomenon in which an organism learns to associate a neutral stimulus with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), such as footshock, to elicit a defensive response. However, most classical conditioning paradigms focus on freezing as the primary defensive behavior, obscuring the contributions of associative and non-associative mechanisms to dynamic defensive responses. In this study, we used a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that paired a serial compound stimulus (SCS), consisting of a tone and white noise (WN) stimulus periods, with footshock to investigate how associative and non-associative mechanisms affect defensive responses in male and female adult C57BL/6 J mice. We compared this paired SCS-footshock group with four control groups that were conditioned with either pseudorandom unpaired presentations of SCS and footshock, shock only, or reversed SCS presentations with inverted tone-WN order, with paired or unpaired presentations. On day 2 of conditioning, the paired group exhibited robust freezing during the tone period and explosive jumping and darting behaviors during the WN period. In contrast, the unpaired and both reverse SCS groups expressed less tone-induced freezing and rarely showed jumping or darting during WN. Following the second day of conditioning, we observed how defensive behavior changed over two extinction sessions. During extinction, the tone-induced freezing decreased in the paired group, and mice rapidly shifted from escape jumping during WN to a combination of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired reverse, and shock-only groups displayed defensive tail rattling and darting during the SCS, with minimal freezing and jumping. Interestingly, the paired reverse group did not jump to WN, and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. These findings demonstrate that non-associative factors promote some defensive responsiveness, but associative factors are required for robust cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight expression.
Insects are able to navigate their environment by keeping track of their head direction. Previous studies have shown that insects encode their head direction as a sinusoidal activity pattern around a ring of neurons arranged in an eight-column structure. However, it is unclear whether this sinusoidal encoding of head direction is an evolutionary coincidence or if it offers a particular functional advantage. To address this question, we establish the basic mathematical requirements for direction encoding and show that it can be performed by many circuits, all with different activity patterns. Among these activity patterns, we prove that the sinusoidal one is the most noise-resilient, but only when coupled with a sinusoidal connectivity pattern between the encoding neurons. We compare this predicted optimal connectivity pattern with anatomical data from the head direction circuits of the locust and the fruit fly, finding that our theory agrees with experimental evidence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our predicted circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying that the neural connectivity does not need to be explicitly encoded in the genetic program of the insect but rather can emerge during development. Finally, we illustrate that in our theory, the consistent presence of the eight-column organisation of head direction circuits across multiple insect species is not a chance artefact but instead can be explained by basic evolutionary principles.
Parkinson’s disease ( PD ) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations of PTEN-induced kinase 1 ( PINK1 ) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, both of which are pivotal in maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CISD1, a homodimeric mitochondrial iron-sulfur-binding protein, is a major target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. We here discovered a heightened propensity of CISD1 to form dimers in Pink1 mutant flies and in dopaminergic neurons from PINK1 mutation patients. The dimer consists of two monomers that are covalently linked by a disulfide bridge. In this conformation CISD1 cannot coordinate the iron-sulfur cofactor. Overexpressing Cisd, the Drosophila ortholog of CISD1, and a mutant Cisd incapable of binding the iron-sulfur cluster in Drosophila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was more pronounced with mutant Cisd and aggravated in Pink1 mutant flies. Complete loss of Cisd, in contrast, rescued all detrimental effects of Pink1 mutation on climbing ability, wing posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial ultrastructure. Our results suggest that Cisd, probably iron-depleted Cisd, operates downstream of Pink1 shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CISD1 as a potential therapeutic target. In summary, our results suggest that the mitochondrial iron-sulfur cluster protein Cisd is downstream of the pathophysiological cascade initiated by Pink1 and partially Prkn loss of function in flies and probably also in humans. This sheds light on the pathophysiology of PD and implicates CISD1 as a therapeutic target protein. We here identified the mitochondrial protein CISD1, specifically its iron-depleted form, as a potential downstream mediator of the pathophysiological effects arising from the loss of PINK1 function, and to a certain extent, Parkin loss of function. Our investigation revealed that both dopaminergic neurons from familial PD patients with PINK1 mutations and Pink1 mutant flies exhibit increased levels of a slower-migrating form of CISD1/Cisd on immunoblots. Based on the involvement of mammalian CISD1 in mitochondrial bioenergetics and quality control, iron metabolism and defense against oxidative distress – all hallmarks of PD – we aimed to investigate CISD1’s role in PD using both fly and mammalian model systems. In our study, we identified CISD1, particularly its iron-depleted apo form, as a downstream mediator of the PD pathology induced by the loss of Pink1 and Prkn function. Immunoblotting revealed increased dimer formation and even the presence of a CISD1 multimer under these conditions. Consequently, we conclude that the increased dimer formation in the PINK1 mutant neurons likely represents the presence of apo-CISD1, a form of CISD1 devoid of its iron-sulfur cluster, and that this is caused by changes in the iron homeostasis.
Phytoplasmas, a type of obligate parasite, induce significant changes in their plant hosts to facilitate transmission to new hosts. The molecular mechanisms behind these changes, known as extended phenotypes, are not well understood. The virulence protein SAP54, produced by phytoplasmas, is responsible for the induction of leaf-like flowers in phytoplasma-infected plants. However, we previously demonstrated that the attraction of leafhopper vectors to infected plants is not due to the leaf-like flowers, but rather to the leaves themselves. Here, we show that leaf exposure to leafhopper males is required for the attraction phenotype, suggesting a leaf response that distinguishes leafhopper sex in the presence of SAP54. In contrast, SAP54 alongside leafhopper females discourages further female colonization. We demonstrate that SAP54 suppresses biotic stress response pathways in leaves exposed to males. The host plant MADS-box transcription factor short vegetative phase ( SVP ) emerges as a key element in the female leafhopper preference for plants exposed to males, with SAP54 promoting the degradation of SVP. This preference extends to female colonization of male-exposed svp null mutant plants over those not exposed to males. Our research underscores the dual role of the phytoplasma effector SAP54 in host development alteration and vector attraction, integral to the phytoplasma life cycle. Importantly, we clarify how SAP54, by targeting SVP, heightens leaf vulnerability to leafhopper males, thus facilitating female attraction and subsequent plant colonization by the insects. SAP54 essentially acts as a molecular ‘matchmaker’, helping male leafhoppers more easily locate mates by degrading SVP-containing complexes in leaves. This study not only provides insights into the long reach of single parasite genes in extended phenotypes, but also opens avenues for understanding how transcription factors that regulate plant developmental processes intersect with and influence plant-insect interactions.
Candida albicans is an opportunistic human pathogen that poses a significant threat to human health and is associated with a substantial socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments are often ineffective, at least in part, because C. albicans can initiate a strong drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above their minimal inhibitory concentration. To better understand this tolerance response, we used a nanoliter droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish their subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antifungal drugs. We found that profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell cycle stage and distinct metabolic and stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure, surviving cells bifurcate into two major subpopulations: one characterized by the upregulation of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, rRNA processing machinery, and mitochondrial cellular respiration capacity, termed the Ribo-dominant ( Rd ) state; and the other enriched for genes encoding stress responses and related processes, termed the Stress-dominant ( Sd ) state. This bifurcation persists at 3 and 6 days post-treatment. We provide evidence that the ribosome assembly stress response ( RASTR ) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate cell survival.
The nearly neutral theory of molecular evolution posits that the effectiveness of selection varies among species. In an idealized model, the census population size determines both the minimum magnitude of the selection coefficient required for deleterious variants to be reliably purged and the amount of neutral diversity. Empirical estimates of effective population size are often based on the amount of putatively neutral genetic diversity and are assumed to capture a species’ effectiveness of selection. However, this approach is confounded by among-species variation in %GC content and/or amino acid composition. Here, we propose a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ), based on Kullback–Leibler divergence, that corrects for both confounders. We demonstrate the use of CAIS correlations, as well as the Effective Number of Codons, to show that the protein domains of more highly adapted vertebrate species evolve higher intrinsic structural disorder. We extend the Codon Adaptation Index ( CAI ) using Kullback–Leibler divergence to create a new Codon Adaptation Index of Species ( CAIS ) that corrects for both GC and amino acid composition. This new metric can be readily calculated without data on polymorphism or mutation rate, without selecting reference genes, and without concerns about demographic history. We posit that more highly adapted species have a higher proportion of both genes and sites subject to effective selection on codon bias. Codon adaptation metrics more directly quantify how species vary in their exquisiteness of adaptation, than do estimates of effective population size that are based on neutral polymorphism. Both CAIS and ENC can be estimated for far more species because they do not require polymorphism or mutation rate data, nor tRNA gene copy numbers and abundances, but only a single complete genome. CAIS has the additional advantage of not being confounded with amino acid frequencies. We developed a new metric of species adaptedness at the codon level, capable of quantifying degrees of codon adaptation even among vertebrates.
Sepsis is a global health priority that causes millions of deaths per year. It is characterized by a dysregulated inflammatory immune response, indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation. One important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ), which is released by inflamed host cells and tissues, as well as by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP and its role in sepsis pathogenesis. We used genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) to demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane. We also found that impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane contributes to ATP release and is associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, we analyzed the local effects of bacterial ATP using a transformed E. coli bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. We found that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. In addition, bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles ( OMV ). ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulate expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis.
The relationship between psychotic-like experiences ( PLEs ) in children and the risk of developing psychosis, schizophrenia, and other mental disorders is well established. However, the factors that contribute to the development of PLEs in children are not yet fully understood. In this study, we used large-scale longitudinal data from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study to examine the relationships between genetic and environmental factors, cognitive intelligence, and PLEs in 6, 602 children. We found that lower cognitive intelligence and higher PLEs were significantly associated with lower polygenic scores for cognitive phenotypes, lower family and neighborhood socioeconomic status, and less supportive environments. We also found that cognitive intelligence mediates the effects of these factors on PLEs, with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs. Our findings suggest that improving school and family environments and promoting local economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children. We used a novel structural equation modeling ( SEM ) method to examine the longitudinal trajectories of genetic and environmental influences on PLEs mediated by cognitive intelligence. We found that higher polygenic scores for cognitive capacity phenotypes were significantly associated with higher intelligence and lower PLEs, while lower family and neighborhood socioeconomic status and less supportive environments were associated with lower intelligence and higher PLEs. We also found that the effects of genetic and environmental factors on PLEs were mediated by cognitive intelligence, with supportive parenting and positive school environments showing the strongest impact on reducing PLEs.
Fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is a morphogen that plays a crucial role in establishing graded positional cues during early fetal telencephalic development. In this study, we used human induced pluripotent stem cell ( hiPSC )-derived cerebral organoids as an in vitro platform to investigate the effect of FGF8 signaling on neural identity and differentiation. We found that FGF8 treatment increases cellular heterogeneity, leading to distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic-like domains that co-develop in multi-regional organoids. Within telencephalic regions, FGF8 affects the anteroposterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, thus impacting spontaneous neuronal network activity. Moreover, FGF8 efficiently modulates key regulators responsible for several human neurodevelopmental disorders. Overall, our results show that FGF8 signaling is directly involved in both regional patterning and cellular diversity in human cerebral organoids and in modulating genes associated with normal and pathological neural development. Transcriptomic analysis of FGF8-treated versus untreated cerebral organoids revealed a clear FGF8-mediated induction of ventral telencephalic genes, suggesting that one of the primary roles of FGF8 signaling within telencephalic territories may be the promotion of ventral identity. Consistently, we observed upregulation of ventral genes such as ASCL1, DLX2, and PBX3 and simultaneous downregulation of dorsal genes like EMX1, NEUROG2, SOX5, and LHX2. Our findings indicate that FGF8 treatment leads to altered regional identities in 3D organoids compared to untreated controls, resulting in the development of multi-regional organoids with distinct co-developing brain domains. FGF8 efficiently modulates NR2F1 and other genes associated with brain disorders in human FOXG1+ telencephalic cells, underscoring its critical role in the fine-tuning of key neurodevelopmental and pathogenic pathways. In summary, our findings highlight an FGF8-dependent effect on regional identity, along with the modulation of several NDD-related targets, including an evolutionarily conserved FGF8-NR2F1 molecular axis.
In Drosophila larvae, sleep and feeding patterns lack strong daily rhythms until the 3rd instar larval stage ( L3 ), when feeding is consolidated to the day and sleep to the night. Here, we identify a role for nutritional status in driving sleep-wake rhythm development in Drosophila larvae. We find that in the 2nd instar larval period ( L2 ), sleep and feeding are spread across the day; these behaviors become organized into daily patterns by the 3rd instar larval stage ( L3 ). Forcing mature ( L3 ) animals to adopt immature ( L2 ) feeding strategies disrupts sleep-wake rhythms and the ability to exhibit long-term memory ( LTM ). In addition, the development of the clock ( DN1a ) -arousal ( Dh44 ) circuit itself is influenced by the larval nutritional environment. Finally, we demonstrate that larval arousal Dh44 neurons act through glucose metabolic genes to drive onset of daily sleep-wake rhythms. Together, our data suggest that changes to energetic demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circadian circuits and behaviors.
Fish swimming in groups, also known as schools, have long been thought to reduce the cost of locomotion. However, direct measurements of the energy-saving benefits of fluid-mediated collective movements have remained elusive. In this study, we characterized both aerobic and anaerobic metabolic energy contributions in schools of giant danio ( Devario aequipinnatus ). We found that fish swimming in schools have a concave upward shaped metabolism–speed curve, with a minimum metabolic cost at ~1 body length s–1. We also discovered that fish swimming in schools reduce total energy expenditure ( TEE ) per tail beat by up to 56% compared to solitary fish. When reaching their maximum sustained swimming speed, fish swimming in schools had a 44% higher maximum aerobic performance and used 65% less non-aerobic energy compared to solitary individuals, which lowered the TEE and total cost of transport by up to 53%, near the lowest recorded for any aquatic organism. Fish in schools also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. The non-aerobic energetic savings that occur when fish in schools actively swim at high speed can considerably improve both peak and repeated performance, which is likely to be beneficial for evading predators. These energetic savings may underlie the prevalence of coordinated group locomotion in fishes.
Human airway macrophages ( AM ) are the predominant immune cells in the lung and play a crucial role in preventing infection. They are a target for host-directed therapy, and their function is associated with cellular metabolism. However, there is a knowledge gap in understanding the metabolic reprogramming and functional plasticity of distinct human macrophage subpopulations, especially in lung resident AM. We examined tissue-resident AM and monocyte-derived macrophages ( MDM ) in their resting state and after priming with IFN-γ or IL-4 to model the Th1/Th2 axis in the lung. We found that human macrophages, regardless of origin, had a strong induction of glycolysis in response to IFN-γ or upon stimulation. IFN-γ significantly enhanced cellular energetics in both AM and MDM by upregulating both glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Upon stimulation, AM did not decrease oxidative phosphorylation unlike MDM which shifted to ‘Warburg’-like metabolism. IFN-γ priming promoted cytokine secretion in AM. Blocking glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose significantly reduced IFN-γ driven cytokine production in AM, indicating that IFN-γ induces functional plasticity in human AM, which is mechanistically mediated by glycolysis. Directly comparing responses between macrophages, AM were more responsive to IFN-γ priming and dependent on glycolysis for cytokine secretion than MDM. Interestingly, TNF production was under the control of glycolysis in AM and not in MDM. MDM exhibited glycolysis-dependent upregulation of HLA-DR and CD40, whereas IFN-γ upregulated HLA-DR and CD40 on AM independently of glycolysis. These data indicate that human AM are functionally plastic and respond to IFN-γ in a manner distinct from MDM. These data provide evidence that human AM are a tractable target for inhalable immunomodulatory therapies for respiratory diseases.
For the first time in any animal, we show that nocturnal bull ants use the polarised light pattern produced by the moon for overnight navigation. We demonstrate that these ants can detect polarised moonlight and use it to navigate home during the night, even under crescent moons when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Polarised moonlight forms part of the celestial compass of navigating nocturnal ants and is likely detected and integrated into the ant’s path integrator for inbound homing along the same visual pathways as polarised sunlight. Nocturnal bull ants leave their nest at twilight and rely heavily on the overhead solar polarisation pattern to navigate. However, many foragers return home overnight when the sun cannot guide them. We show that these ants use polarised moonlight to navigate home during the night by rotating the overhead polarisation pattern above homing ants, who alter their headings in response. Furthermore, these ants can detect this cue throughout the lunar month, even under crescent moons, when polarised light levels are at their lowest. Finally, we show the long-term incorporation of this moonlight pattern into the ants’ path integration system throughout the night for homing, as polarised sunlight is incorporated throughout the day. This ability to detect polarised moonlight may be present across nocturnal insects more broadly, including nocturnal bees and crickets, but there is currently no behavioural evidence for its use in goal-directed navigation.
Pterosaurs, the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base that allowed them to shift their center of mass and potentially benefit flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin soft tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. To maintain stiffness in the vane, early pterosaurs had to develop a sophisticated dynamic tensioning system. However, how this was achieved has been unclear, especially since vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and are absent in birds and bats. Here, we use Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-linking lattice within the tail vanes of early pterosaurs. This lattice supported a dynamic tensioning system that maintained vane stiffness, allowing the whole tail to augment flight control and the vane to function as a display structure. We examined over 100 Solnhofen pterosaur fossils for well-preserved tail vanes using an ultraviolet torch. Four exceptional specimens were then imaged under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence. Three specimens exhibited tail vanes under white light, but the vane of one specimen was only visible under Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence.
Adolescence is a period of life characterized by changes in reward-related behaviors, social behaviors, and decision-making. These changes are necessary for the transition into adulthood, but they also increase vulnerability to the development of a range of psychiatric disorders. The reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie, in part, the associated behavioral changes and increased vulnerability. In this study, we examined differences in dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens ( NAc ) core of adolescent ( P28-35 ) and adult ( P70-90 ) male rats using fast scan cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis. We found baseline differences between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release in male rats, as well as opposite effects of the α6 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) on modulating dopamine release. The α6-selective blocker, α-conotoxin, increased dopamine release in early adolescent rats, but decreased dopamine release in rats beginning in middle adolescence and extending through adulthood. Strikingly, blockade of GABAA and GABAB receptors revealed that this α6-mediated increase in adolescent dopamine release requires NAc GABA signaling to occur. We confirmed the role of α6 nAChRs and GABA in mediating this effect in vivo using microdialysis. Our results suggest a multisynaptic mechanism potentially unique to the period of development that includes early adolescence, involving acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs to drive inhibitory GABA tone on dopamine release. This effect is driven, in part, by multisynaptic regulation of dopamine release only in adolescent male rats, through both acetylcholine acting at α6-containing nAChRs and GABA tone.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a wide range of behavioral and phenotypic heterogeneity. Despite the lack of genetic overlap between different ASD subtypes, our study demonstrates that two distinct ASD subtypes, idiopathic and 16p11. 2 deletion, share common defects in neural precursor cell (NPC) neurite outgrowth and migration. These defects are driven by the shared pathogenic mechanism of mTOR signaling dysregulation. mTOR signaling alterations were confirmed in all NPCs across both ASD subtypes, and mTOR modulation rescued ASD phenotypes and reproduced autism NPC-associated phenotypes in control NPCs. Thus, our studies demonstrate that genetically distinct ASD subtypes have common defects in neurite outgrowth and migration which are driven by the shared pathogenic mechanism of mTOR signaling dysregulation. Importantly, our study indicates that ASD NPCs not only have enrichment of dysregulated mTOR but that mTOR dysregulation is driving autism-associated phenotypes. To determine whether the mTOR differences described above drive the developmental abnormalities in our cohorts, we conducted gain and loss of function studies on all I-ASD and both male 16pDel NPCs. We show that increasing mTOR pathway activity can rescue ASD defects while reducing mTOR pathway activity reproduces autism NPC phenotypes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mTOR signaling alterations are a point of convergence for the shared ASD neurite and migration phenotypes. Our findings suggest that altered cellular signaling plays an important role in the pathogenesis of ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs).
Inner hair cells ( IHCs ) and spiral ganglion neurons ( SGNs ) form afferent synapses in the cochlea that are essential for sound encoding. These synapses are heterogeneous in structure and function, with differences in presynaptic active zones, postsynaptic SGNs, and synaptic physiology. Here, we investigated the relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural response diversity in the cochlea. We performed paired recordings of IHCs and postsynaptic SGN boutons in acutely explanted organs of Corti from hearing mice with stimuli and conditions aimed to mimic in vivo SGN characterization. We found that synapses with high spontaneous rate of release ( SR ) were predominantly located on the pillar side of the IHC. These high SR synapses had larger and more temporally compact spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents ( EPSCs ), lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. These results indicate that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs. We also compared the physiology of afferent synapses with high and low SR by adapting stimulation protocols routinely employed for in vivo characterization of sound encoding by SGNs. We used step depolarizations to emulate physiological receptor potentials given that mature IHCs of the ‘high-frequency’ mouse cochlea have graded receptor potentials that primarily represent the rectified envelope of an acoustic stimulus ( i. e. the DC component; Russell and Sellick, 1978 ). We found that high SR synapses had larger and more temporally compact EPSCs, lower voltage thresholds, tighter coupling of Ca2+ channels and vesicular release sites, shorter response latencies, and higher initial release rates. These results indicate that synaptic heterogeneity in IHCs directly contributes to the diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked firing of SGNs.
Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the deadliest form of malaria, has a complex life cycle that involves multiple stages of development. During this progression, the parasite faces various environmental challenges that necessitate the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. In this study, we investigated the role of Microrchidia ( MORC ) proteins in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression in P. falciparum. MORC proteins have been implicated in DNA compaction and gene silencing in both plant and animal kingdoms, and have been shown to play a role as a transcriptional switch in apicomplexan parasites. We used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing tool along with complementary molecular and genomics approaches to determine the function, genome distribution, and indispensability of PfMORC in P. falciparum. We found that PfMORC not only modulates chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation throughout the parasite erythrocytic cycle, but is also essential for parasite survival. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing ( ChIP-seq ) experiments revealed that PfMORC binds to sub-telomeric regions and genes involved in antigenic variation, and may also play a role in modulating stage transition. Protein knockdown experiments followed by chromatin conformation capture ( Hi-C ) studies showed that downregulation of PfMORC impairs key histone marks and induces the collapse of the parasite heterochromatin structure leading to its death. These findings confirm that PfMORC plays a crucial role in chromatin structure and gene regulation, validating this factor as a strong candidate for novel antimalarial strategies.
Cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an exploration into whether nerves infiltrating tumors contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a mouse model for head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing, we show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct brain areas. The activation of this neuronal circuitry altered behaviors ( decreased nest-building, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced wheel running ). Tumor-infiltrating nociceptor neurons exhibited heightened calcium activity and brain regions receiving these neural projections showed elevated Fos as well as increased calcium responses compared to non-tumor-bearing counterparts. The genetic elimination of nociceptor neurons decreased brain Fos expression and mitigated the behavioral alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie test behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary wheel running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of such behavioral shifts. Our findings suggest that, in addition to pain, tumor-infiltrating nerves communicate signals to the brain that lead to cancer-associated changes in behavior. We have demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating nerves are integrated into a pre-established neuronal circuit. This circuit extends from the tumor bed to the TGM ganglion, connects to the SpVc, and projects into the brain, influencing behavior in both pain-dependent and independent ways. The absence of nociceptor neurons in tumor-bearing animals decreased cFos and ΔFosB in the PBN, and ΔFosB in the SpVc. These data suggest that the tumor-brain communication was disrupted in the absence of nociceptor neurons. The elimination of TRPV1-expressing nociceptor neurons reduces tumor growth and enhances survival rates, and highlights a potential therapeutic target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients.
SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, is characterized by a high degree of genetic diversity, which is a hallmark of RNA viruses and the basis for their evolutionary success. The nucleocapsid protein ( N-protein ) is a highly expressed and multifunctional protein of SARS-CoV-2 that plays a central role in viral replication, transcription, and assembly. Here, we examine the impact of mutations across the spectrum of viable amino acid sequences on the biophysical phenotypes of the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein. We find that variation in the physicochemical parameters of its extended intrinsically disordered regions ( IDRs ) is sufficient to allow local plasticity, but also observe functional constraints that similarly occur in related coronaviruses. In biophysical experiments with several N-protein species carrying mutations associated with major variants, we find that point mutations in the IDRs can have nonlocal impact and modulate thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, protein oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid phase separation. In the Omicron variant, distant mutations in different IDRs have compensatory effects in shifting a delicate balance of interactions controlling protein assembly properties, and include the creation of a new protein-protein interaction interface in the N-terminal IDR through the defining P13L mutation. We computationally evaluate the range of several biophysical traits resulting from diversity in the SARS-CoV-2 N-protein folded domains and IDRs across the observed mutant spectrum, as well as related coronaviruses. In complementary biophysical experiments with several representative N-protein mutants derived from SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern, we characterize their variation in thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, energetics of NA binding, assembly, and LLPS propensity. We find that a large biophysical parameter space is available for viable N-protein, with the potential for mutations to exert nonlocal effects modulating overall protein biophysical properties.
Hibernation is a period of metabolic suppression utilized by small and large mammal species to survive during winter periods. Our study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization. We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators, Ictidomys tridecemlineatus and Eliomys quercinus, and larger hibernators, Ursus arctos and Ursus americanus. We then conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand. In parallel, we performed multiple proteomics analyses. Our results showed a preservation of myosin structure in U. arctos and U. americanus during hibernation, whilst in I. tridecemlineatus and E. quercinus, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor unexpectedly led to higher levels in energy expenditure of type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures ( 20 °C ). Upon repeating loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments at 8 °C ( near the body temperature of torpid animals ), we found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77–107% during torpor compared to active periods. Additionally, we observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in I. tridecemlineatus, which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule. This may act as a potential molecular mechanism mitigating myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure. Altogether, we demonstrate that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Additionally, we observe that it is further altered in response to cold exposure and highlight myosin as a potentially contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis.
Chondrocyte columns, a hallmark of growth plate architecture, play a central role in bone elongation. In this work, we analyzed hundreds of Confetti multicolor clones in growth plates of mouse embryos using a pipeline comprising 3D imaging and algorithms for morphometric analysis. Surprisingly, analysis of the elevation angles between neighboring pairs of cells revealed that most cells did not display the typical stacking pattern associated with column formation, implying incomplete rotation of the division plane. Morphological analysis revealed that although embryonic clones were elongated, they formed clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. Analysis of growth plates of postnatal mice revealed both complex columns, composed of ordered and disordered cell stacks, and small, disorganized clusters located in the outer edges. Finally, correlation between the temporal dynamics of the ratios between clusters and columns and between bone elongation and expansion suggests that clusters may promote expansion, whereas columns support elongation. Overall, our findings support the idea that modulations of division plane rotation of proliferating chondrocytes determines the formation of either clusters or columns, a multifunctional design that regulates morphogenesis throughout pre- and postnatal bone growth. We analyzed the 3D architecture of confetti-labeled clones in the embryonic and postnatal growth plate of mice and found that chondrocytes in the embryonic growth plate are rarely arranged in columns. Instead, successive incomplete rotations during cell division result in non-stereotypic cell stacking that, in turn, give rise to elongated clusters oriented orthogonally to the longitudinal bone axis. Addressing the three criteria for a column, we found that uniclonal and multiclonal columns are rare in the embryonic growth plate. We discovered that the core mechanism underlying chondrocyte column formation, namely a complete rotation of the division plane during chondrocyte proliferation, is rare in the embryonic growth plate. Our 3D analyses reveal the temporal dynamics of division plane rotations and their effect on the formation of columns and clusters in the pre- and postnatal growth plate, as well as the correlation of these morphogenetic processes with different growth behaviors. The presence of clusters and columns correlated temporally with the rates of growth plate elongation and expansion, suggesting that these structures support different growth strategies during embryonic and postnatal bone development.
Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters ( POTs ) are of great pharmaceutical interest due to their promiscuous substrate binding site, which has been linked to improved oral bioavailability of several classes of drugs. POTs are conserved across all phylogenetic kingdoms and function by coupling peptide uptake to the proton electrochemical gradient. Recent cryo-EM structures and alphafold models have provided new insights into different conformational states of two mammalian POTs, SLC15A1 and SLC15A2. However, these studies leave open important questions regarding the mechanism of proton and substrate coupling. Here, we employ extensive unbiased and enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations to map out the full SLC15A2 conformational cycle and its thermodynamic driving forces. By computing conformational free energy landscapes in different protonation states and in the absence or presence of peptide substrate, we identify a likely sequence of intermediate protonation steps that drive inward-directed alternating access. These simulations identify key differences in the extracellular gate between mammalian and bacterial POTs, which we validate experimentally in cell-based transport assays. Our results from constant-PH MD and absolute binding free energy ( ABFE ) calculations also establish a mechanistic link between proton binding and peptide recognition, revealing key details underlying secondary active transport in POTs. This study provides a vital step forward in understanding proton-coupled peptide and drug transport in mammals and paves the way to integrate knowledge of solute carrier structural biology with enhanced drug design to target tissue and organ bioavailability.
Speech-induced suppression of neural responses in the auditory cortex is a common phenomenon across the animal kingdom, including humans. This suppression is thought to increase sensitivity to auditory feedback, enabling the detection of vocalization errors. However, a direct link between auditory suppression and sensitivity in human speech monitoring has remained elusive. To address this issue, we obtained intracranial electroencephalography ( iEEG ) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants during speech production. We first characterized the detailed topography of auditory suppression, which varied across the superior temporal gyrus ( STG ). Next, we performed a delayed auditory feedback ( DAF ) task to determine whether the suppressed sites were also sensitive to auditory feedback alterations. Indeed, overlapping sites showed enhanced responses to feedback, indicating sensitivity. Importantly, there was a strong correlation between the degree of auditory suppression and feedback sensitivity, suggesting suppression might be a key mechanism that underlies speech monitoring. Further, we found that when participants produced speech with simultaneous auditory feedback, posterior STG was selectively activated if participants were engaged in a DAF paradigm, suggesting that increased attentional load can modulate auditory feedback sensitivity.
Type IV restriction systems are among the most common forms of prokaryotic restriction systems. A comprehensive census of McrBC systems reveals their enormous abundance in diverse prokaryotes and a plethora of genomic associations. We focus on a previously uncharacterized branch of McrBC systems, which we denote as coiled-coil nuclease tandems ( CoCoNuTs ). CoCoNuTs are characterized by the presence of extensive coiled-coil structures and tandem nucleases. They show extraordinary variety, with three distinct types and multiple subtypes. All CoCoNuTs contain domains predicted to interact with translation system components, such as the SmpB-like OB-fold, Hsp70 homologs, or YTH domains, along with RNases, such as HEPN. These domains suggest that CoCoNuTs target RNA. Many CoCoNuTs might also target DNA via McrC nuclease homologs. CoCoNuTs are frequently encoded in the same predicted superoperons as additional restriction systems, such as Type I RM, BREX, and Druantia Type III. In many of these superoperons, CoCoNuTs are likely regulated by cyclic nucleotides, possibly RNA fragments with cyclic termini, that bind associated CARF ( CRISPR-Associated Rossmann Fold ) domains. We hypothesize that CoCoNuTs, together with ancillary restriction factors, employ an echeloned defense strategy analogous to that of Type III CRISPR-Cas systems, in which an immune response eliminating virus DNA and/or RNA is launched first, but then, if it fails, an abortive infection response leading to PCD/dormancy via host RNA cleavage takes over.
Calcineurin is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that is involved in diverse cellular processes and signal transduction pathways. In this study, we investigated the role of calcineurin in regulating innate immunity in Caenorhabditis elegans. We found that calcineurin is required for the rhythmic defecation motor program ( DMP ) in C. elegans, and that inhibition of calcineurin leads to defects in the DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to bacterial infection. We also found that intestinal bloating caused by calcineurin inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. Furthermore, we discovered that the TFEB ortholog, HLH-30, is required for lifespan extension mediated by calcineurin inhibition, and that the nuclear hormone receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcineurin inhibition and is necessary for the increased lifespan. Our studies provide a new mechanism for calcineurin inhibition-mediated longevity extension and uncover a role for calcineurin in the C. elegans DMP. Calcineurin activity is regulated by intracellular calcium levels, and increased amounts of calcium ions activate the phosphatase activity of calcineurin via the binding of the calcium-sensing protein calmodulin to calcineurin ( Klee et al., 1998 ). The rhythmic DMP cycle in C. elegans is known to be regulated by rhythmic calcium waves ( Dal Santo et al., 1999; Teramoto and Iwasaki, 2006 ). Calcineurin is a conserved protein from yeast to humans that is involved in diverse cellular processes and signal transduction pathways ( Chen et al., 2022; Hogan et al., 2003; Schulz and Yutzey, 2004; Ulengin-Talkish and Cyert, 2023; Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002; Dong et al., 2007; Kuhara et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2013; Dwivedi et al., 2009; Mair et al., 2011; Tao et al., 2013; Song et al., 2013; Hogan et al., 2003; Vandewalle et al., 2014 ).
Conflicts between task-relevant and task-irrelevant information can arise from different sources, such as sensory input and internal representations, and can be resolved by a limited set of cognitive control processes. However, how these processes can effectively address diverse conflicts remains a major challenge. Based on the cognitive space theory, different conflicts can be parameterized and represented as distinct points in a low-dimensional cognitive space, which can then be resolved by a limited set of cognitive control processes working along the dimensions. We hypothesize that conflicts similar in their sources are also represented similarly in the cognitive space. To test this hypothesis, we designed a task with five types of conflicts that could be conceptually parameterized. Both human performance and fMRI activity patterns in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex support that different types of conflicts are organized based on their similarity, thus suggesting cognitive space as a principle for representing conflicts. We further hypothesize that the cognitive space representing different types of conflicts may be located in the frontoparietal network due to its essential roles in conflict resolution. Two solutions to resolving different conflict types are proposed. They differ based on whether the same cognitive control mechanisms are applied across domains. On the one hand, the domain-general cognitive control theories posit that the frontoparietal cortex adaptively encodes task information and can thus flexibly implement control strategies for different types of conflicts. This is supported by the generalizable control adjustment.
Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most cases of preterm birth occur spontaneously and result from preterm labor with intact ( spontaneous preterm labor [sPTL] ) or ruptured ( preterm prelabor rupture of membranes [PPROM] ) membranes. The prediction of spontaneous preterm birth ( sPTB ) remains underpowered due to its syndromic nature and the dearth of independent analyses of the vaginal host immune response. We conducted the largest longitudinal investigation targeting vaginal immune mediators, referred to herein as the immunoproteome, in a population at high risk for sPTB. Vaginal swabs were collected across gestation from pregnant women who ultimately underwent term birth, sPTL, or PPROM. Cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides in the samples were quantified via specific and sensitive immunoassays. Predictive models were constructed from immune mediator concentrations. Throughout uncomplicated gestation, the vaginal immunoproteome harbors a cytokine network with a homeostatic profile. Yet, the vaginal immunoproteome is skewed toward a pro-inflammatory state in pregnant women who ultimately experience sPTL and PPROM. Such an inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte chemoattractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial proteins/peptides. The vaginal immunoproteome has improved predictive value over maternal characteristics alone for identifying women at risk for early ( <34 weeks ) sPTB. The vaginal immunoproteome undergoes homeostatic changes throughout gestation and deviations from this shift are associated with sPTB. Furthermore, the vaginal immunoproteome can be leveraged as a potential biomarker for early sPTB, a subset of sPTB associated with extremely adverse neonatal outcomes.
The Hernandez–Hernandez model is an in silico model of electrical and Ca2+ signaling in arterial myocytes that describes the fundamental ionic mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling during the development of myogenic tone in arterial blood vessels. The model is based on new experimental data indicating sex-specific differences in male and female arterial myocytes from murine resistance arteries. The model suggests that the KV1. 5 current is the dominant current regulating membrane potential in male myocytes, whereas KV2. 1 channels play a primary role in the control of membrane potential in female myocytes. The model also predicts that the gating of a small number of voltage-gated K+ channels and L-type Ca2+ channels drives sex-specific differences in intracellular Ca2+ and excitability over the physiological range of membrane potentials. We also show that in an idealized computational model of a vessel, female arterial smooth muscle exhibits heightened sensitivity to commonly used Ca2+ channel blockers compared to male. Importantly, the model predicts that clinically used antihypertensive CaV1. 2 channel blockers cause larger reductions in CaV1. 2 currents in female than in male arterial myocytes. Finally, we present a one-dimensional ( 1D ) vessel representation of electrotonically coupled arterial myocytes connected in series. Predictions from the idealized vessel suggest that Ca2+ channel blockers are more potent in females, resulting in a more substantial [Ca2+]i reduction in female arterial smooth muscle compared to male. The Hernandez–Hernandez model demonstrates the importance of sex-specific differences in CaV1. 2 and KV2. 1 channels.
Decomposition of plant litter is expected to be positively associated with precipitation. However, decomposers of varying sizes have different moisture dependencies. We hypothesized that higher tolerance of macro-decomposers to aridity may counterbalance the effect of smaller decomposers, leading to similar decomposition rates across climatic gradients. We tested this hypothesis by placing plant litter baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient, and by characterizing the macro-decomposer assemblages using pitfall trapping. We found that decomposers responded differently to precipitation levels based on their size. Microbial decomposition increased with precipitation in the winter while macro-decomposition peaked in arid sites during the summer. This led to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient except in hyper-arid sites. Macro-decomposer richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in arid environments. Our findings highlight the importance of macro-decomposition in arid-lands, possibly resolving the dryland decomposition conundrum, and emphasizing the need to contemplate decomposer size when investigating zoogeochemical processes. Macro-decomposition contributed minimally to whole-community decomposition during the winter, but during the summer dominated decomposition in the two arid sites. Using pitfall trapping, we found that macro-decomposer richness, abundance, and biomass followed a hump-shaped response to precipitation, peaking in arid environments. Our results suggest that decomposers respond differently to precipitation levels based on their size, leading to similar overall decomposition rates across the gradient, except in hyper-arid sites. We predicted that the opposing climatic dependencies of macrofauna and microorganisms and mesofauna should lead to similar overall decomposition rates across the precipitation gradient except in the hyper-arid sites in which decomposers activity is predicted to be minimal regardless of organism size. To reveal the mechanism, we sampled macro-decomposers across the aridity gradient and the two seasons, using pitfall traps. Consequently, and in sharp contrast to smaller organisms, macro-decomposition should follow a hump-shaped response to precipitation that peaks in arid ecosystems. To test this novel hypothesis, we examined the climate dependency of plant litter decomposition by microorganisms, meso-decomposers, and macro-decomposers along a sharp aridity gradient spanning from mean annual precipitation ( MAP ) of 22–526 mm. These findings supported the long-suggested but largely overlooked hypothesis that macro-decomposition governs plant litter decomposition in deserts.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) is a highly aggressive and lethal form of cancer, characterised by high rates of metastasis and limited treatment options. The hyperactivation of KRAS in almost all PDAC tumours drives the activation of RAC1, leading to enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropinocytosis. Macropinocytosis is a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but little is known about its role in the trafficking of signalling receptors. Here, we report that CYRI-B is highly expressed in PDAC tumours in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of Cyrib, the gene encoding CYRI-B, accelerates tumourigenesis, leading to enhanced ERK and JNK-induced proliferation in precancerous lesions. However, as disease progresses, loss of CYRI-B inhibits metastasis. CYRI-B depleted tumour cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysophosphatidic acid, a major driver of tumour spread, due to impaired macropinocytic uptake of the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1. Overall, we implicate CYRI-B as a mediator of growth and signalling in pancreatic cancer, providing new insights into pathways controlling metastasis.
HML-2 is the youngest clade of human endogenous retroviruses ( HERVs ) and includes many intact or nearly intact proviruses. However, no replication-competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans. HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates, including rhesus macaques, but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear. We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions. Age estimates, intact open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques. These proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between env and the 3′ long terminal repeat ( LTR ), derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K ( HML-8 ) -related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys ( OWM ), but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split. We also identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons. The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3, which disrupt the Rec Response Element ( RcRE ), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. We show that the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element ( CTE ), indicating the ancestral Rec–RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism.
Enterococcus faecalis ( E. faecalis ) is often found in persistent non-healing wounds, including diabetic foot ulcers, burns, and surgical sites. To investigate the role of E. faecalis in chronic wound infections, we employed single-cell RNA sequencing ( scRNA-seq ) on infected wounds in comparison to uninfected wounds in a mouse model. Our analysis revealed unique transcriptional and metabolic alterations in infected wounds, elucidating the distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to the normal wound healing process. We identified dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes in response to infection, jointly contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. Notably, E. faecalis infection prompted a premature, incomplete epithelial-mesenchymal transition in keratinocytes. Additionally, E. faecalis infection modulated M2-like macrophage polarization by inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro, in vivo, and in our scRNA-seq atlas. Furthermore, we discovered macrophage crosstalk with neutrophils, which regulates chemokine signaling pathways, while promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells. Overall, our findings offer new insights into the immunosuppressive role of E. faecalis in wound infections. We observed that E. faecalis induces immunosuppression in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, delaying the immune response. Our study provides a comprehensive comparison of the transcriptomic and cellular communication profiles between uninfected and E. faecalis-infected full-thickness mouse skin wounds at 4 days post-infection. Our analysis underlines the M2-like macrophage-endothelial cell interactions as targets of altered cell-cell signaling during bacteria-infected wound healing.
Volatiles emitted by herbivore-attacked plants ( senders ) can enhance defenses in neighboring plants ( receivers ). However, the temporal dynamics of this phenomenon remain poorly studied. Using a custom-built, high-throughput proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( PTR-ToF-MS ) system, we explored temporal patterns of volatile transfer and responses between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. We found that continuous exposure to natural blends of herbivore-induced volatiles results in clocked temporal response patterns in neighboring plants, characterized by an induced terpene burst at the onset of the second day of exposure. This delayed burst is not explained by terpene accumulation during the night, but coincides with delayed jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The delayed burst occurs independent of day:night light transitions and cannot be fully explained by sender volatile dynamics. Instead, it is the result of a stress memory from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary exposure to bioactive volatiles on the second day. Our study reveals that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress-induced volatiles results in a response that integrates priming and direct induction into a distinct and predictable temporal response pattern. This provides an answer to the long-standing question of whether stress volatiles predominantly induce or prime plant defenses in neighboring plants, by revealing that they can do both in sequence.
Recursion is a fundamental property of human language and music, where a signal can be placed inside another of a similar kind. However, there are no known examples of self-embedded vocal patterns in nonhuman primates. Here, we report that wild flanged male orangutan long calls feature rhythmically isochronous call sequences nested within isochronous call sequences, consistent with two hierarchical strata. This is the first example of temporally recursive hominid vocal combinatorics in the absence of syntax, semantics, phonology, or music. Our findings suggest that recursive vocal combinatorics may have preluded the evolution of recursion in modern language-able humans. We propose that recursive vocal combinatorics were first and foremost a feature of proto-musical expression in human ancestors, later recruited and ‘re-engineered’ for the generation of linguistic combinatorics. This idea is supported by the fact that three temporally and acoustically distinct call rhythms in the lower stratum were not related to the overarching rhythm at the higher stratum by any low multiples, suggesting that these recursive structures were neither the result of parallel non-hierarchical procedures nor anatomical artifacts of bodily constraints or resonances. Our findings open a new charter for possible incipient and transitional states of recursion among hominids and suggest that future studies probing for recursive call sequence patterns in other orangutan vocal contexts and other great ape vocal behaviors could help test this idea.
The arms race between viruses and hosts has led to numerous evolutionary innovations that shape life's evolution. Viral receptors are cell surface proteins exploited by viruses to initiate infection, and the interactions between viral receptors and viruses have garnered significant interest. Our study sheds light on the arms race between the MDA5 receptor and 5’ppp-RNA virus in a lower vertebrate fish, Miichthys miiuy. The frequent and independent loss events of RIG-I in vertebrates prompted us to search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation response ( HDGCR ) being the main pathway. Our further analysis suggested that MDA5 of M. miiuy and Gallus gallus, the homolog of RIG-I, can replace RIG-I in recognizing 5’ppp-RNA virus, which may lead to redundancy of RIG-I and loss from the species genome during evolution. As an adversarial strategy, 5’ppp-RNA SCRV can utilize the m6A methylation mechanism to degrade MDA5 and weaken its antiviral immune ability, thus promoting its own replication and immune evasion. In summary, our study provides a snapshot into the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering valuable perspectives on the ecological and evolutionary factors that contribute to the diversity of the immune system. In this study, we selected teleost fish miiuy croaker ( Miichthys miiuy ) and bird chicken ( Gallus gallus ), two vertebrates lacking RIG-I, as well as two 5'ppp-RNA viruses ( SCRV and VSV ), to investigate the evolutionary strategies and interactions between 5’ppp-RNA virus and host. The final results demonstrated that the MDA5 of M. miiuy and G. gallus lacking RIG-I both evolved the ability to recognize 5’ppp-RNA. Furthermore, SCRV virus, the virus model used in this study, mainly affects the Siniperca chuatsi, which is a fish species that also lacks RIG-I like M. miiuy.
Prostate cancer ( PC ) patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) experience changes in body composition, including fat body mass ( FBM ), lean body mass ( LBM ), and bone mineral density ( BMD ). Follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) has been implicated in body composition and bone metabolism. This study aimed to correlate FSH serum levels with body composition parameters, BMD, and bone turnover markers at baseline and after 12 months of ADT in 29 consecutive non-metastatic PC patients. All patients underwent administration of the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone antagonist degarelix. FBM, LBM, and BMD were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at baseline and after 12 months of ADT. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. At baseline, a weak, non-significant direct relationship was found between FSH serum levels and FBM at arms and legs. However, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FBM, fat mass at arms, and fat mass at trunk after 12 months. An inverse relationship between serum FSH and appendicular lean mass index/FBM ratio was also observed. These findings suggest that FSH serum levels after ADT could have an impact on body composition, in particular on FBM. Therefore, FSH could be a promising marker to monitor the risk of sarcopenic obesity and to guide clinicians in the tailored evaluation of body composition in PC patients undergoing ADT.
Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) from ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation ( VT/VF ) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolemmal ion channels, none have proven sufficiently effective for preventing SCD. Sarcoplasmic ryanodine receptor 2 ( RyR2 ) Ca2+ release channels, the downstream effectors of sarcolemmal ion channels, are underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) -mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of RyR2s in the pathophysiology of SCD. We tested the hypothesis that RyR2 inhibition of failing arrhythmogenic hearts reduces sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak and repolarization lability, mitigates VT/VF/SCD and improves contractile function. We used a guinea pig model that replicates key clinical aspects of human nonischemic HF, such as a prolonged QT interval, a high prevalence of spontaneous arrhythmic SCD, and profound Ca2+ leak via a hyperactive RyR2. HF animals were randomized to receive dantrolene ( DS ) or placebo in early or chronic HF. We assessed the incidence of VT/VF and SCD ( primary outcome ), ECG heart rate and QT variability, echocardiographic left ventricular ( LV ) structure and function, immunohistochemical LV fibrosis, and sarcoplasmic RyR2 oxidation. DS treatment prevented VT/VF and SCD by decreasing dispersion of repolarization and ventricular arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered resting heart rate, preserved chronotropic competency during transient β-adrenergic challenge, and improved heart rate variability and cardiac function. Inhibition of RyR2 hyperactivity with dantrolene mitigates the vicious cycle of sarcoplasmic Ca2+ leak-induced increases in diastolic Ca2+ and ROS-mediated RyR2 oxidation, thereby reducing repolarization lability and protecting against VT/VF/SCD. Moreover, the consequent increase in sarcoplasmic Ca2+ load improves contractile function. These potentially life-saving effects of RyR2 inhibition warrant further investigation, such as clinical studies of repurposing dantrolene as a potential new therapy for heart failure and/or SCD.
Smads are transcription factors that mediate the transcriptional responses of target cells to secreted ligands of the transforming growth factor-β ( TGF-β ) family, including those of the conserved bone morphogenetic protein ( BMP ) family. In C. elegans, the BMP2/4 ortholog DBL-1 regulates multiple biological functions, including body size, via a canonical receptor-Smad signaling cascade. Here, we identify functional binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcriptional partner SMA-9/Schnurri based on ChIP-seq peaks and expression differences of nearby genes identified from RNA-seq analysis of corresponding mutants. We found that SMA-3 and SMA-9 have both overlapping and unique target genes. At a genome-wide scale, SMA-3/Smad acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas SMA-9/Schnurri direct targets include both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in sma-9 partially suppress the small body size phenotype of sma-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors and challenging the prevailing model for Schnurri function. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) secretory pathway, including the disulfide reductase dpy-11. Our findings indicate that Smads and SMA-9/Schnurri have previously unappreciated complex genetic and genomic regulatory interactions that in turn regulate the secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body size regulation.
DUX4 is an embryonic transcription factor that has recently been characterized as a suppressor of interferon-γ signaling and antigen presentation in a small subset of primary tumors. Here, we report that DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastatic tumors, with ~10–50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers expressing DUX4. In a large cohort of urothelial carcinoma patients, DUX4 expression is significantly associated with immune cell exclusion and decreased objective response to PD-L1 blockade. Furthermore, DUX4 expression is a significant predictor of survival even after accounting for tumor mutational burden and other molecular and clinical features in this cohort, with DUX4 expression associated with a median reduction in survival of over 1 year. Our data motivate future attempts to develop DUX4 as a biomarker and therapeutic target for checkpoint immunotherapy resistance. We verified that DUX4 expression in the advanced urothelial carcinoma tumors was associated with an immune exclusion phenotype: a higher proportion of DUX4+ tumors exhibit either an immune-excluded or immune-desert phenotype compared to malignancies where DUX4 is silent. We similarly examined the correlation of DUX4 expression status with PD-L1 levels in the tumor and immune compartments quantified via IHC. DUX4 expression is a common feature of metastasis and may be an important driver of immune evasion. While the mechanism governing DUX4 de-repression in cancer remains to be elucidated, we show that DUX4 expression in the metastatic context is associated with reduced anti-tumor immunity, mirroring previous observations in primary cancers and cancer cell line models. These analyses suggest that DUX4 expression in the metastatic context induces an immunosuppressive gene expression program, concordant with its established function in inhibiting JAK–STAT signaling in primary cancers. We hypothesized that DUX4 expression in these cancers will generate related transcriptomic signals consistent with CD8+ T cell exclusion from the tumor. Urothelial cancers exhibited one of the highest frequencies of DUX4 expression ( 54% of patients ) in any of the five metastatic cancer cohorts that we analyzed, suggesting that DUX4 could be particularly important in that tumor type. These data demonstrate that the high rates of DUX4 expression that we observed across metastatic cancer cohorts reflect true DUX4 expression rather than technical biases introduced by studying formalin-fixed tissues and are consistent with expression of a polyadenylated DUX4 transcript in both primary and metastatic cancers.
Livestock abortion is an important disease syndrome affecting livestock productivity and public health in Africa. However, there is a lack of data on the aetiology of livestock diseases, which constrains effective interventions to improve livelihoods, food security, and public health. In Tanzania, we established a surveillance platform to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in pastoral, agropastoral, and smallholder systems. Between 2017 and 2019, we investigated 215 abortion events in cattle, sheep, and goats, of which 19. 5% were attributed to a specific cause. We found that delays in obtaining samples significantly affected attribution, and histopathology proved less useful than PCR due to rapid deterioration of samples. Vaginal swabs provided practical and sensitive material for pathogen detection. Our study demonstrated the feasibility of establishing a surveillance system through engagement of community-based field officers, establishment of practical sample collection, and application of molecular diagnostic platforms. Livestock abortion surveillance, even at a small scale, can generate valuable information on causes of disease outbreaks, reproductive losses, and can identify pathogens not easily captured through other forms of livestock disease surveillance. Our study showed that an effective reporting and investigation system can be operationalized across a range of settings in Tanzania, including remote rural areas. We discuss our findings in relation to the feasibility, practicality, and value of establishing a livestock abortion surveillance framework to support evidence-based interventions to improve livestock development, livelihoods, and human health in Africa.
Cigarette smoking is a well-established risk factor for the development and progression of various diseases. Nicotine ( NIC ), the major constituent of cigarette smoke, has been shown to increase the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells ( ISCs ) in vivo and ex vivo. This effect is mediated by the activation of the α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) and protein kinase C ( PKC ), leading to the induction of Yes-associated protein ( YAP ) /Transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif ( TAZ ) and Notch signaling in ISCs. Notably, this effect was not detected in Paneth cells. The inhibition of Notch signaling by dibenzazepine ( DBZ ) nullified the effects of NIC on ISCs, suggesting that Notch signaling plays a crucial role in NIC-induced ISC proliferation. Moreover, NIC enhanced in vivo tumor formation from ISCs after loss of the tumor suppressor gene Apc, and DBZ inhibited NIC-induced tumor growth. These findings suggest that NIC triggers a pathway regulating the stemness and tumorigenicity of ISCs, and that DBZ may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treating intestinal tumors.
The Hsp70 chaperone system plays a crucial role in counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, which are associated with stress, ageing, and disease. Hsp70 solubilises aggregates and aids protein refolding through substrate binding and release cycles regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins ( JDPs ) and nucleotide exchange factors ( NEFs ). Here, we elucidate the collaborative impact of Hsp110 NEFs and different JDP classes throughout Hsp70-dependent aggregate processing. We show that Hsp110 plays a major role at initial stages of disaggregation, determining its final efficacy. The NEF catalyses the recruitment of thick Hsp70 assemblies onto the aggregate surface, which modifies aggregates into smaller species more readily processed by chaperones. Hsp70 stimulation by Hsp110 is much stronger with class B than class A JDPs and requires the auxiliary interaction between class B JDP and the Hsp70 EEVD motif. Furthermore, we demonstrate for the first time that Hsp110 disrupts the JDP-Hsp70 interaction. Such destabilisation of chaperone complexes at the aggregate surface might improve disaggregation, but also lead to the inhibition above the sub-stoichiometric Hsp110 optimum. Thus, balanced interplay between the co-chaperones and Hsp70 is critical to unlock its disaggregating potential.
Knee arthropathy is a musculoskeletal condition that impairs gait. Gait analysis is used in clinical practice to inform diagnosis and monitor disease progression or intervention response. However, clinical gait analysis relies on subjective visual observation of walking as objective gait analysis has not been possible within clinical settings due to the expensive equipment, large-scale facilities, and highly trained staff required. In this work, we demonstrate how a digital insole measuring osteoarthritis-specific gait signatures yields similar results to the clinical gait-lab standard. To achieve this, we constructed a machine learning model, trained on force plate data collected in participants with knee arthropathy and controls. This model was highly predictive of force plate data from a validation set ( area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [auROC] = 0. 86; area under the precision-recall curve [auPR] = 0. 90 ) and of a separate, independent digital insole dataset containing control and knee osteoarthritis subjects ( auROC = 0. 83; auPR = 0. 86 ). After showing that digital insole-derived gait characteristics are comparable to traditional gait measurements, we next showed that a single stride of raw sensor time-series data could be accurately assigned to each subject, highlighting that individuals using digital insoles can be identified by their gait characteristics. This work provides a framework for a promising alternative to traditional clinical gait analysis methods, adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding wearable technology analytical pipelines, and supports clinical development of at-home gait assessments, with the potential to improve the ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring.
Human amniotic membrane ( AM ) products, such as Clarix Flo ( FLO ), have been investigated as a potential non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. FLO has been shown to attenuate established post-surgical pain hypersensitivity in mice by inhibiting nociceptive dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) neurons via CD44-dependent pathways. We further purified the major matrix component, the heavy chain-hyaluronic acid/pentraxin 3 ( HC-HA/PTX3 ) from human AM, which has greater purity and water solubility than FLO. HC-HA/PTX3 replicated FLO-induced neuronal and pain inhibition. Mechanistically, HC-HA/PTX3-induced cytoskeleton rearrangements to inhibit sodium current and high-voltage activated calcium current on nociceptive DRG neurons, suggesting it is a key bioactive component mediating pain relief. Our findings highlight the potential of naturally derived biologics from human birth tissues as an effective non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain. Moreover, we unravel the underlying neuronal mechanisms of pain inhibition induced by FLO and HC-HA/PTX3. Our study suggests that human birth tissue products may be deployed as a viable biologic to treat post-surgical pain. We further identified HC-HA/PTX3 as the primary bioactive component responsible for pain inhibition. It induced an acute cytoskeleton rearrangement and inhibition of INav and HVA-Ica currents in a CD44-dependent manner, making it a promising non-opioid treatment for post-surgical pain.
Retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) cells show a range of pigmentation levels when cultured in vitro. To investigate whether the color of RPE cells is correlated with their function, we analyzed the color intensities of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE cells ( iPSC-RPE ) together with their gene expression profiles at the single-cell level. We utilized the Automated Live imaging and cell Picking System ( ALPS ) to photograph each cell before RNA-sequencing analysis to profile the gene expression of each cell. Our results showed that the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells did not project any specific gene expression profiles, suggesting that the color of RPE cells may not be a strong indicator of their functional characteristics. We reasoned this by analyzing the correlation between the color and the expression level of each gene, and found that the degree of pigmentation is dynamically regulated in each cell, with a time-lag between mRNA expression, production of enzymes, and synthesis of melanin. Furthermore, we found that the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells did not correlate with the expression levels of RPE markers. We then sought to identify the biological aspects that underlie the degree of pigmentation of iPSC-RPE cells, and found that gene sets related to retinoid recycling, an important feature of the RPE to supply the photoreceptor with retinal, showed weak correlation with the color intensity of iPSC-RPE cells.
In recent years, the field of neuroscience has increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in naturalistic environments to gain deeper insights into ethologically relevant behavioral processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ) has emerged as a pivotal model toward this effort due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans. However, traditional research methodologies often fail to fully capture the nuances of marmoset social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this critical gap, we developed the Marmoset Apparatus for Automated Pulling ( MarmoAAP ), a novel behavioral apparatus designed for studying cooperative behaviors in common marmosets. MarmoAAP addresses the limitations of traditional behavioral research methods by enabling high-throughput, detailed behavior outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more nuanced and comprehensive analyses even in a naturalistic setting. MarmoAAP is a versatile and robust tool for advancing our understanding of primate behavior and related cognitive processes. This new apparatus bridges the gap between ethologically relevant animal behavior studies and neural investigations, paving the way for future research in cognitive and social neuroscience using marmosets as a model organism.
Alcohol consumption during pregnancy has been shown to affect genome regulation in the developing offspring, but results have been contradictory. We employed a physiologically relevant murine model of short-term moderate prenatal alcohol exposure ( PAE ) to investigate the effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation in newborn pups. We found that early moderate PAE was sufficient to affect site-specific DNA methylation in newborn pups without altering behavioural outcomes in adult littermates. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing of neonatal brain and liver revealed stochastic influence on DNA methylation that was mostly tissue-specific, with some perturbations likely originating as early as gastrulation. DNA methylation differences were enriched in non-coding genomic regions with regulatory potential indicative of broad effects of alcohol on genome regulation. Replication studies in human cohorts with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder ( FASD ) suggested that some effects were metastable at genes linked to disease-relevant traits including facial morphology, intelligence, educational attainment, autism, and schizophrenia. In our murine model, a maternal diet high in folate and choline protected against some of the damaging effects of early moderate PAE on DNA methylation. Our studies demonstrate that early moderate exposure is sufficient to affect fetal genome regulation even in the absence of overt phenotypic changes and highlight a role for preventative maternal dietary interventions. We identified regions sensitive to gestational alcohol exposure that were replicated in human cohorts. The study was a controlled intervention investigating the impact of early moderate PAE on offspring DNA methylation comparing exposed and unexposed mice, with an additional arm comparing the effect of alcohol exposure in the context of an HMD maternal diet. We employed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing for unbiased assessment of CpG DNA methylation in newborn brain and liver to explore tissue specificity of effects and to determine any ‘tissue agnostic’ effects which may have arisen prior to the germ layers separating in early gastrulation. We also conducted candidate gene testing of regions identified in prior studies as sensitive to early moderate PAE. The exposure period covers the equivalent of pre-conception up until the first trimester in humans when neurulation occurs, reflecting a typical situation in which women may consume alcohol up until pregnancy recognition. The primary outcome of the study was differences in offspring DNA methylation and secondary outcomes of behavioural deficits across neurodevelopmental domains relevant to FASD were also examined. In this validation study, DNA methylation array data from 147 newborn buccal swabs from the Asking Questions About Alcohol in Pregnancy ( AQUA ) cohort were available from this cohort ( 96 moderate PAE and 51 controls ). We performed differential testing on a total of 1898 CpG sites that corresponded to mouse DMRs, comparing ‘never exposed’ newborns to ‘any exposure’ and found no evidence of differential DNA methylation at these CpG. In our model, alcohol effects on DNA methylation were predominantly tissue-specific, with only two genomic regions and four genes that were similarly affected in both liver and brain. These perturbations may have been established stochastically because of PAE to the early embryo and maintained in the differentiating tissue. Further analysis in different germ layer tissues is required to formally establish this.
In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, RNA interference ( RNAi ) is an effective method for silencing a wide variety of genes. However, the silencing of some genes is selectively impaired by the loss of certain regulators of RNAi. Here, we show that such selective requirements can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their RNA metabolism. In this network, the Maelstrom domain-containing protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and the Argonaute protein NRDE-3 work together so that any two are required for silencing one somatic gene, but each is singly required for silencing another somatic gene. The requirement for NRDE-3 but not for MUT-16 or RDE-10 can be bypassed by enhancing the processing of dsRNA, suggesting that loss of NRDE-3 has the least impact on the efficiency of silencing. A dynamic model of RNA changes during silencing by dsRNA reveals several criteria for efficient RNA silencing. The fact that any two of MUT-16, NRDE-3, and RDE-10 – three structurally and functionally different proteins – are required for unc-22 silencing suggests that each of these proteins could be contributing to silencing of any RNAi target. Similar mechanisms could be used to generate other 22G RNAs that are independent of RDE-10. We also show that changing cis-regulatory elements of the target gene can reduce the dependence on NRDE-3, that animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and that cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with UG dinucleotides, which makes them templates for amplifying small RNAs, are enriched within ‘pUG zones’ matching the dsRNA.
Tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) is a severe form of tuberculosis ( TB ) that is associated with high mortality and morbidity, primarily due to the inflammatory response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of TBM pathogenesis and mortality, we analyzed whole-blood RNA sequencing data from 281 Vietnamese adults with TBM, 295 individuals with pulmonary tuberculosis ( PTB ), and 30 healthy controls. We aimed to identify genes and pathways associated with TBM severity and mortality, and to determine the best predictors of death. Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we identified hub genes and pathways linked to TBM severity and mortality, with a consensus analysis revealing distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals. We employed multivariate elastic-net Cox regression to select candidate predictors of death, then logistic regression and internal bootstrap validation to choose the best predictors. We found that increased neutrophil activation and decreased T and B cell activation pathways were associated with TBM mortality. Among HIV-positive individuals, mortality was associated with increased angiogenesis, while HIV-negative individuals exhibited elevated TNF signaling and impaired extracellular matrix organization. We identified four hub genes—MCEMP1, NELL2, ZNF354C, and CD4—that were strong predictors of TBM mortality. These findings indicate that TBM induces a systemic inflammatory response similar to PTB, highlighting critical genes and pathways related to death, and offering insights for potential therapeutic targets. We also identified a four-gene signature as a potential host response biomarker for mortality, regardless of HIV status.
Antibodies are essential reagents for detecting and characterizing proteins in biomedical and clinical research. Despite their importance, many commercial antibodies fail to recognize their intended targets. To assess the scope of this problem, we have developed a standardized characterization approach to evaluate the performance of 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 human proteins related to neuroscience. We used parental and knockout cell lines to assess the performance of these antibodies in three common applications: Western blot ( WB ), immunoprecipitation ( IP ), and immunofluorescence ( IF ). We found that more than 50% of all antibodies failed in one or more applications. However, ~50–75% of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody, depending on the application. This suggests that coverage of human proteins by commercial antibodies is significant. We also found that recombinant antibodies performed better than monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The hundreds of underperforming antibodies identified in this study were found to have been used in a large number of published articles, which should raise alarm. Encouragingly, more than half of the underperforming commercial antibodies were reassessed by the manufacturers, and many had alterations to their recommended usage or were removed from the market. This study demonstrates the scale of the antibody specificity problem but also suggests an efficient strategy toward achieving coverage of the human proteome: mine the existing commercial antibody repertoire and use the data to focus new renewable antibody generation efforts.
Drosophila melanogaster is an important model organism for studying gene expression and inter-organ communication. However, the ability to independently control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal is a major need, especially in the context of inter-organ communication studies. Here, we describe a resource of reagents that facilitate combined use of the GAL4/UAS and a second binary expression system in various Drosophila tissues. We generated a set of more than 40 LexA-GAD and QF2 insertions by CRISPR knock-in and verified their tissue specificity in larvae. We also built constructs that encode QF2 and LexA-GAD transcription factors in a single vector. Following successful integration of this construct into the fly genome, FLP/FRT recombination is used to isolate fly lines that express only QF2 or LexA-GAD. Furthermore, we evaluated both LexA and QF systems for in vivo gene knockdown and are generating a library of such RNAi fly lines as a community resource. Together, these LexA and QF system vectors and fly lines will provide a new set of tools for researchers who need to activate or repress two different genes in an orthogonal manner in the same animal. This resource will greatly expand the ability of Drosophila researchers to modulate gene expression in multiple tissues simultaneously.
Bcl11b is a transcription factor that has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. Bcl11b is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons ( DGN ) and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy fiber-CA3 synapses. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remained unclear. We show that the synaptic organizer molecule C1ql2 is a direct functional target of Bcl11b that regulates synaptic vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that C1ql2 exerts its functions through direct interaction with a specific splice variant of neurexin-3, Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ). Interruption of C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) interaction by expression of a non-binding C1ql2 mutant or by deletion of Nrxn3 in the DGN recapitulates major parts of the Bcl11b as well as C1ql2 mutant phenotype. Together, this study identifies a novel C1ql2-Nrxn3 ( 25b+ ) -dependent signaling pathway through which Bcl11b controls mossy fiber-CA3 synapse function. Thus, our findings contribute to the mechanistic understanding of neurodevelopmental disorders accompanied by synaptic dysfunction.
Sfp1 is a zinc-finger protein known to regulate the transcription of proliferation-related genes. Here, we show that Sfp1 can regulate transcription by binding to both promoters and transcribed regions ( gene bodies ) of the genome. Following promoter binding, Sfp1 binds to gene bodies and affects the configuration of RNA polymerase II ( Pol II ), manifested by dissociation or conformational change of its Rpb4 subunit and increased backtracking. We further show that Sfp1 binds to a subset of mRNAs co-transcriptionally and stabilizes them. The interaction between Sfp1 and its client mRNAs is controlled by their respective promoters and coincides with Sfp1’s dissociation from chromatin. Intriguingly, Sfp1 dissociation from the chromatin correlates with the extent of the backtracked Pol II. We propose that following promoter recruitment, Sfp1 accompanies Pol II and regulates backtracking. The backtracked Pol II is more compatible with Sfp1’s relocation to the nascent transcripts, whereupon Sfp1 accompanies these mRNAs to the cytoplasm and regulates their stability. Thus, Sfp1’s co-transcriptional binding imprints the mRNA fate, serving as a paradigm for the cross-talk between the synthesis and decay of specific mRNAs, and a paradigm for the dual-role of some zinc-finger proteins. The interplay between Sfp1’s two modes of transcription regulation remains to be examined. Sfp1 impacts the mRNA life cycle – from transcription to degradation. Interestingly, the Sfp1 effect on transcription elongation is linked to its function on mRNA stabilization, suggesting that all its functions are connected.
Plant developmentally controlled programmed cell death ( dPCD ) is a fundamental process that plays a crucial role in plant growth and reproduction. In this study, we investigated the connection between dPCD and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thaliana roots, focusing on the root cap-specific transcription factor ANAC033/SOMBRERO ( SMB ) and the senescence-associated nuclease BFN1. We found that mutations of both dPCD regulators increase colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendipita indica, primarily in the differentiation zone. Additionally, smb-3 mutants exhibit hypercolonization around the meristematic zone and a delay of S. indica-induced root-growth promotion. This suggests that root cap dPCD and rapid post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a physical defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Furthermore, we show that BFN1 expression is downregulated during S. indica colonization in mature root epidermal cells, suggesting a transcriptional control mechanism that facilitates the accommodation of beneficial microbes in the roots. We propose that a tight regulation of host dPCD and rapid and complete clearance of root cap cell corpses play important roles in restricting fungal colonization at the root apical meristem. Additionally, we show that S. indica downregulates BFN1 in older and differentiated epidermal cells to promote fungal accommodation. Our results emphasize that beneficial microbes have the ability to modify plant dPCD processes to enhance host colonization.
Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, are characterized by the spreading of pathogenic protein aggregates and the activation of inflammatory responses. One of the mechanisms by which these aggregates spread is through the extrusion of large vesicles, called exophers, from neurons. However, the factors that regulate the extrusion of these vesicles are poorly understood. Here, we document that mechanical force can significantly potentiate the extrusion of exophers from proteostressed neurons in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. We show that the extrusion of exophers from the ALMR neuron peaks at adult day 2 or 3, coinciding with the C. elegans reproductive peak. We also show that genetic disruption of C. elegans germline, sperm, oocytes, or egg/early embryo production can strongly suppress exopher extrusion from the ALMR neurons during the peak period. Conversely, restoring egg production at the late reproductive phase through mating with males or inducing egg retention via genetic interventions that block egg-laying can strongly increase ALMR exopher production. In addition to the impact of fertilized eggs, ALMR exopher production can be enhanced by filling the uterus with oocytes, dead eggs, or even fluid, supporting that distention consequences, rather than the presence of fertilized eggs, constitute the exopher-inducing stimulus. We conclude that the mechanical force of uterine occupation potentiates exopher extrusion from proximal proteostressed maternal neurons. Our observations draw attention to the potential importance of mechanical signaling in extracellular vesicle production and in aggregate spreading mechanisms, making a case for enhanced attention to mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.
Alzheimer’s disease ( AD ) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and the loss of synapses in the brain. The Wnt signaling pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD, and the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-3 ( DKK3 ) has been shown to colocalize to amyloid plaques in AD patients. Here, we investigate the role of DKK3 in the integrity and function of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in healthy and AD brains. Our findings show that DKK3 expression is upregulated in the brains of AD subjects and that DKK3 protein levels increase at early stages in the disease. In the hAPP-J20 and hAPPNL-G-F/NL-G-F mouse models of AD, extracellular DKK3 levels are increased and DKK3 accumulates at dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques. Our functional studies demonstrate that DKK3 triggers the loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of the Wnt/GSK3β signaling pathway with a concomitant increase in inhibitory synapses via activation of the Wnt/JNK pathway. In contrast, DKK3 knockdown restores synapse number and memory in hAPP-J20 mice. Our results show that DKK3 regulates the stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the adult hippocampus through different signaling pathways. In vivo DKK3 loss-of-function ameliorates synaptic defects in J20 mice, supporting the hypothesis that DKK3 is a key contributor to synaptic changes in this AD mouse model.
The rise of antibiotic resistance necessitates the discovery of new drugs against bacterial pathogens. Here, we show that pyoverdines, siderophores produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp., have strong antibacterial properties by inducing iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens. We screened 320 natural Pseudomonas isolates against 12 human pathogens and found several pyoverdines with particularly high antibacterial properties and distinct chemical characteristics. The most potent pyoverdine effectively reduced growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus in a concentration- and iron-dependent manner. Furthermore, pyoverdine increased survival of infected Galleria mellonella host larvae and showed low toxicity for the host, mammalian cell lines, and erythrocytes. Experimental evolution of pathogens combined with whole-genome sequencing revealed limited resistance evolution compared to an antibiotic. Thus, pyoverdines from environmental strains have the potential to become a new class of sustainable antibacterials against specific human pathogens. We investigated whether pyoverdines produced by environmental Pseudomonas spp. have antibacterial activities against human opportunistic pathogens through iron sequestration and withholding this trace element from pathogens. Our screen involving 320 environmental isolates and 12 pathogen strains revealed five top pyoverdine candidates with broad-spectrum activity. We propose that pyoverdines from non-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp. could be potent agents to reduce the growth of opportunistic human pathogens by intensifying iron competition. To test our hypothesis, we screened pyoverdines from a library of 320 environmental Pseudomonas strains, isolated from soil and freshwater habitats, for their activity against 12 strains of human opportunistic bacteria. For the most promising pyoverdine candidates, we elucidated the chemical structure to assess diversity and understand the chemical properties important for iron competition.
Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder characterized by a failure of prefrontal networks in the brain. However, the link between disruptions at the synaptic level and failures at the network level is not fully understood. To address this question, we developed a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal local circuits that can explain the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits we recently observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. We analyzed how the balance between AMPA and NMDA components of recurrent excitation and GABA inhibition in the network influence oscillatory spike synchrony to inform the biological data. We show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting from a steady to oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs such as might occur during behavior. These findings strongly parallel dynamic modulation of 0-lag spike synchrony we observed between neurons in monkey prefrontal cortex during behavior, as well as the suppression of this 0-lag spiking by administration of NMDAR antagonists. As such, our cortical network model provides a plausible mechanism explaining the link between NMDAR synaptic and 0-lag spike synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefrontal network failure in schizophrenia. We provide evidence that spiking networks situated close to a boundary in the synaptic parameter space separating asynchronous and synchronous activity states can explain a variety of biological observations. We show that reducing recurrent NMDAR synaptic currents prevents these networks from transitioning into oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs, thereby preventing the emergence of 0-lag spike synchrony.
Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, is a morphogenic process that occurs in hypoxic micro-environments. The initial steps of angiogenesis depend on the robust differentiation of oligopotent endothelial cells into Tip and Stalk phenotypic cell fates, which are controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell–cell communication. However, the dynamics of spatial patterning of this cell fate specification are only partially understood. Here, we find that the regular spatial Tip–Stalk cell patterning can undergo an order–disorder transition at a relatively high input level of a pro-angiogenic factor VEGF. The resulting differentiation is robust but temporally unstable for most cells, with only a subset of presumptive Tip cells leading sprout extensions. We further find that sprouts form in a manner maximizing their mutual distance, consistent with a Turing-like model that may depend on local enrichment and depletion of fibronectin. Our data suggest that NOTCH signaling mediates a robust way of cell differentiation enabling but not instructing subsequent steps in angiogenic morphogenesis, which may require additional cues and self-organization mechanisms. We propose a dynamic view of angiogenic induction, where the VEGF input can induce NOTCH signaling and formation of Tip cells that can behave as mini-sprouts. The inputs specifying the cell fate can be potentially contradictory, for example, with pro-angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, promoting the Tip cell fate, and the NOTCH signaling activated by the neighboring cells promoting the Stalk cell fate and thus suppressing the Tip cell identity in the same cell. These and other signaling inputs can thus be incoherent in terms of cell fate specification and can result in complex dynamic outcomes that are still poorly understood.
Locus coeruleus ( LC ) projections to the hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory, but the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are currently unknown. The LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, but recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions. Here, we extend these data by characterizing the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice. We find that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation. We also demonstrate that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Finally, we show that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation, while norepinephrine is not. Our data suggest that LC projections to the hippocampus are activated by salient learning-related events and that this LC activation can enhance long-term memory formation. We provide direct evidence that LC activity increases both dopamine and norepinephrine content in the hippocampus and show that dopamine release is important for trace fear memory formation, but the release of norepinephrine is not.
