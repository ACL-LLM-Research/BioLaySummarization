In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, GLP-1/Notch signaling is known to maintain a pool of undifferentiated stem cells/progenitors in the germline. However, we report an unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch signaling in promoting cell fate reprograming of germ cells into somatic cells. To understand this phenomenon, we identified genes activated upon increased GLP-1/Notch signaling in the C. elegans germline. We found that GLP-1/Notch signaling promotes reprograming by activating specific genes that are silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ). We propose that GLP-1/Notch signaling antagonizes PRC2-mediated silencing to promote reprograming of germ cells into somatic cells. We identified the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming. We show that GLP-1/Notch and PRC2 have an antagonistic effect on germ cell-fate decisions and demonstrate co-regulation of their common target, utx-1. These findings have wide implications, ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.

Klebsiella pneumoniae ( K. pneumoniae ) is a pathogenic bacterium that causes respiratory, blood, liver, and bladder infections. In this study, we investigated the role of the adaptor protein SKAP2 in host defense against K. pneumoniae infection. We show that SKAP2 is required for protection against K. pneumoniae ( ATCC 43816 ) pulmonary infections. SKAP2-deficient ( Skap2-/- ) mice had a 100-fold higher bacterial burden compared to wild-type mice, which was controlled by SKAP2 expression in innate immune cells. SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for K. pneumoniae-activated reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection. We also show that Skap2-/- neutrophils and monocytes were present in infected lungs, and the neutrophils degranulated normally in response to K. pneumoniae infection in mice. However, K. pneumoniae-stimulated ROS production in vitro was abolished in Skap2-/- neutrophils. K. pneumoniae-induced ROS response required the activity of Src family kinases ( SFKs ), Syk, Btk, PLCγ2, and PKC. The loss of SKAP2 significantly hindered the K. pneumoniae-induced phosphorylation of SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2, implicating SKAP2 as proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways. In conclusion, SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for K. pneumoniae-activated ROS production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection.
Relapse infections in Plasmodium vivax malaria are caused by the activation of latent liver-stage parasites, known as hypnozoites, weeks to months after the initial infection. The hypnozoite reservoir in the human liver constitutes a third malaria parasite reservoir, in addition to the reservoirs in the blood circulation and mosquito. Relapses can be incorporated into Ross-Macdonald models of malaria transmission through the addition of a state to represent the hypnozoite reservoir. In the absence of effective diagnostics for detecting liver-stage parasites, models will play a crucial role in estimating and predicting the effectiveness of interventions that target the hypnozoite reservoir, either indirectly via vector control and blood-stage anti-malarials or directly via primaquine treatment. Most existing models of malaria transmission do not account for the additional reservoir of parasites in the liver, but the hypnozoite reservoir has been incorporated into some P. vivax transmission models as a state to denote hypnozoite infection or as up to two broods of hypnozoites. Mathematical models of malaria transmission that account for P. vivax relapses can provide valuable insights into the impact of malaria control interventions on the parasite's reservoirs in the vector, the blood and the liver. In this study, a within-host model of hypnozoites in liver hepatocytes is developed to demonstrate that many of the epidemiological patterns of relapse infections can be explained by making the assumption that hypnozoites activate and die at a constant rate. This model is integrated into the existing theory of Ross-Macdonald models to account for the relapse infections characteristic of P. vivax malaria. The model predicts that the hypnozoite reservoir is over-dispersed with many individuals having few or no hypnozoites, and some having intensely infected livers. Individuals with more hypnozoites are predicted to experience more relapses and contribute more to onwards P. vivax transmission. Incorporating hypnozoite killing drugs such as primaquine into first-line treatment regimens is predicted to cause substantial reductions in P. vivax transmission as individuals with the most hypnozoites are more likely to relapse and be targeted for treatment.
Selective logging in Amazonian forests results in the emission of more than 90 Tg of carbon ( C ) to the atmosphere each year, which is then counterbalanced by forest regrowth. To better understand the dynamics of carbon recovery following selective logging, we developed an original modelling approach that links regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass with survivors’ and recruits’ C fluxes. We used a network of 133 permanent forest plots ( 175 ha total ) across Amazonia to provide Amazon-wide predictions of post-logging C recovery. Our results show that net aboveground C recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and in the west ( 21 ±3 Mg C ha-1 ) than in the south ( 12 ±3 Mg C ha-1 ), where environmental stress is high ( low rainfall, high seasonality ). We highlight the key role of survivors in the forest regrowth and elaborate a comprehensive map of post-disturbance C recovery potential in Amazonia. We partitioned the contributions to post-disturbance aboveground carbon stock ( ACS ) gain ( from growth and recruitment of trees ≥20 cm DBH ) and ACS loss ( from mortality ) of survivors and recruited trees to detect the main drivers and patterns of ACS recovery in forests disturbed by selective logging across Amazonia. Our study includes data from thirteen long-term ( 8–30 year ) experimental forest sites located in the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield, which meet the following criteria: ( i ) located in tropical forests with mean annual precipitation above 1000 mm; ( ii ) a total censused area above 1 ha; ( iii ) at least one pre-logging census and ( iv ) at least two post-logging censuses. We up-scaled our results to Amazonia ( sensu lato ) and elaborated predictive maps of potential ACS changes over 10 years under the hypothesis of a 40% ACS loss, which is a common disturbance intensity after conventional logging in Amazonia.
Neural stem cells ( NSCs ) and neurosphere-initiating cells ( NICs ) in the adult mouse forebrain have been studied extensively, but the relationship between these two types of cells remains unclear. In this study, we prospectively identified and isolated NICs from the adult mouse lateral ventricle subventricular zone ( SVZ ) by flow cytometry. We found that these cells, which we refer to as GEPCOT cells, are highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo. They are characterized by the expression of GlastmidEGFRhighPlexinB2highCD24−/lowO4/PSA-NCAM−/lowTer119/CD45−. In contrast, pre-GEPCOT cells are quiescent, express higher levels of Glast, and lower levels of EGFR and PlexinB2. These cells are unable to form neurospheres but express stem cell markers such as Slc1a3-CreERT, GFAP-CreERT2, Sox2CreERT2, and Gli1CreERT2, and are long-lived in vivo. We found that pre-GEPCOT cells are more dependent on the Bmi-1 polycomb protein for Cdkn2a ( p16Ink4a ) repression than GEPCOT cells. Conditional deletion of Bmi-1 depleted both pre-GEPCOT and GEPCOT cells, but pre-GEPCOT cells were more dependent on Bmi-1 for their survival. Our data distinguish quiescent NSCs from NICs and make it possible to study their properties in vivo.
Piezo1 is a mechanically activated ion channel that is involved in sensing forces in various cell types and tissues. Piezo1 has a bowl-shaped structure that is capable of inducing membrane curvature, suggesting that it may interact functionally with other Piezo1 channels. Here, we use cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp stimulation to functionally examine large numbers of membrane patches from cells expressing Piezo1 endogenously at low levels and cells overexpressing Piezo1 at high levels. Our data, together with stochastic simulations of Piezo1 spatial distributions, show that Piezo1 density has no effect on its pressure sensitivity or open probability in the nominal absence of membrane tension. This suggests that Piezo channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently behave as independent mechanotransducers. We propose that this property is essential for cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire cell membrane. Collectively, our electrophysiological data, together with stochastic simulations show that Piezo1 ion channels, at densities likely to be physiologically relevant, inherently function as independent mechanotransducers. We propose that this property enables cells to transduce forces with high spatial homogeneity across the entire cell membrane. This result is important, because it shows that Piezo1 channels have no strong intrinsic tendency to spatially concentrate and functionally modulate each other’s mechanical sensitivity. Cells are constantly exposed to mechanical forces and have evolved diverse molecular mechanisms that enable force detection. The rapid sensing of mechanical forces that occurs in milliseconds is achieved by force-gated ion channels that convert mechanical energy into electrochemical signals. For example, Piezo1 is a mechanically gated cation channel that directly senses membrane tension with high sensitivity. Here, we set out to quantify the spatial distribution and potential functional interactions of Piezo1 ion channels across multiple orders of channel densities. We use electrophysiology and large numbers of independent measurements to simultaneously quantify channel number and function, including single-channel current, open probability, and pressure sensitivity.
Decision making is thought to arise from the accumulation of noisy evidence to a threshold or bound. In the context of perception, the strength of a stimulus, characterized by the signal-to-noise ratio, influences decision speed, accuracy, and confidence. Here, we introduce a novel sensory manipulation that mimics the addition of unbiased noise to motion-selective regions of the visual cortex, which we verified with neuronal recordings from macaque areas MT/MST. In both humans and monkeys, increasing the noise induced faster decisions and greater confidence over a range of stimuli for which accuracy was minimally impaired. The magnitude of the effects was in agreement with predictions of a bounded evidence accumulation model. We have shown that a stimulus manipulation that increases the variance of the momentary evidence bearing on a decision—what we term volatility—increases both the speed of the decision and the confidence associated with it. Testing the influence of volatility on the decision process is difficult, because it requires independent control over the signal and the noise in the evidence. We mimicked a manipulation of noise by changing the statistical properties of a dynamic stimulus. We verified that the manipulation has the desired properties by recording from direction selective neurons in the middle temporal ( MT ) and medial superior temporal ( MST ) areas of the macaque visual cortex. Neurons in these areas are known to represent the momentary evidence in tasks identical to those in our study. We studied the relationship between volatility and decision speed with a reaction-time version of the random-dot motion discrimination task. Three human participants completed 6631 trials, and one macaque completed 14, 137 trials. We then used the volatility manipulation to test the influence of noise on the three observables of choice behavior—accuracy, RT and confidence—in monkeys and humans.
In Caenorhabditis elegans, the insulin-like signaling pathway regulates lifespan by phosphorylating and inactivating DAF-16, the ortholog of mammalian FOXO transcription factors. DAF-16 is phosphorylated by AKT kinases, preventing its nuclear translocation. Calcineurin ( PP2B phosphatase ) also limits lifespan, but its mechanism of action was unknown. Here, we show that TAX-6•CNB-1, the C. elegans Calcineurin ortholog, and UNC-43, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II ( CAMKII ) ortholog, regulate lifespan through DAF-16. Moreover, UNC-43 regulates DAF-16 in response to various stress conditions, including starvation, heat or oxidative stress, and cooperatively contributes to lifespan regulation by insulin signaling. However, unlike insulin signaling, UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, promoting its nuclear localization. The phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6•CNB-1, leading to DAF-16 inactivation. Mammalian FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMKIIA and Calcineurin. We show that DAF-16 is phosphorylated and activated by UNC-43 at the serine 286 ( S286 ) site. The phosphoryl group is removed by TAX-6•CNB-1. UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 therefore regulate C. elegans lifespan through the reversible phosphorylation of DAF-16. Our data suggest that CAMKII ( UNC-43 ) and Calcineurin ( TAX-6•CNB-1 ), by phosphorylating or de-phosphorylating serine 286 of DAF-16, extend or shorten the lifespan of C. elegans. The direct, antagonistic nature of these two enzymes also raised an interesting possibility that, with their opposing effects on DAF-16 and a common activating signal ( Ca2+/CAM ), UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 would constitutively negate each other and have essentially no control of DAF-16. In both cases, the nuclear accumulation induced by unc-43 ( gf ) or tax-6 ( lf ) was greatly diminished by daf-18 RNAi. Therefore, under conditions in which there is a conflict between IIS and CAMKII/Calcineurin signaling toward DAF-16, the insulin signaling pathway appears to dominate.
Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly, has been used as a model organism to study the neural control of motor behavior. In this study, we investigated the organizational principles governing the sequential grooming behavior of Drosophila. Grooming is an innate behavior that involves the serial execution of different movements to clean individual body parts. We used genetically targeted activation of neural subsets to drive distinct motor programs that clean individual body parts. This allowed us to demonstrate that the motor programs are organized into a suppression hierarchy, where motor programs that occur first suppress those that occur later. We found that cleaning one body part reduces the sensory drive to its motor program, which in turn relieves suppression of the next movement, allowing the grooming sequence to progress down the hierarchy. We also developed an empirically derived computational model that demonstrates how a suppression hierarchy can mediate the sequential selection of the cleaning motor programs. Our results provide the first example of an innate motor sequence implemented by the prevailing model for generating human action sequences. We anticipate that identifying the neural circuitry for each cleaning module and determining how these circuitries interact will reveal how the serial organization of grooming behavior is encoded in the nervous system through a hierarchical suppression mechanism. Our findings suggest that the evolutionarily ancient ability to select among competing behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided the necessary infrastructure to perform motor actions in sequence.
Sgol2 is a protein that plays a crucial role in the coordination of essential cell cycle processes during meiosis I in mammalian oocytes. We show that Sgol2 protects centromeric cohesin, silences the spindle assembly checkpoint ( SAC ), promotes the congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis I spindles, facilitates the formation of kinetochore-microtubule attachments ( K-fibers ), and limits bivalent stretching. Sgol2’s ability to protect cohesin depends on its interaction with protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ), while its ability to silence the SAC is mediated by direct binding to Mad2. In contrast, Sgol2’s effect on bivalent stretching and K-fiber formation is independent of PP2A and is mediated by the recruitment of the kinesin MCAK and the inhibition of Aurora C kinase activity, respectively. By virtue of its multiple interactions, Sgol2 links many of the processes essential for faithful chromosome segregation during meiosis I.
Neuron-wide RNA transport combines with netrin-mediated local translation to spatially regulate the synaptic proteome. Previous studies have shown that RNA localization and protein synthesis are required for the persistence of experience-dependent changes in brain connectivity. In this study, we investigated whether in addition to promoting local translation, local stimulation also triggers directed trafficking of RNAs from the nucleus to stimulated synapses. Using imaging of RNA localization and translation in cultured Aplysia sensory-motor neurons, we found that RNAs were delivered throughout the arbor of the sensory neuron, but that translation was enriched only at sites of synaptic contact and/or synaptic stimulation. This suggests that spatially restricting gene expression by regulating local translation rather than by directing the delivery of mRNAs from the nucleus to stimulated synapses maximizes the readiness of the entire neuronal arbor to respond to local cues. We also investigated the mechanisms that trigger local translation and found a role for calcium-dependent retrograde netrin-1/DCC receptor signaling. Netrin-1/DCC signaling is a trans-synaptic signal that promotes translation of localized mRNAs. We found that rRNA, three specific mRNAs, ribosomal proteins, and translation factors were delivered throughout the sensory neuron, but that translation was significantly enriched at sites of synaptic contact and at sites of synaptic stimulation. These results indicate that the spatial regulation of gene expression in Aplysia sensory-motor neurons is mediated primarily at the level of translation rather than at the level of RNA targeting from the nucleus.
Human induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) have the ability to self-organize into complex multicellular patterns and structures. However, current methods to model morphogenic events lack control over cell-type co-emergence and offer little capability to selectively perturb specific cell subpopulations. To address this limitation, we employed an inducible CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) system in hiPSCs to silence key proteins that regulate cell adhesion and cortical tension. We created mixed populations of hiPSCs with and without the CRISPRi system and then induced mosaic knockdown ( KD ) of molecular regulators of cortical tension ( ROCK1 ) and cell-cell adhesion ( CDH1 ). Mosaic KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 resulted in differential patterning within hiPSC colonies due to cellular self-organization, while retaining an epithelial pluripotent phenotype. Knockdown induction stimulated a transient wave of differential gene expression within the mixed populations that stabilized in coordination with observed self-organization. We show that silencing of target genes by CRISPRi within only subpopulations of cells provides multiple avenues to genetically control the emergence of asymmetric cell phenotypes and development of multicellular patterns. Mosaic KD was employed to interrogate how the creation of physical asymmetries in an otherwise homogeneous population leads to multicellular organization and pattern formation. We show that induction of mosaic KD of ROCK1 or CDH1 results in a ‘bottom-up’ cell-driven pattern formation of hiPSC colonies while preserving pluripotency. Ultimately, this study identifies a novel strategy to direct the emergence of heterotypic cell populations to control multicellular organization in pluripotent stem cells, and subsequently facilitates the creation of robust models of morphogenesis necessary for the mechanistic study of human developmental tissue patterning and formation.
Visual working memory ( VWM ) precision is known to decrease with the number of encoded items. Here, we propose a normative theory to explain such set size effects: the brain minimizes a weighted sum of an error-based behavioral cost and a neural encoding cost. We construct a model from this theory and find that it predicts set size effects. Notably, these effects are mediated by probing probability, which aligns with previous empirical findings. The model accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability on encoding precision in nine delayed-estimation experiments. Moreover, we find support for the prediction that the total amount of invested resource can vary non-monotonically with set size. Finally, we show that it is sometimes optimal to encode only a subset or even none of the relevant items in a task. Our findings raise the possibility that cognitive “limitations” arise from rational cost minimization rather than from constraints. We tested the model on data from nine previous delayed-estimation experiments and found that it accounts well for effects of both set size and probing probability, despite having relatively few parameters. Moreover, it accounts for a non-monotonicity that appears to exist between set size and the total amount of resource that subjects invest in item encoding. The total amount of resource that subjects spend on item encoding may vary non-monotonically with set size in our model. At the neural level, this translates to a prediction of a non-monotonic relation between population-level spiking activity and set size. We are not aware of any studies that have specifically addressed this prediction, but it can be tested using neuroimaging experiments. Our theory also makes predictions about effects of incentive manipulations on encoding precision, because such manipulations affect the expected behavioral cost function.
Phytophthora infestans, the pathogen responsible for the Irish potato famine, secretes an effector protein called PexRD54 that interferes with the host plant's autophagy pathway. Autophagy is a cellular process by which cells recycle damaged or dysfunctional components to maintain cellular homeostasis. In plants, autophagy also plays a role in defense against pathogens. Here, we show that PexRD54 binds to the autophagy protein ATG8CL and stimulates the formation of autophagosomes, which are membrane-bound structures that engulf and recycle cellular components. This binding also depletes the autophagy cargo receptor Joka2 out of ATG8CL complexes, thereby interfering with Joka2's positive effect on pathogen defense. Thus, PexRD54 has evolved to antagonize a host autophagy cargo receptor to counteract host defenses against P. infestans. Our results show that, in addition to disrupting autophagy, pathogens can also activate autophagy for their own benefit. We also show that PexRD54 competes with the host cargo receptor Joka2 and depletes it out of ATG8CL autophagosomes to promote disease susceptibility. This is the first example of a plant pathogen effector that has evolved an ATG8 interacting motif to bind with high affinity to the autophagy protein ATG8CL and stimulate the formation of ATG8CL-marked autophagosomes. Unlike the Legionella effector RavZ, PexRD54 activates selective autophagy possibly to eliminate defense-related compounds or to reattribute cellular resources by promoting nutrient recycling.
Cardiac fibroblasts ( CFs ) play a crucial role in the adaptive responses of the heart to pathological conditions such as ischemia. However, a comprehensive understanding of how early environmental changes induce CF pathological responses is still lacking, partly due to the lack of approaches involving complex and simultaneous environmental stimulation. Here, we provide a first analysis of human primary CF behavior by means of a multi-stimulus microdevice for combined application of cyclic mechanical strain and controlled oxygen tension. Our findings elucidate differential human CFs responses to different combinations of the above stimuli. Individual stimuli cause proliferative effects ( PHH3+ mitotic cells, YAP translocation, PDGF secretion ) or increase collagen presence. Interestingly, only the combination of hypoxia and a simulated loss of contractility ( 2% strain ) is able to additionally induce increased CF release of inflammatory and pro-fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases. We propose an innovative model that recreates a pathological environment for understanding CF responses during cardiac injury. Replicating for the first time the combination of oxygen changes and mechanical cues, we revealed how these environmental stimulations combine to trigger CF pathological responses and highlighted emerging adaptive cellular mechanisms. In an attempt to provide in vitro models of cardiac disease, CFs have been widely studied under relevant physico-chemical stimulation such as mechanical stress, oxygen deprivation, and biochemical stimulation with pro-fibrotic cytokines. We here finely controlled the applied mechanical strain and oxygen regimes sensed by CFs to model early environmental changes in cardiac injury and provide insights into individual or synergistic contributions of the environmental signals in the activation of early CF responses relevant to cardiac fibrotic disease. We found that mimicking the combination of hypoxia and reduced contractility proved crucial in eliciting inflammatory and fibrotic remodeling responses of CFs, while individual environmental stimuli only regulated proliferative and collagen-related responses. These insights have impact on future studies of pathological myocardial remodeling and the in vitro model here described provides a tool for better understanding pathological mechanisms and tailoring reparative strategies.
Drosophila SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are defined by DOMINO isoforms. Histone acetylation and deposition of the H2A. Z variant are important for active transcription. In Drosophila, the single DOMINO chromatin regulator complex is thought to combine both activities. We show that alternative isoforms of the DOMINO nucleosome remodeling ATPase, DOM-A and DOM-B, directly specify two distinct multi-subunit complexes. Both complexes are necessary for transcriptional regulation but through different mechanisms. The DOM-B complex incorporates H2A. V genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner, similar to the yeast SWR1 complex. The DOM-A complex functions as an ATP-independent histone acetyltransferase complex similar to the yeast NuA4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. Our work provides an example of how different evolutionary strategies lead to similar functional separation. In yeast and humans, nucleosome remodeling and histone acetyltransferase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Drosophila generates the same diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene. We show that most of TIP60 resides in the DOM-A complex in Drosophila cells. The yeast SWR1 and NuA4 complexes are both implicated in transcription. We explored the functional differences of the two DOM isoforms on transcription by RNAseq. We also included knock-downs of H2A. V and TIP60 in our analysis. Knock-down of either DOM-A, DOM-B, TIP60 or H2A. V affects transcription. Our data suggest that the ATPase activity of DOM-A is dispensable for H4K12 acetylation by the DOM-A. Our work illustrates how alternative splicing generates functional diversity amongst chromatin regulators.
β-Catenin ( Ctnnb1 ) plays a critical role in the formation of neuromuscular junctions ( NMJs ) by regulating the interaction between motoneurons and muscle cells. However, little is known about the retrograde signals that are involved in this process. In this study, we investigated the function of Ctnnb1 in muscle cells and identified Slit2 as a β-catenin/Ctnnb1-dependent retrograde signal for presynaptic differentiation. We used an in vivo transgenic approach to dissect the functions of Ctnnb1 in muscle cells and found that the transcriptional activity of Ctnnb1, but not its cell-adhesion function, is required for presynaptic differentiation. We also showed that Ctnnb1 regulates the expression of Slit2 in muscle cells, and that Slit2 is concentrated at the NMJ. Furthermore, we found that transgenic expression of Slit2 in muscle cells is able to rescue the presynaptic deficits caused by a Ctnnb1 mutation in mice, including poor innervation, reduced vesicle density and active zone, and depressed miniature end-plate potentials ( mEPPs ). These observations suggest that Slit2 serves as a factor utilized by muscle Ctnnb1 to direct presynaptic differentiation. We also showed that Slit2 immobilized on beads is able to induce synaptophysin puncta in axons of spinal cord explants, further supporting the role of Slit2 in presynaptic differentiation. Together, these findings suggest that Ctnnb1 regulates presynaptic differentiation by controlling the expression of muscle-derived proteins, including Slit2, and that Slit2 serves as a retrograde signal for presynaptic differentiation.
The dynamics of force transduction at cell–cell junctions of epithelial clusters have been quantified with both sub-cellular and multi-cellular resolution using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. We found that basal force fluctuations are coupled to E-cadherin localization at the level of individual cell–cell junctions. At the multi-cellular scale, cell–cell force exchange depends on the cell position within a cluster, and is adaptive to reconfigurations due to cell divisions or positional rearrangements. Importantly, force transmission through a cell requires coordinated modulation of cell-matrix adhesion and actomyosin contractility in the cell and its neighbors. These data provide insights into mechanisms that could control mechanical stress homeostasis in dynamic epithelial tissues, and highlight our methods as a resource for the study of mechanotransduction in cell–cell adhesions. We developed a generalized cell–cell force measurement and analysis method to quantify, spatially and temporally, the transmission of mechanical forces through cell–cell junctions of dynamic adherent epithelial clusters. Our time-resolved force measurements demonstrated that cell–cell forces at individual junctions fluctuate over time, both during interphase and cell divisions. We investigated whether and how basal force variations were coupled to the localization and recruitment of the molecular components of cell–cell junctions. We focused first on E-cadherin, the backbone of adherens junctions for epithelial cells. Along the cell junction, we showed with sub-interface resolution that the local mechanical stresses also correlated with localization of E-cadherin molecules. Expanding our approach to temporal force fluctuation analysis at the length scale of a cell, we found that force propagation through cells can be intercepted by cell anchorage to the extracellular matrix and by actomyosin contraction. Our method also provides insights into tissue mechanics by revealing that force transmission across a cell cluster is short-ranged, typically on the length scale of one cell diameter, due to the anchoring and scrambling of forces by cell–matrix adhesions and basal actomyosin contractility.
Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. Here, we investigated the structural and biochemical properties of huntingtin and the effect of the polyglutamine expansion on its structure and function. We used a combination of biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle electron microscopy, and cross-linking mass spectrometry. Our results show that huntingtin is likely composed of five distinct domains and adopts a spherical α-helical solenoid structure where the amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal regions form a circumscribed central cavity. Interestingly, we found that the polyglutamine expansion increases the α-helical properties of huntingtin and affects the intramolecular interactions among the domains. Our work delineates the structural characteristics of full-length huntingtin, which are affected by the polyglutamine expansion, and provides an elegant solution to the apparent conundrum of how the extreme amino-terminal polyglutamine tract confers a novel property on huntingtin, causing the disease. We propose that huntingtin’s solenoid structure may enable quantitative or qualitative modulation of huntingtin function according to the size of the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract. Our biophysical analyses of an allelic series of native recombinant human huntingtins provide a satisfying solution to the mystery of how the amino-terminal polyglutamine tract may be in a position to modulate huntingtin structure and function.
Ferritinophagy, the autophagic turnover of ferritin, is a critical process for the regulation of intracellular iron bioavailability. However, how ferritinophagy flux is controlled and the roles of NCOA4, a selective cargo receptor for ferritin, in iron-dependent processes are poorly understood. We show that NCOA4 interacts directly with ferritin via a conserved NCOA4 C-terminal domain and a key conserved residue on ferritin. This interaction is required for the delivery of ferritin to the lysosome via autophagosomes. Moreover, we demonstrate that NCOA4 abundance is under dual control via autophagy and the ubiquitin proteasome system. When iron levels are high, NCOA4 abundance is low, thereby promoting ferritin accumulation and iron capture. However, when iron is low, NCOA4 levels increase to promote ferritinophagy. We show that the HERC2 ligase uses its CUL7-homology domain to recognize NCOA4 under high iron conditions to mediate NCOA4 turnover via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, thereby reducing the steady-state NCOA4 levels and increasing ferritin for iron capture. We further show that NCOA4-mediated ferritinophagy is important for maintaining cellular iron homeostasis and that NCOA4 plays an essential role in erythroid differentiation in zebrafish and cultured cells.
The hierarchical organization of the lateral prefrontal cortex ( LPFC ) has been a topic of debate in the field of higher-level cognition. Here, we provide evidence that the LPFC is organized hierarchically, with progressively rostral areas processing increasingly abstract information to facilitate efficient and flexible cognition. We found that the rostral/caudal axis of the LPFC operates according to abstraction principles by examining gradients of stimulus domain-generality/specificity and temporal control over action. Furthermore, we modeled interactions among LPFC sub-regions to examine whether and how cognitive control demands elicit asymmetrical influences indicative of hierarchical processing. Our data suggest that top-down control within the LPFC is an important determinant of higher-level cognitive function. We found that more strongly asymmetrical hierarchical projections from mid LPFC to other LPFC regions were related to better higher-level cognitive ability. This suggests a beneficial cognitive effect of a hierarchical organization with mid LPFC at the apex. Furthermore, we found that cognitive demands elicited both top-down influences from rostral to mid LPFC and bottom-up influences from caudal to mid LPFC. Thus, analyses of effective connectivity and its modulations suggest that mid LPFC forms a nexus where information converges to influence action. We also found that the strengths of these dynamics were related to trait-measured higher-level cognitive ability. Collectively, these results suggest that the LPFC is hierarchically organized with the mid LPFC positioned to synthesize abstract and concrete information to control behavior.
The hominoid-specific gene TBC1D3 has been found to play a crucial role in the generation of basal neural progenitors and the induction of cortical folding in mice. Cortical expansion and folding are often linked to the evolution of higher intelligence, but the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying cortical folding remain poorly understood. TBC1D3 undergoes segmental duplications during hominoid evolution, but its role in brain development has not been explored. We found that expression of TBC1D3 in ventricular cortical progenitors of mice via in utero electroporation caused delamination of ventricular radial glia cells ( vRGs ) and promoted the generation of self-renewing basal progenitors with typical morphology of outer radial glia ( oRG ), which are most abundant in primates. Furthermore, down-regulation of TBC1D3 in cultured human brain slices decreased the generation of oRGs. Interestingly, localized oRG proliferation resulting from either in utero electroporation or transgenic expression of TBC1D3 was often found to underlie cortical regions exhibiting folding. Thus, we have identified a hominoid gene that is required for oRG generation in regulating the cortical expansion and folding.
NPR1 is a plant immune coactivator that plays a key role in the activation of systemic acquired resistance in plants. NPR1 is an unstable protein that undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which is thought to facilitate continuous delivery of active NPR1 to target promoters and maximize gene expression. However, we show that ubiquitination of NPR1 is a progressive event in which initial modification by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase ( CRL3 ) promotes its chromatin association and expression of target genes. Only when polyubiquitination of NPR1 is enhanced by the E4 ligase UBE4 is it targeted for proteasomal degradation. Conversely, ubiquitin ligase activities are opposed by UBP6/7, two proteasome-associated deubiquitinases that enhance NPR1 longevity. Thus, immune-induced transcriptome reprogramming requires sequential actions of E3 and E4 ligases balanced by opposing deubiquitinases that fine-tune activity of NPR1 without strict requirement for its sacrificial turnover. Our findings indicate that initial CRL3-mediated ubiquitination is required for NPR1 to attain its full transcriptional activity, while the stepwise formation of long ubiquitin chains mediated by UBE4 inactivates NPR1 and promotes its degradation by the proteasome. Instead, initial ubiquitination boosts NPR1 transcriptional coactivator activity, at least in part by enhancing target promoter occupancy in the short term and potentially also by promoting genomic mobility of NPR1 in the longer term.
In Arabidopsis thaliana, the biogenesis of 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs ( 24 nt siRNAs ) requires nuclear RNA polymerase IV ( Pol IV ), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 ( RDR2 ), and DICER-like 3 ( DCL3 ). These siRNAs guide the cytosine methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes. However, the precursors of these siRNAs were mostly undefined. We identified Pol IV and RDR2-dependent RNAs ( P4R2 RNAs ) that accumulate in dcl3 mutants and are diced into 24 nt RNAs by DCL3 in vitro. P4R2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nt and initiate with a purine adjacent to a pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol IV transcripts generated in vitro. RDR2 terminal transferase activity may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P4R2 RNA 3’ termini. The 24 nt siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5’ or 3’ ends of P4R2 RNAs, suggesting a model whereby siRNAs are generated from either end of P4R2 duplexes by single dicing events.
The development of mature neural networks in the brain is a complex and poorly understood process that is believed to be developmentally regulated. However, the postnatal time course for neural networks to perform complex computations remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the progression of large-scale synaptic and cellular activity patterns across development using high spatiotemporal resolution in vivo electrophysiology in immature mice. We found that mature cortical processes emerge rapidly and simultaneously after a discrete but volatile transition period at the beginning of the second postnatal week of rodent development. This transition is characterized by relative neural quiescence, after which spatially distributed, temporally precise, and internally organized activity occurs. We also demonstrate a similar developmental trajectory in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that could facilitate a transition in network operation. We hypothesize that this transient quiescent period is a requisite for the subsequent emergence of coordinated cortical networks. We found that the transition between immature and mature network dynamics was characterized by unexpectedly decreased coordinated cellular and synaptic activity at the beginning of the second postnatal week. After this timepoint, precise neuronal synchronization and oscillatory coupling in space and time robustly emerged. We demonstrate that maturation of cortical network dynamics is preceded by a discrete, relatively quiescent, evolutionarily conserved transition period during early postnatal development. During this period, oscillations and neural spiking display a nadir that signals the shift from local, loosely correlated, putatively sensory-driven patterns to internally organized, spatially distributed, and temporally precise activity. We found that neural spiking was more efficiently recruited to oscillatory activity with consistent, strong phase-locking, and higher temporal precision. These features are characteristic of adult neural networks engaged in information processing. Thus, a transient period of developmental perturbation may be an evolutionarily conserved indicator of a substantial shift in cortical network operations.
Plasmodium falciparum, the parasite responsible for the deadliest form of malaria, is characterized by its ability to undergo antigenic variation via the sequential, mutually exclusive expression of its multi-copy var genes. These genes encode the parasite's major surface antigen, PfEMP1, which binds to host endothelial cell receptors to allow the parasite to sequester within various host tissues. The coexistence of multiple independently circulating strains in pathogen populations that undergo sexual recombination is a central question of epidemiology with profound implications for control. An agent-based model has been developed that extends earlier ‘strain theory’ by addressing the var gene family of P. falciparum. The model explicitly considers the extensive diversity of multi-copy genes that undergo antigenic variation and tracks the dynamics of all unique var repertoires in a population of hosts. It shows that even under high levels of sexual recombination, strain competition mediated through cross-immunity structures the parasite population into a subset of coexisting dominant repertoires of var genes whose degree of antigenic overlap depends on transmission intensity. Empirical comparison of patterns of genetic variation at antigenic and neutral sites supports this role for immune selection in structuring parasite diversity. Our modeling framework considers the dynamics shaping the enormous potential diversity of genomic repertoires of var genes by tracking all possible var repertoires, given a diverse pool of genetic variants. We explore whether structured parasite populations resulting from the selection pressures exerted by competition among distinct var repertoires for hosts, mediated by cross-immunity, can emerge. Mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains have demonstrated that immune selection can lead to the maintenance of discrete, non-overlapping, antigenic repertoires—even when antigenic variability is driven by several unlinked genes that undergo recombination. The ‘var strain’ model suggests that vector control strategies that reduce transmission will not always drastically reduce var gene diversity, because a reservoir of parasite genomes with diverse ( highly non-overlapping ) var repertoires will remain. We describe an agent-based model that extends strain theory to address the effect of immune selection acting on multi-copy antigen genes; we use the var gene family of P. falciparum as the basis for this model.
Deamidation of a glutamine residue in the host ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13 by the deamidase OspI from enteric bacteria Shigella flexneri disrupts the interaction between UBC13 and the RING-finger ubiquitin ligase TRAF6. This disruption prevents the formation of K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the UBC13/TRAF6 complex, thereby inhibiting the downstream activation of the NF-κB inflammatory response. The precise role of deamidation in silencing the UBC13/TRAF6 complex was unknown, but we report that deamidation inhibits the interaction between UBC13 and TRAF6 RING-domain ( TRAF6RING ) by perturbing both the native and transient interactions. Deamidation creates a new intramolecular salt-bridge in UBC13 that competes with a critical intermolecular salt-bridge at the native UBC13/TRAF6RING interface. Moreover, the salt-bridge competition prevents transient interactions necessary to form a typical UBC13/RING complex. Repulsion between E100 and the negatively charged surface of RING also prevents transient interactions in the UBC13/RING complex. Our findings highlight a mechanism wherein a post-translational modification perturbs the conformation and stability of transient complexes to inhibit protein-protein association.
In the auditory cortex of awake mice, we used single-unit recordings and optogenetic manipulations to show that inactivating somatostatin-positive ( Sst+ ) interneurons increased response gain, while inactivating parvalbumin-positive ( Pvalb+ ) interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer. In contrast, activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons revealed no such differences. These findings suggest that Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons support specific, separable functions in the auditory cortex. We used a simple network model to understand this asymmetry, and showed that relatively small changes in key parameters, such as spontaneous activity or strength of the light manipulation, determined whether activation and inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions regarding interneurons’ computational functions. We found that inactivation of Sst+ interneurons increased response gain, while inactivation of Pvalb+ interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer, implying that these two neuron types support specific, separable functions in the auditory cortex. Yet activating Sst+ and Pvalb+ interneurons revealed no such differences.

Working memory ( WM ) is an emergent property of large-scale network interactions in the brain, and synchronization of oscillatory activity might contribute to WM by enabling the coordination of long-range processes. However, causal evidence for the way oscillatory activity shapes network dynamics and behavior in humans is limited. Here, we applied transcranial alternating current stimulation ( tACS ) to exogenously modulate oscillatory activity in a right frontoparietal network that supports WM. We found that externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Simultaneously collected fMRI data reveals tACS effects dependent on the relative phase of the stimulation and the internal cognitive processing state. Specifically, synchronous tACS during the verbal WM task increased parietal activity, which correlated with behavioral performance. Furthermore, functional connectivity results indicate that the relative phase of frontoparietal stimulation influences information flow within the WM network. Overall, our findings demonstrate a link between behavioral performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization. We tested the following hypotheses: ( 1 ) behavioral WM performance is enhanced by entraining synchronous activity within a right frontoparietal network activated by WM demands; ( 2 ) regional brain activity in this frontoparietal network is modulated in a phase dependent manner; ( 3 ) changes in BOLD induced by phase-dependent network stimulation correlate with behavioral performance; ( 4 ) functional connectivity across distant brain regions is modulated in a phase-dependent manner. We found that synchronous ( in-phase ) stimulation caused an improvement in performance and led to increased frontoparietal activity when cognitive demands were high. These results show that external manipulations of large-scale brain synchronization can be used to shape activity and connectivity within brain networks, and those modulations are detectable using fMRI.
Embryonic polarity in invertebrates, amphibians, and fish is largely specified by maternal determinants that fix cell fates early in development. In contrast, amniote embryos remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. In the chick embryo, the earliest known factor is cVg1, a transforming growth factor beta ( TGFβ ) signal expressed posteriorly before gastrulation. A molecular screen to find upstream regulators of cVg1 in normal embryos and in embryos manipulated to form twins uncovers the transcription factor Pitx2 as a candidate. We show that Pitx2 is essential for axis formation, and that it acts as a direct regulator of cVg1 expression by binding to enhancers within neighbouring genes. Pitx2, Vg1/GDF1, and Nodal are also key actors in left–right asymmetry, suggesting that the same ancient polarity determination mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution.
Drosophila melanogaster exhibits robust odor-guided behaviors in an odor gradient field. In order to investigate how early olfactory circuits process temporal variation of olfactory stimuli, we subjected flies to precisely defined odor concentration waveforms and examined spike patterns of olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ) and projection neurons ( PNs ). We found a significant temporal transformation between OSN and PN spike patterns, manifested by the PN output strongly signaling the OSN spike rate and its rate of change. A simple two-dimensional model admitting the OSN spike rate and its rate of change as inputs closely predicted the PN output. When cascaded with the rate-of-change encoding by OSNs, PNs primarily signal the acceleration and the rate of change of dynamic odor stimuli to higher brain centers, thereby enabling animals to reliably respond to the onsets of odor concentrations. PNs subsequently relay olfactory information to higher brain centers such as the mushroom body and the lateral horn ( Stocker et al., 1990 ). Two recent studies independently reported that Drosophila OSNs encode not only the odor concentration but also its rate of change as a function of time ( Kim et al., 2011; Nagel and Wilson, 2011 ). Building on this recent advance, we asked how PNs further contribute to creating internal representations of dynamic olfactory environments. We tested first- and second-order neurons in the Drosophila olfactory system with a wide range of dynamically varying odor concentrations and constructed a simple 2D LN model for the temporal processing of olfactory information. The shape of the 2D nonlinearity and the relatively low prediction error of the model support the hypothesis that the PN spike rate is most strongly dependent on the rate of change of its feedforward OSN input. It is therefore crucial for flying insects to detect and respond to an encountered odor plume before the fly's position drifts relative to adjacent plumes. We showed that Drosophila's early olfactory system signals the acceleration of odor concentrations to higher brain centers. This encoding mechanism allows an animal to detect the odor onset at a very early phase.
In flowering plants, seed development is initiated by the fusion of the maternal egg and central cells with two paternal sperm cells, leading to the formation of embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilization products are surrounded by the maternally derived seed coat, whose development prior to fertilization is blocked by epigenetic regulators belonging to the Polycomb Group ( PcG ) protein family. Here we show that fertilization of the central cell results in the production of auxin and most likely its export to the maternal tissues, which drives seed coat development by removing PcG function. We further show that mutants for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62 have an impaired transport of auxin from the endosperm to the integuments, which results in seed abortion. We propose that AGL62 regulates auxin transport from the endosperm to the integuments, leading to the removal of the PcG block on seed coat development. Our data strongly suggest that production of auxin in the developing endosperm is likely to be the trigger for seed coat development. To further challenge this hypothesis, we investigated plants mutant for the MADS-box transcription factor AGL62. agl62 seeds abort early after fertilization ( around 3–4 DAP ), correlating with early endosperm cellularization and failure to develop a seed coat. We now propose a dual role for post-fertilization auxin production, both in driving endosperm and seed coat development. Additionally, the agl62 mutant has defects both in seed coat development in fertilized ovules and endosperm development in autonomous seeds. This suggests that AGL62, like auxin, is involved in mediating both endosperm and seed coat developmental pathways. We provide multiple lines of evidence supporting this hypothesis: ( i ) auxin rapidly accumulates in the integuments after fertilization, ( ii ) impaired auxin biosynthesis but not auxin signaling in the endosperm causes defects in seed coat development, ( iii ) ovules of transgenic lines producing auxin ectopically in the central cell initiate seed coat development without fertilization, ( iv ) failure of seed coat development in the agl62 mutant correlates with failure to export auxin from the endosperm.
The interaction between a bacteriophage and its host is mediated by the phage's receptor binding protein ( RBP ), which is essential for governing phage activity and host range. Despite its importance, the molecular rules of RBP function remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically dissected the functional role of every residue in the tip domain of T7 phage RBP ( 1660 variants ) by developing a high-throughput, locus-specific, phage engineering method called ORACLE ( Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Library Expression ). This method allowed us to create a large, unbiased library of phage variants at a targeted gene locus and quantify the functional role of all variants on multiple bacterial hosts. We generated high-resolution functional maps delineating regions concentrated with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific substitutional patterns, many of which were previously unknown. We discovered T7 variants with far greater virulence than wildtype T7, demonstrating that even those natural phages that are well adapted to a host can be engineered for higher efficacy. These results indicate that ORACLE can generate phage variants superior to wildtype phage that could then become starting points for further engineering therapeutic phages. We also discovered gain-of-function variants against resistant hosts and host-constricting variants that eliminated certain hosts. To demonstrate the therapeutic value of ORACLE, we engineered T7 variants that avert emergence of spontaneous resistance in pathogenic Escherichia coli causing urinary tract infections ( UTIs ). Our study explains the molecular drivers of adaptability of the tip domain and identifies key functional regions determining activity and host range.
Individuals with congenital amusia have a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing, which leads them to downweight pitch cues during speech perception and instead rely on other dimensions such as duration. To investigate the neural basis for this strategy, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to scan 15 individuals with amusia and 15 controls while they performed a speech perception task. During the task, participants read sentences where a comma indicated a grammatical phrase boundary and then heard two sentences spoken that differed only in pitch and/or duration cues and selected the best match for the written sentence. We found that individuals with amusia exhibited prominent reductions in functional connectivity between left prefrontal language-related regions and right hemisphere pitch-related regions, which reflected the between-group differences in cue weights in the same groups of listeners. Connectivity differences between these regions were not present during a control task. Our results indicate that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked with functional connectivity between frontal and perceptual regions and suggest a compensatory mechanism. We suggest that individuals with amusia neglect pitch because they have implicitly learned that their memory for pitch is unreliable, and that this down-weighting of pitch is reflected in decreased functional connectivity between right auditory areas and downstream task-relevant areas which integrate information from perceptual regions. Our results are consistent with prior reports that amusics and controls do not differ in pitch representations within sensory regions, such as the extent of pitch-responsive regions within auditory cortex ( Norman-Haignere et al., 2016 ) and brainstem encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli ( Liu et al., 2015b ).
Devil Facial Tumour 2 ( DFT2 ) is a contagious cancer recently discovered in the Tasmanian devil ( Sarcophilus harrisii ), a species that already harbours a more widespread contagious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour 1 ( DFT1 ). In contrast to DFT1, DFT2 cells express major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I molecules, suggesting that loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of a contagious cancer. However, the most highly expressed MHC class I alleles in DFT2 cells are common among host devils or non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenicity in a population sharing these alleles. In parallel, MHC class I loss is emerging in vivo, suggesting that DFT2 may be mimicking the evolutionary trajectory of DFT1. We show that DFT2 cells express classical and non-classical MHC class I molecules both in vitro and in vivo. This is in contrast to DFT1, which has lost expression of MHC class I. DFT2 cells express the non-polymorphic, non-classical MHC class I molecule ( Saha-UK ), likely reducing the immunogenicity of these tumour cells. The classical MHC class I allele with the highest expression in DFT2 cells is shared with host devils. We also show that MHC class I expression varies among DFT2 tumours in vivo, suggesting that MHC class I negative subclones could emerge as DFT2 transmits more widely.
Thalamus and claustrum control parallel layer 1 circuits in retrosplenial cortex. The granular retrosplenial cortex ( RSG ) is critical for both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, but the underlying neural codes remain poorly understood. Here, we use optogenetic circuit mapping in mice to reveal a double dissociation that allows parallel circuits in superficial RSG to process disparate inputs. The anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum, sources of spatial information, strongly and selectively recruit small low-rheobase ( LR ) pyramidal cells in RSG. In contrast, neighboring regular-spiking ( RS ) cells are preferentially controlled by claustral and anterior cingulate inputs, sources of mostly non-spatial information. Precise sublaminar axonal and dendritic arborization within RSG layer 1, in particular, permits this parallel processing. Observed thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable computational models of LR neurons to compute the speed of head rotation, despite receiving head direction inputs that do not explicitly encode speed. Thus, parallel input streams identify a distinct principal neuronal subtype ideally positioned to support spatial orientation computations in the RSG. In summary, our results highlight a superficial retrosplenial circuit enabled by the precise sublaminar organization of distinct principal neuronal subtypes and axonal afferents. LR neurons receive directional and spatial inputs from the anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum. The synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs to LR cells can give rise to rate coding of angular head speed in LR cells. Determining how these two parallel streams of information are integrated in downstream neurons within both the ipsilateral and contralateral granular and dysgranular retrosplenial cortices is the next critical step toward a mechanistic understanding of retrosplenial computations. We find that anterior thalamus and dorsal subiculum preferentially control LR neurons, whereas claustrum and anterior cingulate control RS cells. We show that the synaptic dynamics of thalamic inputs allow for the robust encoding of angular speed by LR cell models, even though these inputs only explicitly contain information about head direction, not speed.
Seizures are a druggable mechanistic link between traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) and subsequent tauopathy. TBI is a prominent risk factor for dementias including chronic traumatic encephalopathy ( CTE ). However, the mechanisms that promote prion-like spreading of Tau aggregates after TBI are not fully understood, in part due to lack of tractable animal models. Here, we test the putative role of seizures in promoting the spread of tauopathy. We introduce ‘tauopathy reporter’ zebrafish expressing a genetically encoded fluorescent Tau biosensor that reliably reports accumulation of human Tau species when seeded via intraventricular brain injections. Subjecting zebrafish larvae to a novel TBI paradigm produced various TBI features including cell death, post–traumatic seizures, and Tau inclusions. Bath application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued TBI-induced tauopathy and cell death. These data suggest a role for seizure activity in the prion-like seeding and spreading of tauopathy following TBI. Further work is warranted regarding anti-convulsants that dampen post-traumatic seizures as a route to moderating subsequent tauopathy. We engineered a novel in vivo Tau biosensor model in zebrafish that can visualize pathological Tau spreading and accumulation within the intact and vibrant CNS. In sum, our data reveal a substantial burst of neural activity occurs during TBI, and that zebrafish larvae exposed to TBI subsequently exhibit a significantly higher propensity for spontaneous seizures. After validating that our method was able to induce TBI upon zebrafish larvae, we next asked whether TBI induces Tau aggregates in our Tau biosensor model. Combining these novel approaches, we found that post-traumatic seizures correlate strongly with spreading tau pathology following TBI. Manipulating this seizure activity mitigated Tau aggregation and revealed a critical role for endocytosis in the prion-like spread of Tau seeds in vivo following TBI. The results from our novel in vivo TBI model implicate seizures and dynamin-dependent endocytosis in the spread of Tau seeds, thereby offering potential therapeutic targets.
The relationship between the spatial configuration and functional connectivity of brain regions has been investigated in the context of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rfMRI ). Functional connectivity ( FC ) refers to the temporal correlations between spontaneous fluctuations in distinct brain regions, revealing complex patterns of functional connectivity. However, the spatial configuration and organisation of functional regions ( referred to as ‘topography’ ) may interact with measures of brain connectivity. In this study, we investigated the extent to which the exact spatial arrangement of cortical regions interacts with measures of brain connectivity. We find that the shape and exact location of brain regions interact strongly with the modelling of brain connectivity, and present evidence that the spatial arrangement of functional regions is strongly predictive of non-imaging measures of behaviour and lifestyle. We believe that, in many cases, cross-subject variations in the spatial configuration of functional brain regions are being interpreted as changes in functional connectivity. Therefore, a better understanding of these effects is important when interpreting the relationship between functional imaging data and cognitive traits. The organisation of the human brain into large-scale functional networks has been investigated extensively over the past two decades using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging ( rfMRI ). Spontaneous fluctuations in distinct brain regions ( as measured with rfMRI ) show temporal correlations with each other, revealing complex patterns of functional connectivity ( FC ) ( Biswal et al., 1995; Friston, 1994, 2011 ). We find that network matrices ( as often estimated ) contain little unique trait-level cross-subject information that is not also reflected in the spatial topographical organisation of functional regions. The implication of this finding is that the cross-subject information represented in commonly adopted ‘connectivity fingerprints’ largely reflects spatial variability in the location of functional regions across individuals, rather than variability in coupling strength ( at least for methods that directly map group-level parcellations onto individual data ).
TBP/TFIID-dependent activation of MyoD target genes in skeletal muscle cells is a complex process that involves the replacement of the canonical TFIID-TBP complex with TRF3/TBP2. However, we show here that TBP2 is not expressed in established C2C12 muscle cells or in primary mouse MuSCs, and that TBP2 null mice have an intact regeneration potential upon injury. This suggests that TBP2 does not replace TBP during muscle differentiation, as previously proposed. Instead, we demonstrate that TBP, but not TBP2, is the essential component of the transcription pre-initiation complex ( PIC ) that promotes muscle gene expression in differentiated skeletal muscles. We found that TBP2 is not expressed in myotubes derived from either C2C12 myoblasts or from primary mouse MuSCs. Consistently, TBP2-deficient mice displayed an intact regeneration potential, and MuSCs isolated from TBP2-deficient muscles differentiated into myotubes with the same efficiency as wild type MuSCs. Our data demonstrating the lack of requirement of TBP2 for adult skeletal muscle regeneration prompted us to compare the RNA expression profile of Tbp and Tbpl2 genes in MuSCs isolated from skeletal muscles of wild type mouse by FACS, and in the C2C12 myogenic cell line. We found that Tbp expression was detected in both MuSC-derived myotubes and in C2C12 myotubes. We also detected comparable numbers of MuSCs in muscles of WT and TBP2 null mice 12 days after injury, indicating an intact capacity of adult MuSCs to proliferate, self-renew and differentiate during ongoing muscle regeneration in the absence of TBP2.
In this study, we used a large-scale optogenetic interface to simultaneously stimulate excitatory neurons and record electrocorticographic activity across primary somatosensory ( S1 ) and motor ( M1 ) cortex in two macaques. We investigated the effects of stimulation on large-scale network dynamics and found that stimulation in S1 or M1 significantly strengthened the functional connectivity between these areas within minutes. We used two measures of network connectivity: the network response to focal stimulation and the baseline coherence between pairs of electrodes. These measures were strongly correlated before stimulation, and we found that stimulation led to heterogeneous connectivity changes across the network. These changes reflected the correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent with Hebbian plasticity models. Our results demonstrate a robust relationship between stimulus-evoked correlations and changes in baseline connectivity across the network, and are well explained by a Hebbian model of large-scale stimulation-induced plasticity. This work extends Hebbian plasticity models to large-scale circuits, with significant implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation.
In a rare case of a Rhesus macaque born without primary visual cortex ( V1 ), the animal’s in-group behaviour was unremarkable, but visual task training was impaired. The animal’s brain was examined with multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed that visual structures outside of the lesion appeared normal. Visual stimulation under anaesthesia with checkerboards activated the lateral geniculate nucleus, while full-field moving dots activated the pulvinar. Visual cortical activation was sparse but included face patches. Consistently across lesion and control monkeys, functional connectivity analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas temporally correlated with V5/MT activation, even without V1. Despite robust subcortical responses to visual stimulation, we found little evidence for strengthened subcortical input to V5/MT supporting residual visual function or blindsight-like phenomena. Visual structures, both cortical and subcortical, outside of the large lesion of primary visual cortex remained intact in monkey S with little evidence of atrophy. This suggests a role in residual visual function, consistent with an intact network of extrastriate cortical visual areas that was comparable to control monkeys. While the structural connectivity between the subcortical regions and area V5/MT was weak, the microstructure was intact. We found no significant V5/MT activation in monkey S to either checkerboard or moving dots stimuli, so to understand the nature of the response in area V5/MT, we performed a connectivity analysis. Given the significantly weakened tract between V5/MT and subcortical nuclei indicated by the diffusion imaging, there is little evidence to suggest that a strengthening of these connections underlies whatever residual vision was present in monkey S. Residual vision can manifest in several different ways, including the ability to determine information from faces, as shown in patient TN ( Burra et al., 2013 ), a function that has been suggested to survive loss of V1. Nevertheless, for visual motion stimuli we saw in monkey S foci of activation in the region of V5/MT in dorsal STS of both hemispheres, suggesting any activation may be sub-threshold and difficult to detect with BOLD. Even without the strong visually-evoked V5/MT responses, it was possible to map out a functional network of cortical areas showing a similar BOLD response over time to V5/MT. Retinal information may reach the dorsal visual areas via the weak pathways with LGN and pulvinar, but the lack of consistent visual cortex activation, possibly due to the anaesthesia, makes this question difficult to answer. The lack of significant differences between monkey S and controls in the pathways between LGN-V5/MT and pulvinar-V5/MT suggests either or both could support residual visual abilities.
The interferon-inducible protein 16 ( IFI16 ) is a key innate immune sensor that plays a central role in detecting foreign double-stranded ( ds ) DNA in both the host nucleus and cytoplasm. IFI16 recognizes foreign dsDNA and uses it as a scaffold to assemble supramolecular signaling platforms. However, the molecular mechanism by which IFI16 distinguishes foreign DNA from host genomic material inside the nucleus has been a major unresolved question in innate immunology. Here, we show that IFI16 one-dimensionally tracks long stretches of exposed foreign dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular signaling platforms. We also demonstrate that nucleosomes represent barriers that prevent IFI16 from targeting host DNA by directly interfering with these one-dimensional movements. This unique scanning-assisted assembly mechanism allows IFI16 to distinguish friend from foe and assemble into oligomers efficiently and selectively on foreign DNA. By using time-resolved bulk and single-molecule fluorescence assays, we demonstrate that IFI16 scans along exposed dsDNA to assemble into distinct clusters and that chromatinization is sufficient to inhibit IFI16 from targeting host dsDNA for assembly. In vivo, this 1D scanning mechanism allows a limited number of IFI16 molecules to allocate each other on large genomes of invading pathogens. We propose that the 1D-diffusion mediated assembly plays a key role in regulating the overall IFI16-mediated immune responses.
Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease ( AD ), are characterized by the formation of pathological protein deposits in the brain. However, the exact composition of these deposits is difficult to determine due to their small size and heterogeneity. Here, we describe a novel proteomics technique called spatially targeted optical microproteomics ( STOMP ), which allows for the interrogation of micron-scale regions of interest ( ROIs ) in mammalian tissue without the need for genetic manipulation. STOMP combines two-photon laser scanning microscopy with photochemical affinity labeling and mass spectrometry to covalently couple photo-tags to all proteins within each ROI. This technique offers single-micron-scale three-dimensional resolution, an order of magnitude better than the current state of the art, and can be applied to various biological samples including cell lines, primary cell cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy samples, and fixed post-mortem tissue. As a test case, we examined amyloid plaques in an AD mouse model and a post-mortem AD case, confirming known plaque constituents and discovering new ones. The predominant protein photo-tagged in the STOMP sample was Aβ, which is not visible in the non-plaque experiment due to its low overall abundance. In addition to providing clues to the etiology of neurodegenerative disease, STOMP has great potential to advance research in cell biology by yielding the composition of small features that are not amenable to biochemical purification.
Frizzled3 ( Fz3 ) is a gene that plays a crucial role in the development of the nervous system, particularly in the growth and guidance of motor axons. In this study, we investigated the function of Fz3 in the development of cranial and spinal motor neurons in mice. We found that disruption of the Fz3 gene leads to defects in axonal growth in the VIIth and XIIth cranial motor nerves, the phrenic nerve, and the dorsal motor nerve in fore- and hindlimbs. Affected motor neurons undergo cell death 2 days prior to the normal wave of developmental cell death that coincides with innervation of muscle targets. This suggests that developing neurons with long-range axons are programmed to die unless their axons arrive at intermediate targets on schedule. In contrast to the phenotypes of several other axon path-finding mutants, Fz3−/− dorsal axons do not reroute to other trajectories, but instead stall at a precise location in the nerve plexus. These findings implicate planar cell polarity ( PCP ) signaling in motor axon growth and highlight the question of how PCP proteins, which form cell–cell complexes in epithelia, function in the dynamic context of axonal growth. In the limb, the absence of Fz3 leads to a specific stalling defect among LMCL axons that is distinct from the phenotypes produced by defects in several other signaling systems active in limb axon guidance. We found that the primary cause of motor axon deficiency in the VIIth, XIIth, phrenic, and dorsal limb nerves in Fz3−/− mice is defective axon growth and/or guidance, rather than defective motor neuron differentiation or excessive motor neuron death. In addition, we found that a discrete subset of motor neurons exhibits both axon growth defects and apoptotic cell death at E11. 5-E12. 5 in Fz3−/− embryos, suggesting that controlling axonal growth may be the only function of Fz3 in motor neurons.
Transposable elements ( TEs ) are repetitive DNA sequences that have the ability to jump from one location to another in the genome. They are thought to have played a significant role in the evolution of gene regulatory networks. In the early mouse embryo, both the embryonic and extraembryonic lineages have co-opted TEs as enhancers to regulate gene expression. However, there is little evidence that TEs play a significant role in gene regulation. Here, we tested a set of long terminal repeat TE families for roles as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophoblast stem cells. We found that a large number of TEs are involved in establishing tissue-specific gene expression programmes. However, only a minority of TEs play a significant role in gene regulation. Our results suggest that a subset of TEs are important for gene regulation in early mouse development, and highlight the importance of functional experiments when evaluating gene regulatory roles of TEs. We used CRISPR interference ( CRISPRi ) and CRISPR-mediated genetic excision to test the regulatory roles of multiple TE+ enhancers in embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) and trophoblast stem cells ( TSCs ). Our results are in line with chromatin accessibility data and suggest that TE+ enhancers may be used to support lineage-specific expression of a subset of genes in early development. We identified a number of TEs that are important to drive expression of lineage-specific genes, but extensive genetic work will be necessary to evaluate what proportion of TE+ enhancers act in a redundant fashion with other regulatory elements.
C4 photosynthesis is a complex trait that has independently evolved from the ancestral C3 pathway in at least 60 plant lineages. However, the evolutionary history of C4 photosynthesis is unclear. Here, we show that C4 photosynthesis is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. We conducted a meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species that use C3, C4, or intermediate C3–C4 forms of photosynthesis to parameterise a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape. We then developed and experimentally verified a novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model that predicts how the C4 phenotype evolved. The alternative evolutionary histories underlying the appearance of C4 photosynthesis were determined by ancestral lineage and initial phenotypic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis. We conclude that the order of C4 trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers. This flexibility will have facilitated the convergent evolution of this complex trait. We report the development of a novel, predictive Bayesian approach that is able to infer likely evolutionary trajectories connecting phenotypes from sparsely sampled, highly stochastic data. With this model, we provided insights into the evolution of one of the most complex traits to have arisen in multiple lineages: C4 photosynthesis. As the emergence of the entire C4 phenotype cannot be comprehensively explored experimentally, C4 photosynthesis is an ideal system for the mathematical modelling of complex trait evolution as transitions on an underlying phenotype landscape. We therefore conclude that these distinct sub-types evolved as a consequence of alternative evolutionary histories in response to non-photosynthetic pressures. Furthermore, we propose that early evolutionary events determined the downstream phenotypes of C4 sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across phenotype space.
SpoIVA is a bacterial cytoskeletal protein that hydrolyzes ATP to polymerize irreversibly during Bacillus subtilis sporulation. It evolved from a TRAFAC class of P-loop GTPases, but the evolutionary pressure that drove this change in nucleotide specificity is unclear. We therefore reengineered the nucleotide-binding pocket of SpoIVA to mimic its ancestral GTPase activity. The resulting protein, SpoIVAGTPase, was functional in vivo and could use either ATP or GTP to induce a similar conformational change after nucleotide hydrolysis. However, SpoIVAGTPase only polymerized in the presence of ATP, suggesting a specific requirement for the nucleotide base, not simply the energy released from nucleotide hydrolysis, for its function. Consistent with this notion, we observed that physiological levels of intracellular ATP, but not GTP, facilitate the requisite conformational changes in SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase. Both SpoIVA and SpoIVAGTPase failed to undergo nucleotide hydrolysis-mediated structural changes in the presence of 0. 06 mM GTP at sub-polymerization levels of the protein but did so in the presence of 1. 5 mM ATP. However, when we examined SpoIVA polymerization at different concentrations of ATP, we observed that while neither SpoIVA nor SpoIVAGTPase were able to polymerize in the presence of 0. 06 mM ATP, they were able to polymerize in the presence of 1. 5 mM ATP. This suggests that the nucleotide base, in addition to the energy released from hydrolysis, can be critical in specific biological functions. We also present data suggesting that increased levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation was the evolutionary pressure that drove the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA.
Leptin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating energy balance and exhibits neurotrophic effects during critical developmental periods. However, the actual role of leptin during development is not yet fully understood. To uncover the importance of leptin in early life, the present study restored leptin signaling either at the fourth or tenth week of age in mice formerly null for the leptin receptor ( LepR ) gene. We found that some defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, including the poor development of arcuate nucleus neural projections, were recovered by LepR reactivation in adulthood. However, LepR deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. LepR reactivation in adulthood also led to persistent reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cartpt and Prlh mRNA expression and to defects in the reproductive system and brain growth. Our findings revealed that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine and developmental problems. Thus, the actual importance of leptin signaling during development for the long-term energy homeostasis and other aspects regulated by leptin is not yet fully understood. To uncover the role of leptin during development, we investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life. For this purpose, we studied knockout mice for the Lepr gene that grew without leptin’s effects. Leptin or LepR deficiency leads to reduced brain mass, disruption of the projections from ARH neurons to the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, as well as behavioral and cognitive problems. Therefore, we evaluated the possible consequences of the lack of leptin signaling in early life on brain development. In addition to the role of leptin in energy homeostasis, other studies have shown that leptin can affect developmental processes, especially in the brain. Regarding this aspect, rodents exhibit a postnatal leptin surge between the first and second week of age that is not associated to changes in fat mass or food intake. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the metabolic programming by indicating which specific metabolic, neuroendocrine and developmental consequences arise from the absence of leptin signaling in early life, especially in the context of the alarming growth of childhood obesity worldwide.
In this study, we show that heterotrimeric G proteins composed of the non-canonical Gα protein XLG2, the Gβ protein AGB1, and the Gγ proteins AGG1 and AGG2 are required for FLS2-mediated immune responses in Arabidopsis. The FLS2 immune receptor perceives bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the central cytoplasmic kinase BIK1. We demonstrate that in the pre-activation state, XLG2 directly interacts with FLS2 and BIK1, and functions together with AGB1 and AGG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of BIK1, allowing optimum immune activation. Following the activation by flg22, XLG2 dissociates from AGB1 and is phosphorylated by BIK1 in the N terminus. The phosphorylated XLG2 enhances the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) likely by modulating the NADPH oxidase RbohD. Importantly, introduction of a transgenic copy of BIK1 largely restored flg22-triggered immune responses and disease resistance in xlg2 and agb1 mutants, demonstrating that a major function of the heterotrimeric G protein is to maintain the signaling competence of the FLS2-BIK1 complex in the pre-activation state. In addition to the ligand-induced dissociation of XLG2 from AGB1, flg22 induces the phosphorylation of XLG2 in the N terminus. Together the results show that the G proteins dynamically interact with the FLS2-BIK1 receptor complex during FLS2 signaling, and the findings are consistent with the observed defects in flg22-induced responses and RbohD phosphorylation in the G protein mutants.
The Arabidopsis circadian clock has been shown to orchestrate gene regulation across the day/night cycle. However, it remains unclear how robust the clock is in individual cells, or how clock timing is coordinated across the plant. Here we examine clock activity at the single cell level across Arabidopsis seedlings over several days under constant environmental conditions. Our data reveal robust single cell oscillations, albeit desynchronised. We observe two waves of clock activity; one going down, and one up the root. We also find evidence of cell-to-cell coupling of the clock, especially in the root tip. A simple model shows that cell-to-cell coupling and our measured period differences between cells can generate the observed waves. Our results reveal the spatial structure of the plant clock and suggest that unlike the centralised mammalian clock, the Arabidopsis clock has multiple coordination points. We are able to estimate the coupling strength between cells, and find evidence of coupling, especially strong in the root tip. A simple model suggests that our observed period differences, plus cell-to-cell coupling, can generate the observed waves in clock gene expression. Thus, our data reveals both the structure and robustness of the plant circadian clock system. Our results suggest that the structure of the plant clock is more complicated than previously thought, as a hierarchical model does not explain the observed short period oscillations in the root tip, or the wave of clock gene expression up from the root tip. Our results support a more decentralised model of clock coordination in plants.
Speech perception in noisy environments is a complex process that requires the brain to unmix the attended speech stream from background speakers. Normally, this is achieved through a combination of fast temporal processing and cognitive active listening mechanisms. However, a significant proportion of adults with clinically normal hearing experience difficulties in following conversations in noisy social environments. Here, we present a set of neural biomarkers that identify poor multi-talker speech intelligibility in adults with clinically normal hearing. We found that multi-talker speech intelligibility thresholds varied widely in normal hearing adults, but could be predicted from neural phase-locking to frequency modulation ( FM ) cues measured with ear canal EEG recordings. Combining neural temporal fine structure processing, pupil-indexed listening effort, and behavioral FM thresholds accounted for 78% of the variability in multi-talker speech intelligibility. We also found that individuals with steeper pupil recruitment functions had more difficulty in the multi-talker speech task, leading to a significant correlation between min-max/halfmax pupil change and speech intelligibility threshold. These data suggest that the strong association between psychophysical tests for FM detection and speech-in-noise intelligibility can be attributed, at least in part, to encoding of FM cues at early stages of auditory processing. Our overall motivation was to develop objective physiological markers that might explain complaints of poor speech communication in individuals with clinically normal hearing. We present a simple battery of behavioral and physiological tests that can account for nearly 80% of the variability in a test of multi-talker speech intelligibility that does not involve linguistic cues.
Microvascular diseases that originate in the capillaries of the retina, a part of the central nervous system, are difficult to evaluate early on due to imperfections in the optics of the eye that blur microscopic retinal capillaries and single blood cells flowing within. To overcome this limitation, we used 15 kHz adaptive optics imaging to noninvasively measure single-cell blood flow in one of the most widely used research animals, the C57BL/6J mouse. We were able to measure blood flow across the full spectrum of retinal vessel diameters ( 3. 2–45. 8 µm ), ranging from 0. 0002 to 1. 55 µL min–1, without requiring surgery or contrast dye. This was made possible by pairing ultrafast imaging with an automated analysis pipeline that enabled high-throughput velocity measurement of hundreds of thousands of blood cells per second. In this study, we report single-cell velocity and flow rate in the smallest to largest vessels in the living mouse retina. We used AOSLO imaging with ultrafast camera capture to noninvasively image blood cells without foreign contrast agents. This novel imaging paradigm was paired with an automated analysis workflow to enable high-throughput velocity measurement of hundreds of thousands of blood cells per second. Our method of noninvasively studying the retina may serve as a window to supplement the understanding of microcirculation dynamics in the CNS. The eye may also serve as a window to systemic microvascular health. In total, 123 vessels in 19 mice were studied.
Nod Factor Receptor 1 ( NFR1 ), NFR5, and Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase ( SYMRK ) initiate spontaneous nodule organogenesis and nodulation-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia when ectopically expressed in Lotus japonicus roots. NFR1 and NFR5 were found to associate with endogenous SYMRK in the roots of L. japonicus. Epistasis tests revealed that the dominant active SYMRK allele initiates signalling independently of either the NFR1 or NFR5 gene and upstream of a set of genes required for the generation or decoding of calcium-spiking in both symbioses. However, only SYMRK overexpression triggered the expression of arbuscular mycorrhiza ( AM ) -related genes, indicating that the receptors play a key role in the decision between AM- or root nodule symbiosis-development. The SYMRK-mediated loss of signalling specificity may be explained by simultaneous complex formation of SYMRK with NFR1 and NFR5, and related LysM-RLKs that mediate recognition of signals from the AM fungus. This results in the release of both negative regulatory mechanisms, or by an unbalanced stoichiometry of SYMRK and putative specific negative regulators of AM- and root nodule symbiosis signalling. The common symbiosis genes of legumes are required for both AM and root nodule symbiosis. A subset of these genes is essential for either the generation or the decoding of calcium-spiking. In L. japonicus, the former group encodes the RLK Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase ( SYMRK ). Interestingly, under these conditions, the SYMRK-NFR association was detected in the absence of nodulation factor.
DeepPoseKit is a new software toolkit designed for fast and robust animal pose estimation using deep learning. It addresses the limitations of currently available methods in terms of speed and robustness by employing an efficient multi-scale deep-learning model called Stacked DenseNet and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm. These advances improve processing speed by more than two times with no loss in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the versatility of our methods with multiple challenging animal pose estimation tasks in both laboratory and field settings, including groups of interacting individuals. Our work reduces barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and has broad applicability across the behavioral sciences. We have presented a new software toolkit, called DeepPoseKit, for estimating animal posture using deep learning models. We built on the state-of-the-art for individual pose estimation using convolutional neural networks to achieve fast inference without reducing accuracy or generalization ability. Our new pose estimation model, called Stacked DenseNet, offers considerable improvements over the models from Mathis et al. The code, documentation, and examples for our entire software package are freely available at https://github. com/jgraving/deepposekit under a permissive open-source license. To achieve the goal of fast animal pose estimation introduced by Pereira et al. ( 2019 ), while maintaining the robust predictive power of models like DeepLabCut ( Mathis et al. Together these advances could lead to larger, higher-resolution, more reliable behavioral datasets that could revolutionize our understanding of relationships between behavior, the brain, and the environment. In conclusion, we have presented a new toolkit, called DeepPoseKit, for automatically measuring animal posture from images. Achieving fast pose estimation using CNNs typically relies on massively parallel processing on the GPU with large batches of data or requires downsampling the images to increase speed, which increases error ( Mathis and Warren, 2018 ). These factors make fast and accurate real-time inference challenging to accomplish. Our Stacked DenseNet model, with a batch size of one, can run inference at ∼30–110 Hz—depending on the resolution of the predicted confidence maps ( Appendix 1—figure 1b ). In contrast to conventional computer-vision methods, modern deep-learning–﻿based methods can be used to achieve near human-level accuracy in almost any scenario by manually annotating data ( Figure 1 ) —known as a training set—and training a general-purpose image-processing algorithm—a convolutional neural network or CNN—to automatically estimate the locations of an animal’s body parts directly from images ( Figure 2 ).
Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and subsequent pyroptotic cell death in innate immune cells, such as macrophages, can be triggered by the disruption of glycolytic flux. We describe here the identification of an intracellular trigger of NLRP3-mediated inflammatory signaling, IL-1β production and pyroptosis in primed murine bone marrow-derived macrophages that is mediated by the disruption of glycolytic flux. This signal results from a drop in NADH levels and induction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) production, and can be rescued by addition of products that restore NADH production. This signal is also important for host-cell response to the intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhimurium, which can disrupt metabolism by uptake of host-cell glucose. These results reveal an important inflammatory signaling network used by immune cells to sense metabolic dysfunction or infection by intracellular pathogens. We found that S. typhimurium infection impaired NADH production, resulting in the formation of mitochondrial ROS that were essential for NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Therefore, disruption of glycolytic flux is a biologically relevant trigger of NLRP3 inflammasome activation that is mediated by mitochondrial redox changes, revealing a mechanistic link between cellular metabolism and initiation of inflammation. Importantly, we found that the NAD+ consumption rate increased upon pyruvate treatment, indicating induction of productive metabolism downstream of glycolysis in infected BMDMs. Taken together, these data indicate that glycolytic perturbation is a mechanism by which innate immune cells sense altered homeostasis during S. typhimurium infection and induce a pro-inflammatory response via NLRP3 inflammasome formation and pyroptotic cell death.
PALB2 is a tumour suppressor protein that plays a critical role in maintaining chromosomal integrity by coordinating the functions of BRCA1 and BRCA2 during homology-directed repair ( HDR ). In addition to its role as a scaffold protein, PALB2 has been shown to interact with DNA, but the functional significance of this interaction is poorly understood. We have identified a major DNA-binding site of PALB2 and demonstrated that mutations in this site reduce RAD51 foci formation and HDR efficiency in cells by 50%. Furthermore, we have shown that the N-terminal DNA-binding domain ( N-DBD ) of PALB2 stimulates the function of RAD51 recombinase and possesses strand exchange activity even in the absence of RAD51. Notably, the N-DBD can use both DNA and RNA as substrates and supports both forward and inverse strand exchange. These data reveal a novel activity of PALB2 and highlight the importance of PALB2 DNA binding for chromosome repair in cells.
MreB is a prokaryotic actin homologue that forms antiparallel double filaments in vitro and in vivo. Unlike other actin-like proteins, MreB filaments are composed of pairs of protofilaments that are arranged in an antiparallel fashion. This arrangement is unprecedented among actin-like proteins and is essential for MreB's function in cell shape maintenance. The antiparallel arrangement of MreB protofilaments ensures that each subunit can interact with the membrane and membrane-bound components of the elongasome. The non-polar nature of MreB filaments explains common assembly and disassembly kinetics for both filament ends. The mechanism for protofilament formation of Caulobacter crescentus MreB is reminiscent of that of other actin-like proteins, revealing the typical domain closure upon polymerisation. The crystal structure of Caulobacter MreB reveals the typical actin fold, containing two domains on either side of a nucleotide binding cleft. Both domains are separated into two subdomains, A and B. Crystal structures of different nucleotide and polymerisation states of Caulobacter MreB reveal conserved conformational changes accompanying antiparallel filament formation. The antimicrobial agents A22/MP265 bind close to the bound nucleotide of MreB, presumably preventing nucleotide hydrolysis and destabilising double protofilaments. The antiparallel arrangement of protofilaments of C. crescentus MreB is unprecedented within the actin family of proteins. It ensures that the amphipathic helix of both protofilaments can bind to the membrane and that both protofilaments are able to interact with bitopic proteins, such as RodZ.
Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta are two closely related plant species that differ in their petal number robustness. While A. thaliana flowers consistently have four petals, C. hirsuta flowers have variable petal numbers. Here, we show that divergence in the pleiotropic floral regulator APETALA1 ( AP1 ) can account for the difference in petal number robustness between the two species. AP1 is an important regulator of flower development in A. thaliana, acting early to initiate flowers and later to specify floral organs. We show that A. thaliana AP1 confers robustness by masking the phenotypic expression of quantitative trait loci ( QTL ) controlling petal number in C. hirsuta. In contrast, C. hirsuta AP1 fails to complement this function of A. thaliana AP1, conferring variable petal number. This large effect of AP1 is explained by epistatic interactions, where A. thaliana AP1 masks the phenotypic expression of all petal number QTL in C. hirsuta. Therefore, our results suggest that AP1 divergence likely exposed cryptic genetic variation in C. hirsuta that contributes directly to maintaining variable petal number within natural accessions of C. hirsuta. We also show that variable petal number in C. hirsuta is maintained despite sufficient standing genetic variation in natural accessions to produce plants with four-petalled flowers. Our results suggest that AP1 polymorphisms do not contribute directly to within-species variation in C. hirsuta petal number. Instead, the decanalization of petal number in C. hirsuta reflects its robustness to genetic variation.
Misfolding of proinsulin is an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes ( T2D ). Proinsulin, the precursor to insulin, is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) of pancreatic islet β-cells, where it forms three evolutionarily conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. However, a subset of proinsulin molecules in normal islets contains at least one free cysteine thiol, and in islets with a perturbed ER folding environment, non-native proinsulin forms intermolecular disulfide-linked complexes. In genetically obese mice with otherwise wild-type islets, disulfide-linked complexes of proinsulin are more abundant, and in leptin receptor-deficient mice, the increase in such complexes tracks with the onset of islet insulin deficiency and diabetes. We show that proinsulin-Cys ( B19 ) and Cys ( A20 ) are necessary and sufficient for the formation of proinsulin disulfide-linked complexes, and that proinsulin Cys ( B19 ) -Cys ( B19 ) covalent homodimers resist reductive dissociation, highlighting a structural basis for aberrant proinsulin complex formation. We conclude that increased proinsulin misfolding via disulfide-linked complexes is an early event associated with prediabetes that worsens with β-cell dysfunction in T2D. We establish that proinsulin misfolding includes the inability to successfully complete its three internal disulfide bonds, with a subfraction of proinsulin molecules in the ER bearing unpaired cysteine residues. This population of improperly folded proinsulin molecules enters into aberrant disulfide-linked partnerships with other proinsulin molecules in the ER, resulting in misfolded proinsulin complexes that are for the first time identified in the islets of human beings.
Suv39h1 is a major histone H3 lysine 9 ( H3K9 ) -specific methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in assembling silent heterochromatin. It recognizes trimethylated H3K9 ( H3K9me3 ) via its chromodomain ( CD ) and targets specific chromosomal regions. However, the detailed targeting mechanisms, especially for naïve chromatin without preexisting H3K9me3, are poorly understood. Here we show that Suv39h1’s CD ( Suv39h1-CD ) binds nucleic acids, and this binding is important for its function in heterochromatin assembly. Suv39h1-CD had higher binding affinity for RNA than DNA, and its ability to bind nucleic acids was independent of its H3K9me3 recognition. Suv39h1 bound major satellite RNAs in vivo, and knockdown of major satellite RNAs lowered Suv39h1 retention on pericentromere. Suv39h1 mutational studies indicated that both the nucleic acid–binding and H3K9me–binding activities of Suv39h1-CD were crucial for its pericentric heterochromatin assembly. These results suggest that chromatin-bound RNAs contribute to creating SUV39H’s target specificity. In addition to its role in establishing H3K9me3, Suv39h1-CD’s RNA-binding activity also contributes to Suv39h1’s stable association with H3K9me3-rich pericentromeric regions. Knockdown of major satellite repeat transcripts further supports the notion that RNA ( major satellite RNA ) binding of Suv39h1 contributes to its stability on chromatin. We also found that the HP1-binding and chromatin-binding activities of Suv39h1’s N-terminal region contributed to the Suv39h1-mediated pericentric H3K9me3 formation. Collectively, our results demonstrated that the four different activities of Suv39h1 other than its lysine methyltransferase activity cooperatively regulate Suv39h1-mediated pericentric heterochromatin assembly.
Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex allow for the precise decoding of position in space and have recently been hypothesized to make a general contribution to mental operations. A prerequisite for this hypothesis is that grid cell activity does not critically depend on physical movement. Here, we show that movement of covert attention, without any physical movement, also elicits spatial receptive fields with a triangular tiling of space. In monkeys trained to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a stimulus moving in the periphery, we identified a significant population ( 20/141, 14% neurons at a FDR <5% ) of entorhinal cells with spatially structured receptive fields. This contrasts with recordings obtained in the hippocampus, where grid-like representations were not observed. Our results provide evidence that neurons in macaque entorhinal cortex do not rely on physical movement. Previous results demonstrated that, in stationary monkeys, grid cells can be activated by eye movements as monkeys visually explore complex scenes. To examine spatial representations of cells in the entorhinal cortex during the movement of covert attention, we recorded the neuronal activity of 141 neurons in the entorhinal cortex of two rhesus macaque monkeys performing a covert attention tracking task. The monkeys were trained to maintain central fixation while attending to a small ( 1° ) dot that moved around the computer monitor. Monkeys performed the task at >70% accuracy, with the majority of errors due to saccades to outside of the fixation window. Depending on their motivation, monkeys completed between two and eight cycles per session. In order to examine spatial representations among entorhinal neurons, we evaluated the standard gridness measure ( Solstad et al., 2008; Langston et al., 2010; Brandon et al., 2011 ), and the neural substrate for overt and covert attention is largely overlapping ( Corbetta et al., 1998 ).
Decision-making in mice is a complex behavior that has been difficult to reproduce across multiple laboratories. To address this issue, we developed a standardized task to probe decision-making in mice that can be readily shared, compared, and reproduced across laboratories. The task is a perceptual and value-based decision-making task that is performed by head-fixed mice, and we standardized the training protocol and experimental hardware, software, and procedures. We trained 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, and collected 5 million mouse choices into a publicly available database. The results show that learning speed was variable across mice and laboratories, but once training was complete, there were no significant differences in behavior across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories adopted similar reliance on visual stimuli, past successes and failures, and estimates of stimulus prior probability to guide their choices. These results reveal that a complex mouse behavior can be reproduced across multiple laboratories, and provide an unprecedented dataset and open-access tools to study decision-making in mice. More generally, they indicate a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through collaborative open-science approaches. To facilitate reuse and reproducibility, we adopted an open science approach by describing and sharing the hardware and software components and the experimental protocols. We also present results from a large cohort of mice trained in the task, demonstrating reproducible methods and reproducible results across laboratories. In all laboratories, most mice learned the task, although often at a different pace. After learning, they performed the task in a comparable manner, and with no significant difference across laboratories.
Regeneration and proper function of the digestive system are essential for the survival of most animals. In order to understand the mechanisms involved in these processes, it is necessary to have an atlas of gene expression and cell types. Here, we report the characterization of the intestinal transcriptome of Schmidtea mediterranea, a planarian flatworm that can regenerate all organs, including the gut. We used laser-capture microdissection ( LCM ) and RNA-seq to identify hundreds of genes with intestinal expression undetected by previous approaches. These genes are involved in metabolism, nutrient storage and transport, innate immunity, and other physiological roles, demonstrating considerable functional homology with digestive systems of other animals, including humans. Furthermore, we identified 22 intestine-enriched transcription factors, including several required for the production and/or maintenance of goblet cells. We found that depletion of goblet cells reduces planarians' willingness to feed and viability, with only negligible effects on regeneration of other intestinal cell types or non-intestinal tissues. We also identified two intestine-enriched transcription factors, gli-1 and RREB2, whose RNAi phenotypes suggest that distinct mechanisms govern differentiation and maintenance of goblet cells. These observations reinforce the evolutionary conservation of intestinal gene expression and indicate that physiological roles performed by multiple human digestive organs are consolidated in the planarian intestine. Finally, we have developed methods for applying laser-capture microdissection to planarian tissue, which we used to define gene expression and cell types in the intestine. Altogether, this work provides resources for further investigation of mechanisms involved in gastrointestinal function, repair, and regeneration.
Electric communication plays a crucial role in the social behavior of mormyrid fish, a group of weakly electric fish that produce a species-specific electric organ discharge ( EOD ) at variable interpulse intervals ( IPIs ). In this study, we describe a novel mechanism for peripheral sensory coding in which sensory receptors with spontaneous oscillatory activity respond to stimuli with phase resets that result in transient synchrony across the population. These oscillating receptors are tuned to much lower frequencies than the peak power frequencies of conspecific EODs and confer enhanced sensitivity to IPIs that can only be produced by groups of fish. Therefore, whereas spiking receptors are specialized for detecting signals from individuals, oscillating receptors appear specialized for detecting signals from a large group. This novel peripheral coding mechanism may represent an adaptation for detecting communication signals from large groups of fish. To test this hypothesis, we performed behavioral playback experiments in which we presented a single fish with a train of 10 conspecific EODs at constant IPIs. We found that a species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to submillisecond IPIs within the range of enhanced receptor sensitivity, whereas a species with spiking receptors did not. These findings provide the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony and suggest that different perceptual capabilities correspond to different receptor physiologies. We hypothesize that these divergent mechanisms represent adaptations for different social environments.
Bacteriophage BPP-1 is a virus that infects and kills Bordetella species, the causative agents of whooping cough in humans and respiratory diseases in other mammals. BPP-1 is a member of the Podoviridae family and has a T = 7l icosahedral capsid with a diameter of ∼670 Å. The capsid is composed of two types of proteins: the cement protein ( CP ) and the major capsid protein ( MCP ). In this study, we report the three-dimensional structure of the BPP-1 head at ∼3. 5 Å resolution determined by single-particle cryo electron microscopy ( cryoEM ). The atomic model of the BPP-1 head reveals two of the three characteristic folds of major virus lineages: jellyroll for the CP and HK97-like ( ‘Johnson’ ) for the MCP. Strikingly, the fold topology of MCP is non-circularly permuted from the Johnson fold topology previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. This new topology is likely the only feasible alternative of the old topology. In contrast to the covalent inter-protein linkages of the HK97 chainmail, β-sheet augmentation and electrostatic interactions contribute to the formation of non-covalent chainmail in BPP-1. Despite these complex interactions, the termini of both CP and MCP are ideally positioned for DGR-based phage-display engineering. The atomic description of the BPP-1 head will enhance bioengineering efforts, reveal non-covalent molecular interactions conducive of stable bacteriophage capsid formation, and clarify evolutionary relationships of BPP-1 MCP and CP with proteins in other viruses.
Dengue virus ( DENV ) is a mosquito-borne pathogen that cycles between mosquito and mammalian hosts. To understand how DENV populations adapt to these different host environments, we used serial passage in human and mosquito cell lines and estimated fitness effects for all single-nucleotide variants in these populations using ultra-deep sequencing. This allowed us to determine the contributions of beneficial and deleterious mutations to the collective fitness of the population. Our analysis revealed that the continuous influx of a large burden of deleterious mutations counterbalances the effect of rare, host-specific beneficial mutations to shape the path of adaptation. Beneficial mutations preferentially map to intrinsically disordered domains in the viral proteome and cluster to defined regions in the genome. These phenotypically redundant adaptive alleles may facilitate host-specific DENV adaptation. Importantly, the evolutionary constraints described in our simple system mirror trends observed across DENV and Zika strains, indicating it recapitulates key biophysical and biological constraints shaping long-term viral evolution. We find that adaptation relies on host-specific beneficial mutations that are clustered in specific regions of the DENV genome and enriched in regions of the proteome that exhibit structural flexibility. Notably, many beneficial mutations were clustered at a few specific locations in the genome, suggesting adaptation relies on hotspots of host-specific selection. To further analyze these ‘hotspots’ of adaptation we mapped the allele fitness values on the three-dimensional structure of dengue protein E, a well-studied transmembrane protein which forms the outermost layer of the viral envelope. Our findings quantify the cost of deleterious mutation across the dengue genome, highlighting how negative selection shapes diversity in viral populations.
KRasG12D, an active mutant of the KRas protein, exhibits distinct membrane diffusion and trafficking properties in U2OS cells. Using single-particle tracking with photoactivated localization microscopy ( spt-PALM ) and detailed trajectory analysis, we show that KRasG12D is partitioned into three distinct mobility states on the cell membrane. These states include an immobile state in ~70 nm domains, an intermediate mobility state in ~200 nm domains, and a fast diffusion state on the rest of the membrane. Importantly, the partitioning of KRasG12D into these three states remains invariant over a wide range of protein expression levels. This suggests that KRasG12D diffusion and trafficking through the three mobility states and associated nanodomains is in a maintained, homeostatic condition. The measured sizes of the immobilization and intermediate domains of KRasG12D are consistent with previous beliefs that nanoscopic membrane domains regulate Ras organization on the membrane. We propose a new model to describe the membrane dynamics of KRasG12D, where nested membrane nanodomains dictate the diffusion and trafficking, with implications in Ras multimer formation and signaling. Our work sheds new light on how complex nanodomains organize on the membrane to dictate Ras diffusion and trafficking. The insights gained here offer useful guidance to future experiments that aim at determining the molecular and structural identities of the Ras-associated membrane nanodomains and defining the mechanisms of Ras multimer formation and signaling.
Morphogen gradients of Bone Morphogenetic Proteins ( BMPs ) play a crucial role in patterning the dorsoventral ( DV ) embryonic axis of vertebrates and invertebrates. In vertebrates, the prevailing view for BMP gradient formation is through a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists, often along with ligand shuttling to generate peak signaling levels. However, the mechanism by which BMP ligands and antagonists shape this gradient in vertebrates is still unclear. In this study, we sought to delineate the mechanism of BMP gradient formation in zebrafish by precisely quantifying the BMP activity gradient in wild-type and mutant embryos and combining these data with a mathematical model-based computational screen to test hypotheses for gradient formation. Our analysis ruled out a BMP shuttling mechanism and a bmp transcriptionally-informed gradient mechanism. Rather than supporting a counter-gradient mechanism, our analyses support a fourth model, a source-sink mechanism, which relies on a restricted BMP antagonist distribution acting as a sink that drives BMP flux dorsally and gradient formation. We measured Bmp2 diffusion and found that it supports the source-sink model, suggesting a new mechanism to shape BMP gradients during development. Our study presents a new view of the mechanism that BMP antagonists and ligand use to establish the BMP signaling gradient patterning the DV axis in zebrafish.
Lysosomes are key organelles responsible for intracellular proteolysis and degradation of cellular waste. The export of low-molecular-weight catabolic end-products from lysosomes is mediated by polytopic transmembrane proteins that facilitate secondary active or passive transport. However, a number of lysosomal transporters remain poorly characterized. Here, we present a detailed analysis of MFSD1, a hitherto uncharacterized lysosomal family member of the major facilitator superfamily. MFSD1 is not N-glycosylated and contains a dileucine-based sorting motif needed for its transport to lysosomes. Mfsd1 knockout mice develop splenomegaly and severe liver disease. Proteomics of isolated lysosomes from Mfsd1 knockout mice revealed GLMP as a critical accessory subunit for MFSD1. MFSD1 and GLMP physically interact, and GLMP is essential for the maintenance of normal levels of MFSD1 in lysosomes and vice versa. Glmp knockout mice mimic the phenotype of Mfsd1 knockout mice. Our data reveal a tightly linked MFSD1/GLMP lysosomal membrane protein transporter complex. MFSD1 is endogenously localized in lysosomes under steady state conditions, is not N-glycosylated, and is ubiquitously expressed in murine tissues. Its transport to lysosomes is mediated by a dileucine-based sorting motif in the N-terminus. In order to determine the physiological functions of MFSD1, we generated Mfsd1 knockout mice. By means of differential proteomics of isolated liver lysosomes from wildtype and Mfsd1 knockout mice, we identified GLMP as an essential accessory protein for MFSD1. GLMP is a highly glycosylated lysosomal protein of so far unknown function. Deficiency of Mfsd1 leads to drastically reduced levels of GLMP and vice versa.
Microtubule-based transport by kinesin motors is essential for a wide range of vital processes in eukaryotic cells. Kinesin motors are powered by ATP hydrolysis and are responsible for transporting cargo along microtubules. To gain insight into this process, we developed atomic models for the no-nucleotide and ATP states of the monomeric kinesin motor domain on microtubules from cryo-EM reconstructions at 5–6 Å resolution. By comparing these models with existing X-ray structures of ADP-bound kinesin, we propose a mechanistic scheme in which microtubule attachment triggers a clamshell opening of the nucleotide cleft and accompanying release of ADP. Binding of ATP re-closes the cleft in a manner that tightly couples to translocation of cargo, via kinesin's ‘neck linker’ element. These structural transitions are reminiscent of the analogous nucleotide-exchange steps in the myosin and F1-ATPase motors and inform how the two heads of a kinesin dimer ‘gate’ each other to promote coordinated stepping along microtubules. This mechanism would allow microtubules to regulate kinesin's affinities for ADP and ATP by modulating the conformation of the switch loops, yielding an elegant structural basis for kinesin's nucleotide-binding behavior on and off microtubules.
Mitochondrial protein quality control ( QC ) is essential for maintaining the function of mitochondria. However, the QC pathways for misfolded mitochondrial proteins remain poorly defined. Here, we establish temperature-sensitive ( ts- ) peripheral mitochondrial outer membrane ( MOM ) proteins, sen2-1HAts and sam35-2HAts, as novel model QC substrates in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We show that these proteins are degraded from the MOM by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The ubiquitination of sen2-1HAts is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase ( E3 ) Ubr1, while sam35-2HAts is ubiquitinated primarily by San1. Mitochondria-associated degradation ( MAD ) of both substrates requires the SSA family of Hsp70s and the Hsp40 Sis1, providing the first evidence for chaperone involvement in MAD. In addition to a role for the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex, Doa1 and a mitochondrial pool of the transmembrane Cdc48 adaptor, Ubx2, are implicated in their degradation. This study reveals a unique QC pathway comprised of a combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors that distinguishes it from other cellular QC pathways. To date, the only ubiquitin ligases known to act on mitochondrial proteins in yeast are SCFMdm30 and Rsp5. However, the known mitochondrial substrates for these E3s are native proteins. We exploited two previously-identified yeast ts- alleles, sam35-2 and sen2-1, to elucidate how misfolded mitochondrial proteins are targeted for destruction. Generally, pathways converge post-ubiquitination, where the Cdc48-Npl4-Ufd1 AAA-ATPase complex and its associated co-factors facilitate unfolding and/or extraction of substrates from their natural environments prior to targeting to 26S proteasomes for degradation. We further assessed whether ubiquitin-modified forms of the ts- proteins were localized to mitochondria under conditions of proteasome impairment. Ubiquitinated sam35-2HAts and sen2-1HAts both accumulated largely in the mitochondrial pellet fraction and to a lesser extent in the soluble fraction, correlating with the relative distributions of unmodified species.
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK ) is a key effector of many growth signalling pathways in the epidermis and other tissues. ERK activation is triggered by the activation of epidermal growth factor receptors ( EGFRs ) through binding to their cognate ligands. Despite the significance of ERK activity regulation, technical limitations have obscured how growth signal activation is generated and propagated throughout the tissue. In this study, we exploited transgenic mice expressing a FRET biosensor of ERK and monitored ERK activity in epidermal cells at single cell resolution. Our long time lapse imaging of intact epidermis revealed radial propagation of ERK activity, where ERK activation originates from a few cells and propagates radially up to a radius of about 50 μm over 30 min until disappearance. We named this novel phenomenon as Spatial Propagation of Radial ERK Activity Distribution ( SPREAD ) and investigated its mechanism of ERK propagation and its role in cell cycle progression. We found that the frequency of SPREADs correlated with the rate of epidermal cell division. SPREADs and proliferation were stimulated by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate ( TPA ) in a manner dependent on EGFRs and their cognate ligands. At the wounded skin, ERK activation propagated as a trigger wave in parallel to the wound edge, suggesting that ERK activation propagation can be superimposed. Furthermore, by visualising the cell cycle, we found that SPREADs were associated with G2/M cell cycle progression. Our results provide new insights into how cell proliferation and transient ERK activity are synchronised in a living tissue.
The cyanobacterial circadian clock has been found to follow midday in both in vivo and in vitro conditions. The circadian clock is a biological oscillation that schedules daily changes in physiology and is generally driven by daily cues whose timing varies with the seasons. However, the principles that determine how circadian clocks align to these external cycles are not well understood. Here, we report experimental platforms for driving the cyanobacterial circadian clock both in vivo and in vitro. We find that the phase of the circadian rhythm follows a simple scaling law in light-dark cycles, tracking midday across conditions with variable day length. The core biochemical oscillator comprised of the Kai proteins behaves similarly when driven by metabolic pulses in vitro, indicating that such dynamics are intrinsic to these proteins. We develop a general mathematical framework based on instantaneous transformation of the clock cycle by external cues, which successfully predicts clock behavior under many cycling environments. This framework can be used to guide the design of experiments that probe the molecular origins of key mathematical features. The precisely defined nature of the cyanobacterial clock facilitates such experiments, but the model is general, so we expect it to be useful for other organisms as well. The core oscillator of the cyanobacterial circadian clock can be reconstituted in vitro from purified Kai proteins. We biochemically simulated seasonal effects in the reconstituted KaiABC oscillator by driving the Kai proteins with pulses of nucleotides on a 24 hr cycle, simulating in vivo metabolic conditions during day and night. Remarkably, this in vitro system shows a similar linear scaling of clock phase with simulated day length, indicating that core mechanisms for seasonal adaptation are intrinsic to the Kai proteins. The data reduction achieved in our linear model holds the promise of predicting the behavior of the circadian rhythms in many time-varying environments from a minimal data set that characterizes oscillator response, and may be applicable to clocks in many organisms.
Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) is one of the leading causes of premature death in the general population. Genome-wide association studies have identified the transcription factor Meis1 as a risk factor for SCD. We report that Meis1 inactivation in the mouse neural crest leads to an altered sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac rhythmicity in adults characterized by a chronotropic incompetence and cardiac conduction defects, thus increasing the susceptibility to SCD. We further demonstrate that this imbalance results from neurodevelopmental defects leading to sympathetic neurons apoptosis and position Meis1 as a novel actor in sympathetic neurons differentiation by its role in distal target-field innervation. We show that Meis1 is a major regulator of sympathetic target-field innervation and that Meis1 deficient sympathetic neurons die by apoptosis from early embryonic stages to perinatal stages. In addition, we show that Meis1 regulates the transcription of key molecules necessary for the endosomal machinery. Accordingly, the traffic of Rab5+ endosomes is severely altered in Meis1-inactivated sympathetic neurons. We demonstrate that Meis1 acts independently of the well-studied network of transcription factors governing early specification of sympathetic neurons to orchestrate later phases of neuronal differentiation. Our results further complement the study by Mahmoud et al. demonstrating Meis1 function in the regulation of neonatal cardiomyocytes mitosis especially following myocardial infarction. Finally, we highlight that loss of Meis1 function in early sympathetic neurons leads to an imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation of cardiac functions in adult mice resulting in increased susceptibility to SCD.
Biofilms are surface-attached communities of bacteria that display a wide range of morphologies. Although the structural and regulatory components required for biofilm formation are known, it is not understood how these constituents promote biofilm surface morphology. Using Vibrio cholerae as our model system, we show that mechanical instabilities, including wrinkling and delamination, underlie the morphogenesis program of growing biofilms. We also identify interfacial energy as a key driving force for mechanomorphogenesis because it dictates the generation of new and the annihilation of existing interfaces. Finally, we discover feedback between mechanomorphogenesis and biofilm expansion, which shapes the overall biofilm contour. The morphogenesis principles that we discover in bacterial biofilms, which rely on mechanical instabilities and interfacial energies, should be generally applicable to morphogenesis processes in tissues in higher organisms. We show here that mechanical instabilities, including wrinkling and delamination, underlie biofilm morphogenesis. Moreover, differences in interfacial energies drive mechanomorphogenesis by dictating the creation or annihilation of new or existing interfaces. Finally, feedback between mechanomorphogenesis and biofilm expansion shapes the overall biofilm contour. We suggest that biofilms could first wrinkle, and subsequently delaminate as growth gradually builds up compressive stress. According to this mechanomorphogenesis model, we should be able to change the biofilm topography by changing the spatial distribution of the mechanical stress. Our findings concerning the connections between a biofilm’s surface morphology and its mechanical and material properties suggest that new genes and/or new compounds that alter biofilm morphology by altering mechanics could be discovered and investigated to address biofilm-related problems.
The transcription factor NRSF (neuron-restrictive silencer factor) has been found to contribute to the development of epilepsy by selectively repressing a subset of target genes in the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in seizure generation. We have previously shown that interfering with NRSF function can attenuate the development of epilepsy. In this study, we investigated the role of NRSF in epileptogenesis and found that epilepsy-provoking seizures increased NRSF levels in the mature hippocampus by several fold. However, surprisingly, this increase in NRSF levels led to the repression of only a small subset ( ∼10% ) of potential NRSF target genes. These repressed genes were rescued when NRSF binding to chromatin was blocked, suggesting that NRSF is responsible for their repression. We also found that the genes selectively repressed by NRSF had mid-range binding frequencies to the repressor, a property that rendered them sensitive to moderate fluctuations in NRSF levels. These genes coded for ion channels, receptors, and other crucial contributors to neuronal function, suggesting that their repression may contribute to the pathogenesis of epilepsy. We used large-scale transcriptome arrays, qPCR validation, chromatin immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ), and gene set enrichment analysis ( GSEA ) to examine the basis of NRSF-dependent gene expression changes during epileptogenesis. Our results suggest that dynamic, selective regulation of NRSF target genes may play a role in influencing neuronal properties in both pathological and physiological contexts.
In the mammalian olfactory system, mitral cells ( MCs ) and tufted cells ( TCs ) are two classes of projection neurons in the olfactory bulb that are activated by olfactory sensory neurons ( OSNs ). MCs and TCs are thought to be involved in parallel processing of sensory information, but how local circuit activity creates stimulus selectivity in these parallel pathways remains poorly understood. Here, we have investigated the parallel pathways formed by MCs and TCs in mice and characterized the emergence of feature selectivity in these cell types via distinct lateral inhibitory circuits. We find differences in activity-dependent lateral inhibition between MCs and TCs that likely reflect newly described differences in the activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations show that these circuit-level differences allow MCs and TCs to best discriminate odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating that segregating information about different ranges of stimulus intensity may be an important function of these parallel sensory pathways. In the mammalian olfactory bulb, the firing of OSNs excites MCs and TCs, and differences in odor-evoked responses in MCs and TCs emerge due to differences in connectivity to OSNs and external tufted cells. The combination of activity-dependent lateral inhibition at both low and intermediate rates enables MCs and TCs to collectively encode odors better than either population alone and supports novel computations that are unlikely to occur with a single neuron type.
Allosteric modulation in monomers and oligomers of a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), specifically the M2 muscarinic receptor, has been compared to identify the molecular and supramolecular determinants of such effects. Allosteric interactions were monitored by means of a FRET-based sensor of conformation at the allosteric site and in pharmacological assays involving mutants engineered to preclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of allostery at the atomic level were examined in molecular dynamics simulations. Allosteric effects in monomers were exclusively negative and derived primarily from intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between the allosteric and orthosteric ligands. Allosteric effects in oligomers could be positive or negative, depending upon the allosteric-orthosteric pair, and they arose from interactions within and between the constituent protomers. The complex behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations. Allostery at the M2 muscarinic receptor has generally been understood in terms of interactions within a monomer, but this view disregards the tendency of GPCRs to form oligomers. Moreover, the oligomeric nature of the M2 receptor is evident in the multiphasic effects of allosteric ligands on the dissociation rate of orthosteric antagonists and their binding at equilibrium. To understand how a multimeric complex might account for allosteric behavior that resists explanation in terms of monomers, we have compared positive and negative allosteric modulators for their effects on oligomers and purified monomers of the M2 muscarinic receptor.
SETD2 is a histone methyltransferase that plays a crucial role in the cellular response to DNA double-strand breaks ( DSBs ). In this study, we show that SETD2 is required for the activation of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated ( ATM ) kinase, which is a key regulator of the DNA damage response ( DDR ). We also find that SETD2 is necessary for homologous recombination repair of DSBs by promoting the formation of RAD51 presynaptic filaments. In addition, we show that SETD2 is required for the recruitment of RAD51 to resected DNA 5′ ends and that SETD2-depleted cells show reduced homology-directed repair of DSBs. Our data further reveal that SETD2 is necessary for the DDR and that depletion of SETD2 impairs ATM activation and leads to delayed recruitment of 53BP1 to sites of DSBs. We also show that SETD2 mutations are found in several cancers, such as clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( ccRCC ), and that loss of SETD2 may afford an alternative mechanism for the inactivation of the p53-mediated checkpoint without the need for additional genetic mutations in TP53. We propose that SETD2 provides a chromatin bookmarking instrument that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs. In addition, we show that SETD2 is necessary for the recruitment of RAD51 to resected DNA 5′ ends and that SETD2-depleted cells show reduced homology-directed repair of DSBs. Our findings disclose an unprecedented role for a histone-modifying enzyme in priming intact chromatin for the response to DNA damage and provide a functional link between altered chromatin states and the mechanisms that maintain genome integrity.
Rasgrp1 is a Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor that plays a well-known role in thymic positive selection. Here, we identify a new role for Rasgrp1 in the cell-intrinsic regulation of peripheral CD4+ T cells. Rasgrp1Anaef is a mouse missense variant with an ENU-mutated EF hand in the Rasgrp1 Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor. Rasgrp1Anaef mice exhibit anti-nuclear autoantibodies and gradually accumulate a CD44hi Helios+ PD-1+ CD4+ T cell population that is dependent on B cells. Despite reduced Rasgrp1-Ras-ERK activation in vitro, thymocyte selection in Rasgrp1Anaef is mostly normal in vivo, although CD44 is overexpressed on naïve thymocytes and T cells in a T-cell-autonomous manner. We identify CD44 expression as a sensitive reporter of tonic mTOR-S6 kinase signaling through a novel mouse strain, chino, with a reduction-of-function mutation in Mtor. Elevated tonic mTOR-S6 signaling occurs in Rasgrp1Anaef naïve CD4+ T cells. CD44 expression, CD4+ T cell subset ratios and serum autoantibodies all returned to normal in Rasgrp1AnaefMtorchino double-mutant mice, demonstrating that increased mTOR activity is essential for the Rasgrp1Anaef T cell dysregulation.
Arid1a, a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, plays a critical role in maintaining acinar cell identity in the adult pancreas. In the presence of oncogenic Kras mutations, loss of Arid1a leads to rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) precursor lesions. In contrast, Arid1a silencing during embryogenesis, concurrent with KrasG12D activation, leads to retention of acinar cell fate. These results demonstrate that Arid1a is a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity and underscore an unanticipated influence of timing and genetic context on the effects of SWI/SNF complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis. In adult acinar cells harboring oncogenic Kras mutations, suppression of Arid1a accelerates acinar to ductal reprogramming and specification of mucinous PDAC precursor lesions that cannot be reversed by restoring endogenous Arid1a expression. Thus, our data suggest that Arid1a can provide a potent barrier to Kras-driven acinar to ductal metaplasia and early stage pancreatic neoplasia. Arid1a loss enables a non-reversible reprogramming of cell fate that is dependent on cellular and genetic context. We next sought to understand the mechanism whereby Arid1a regulates pancreas cell identity. Perturbation of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex is expected to impact the expression of SWI/SNF target genes. Indeed, our transcriptional and chromatin profiling data imply that Arid1a disruption, in the presence of oncogenic Kras, reduces the chromatin accessibility of key transcription factors to the enhancers of genes needed to sustain acinar cell fate.
Social isolation has a sex-specific effect on the biophysical properties of corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH ) neurons in the paraventricular nucleus ( PVN ) of the hypothalamus. CRH neurons are obligatory for launching the neuroendocrine response to stress. We report that brief social isolation ( <24 hr ) increases the first spike latency ( FSL ) and decreases the excitability of CRH neurons in preadolescent female mice, but not in age-matched male mice. By contrast, acute physical stress ( swim ) increases FSL in both group-housed females and single-housed males. The increase in FSL following either social isolation or acute physical stress is blocked by the glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, metyrapone, and mimicked by exogenous corticosterone. The increase in FSL results in a decrease in the excitability of CRH neurons. Our observations demonstrate that social isolation, but not acute physical stress, has sex-specific effects on PVN CRH neurons. We hypothesized that female mice, but not male mice, may interpret social isolation as a stress. To test this idea, we subjected single-housed male and female mice to an acute swim stress and assessed the intrinsic properties of CRH neurons. Our findings demonstrate that males and females react differently to some stressors but not others. Specifically, social isolation has definitive, CORT-dependent effects on CRH neurons in female, but not male mice. By contrast, both males and females show indistinguishable responses to an acute physical swim stress. Additionally, a prior social isolation occludes the effects of subsequent physical stress on FSL in females, but has no effect on FSL in males.
Mammalian hemoglobin ( Hb ) is a model protein for studying molecular adaptation in vertebrates. Although both the affinity and cooperativity of oxygen binding to Hb affect tissue oxygen delivery, only the former was thought to determine molecular adaptations of Hb. Here, we suggest that Hb affinity and cooperativity reflect evolutionary and physiological adaptations that optimized tissue oxygen delivery. We derived the relationship between the Hill coefficient and the relative affinity and conformational changes parameters of the Monod-Wymann-Changeux allosteric model and graphed the ‘biophysical Hill landscape’ describing this relation. We found that mammalian Hb cooperativity values all reside on a ridge of maximum cooperativity along this landscape that allows for both gross- and fine-tuning of tissue oxygen unloading to meet the distinct metabolic requirements of mammalian tissues for oxygen. Our findings reveal the mechanism underlying body size-related adaptation of mammalian Hb. We found that different mammalian Hbs exhibit different maximum nH values and that systematically higher maximum Hill values give rise to higher sensitivities to substrate unloading by MWC proteins. We hypothesize that the maximum cooperativity point of Hb has been tuned during evolution to satisfy the particular physiological requirements of different tissues for oxygen supply. Furthermore, we found that Hb in small-sized animals that display high metabolic rates presents lower affinity for oxygen than does the same protein in large-sized animals, again reflecting the adaptive adjustment of tissue oxygen unloading by Hb.
Plasmodium sporozoites are injected into the skin of a mammalian host by an Anopheles mosquito at the start of a malaria infection. The ability of sporozoites to locate and enter a blood vessel is a critical, yet poorly understood process. In this study, we examine the motility of sporozoites and their interaction with dermal blood vessels using intravital microscopy in mice. Our data suggest that sporozoites exhibit two types of motility: ‘avascular motility’ and ‘perivascular motility’. Avascular motility is characterized by high speed and less confinement in regions far from blood vessels, while perivascular motility is more constrained in the vicinity of blood vessels. We find that the curvature of sporozoite tracks engaging with vasculature optimizes contact with dermal capillaries. Imaging of sporozoites with mutations in key adhesive proteins highlights the importance of the sporozoite's gliding speed and its ability to modulate adhesive properties for successful exit from the inoculation site. The gliding motility of Plasmodium sporozoites is essential for their infectivity. Previous reports have observed sporozoite motility in the dermis, but an in-depth analysis of their motility over time has not been performed. Intravital imaging of sporozoites over the first 120 min after inoculation highlights significant changes in their motility in this time frame. These data demonstrate that sporozoite motility can change in response to environmental signals encountered by the sporozoite and suggest that sporozoites in the dermis exhibit two types of motility. Mutant sporozoites that display modest changes in motility pattern or speed have dramatic decreases in blood vessel invasion and infectivity. These data suggest that exit from the inoculation site presents an important barrier for the sporozoite and is therefore an opportune time to intervene.
Cells are organized into functional modules, which are composed of proteins that are not absolutely conserved across the tree of life. This suggests that cells can evolve to perform the same biological functions with different proteins. We evolved Saccharomyces cerevisiae for 1000 generations without the important polarity gene BEM1. Initially, the bem1∆ lineages rapidly increased in fitness and then slowly reached >90% of the fitness of their BEM1 ancestors at the end of the evolution. We sequenced their genomes and monitored polarization, revealing a common evolutionary trajectory with a fixed sequence of adaptive mutations, each improving cell polarization by inactivating proteins. Our results show that organisms can be evolutionarily robust to physiologically destructive perturbations and suggest that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions. We followed the evolutionary adaptation to the removal of an important component of the module that polarizes budding yeast cells. Cells recovered by following a reproducible evolutionary trajectory that could be largely explained by the interactions amongst the mutated genes and led to a substantial recovery in the speed and accuracy of cell polarization. In addition, bem1∆ cells often contain more than one polarity site, suggesting that the positive feedback that ensures a single site of polarization is weaker. Our results demonstrate that the multiple layers of regulation that allow cells to polarize rapidly and accurately also make it possible for them to adapt, by evolution, to very strong perturbations. Under strong selective pressure, the larger target size for mutations that inactivate proteins favors evolutionary trajectories that remove components from modules over those that quantitatively alter their properties.
The neural mechanisms of economic commitment in the human medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) have been investigated in a recent study. In this study, participants were presented with successive choices between goods or gambles that had lasting consequences, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. Here, participants decided whether to commit ( by acceptance or rejection ) to prospects that provided sustained financial return. The study found that BOLD signals in the rostral medial prefrontal cortex ( rmPFC ) encoded stimulus value only when acceptance or rejection was deferred into the future, suggesting a role in integrating value signals over time. By contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( dACC ) encoded stimulus value only when participants rejected ( or deferred accepting ) a prospect. dACC BOLD signals reflected two decision biases–to defer commitments to later, and to weight potential losses more heavily than gains–that ( paradoxically ) maximised reward in this task. These findings offer fresh insights into the pressures that shape economic decisions, and the computation of value in the medial prefrontal cortex. Previous studies have examined the neural mechanisms of economic behavior by offering participants a succession of independent gambles or unrelated consumer choices ( Daw et al., 2006; Plassmann et al., 2007; Lim et al., 2013 ). Here, we devised a task in which decisions involved commitment to an asset with enduring financial consequences. The aim of the current work was to understand the computational mechanisms by which economic commitments are made in humans, and to investigate their neural implementation in the reward circuitry of the medial prefrontal cortex. Commitments often follow a period of deliberation, during which items are considered but final acceptance or rejection is deferred to a later moment ( Shafir and Tversky, 1992; Shafir, 1993 ). In either case, however, it remains unknown whether this value difference coding depends on whether stimuli are accepted or rejected, because when deciding between two prospects, an option may be chosen either because it was preferred, or because the alternative was dispreferred. Moreover, it remains unknown how value encoding in the medial prefrontal cortex depends on whether decisions involve economic commitment or not. Here, thus, we investigated the neural mechanisms that accompany commitment ( acceptance, rejection ), and deferral ( failure to accept or reject ) during economic choice, using a multi-alternative choice task in which decisions had financial ramifications that persisted over prolonged episodes, and could not be reversed. In half of the blocks, participants had to choose between accepting ( inclusion by commitment ) and deferring acceptance of a prospect ( exclusion by deferral ). The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( dACC ) encoded value when a prospect was excluded ( not included ) while the rmPFC encoded value only during deferral ( not commitment ). Furthermore, joint consideration of the behavioural data and the dACC activity allowed us to pinpoint two pressures that shaped decisions in the task: a bias to defer until a later date, and a bias to weight unfavourable ( excluded ) options more heavily.
Paraspeckles are nuclear bodies that form around the long non-coding RNA, Neat1, and RNA-binding proteins. They are believed to control gene expression at a post-transcriptional level by retaining mRNAs containing inverted repeats of Alu sequences ( IRAlu ) in their 3’-untranslated regions ( 3’-UTRs ) within the nucleus. In this study, we found that all components of paraspeckles, including four major proteins and Neat1, display a circadian expression pattern in pituitary cells. Furthermore, the insertion of IRAlu at the 3’-UTR of the EGFP cDNA led to a rhythmic circadian nuclear retention of the egfp mRNA, which was lost when paraspeckles were disrupted. In contrast, the insertion of a single antisense Alu had only a weak effect. Using real-time video-microscopy, these IRAlu were further shown to drive a circadian expression of EGFP protein. This study shows that paraspeckles, thanks to their circadian expression, control circadian gene expression at a post-transcriptional level.
Presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels ( VGCCs ) are critical for converting electrical information into chemical communication at synapses. However, the molecular mechanisms that control VGCC function in the active zone of nerve terminals are poorly understood. Here, we show that Munc13, an active-zone protein essential for exocytosis, also controls VGCC function. We demonstrate that Munc13 interacts with VGCCs via a pair of basic residues in its C2B domain and that this interaction dictates VGCC behavior during various forms of activity. We show that elimination of this interaction by either removal of Munc13 or replacement of Munc13 with a Munc13 C2B mutant alters synaptic VGCC's response to and recovery from high-frequency action potential bursts and alters calcium influx from single action potential stimuli. These studies illustrate a novel form of synaptic modulation and show that Munc13 is poised to profoundly impact information transfer at nerve terminals by controlling both vesicle priming and the trigger for exocytosis. We also show that Munc13 enhances Ca2+ influx and modulates kinetic properties of VGCCs across a range of stimulation conditions. Our data strongly imply that this modulation is mediated by a direct VGCC-Munc13 interaction although we cannot exclude that synprint interaction site on Munc13 C2B influences interactions with other proteins in situ that in turn modulate VGCCs. To test for the possible significance of the Munc13–VGCC interaction, we examined the impact of removing Munc13 on action potential-driven calcium influx in nerve terminals. We show that expression of an shRNA targeting the major cortical isoforms Munc13-1 and Munc13-2 ( Munc13-KD ) led to a 94% or greater depletion of this protein at nerve terminals that results in complete block of exocytosis. The fact that VGCC failed to reactivate in 1. 2 mM extracellular Ca2+ WT cells but not in Munc13-KR/AA rescue suggests that the increase in exocytosis during 2 ms ISI paired pulses in Munc13-KR/AA is a direct effect of the lack of Munc13-VGCC interaction and not a secondary effect of reduced exocytosis. We therefore conclude that this interaction site in Munc13's C2B domain mediates VGCC channel reactivation in nerve terminals.
Plant cells in the epidermis of many plant species exhibit a complex, puzzle-like shape that has remained poorly understood in terms of its functional benefit. We propose that this shape emerges as an effective strategy to reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall of the epidermis. The epidermis is a tissue that grows isotropically, meaning that it grows equally in all directions, and as a result, cells in this tissue are subject to high levels of mechanical stress due to turgor pressure. Turgor pressure is the pressure exerted by water within plant cells, which can reach values of up to 10 bar in Arabidopsis leaf cells and up to 50 bar in specialized cells such as stomata. We hypothesize that the puzzle shape of epidermal cells provides a solution to this problem by preventing the formation of large, isodiametric cells that would bulge under the stress produced by turgor pressure. We tested this hypothesis by analyzing data from various plant organs and species, and by using simulation models to show that a mechanism actively regulating cellular stress plausibly reproduces the development of epidermal cell shape. Our results suggest that mechanical stress is a key driver of cell-shape morphogenesis, and that the puzzle shape of epidermal cells is an adaptation to a developmental constraint related to the mechanical forces that act on turgid plant cells in the epidermis.
Human pre-spliceosome assembly is a critical step in the splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs. Spliceosome assembly involves both cross-intron and cross-exon interactions, but how these processes work together to promote pre-spliceosome assembly has been unclear. In this study, we investigated how cross-intron and cross-exon processes jointly promote pre-spliceosome assembly in human nuclear extracts. We examined the dynamic interactions of single pre-mRNA molecules with individual fluorescently tagged spliceosomal subcomplexes. We found that U1 subcomplex bound to the 5' splice site of an intron acts jointly with U1 bound to the 5' splice site of the next intron to dramatically increase the rate and efficiency by which U2 subcomplex is recruited to the branch site/3' splice site of the upstream intron. The flanking 5' splice sites have greater than additive effects, implying distinct mechanisms facilitating U2 recruitment. This synergy of 5' splice sites across introns and exons is likely important in promoting correct and efficient splicing of multi-intron pre-mRNAs. We also established methods for observing the dynamics of spliceosomal subcomplexes on and the splicing of individual pre-mRNA molecules in human cell extract. The experiments reveal that the dynamics of U1 binding to the 5' splice site are largely unaffected by the presence of U2 binding sites positioned either downstream or upstream of the 5' splice site. We found that pre-spliceosomes can form on multi-intron pre-mRNAs through at least two different pathways. An intron can be recognized via cross-intron interactions leading directly to a catalytically active spliceosome, or via cross-exon interactions where the exons flanking an intron are first defined, after which cross-intron interactions between adjacent cross-exon complexes lead to spliceosome assembly.
Ubiquitin-dependent folding of the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6 is a novel folding assistance system that operates on membrane proteins from the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ). We show that LRP6 undergoes ubiquitination on a specific lysine, Lys-1403, which retains it in the ER while avoiding degradation. This ubiquitination is mediated by a ubiquitin-binding protein that acts as a chaperone and provides the protein with time to fold. If folding is successful, LRP6 is transported out of the ER, a step that is favored by palmitoylation. If folding is impaired or delayed, polyubiquitination of other cytosolic lysine residues takes over and targets LRP6 to ER-associated degradation ( ERAD ). This ubiquitination-deubiquitination assisted-folding cycle also appears to operate on other membrane proteins, such as CFTR and the anthrax toxin receptor 2 ( Capillary Morphogenesis gene 2, CMG2 ), which are involved in severe human diseases.
Neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities have been shown to be influenced by sex differences in cognitive processes. In particular, value-based decision making processes have been proposed to be influenced by sex differences. However, the overall correct performance in decision making tasks often shows variable or minimal differences across sexes. Here, we examine sex differences in mice in the latent variables underlying behavior in a classic value-based decision making task: a restless two-armed bandit. While male and female mice had similar accuracy, they achieved this performance via different patterns of exploration. Male mice tended to make more exploratory choices overall, largely because they appeared to get ‘stuck’ in exploration once they had started. In contrast, female mice tended to explore less but learned more quickly during exploration. Together, these results suggest that sex exerts stronger influences on decision making during periods of learning and exploration than during stable choices. We used a combination of computational modeling approaches to characterize sex differences in a canonical explore/exploit task. While males and females had similar performance, they used different latent explore-exploit strategies to learn about the dynamic environment. To understand how reward and reward omission differentially affect choice across sexes, we conducted post-hoc win-stay lose-shift analyses. We found that female mice displayed more win-stay behaviors, indicating that they were more likely than the males to repeat behaviors that produced reward on the previous trial. These results suggest that exploration during decision making is altered in people diagnosed with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing the neural mechanisms of exploration as a highly translational avenue for conferring sex-modulated vulnerability to neuropsychiatric diagnoses.
Endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation ( ERAD ) is a process by which membrane proteins are ubiquitinated, extracted from the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membrane, and degraded by the proteasome. However, the mechanism by which hydrophobic transmembrane ( TM ) segments are moved from the phospholipid bilayer into the cytosol, often together with hydrophilic and folded ER luminal protein parts, is not well understood. In this study, we show that the ubiquitin ligase Doa10 is a retrotranslocase that facilitates the extraction of membrane proteins from the ER. Doa10 is a 150 kDa protein with 14 transmembrane segments and is a member of the membrane-associated RING-CH ( MARCH ) family of ubiquitin ligases. Using a reconstituted system with purified proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we demonstrate that Doa10 is a retrotranslocase that cooperates with the cytosolic ATPase Cdc48 in the extraction of proteins with folded luminal domains. We show that the TM segment of a substrate protein interacts with the membrane-embedded domain of Doa10 and then passively moves into the aqueous phase. In contrast, the luminal substrate segments cross the membrane in an unfolded state, and their unfolding occurs on the luminal side of the membrane by cytoplasmic Cdc48 action. Our results reveal how a membrane-bound retrotranslocase cooperates with the Cdc48 ATPase in the extraction of membrane proteins from the ER.
Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling plays a crucial role in guiding development and maintaining adult tissue homeostasis in both invertebrates and vertebrates. Aberrant Hh signaling is a common cause of developmental birth defects and cancer, including holoprosencephaly, limb and digit abnormalities, medulloblastoma, and basal cell carcinoma. Hh proteins induce transcriptional changes in target cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Drosophila Ci or mammalian Gli proteins to nuclear transcriptional repressors and by activating the full-length Ci or Gli proteins. In Drosophila wing imaginal discs, Hh is expressed in posterior compartment cells and signals to a band of anterior cells at the anterior-posterior ( AP ) border with declining strength from posterior to anterior. Ci is expressed only in anterior cells, and its processing to a nuclear transcriptional repressor is required for Hh signaling. However, we used Ci variants expressed at physiological levels to investigate the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent Hh signaling in Drosophila wing imaginal discs. We found that Ci variants that cannot be processed supported a normal pattern of graded target gene activation and the development of adults with normal wing morphology, when supplemented by constitutive Ci repressor. This suggests that Hh can signal normally in the absence of regulated processing. Moreover, processing-resistant Ci variants were also significantly activated in the absence of Hh by elimination of Cos2, likely acting through binding the CORD domain of Ci, or PKA, revealing separate inhibitory roles of these two components in addition to their well-established roles in promoting Ci processing. These results show that wing patterning by Hh does not require regulation of the level of either repressor or full-length Ci protein by processing, and that Ci can mediate normal Hh morphogen action in wing discs in the complete absence of regulated processing.
Nociceptive information is relayed through the spinal cord dorsal horn, a critical area in sensory processing. This study used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate spinal interneurons that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin ( CR ). We show that these interneurons form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain enhanced excitatory signaling, and directly relay signals to lamina I projection neurons. Photoactivation of CR interneurons in vivo resulted in a significant nocifensive behavior that was morphine sensitive, caused a conditioned place aversion, and was enhanced by spared nerve injury. Furthermore, halorhodopsin-mediated inhibition of these interneurons elevated sensory thresholds. Our results suggest that dorsal horn circuits that involve excitatory CR neurons are important for the generation and amplification of pain and identify these interneurons as a future analgesic target. The results from this study confirm that CR neurons form an excitatory dorsal horn network that contributes to spinal pain signaling and can amplify pain signals in the absence of peripheral input. The strong interconnectivity of this neurochemically-defined subpopulation in the dorsal horn means they are ideally positioned to alter incoming sensory information prior to its relay to higher brain centers. This capacity is clearly demonstrated in the nocifensive responses elicited by spinal photostimulation. Importantly, however, our work has largely focused on characterizing CR microcircuits and establishing their functional roles in sensory experience by experimental activation using optogenetics. Future work must continue to determine how these circuits respond during peripherally evoked sensory processing, as we have here using halorhodopsin.
Mutations in the gene encoding Ras-associated binding protein 23 ( RAB23 ) cause Carpenter Syndrome, which is characterized by multiple developmental abnormalities including polysyndactyly and defects in skull morphogenesis. To understand how RAB23 regulates skull development, we generated Rab23-deficient mice that survive to an age where skeletal development can be studied. These mice exhibit premature fusion of multiple sutures and aberrant osteoprogenitor proliferation and elevated osteogenesis in the suture. We show that disruption of Rab23 leads to an upregulation of Pitx2, Fgf10 and Fgfr1b expression, decreased p38 and enhanced pERK1/2-RUNX2 signaling along with elevated osteoprogenitor proliferation. RAB23 regulates the sutural stem cell niche marker GLI1, represses Hedgehog ( Hh ) signaling, and inhibits osteoprogenitor expansion. RAB23 also represses FGF10-driven pERK1/2 signaling, which directly regulates osteoprogenitor development, RUNX2-mediated differentiation, and represses GLI1. Therefore, RAB23 coordinates suture biogenesis by regulating FGF-ERK1/2-RUNX2 activity, as well as the activation of GLI1. RAB23 coordinates suture morphogenesis and controls suture patency through three mechanisms: FGF10-pERK1/2 signaling, the repression of Hh targets through a canonical pathway, and through the repression of GLI1 by pERK1/2. We show that inhibition of elevated pERK1/2 signaling results in the normalization of osteoprogenitor proliferation with a concomitant reduction of osteogenic gene expression, and prevention of craniosynostosis. Our results suggest a novel role for RAB23 as an upstream negative regulator of both FGFR and canonical Hh-GLI1 signaling, and additionally in the non-canonical regulation of GLI1 through pERK1/2.
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 ( PRC2 ) is a conserved protein complex that maintains epigenetic repression of many genes in animals and plants. PRC2 modifies chromatin at its target genes, and these modifications can be inherited through cell division. However, it remains unclear whether this inheritance can direct long-term memory of individual gene expression states ( cis memory ) or if local chromatin states are dictated by the concentrations of diffusible factors ( trans memory ). To address this question, we exploited the classic epigenetic process of vernalization in Arabidopsis. Vernalization is the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure and is mediated by cold-induced epigenetic repression of the Polycomb target gene and floral repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C ( FLC ). We crossed FLC-mCherry to FLC-Venus plants to generate F1 hybrids carrying a single copy of each transgene. In a trans-based memory, the only possible heritable expression states of FLC-Venus/FLC-mCherry are ON/ON and OFF/OFF, because epigenetic information is stored as a diffusible signal. However, we show that one copy of FLC can be repressed while the other is active. Furthermore, this ‘mixed’ expression state is inherited through many cell divisions as plants develop. These data demonstrate that epigenetic memory of FLC expression is stored not in trans but in cis. FLC repression requires PRC2 but is independent of DNA methylation, making it a useful system for studying the cis-memory storage capability of Polycomb at a single gene. In vernalized plants, FLC expression is bistable, with the number of cells in which FLC is stably repressed increasing quantitatively with the duration of prior cold exposure.
BiP, the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) Hsp70 chaperone, forms oligomers of poorly understood structure and functional significance. Using site-specific proteolysis and crosslinking, we found that these oligomers consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate binding site of another. This interaction attenuates the chaperone function of oligomeric BiP. We also found a rapidly modulated reciprocal relationship between the burden of unfolded proteins and BiP oligomers, as well as slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently modified BiP. Lumenal ER calcium depletion caused rapid oligomerization of mammalian BiP and a coincidental diminution in substrate binding, suggesting that the oligomers are relatively inert. Thus, equilibration between inactive oligomers and active monomeric BiP is poised to buffer fluctuations in ER unfolded protein load on a rapid timescale. Our findings are consistent with a model whereby competition between oligomerization and substrate binding buffers the ER against rapid fluctuations in unfolded protein load in both directions.
Flexible filamentous viruses are a group of plant pathogens that have a significant impact on agriculture. These viruses are characterized by their non-enveloped, flexible rod-shaped virions that contain several hundred copies of a helically arrayed coat protein ( CP ) protecting a positive-sense single-stranded RNA ( + ) ssRNA. Here, we describe the near-atomic structure of Pepino mosaic virus ( PepMV ), a representative of the genus Potexvirus ( family Alphaflexiviridae ), at 3. 9 Å resolution using electron cryomicroscopy. Our results allow for the modeling of the CP and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP resembles that of nucleoproteins ( NPs ) from the genus Phlebovirus ( family Bunyaviridae ), a group of enveloped ( - ) ssRNA viruses. The main difference between potexvirus CP and phlebovirus NP is in their C-terminal extensions, which appear to determine the characteristics of the distinct multimeric assemblies – a flexuous, helical rod or a loose ribonucleoprotein. The homology between the CP of flexuous viruses and the NP of phleboviruses suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic ( + ) and ( - ) ssRNA viruses. We have also found a clear structural homology between the CP of flexuous viruses and the NP of the genus Phlebovirus, a group of enveloped viruses with a segmented ( - ) ssRNA genome. The NPs from phleboviruses are associated with the viral genome in loose ribonucleoproteins ( RNPs ) protected inside an envelope, in which inserted glycoproteins construct an icosahedral shell.
Antibody binding to cell surface proteins plays a crucial role in immunity, and the location of an epitope can determine the immunological outcome of a host-target interaction. However, existing techniques for epitope identification are costly, time-consuming, and unsuited for high-throughput analysis. To address this limitation, we have developed a method called SiteLoc for imaging-based molecular localization on cellular surface proteins. SiteLoc achieves nanometer-scale resolution by estimating the distance from a bound ligand to a reference surface using topological image averaging. This method is well suited for antibody binding site measurements on native cell surface morphology and can be applied to other molecular distance estimations as well. Our results show that SiteLoc can accurately estimate molecular heights on both spherical and non-spherical cellular surfaces. We demonstrate this by performing site localization measurements for ligands on bacterial M protein, which agree well with previously reported data. The antibody Fc binding site on M protein is located at the S region, and a non-specific monoclonal IgG antibody ( Xolair ) is used for site localization of this binding site. Our method can be useful for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines, as fast and efficient screening of epitope locations can greatly aid both mechanistic understanding and potential therapeutic development.
Systemic vascular pressure in vertebrates is regulated by a range of factors, one of which is peripheral resistance in tissue capillary beds. However, many aspects of the relationship between central control of vascular flow and peripheral resistance are unclear. In particular, the relationship between hypoxic response in individual tissues and the effect that response has on systemic cardiovascular adaptation to oxygen deprivation is not well understood. We show here how hypoxic response via the HIF transcription factors in one large vascular bed, that underlying the skin, influences cardiovascular response to hypoxia in mice. We show that the response of the skin to hypoxia feeds back on a wide range of cardiovascular parameters, including heart rate, arterial pressures, and body temperature. These data represent the first demonstration of a dynamic role for oxygen sensing in a peripheral tissue directly modifying cardiovascular response to the challenge of hypoxia. We show that peripheral resistance and oxygen sensing, in this case in the skin, plays an essential role in this systemic cardiovascular response. These data demonstrate that peripheral tissues can play a fundamental role in cardiovascular adaptation to hypoxia. We undertook an analysis of the effect of loss of hypoxia-responsive genes on the cardiovascular hypoxic response using the skin as a model for a peripheral tissue with a substantial vascular bed. We show that mice lacking HIF-1α, HIF-2α, NOS2 and Arg-1 expression in the epidermis show significant changes in systemic blood pressures and cutaneous temperatures relative to littermate control animals. We show for the first time that keratinocyte HIF-1α and HIF-2α expression affects the immediate, acute and chronic phases of the cardiovascular response to hypoxia. We propose a model for hypoxic responses involving HIF isoform activity and nitric oxide homeostasis in the skin that argues that hypoxia results in an initial HIF-1α/NOS2/NO mediated increase in vascular diameter, and resulting increases in perfusion; followed by a HIF-2α/Arginase-induced reduction of intracellular L-arginine.
Optogenetic methods for circuit mapping have been refined to enable measurements of functional synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution. By expanding a two-photon beam in the imaging plane using the temporal focusing method and restricting channelrhodopsin to the soma and proximal dendrites, we are able to reliably evoke action potentials in individual neurons, verify spike generation with GCaMP6s, and determine the presence or absence of synaptic connections with patch-clamp electrophysiological recording. Optical activation of single neurons using two-photon excitation of caged neurotransmitters or optogenetic probes such as channelrhodopsin ( ChR2 ) provides a powerful approach for assessing the synaptic connections of single neurons. In particular, optogenetic mapping utilizing ChR2 and the rapidly expanding family of opsin variants have increased the flexibility and precision of mapping paradigms. However, the ability to use optogenetic stimulation to selectively target single neurons remains challenging because the opsins are expressed throughout the dendritic and axon terminal fields, generating a potential confounding source of light-induced electrical responses. This study demonstrates that combining temporal focusing for two-photon activation of ChR2 with restriction of ChR2 expression to the soma and proximal dendrites of neurons yields a reliable method for evaluating synaptic connectivity with single-neuron resolution. The synaptic organization of individual neurons into circuits is the physiological basis for the interpretation of sensory input and production of behavioral responses. Understanding the precise patterns of connectivity among the distinct types of neurons that comprise neural circuits is critical for elucidating circuit function and ultimately requires methods that can map functional connectivity with single-cell resolution.
Transcription factors ( TFs ) Sox2 and Oct4 are proteins that bind to DNA to regulate gene expression. Their mode of interaction on eukaryotic genomes has been the subject of debate. Previous single-molecule data in living cells suggested that Sox2 and Oct4 bind to DNA in an ordered manner. However, a rigorous biophysical analysis of these data reveals that Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit negative reciprocity. This means that the expression of Sox2 increases the genomic binding of Oct4, but the expression of Oct4 decreases the genomic binding of Sox2. This is in contrast to ordered assembly, where Sox2 would assist Oct4 in binding to DNA. Instead, the data suggest that Sox2 and Oct4 sometimes help and sometimes hinder each other across the genome. This finding is unexpected and suggests that TFs like Sox2 and Oct4 exhibit different cooperativities at different genomic loci. The implications of this finding will need to be addressed in future studies. The most intriguing consequence of our analysis is the possibility of energy expenditure in the action of Sox2 and Oct4 on DNA. This has not previously been found in living cells and suggests unexpected complexity in how Sox2 and Oct4 interact on DNA. Single-molecule methods offer exciting capabilities for unravelling such mechanisms.
LPS is a bacterial endotoxin that plays an important role as an immune system infection cue. However, it remains unknown whether animals possess sensory mechanisms to detect LPS prior to infection. Here, we show that Drosophila melanogaster display strong aversive responses to LPS and that gustatory neurons expressing Gr66a bitter receptors mediate avoidance of LPS in feeding and egg laying assays. We found that the expression of the chemosensory cation channel dTRPA1 in these cells is necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. Furthermore, LPS stimulates Drosophila neurons in a TRPA1-dependent manner and activates exogenous dTRPA1 channels in human cells. Our findings demonstrate that flies detect bacterial endotoxins via a gustatory pathway through TRPA1 activation as a conserved molecular mechanism. We show that LPS is avoided during feeding and oviposition and that dTrpA1 expression in bitter-sensing gustatory neurons is necessary and sufficient for LPS avoidance. These data indicate that a TRPA1-dependent mechanism of avoidance of LPS may serve flies to prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Indeed, we found that control animals, but not dTrpA1-/- mutants, preferred laying eggs on control food, rather than on food contaminated with LPS. We also found that blocking neurotransmission in gustatory neurons by expressing the light chain of tetanus toxin abolished avoidance of LPS, indicating that flies can detect LPS through a gustatory mechanism. Our data demonstrate that fruit flies possess a gustatory mechanism underlying the detection and avoidance of LPS. The avoidance of LPS-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may serve to prevent Gram-negative bacterial infections, potentially compensating for the lack of adaptive immunity in these animals.
Zfp335 is a transcription factor that plays a crucial role in the maturation of naïve T lymphocytes. Naïve T cells are essential for immune function, but the mechanisms governing their maturation remain incompletely understood. We have identified a mouse mutant, bloto, that harbors a hypomorphic mutation in the zinc finger protein Zfp335. Zfp335bloto/bloto mice exhibit a naïve T cell deficiency due to an intrinsic developmental defect that begins to manifest in the thymus and continues into the periphery. This defect affects T cells that have recently undergone thymic egress. The effects of Zfp335bloto are multigenic and cannot be attributed to altered thymic selection, proliferation, or Bcl2-dependent survival. Zfp335 binds to promoter regions via a consensus motif, and its target genes are enriched in categories related to protein metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcriptional regulation. Restoring the expression of one target, Ankle2, partially rescues T cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp335 as a transcription factor and essential regulator of late-stage intrathymic and post-thymic T cell maturation. We have shown that Zfp335 regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes. We identify a set of Zfp335 target genes in thymocytes and present evidence that decreased Zfp335 occupancy at a subset of these targets alters gene expression in mutant thymocytes. Taken together, our findings provide evidence that Zfp335 functions as a transcription factor and key regulator of a transcriptional program required for T cell maturation.
mRNA:ncRNA avoidance is a global factor that can be harnessed to control protein expression levels in bacteria and archaea. It has been shown that mRNA abundances do not always correlate with protein abundance, and that some of the discrepancy can be accounted for by two important mRNA features: codon usage and mRNA secondary structure. In this study, we present a new global factor, mRNA:ncRNA avoidance, and provide evidence that it increases translational efficiency. We also demonstrate that there is a strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes, and that these interactions have a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or codon usage. By generating synonymously variant green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) mRNAs with different potential for mRNA:ncRNA interactions, we demonstrate that GFP levels correlate well with interaction avoidance. Therefore, taking stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein abundance. We find that for 97% of species, there is a reduced capacity for interaction between native RNAs relative to controls. Furthermore, by generating synonymously variant GFP mRNAs that differ in their potential to interact with core ncRNAs, we demonstrate that GFP expression levels can be both predicted and controlled. Our results demonstrate that there is strong selection for the avoidance of stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions across prokaryotes. We also find that stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions are significantly underrepresented in most ( 73% ) of the prokaryotic phyla. Our results clearly establish a signature of selection that acts to minimise stochastic mRNA:ncRNA interactions. However, with thousands of potential interacting RNA species in even simple prokaryotic systems, the complete avoidance of stochastic interactions is combinatorially unlikely. Therefore, there ought to be a tradeoff between avoidance and optimal expression. Our results indicate that crosstalk between mRNAs and ncRNAs can impact protein expression levels. We therefore predict that taking crosstalk into account will enable the design of constructs where protein expression levels can be precisely controlled.
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of both upper and lower motor neurons. A key pathological event in ALS is the denervation of neuromuscular junctions ( NMJs ), which is observed in both patients and animal models of the disease. However, it remains unclear whether NMJ denervation is the first manifestation of a globally degenerating motor neuron or if it arises from local branch-specific degeneration. To address this question, we used longitudinal in vivo imaging of single motor neuron axonal arbors and their NMJs over a three-month period in a mouse model of ALS ( SOD1G37R mice ). Our results show that single motor-units are dismantled asynchronously in the mouse model of ALS. We reveal that weeks prior to complete axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous new axonal sprouting resulting in synapse formation onto nearby NMJs. We also show that denervation events tend to propagate from the first lost NMJ, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. These results show that NMJ denervation in ALS is a complex and dynamic process of continuous denervation and new innervation rather than a manifestation of sudden global motor neuron degeneration. Our findings highlight a long temporal window between early branch-specific dismantling and global motor axon degeneration, which could be therapeutically exploited in ALS.
Estrogen receptor alpha ( ERα ) plays a crucial role in mediating the physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment in mice. Tamoxifen is a widely used adjuvant therapy for breast cancer patients, but long-term treatment is associated with undesirable side effects such as hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue. In this study, we show that mice undergoing tamoxifen treatment experience changes in body temperature, bone density, and movement. These changes are dependent on ERα, as conditional knockout of ERα in the hypothalamus and preoptic area ( hypothalamus-POA ) ablates or reverses tamoxifen-induced gene expression changes in the hypothalamus-POA. Furthermore, ERα-deficient mice do not exhibit tamoxifen-induced changes in body temperature, bone density, or movement. These findings provide mechanistic insight into the effects of tamoxifen on the hypothalamus-POA and indicate that ERα mediates several physiological effects of tamoxifen treatment in mice. We also show that ERα expression in the hypothalamus-POA is necessary for the tamoxifen-induced changes in gene expression in the hypothalamus-POA and the effects on thermoregulation, bone density, and movement. Together, these findings suggest that tamoxifen treatment modulates ERα signaling in the central nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of physiology and health.
ISG15 is an interferon-stimulated protein with anti-viral activity that has been shown to play a role in host defense against viral infections. However, the role of ISG15 during bacterial infections remains poorly understood. Here, we show that ISG15 expression is dramatically induced in nonphagocytic cells upon infection with Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive bacterium that causes listeriosis in humans. This induction of ISG15 is surprisingly independent of type I interferon signaling, which is a key component of the innate immune response against viral infections. Instead, ISG15 expression in response to Listeria infection depends on the cytosolic surveillance pathway, which senses bacterial DNA and signals through STING, TBK1, IRF3, and IRF7. We also show that ISG15 expression restricts Listeria infection in vitro and in vivo. Using stable isotope labeling in tissue culture ( SILAC ), we identified ISGylated proteins that could be responsible for the protective effect of ISG15 against Listeria infection. We found that infection or overexpression of ISG15 leads to ISGylation of ER and Golgi proteins, which correlates with increased secretion of cytokines known to counteract infection. Our data reveal a previously uncharacterized ISG15-dependent restriction of Listeria infection, reinforcing the view that ISG15 is a key component of the innate immune response.
Single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer ( smFRET ) is an adaptable method for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, the development of high throughput methodologies and the growth of commercial instrumentation has outpaced the development of rapid, standardized, and automated methodologies to objectively analyze the wealth of produced data. Here we present DeepFRET, an automated, open-source standalone solution based on deep learning, where the only crucial human intervention in transiting from raw microscope images to histograms of biomolecule behavior is a user-adjustable quality threshold. Integrating standard features of smFRET analysis, DeepFRET consequently outputs the common kinetic information metrics. Its classification accuracy on ground truth data reached >95% outperforming human operators and commonly used threshold, only requiring ~1% of the time. Its precise and rapid operation on real data demonstrates DeepFRET’s capacity to objectively quantify biomolecular dynamics and the potential to contribute to benchmarking smFRET for dynamic structural biology. DeepFRET is an all-inclusive analysis software with a pre-trained DNN at its core, for a rapid, objective, and accurate assessment of smFRET data for quantifying biomolecular dynamics. The fully automated analysis software operates with minimal crucial human intervention and requires only a threshold on the data quality confidence, as an initial step, to output detailed quantification of structural dynamic from raw images. DeepFRET comes as a free-to-use standalone executable for both Windows and Mac users allowing end-users with limited programming skills to easily operate it.
Polycomb repressive complex-1 ( PRC1 ) plays a crucial role in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression. SCML2 is a mammalian homolog of Drosophila SCM, a Polycomb-group protein that associates with PRC1. In this study, we show that SCML2A, an SCML2 isoform tightly associated to chromatin, contributes to PRC1 localization and also directly enforces repression of certain Polycomb target genes. SCML2A binds to PRC1 via its SPM domain and interacts with non-coding RNAs ( ncRNAs ) through a novel RNA-binding region ( RBR ). Targeting of SCML2A to chromatin involves the coordinated action of the MBT domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PRC1 through the SPM domain. Deletion of the RBR reduces the occupancy of SCML2A at target genes and overexpression of a mutant SCML2A lacking the RBR causes defects in PRC1 recruitment. These observations point to a role for ncRNAs in regulating SCML2 function and suggest that SCML2 participates in the epigenetic control of transcription directly and in cooperation with PRC1. In addition, our results show that RNA binding also plays a role in SCML2 function, as it is required for its localization to chromatin. We have identified a novel RBR in SCML2 that contributes to its chromatin localization. Along with the recognition of methylated lysines by the MBT domain, the RNA-binding activity of the RBR is required to recruit or stabilize SCML2 on chromatin. We propose that SCML2A is then retained at target genes through the interaction with PRC1 and that, in turn, SCML2A contributes to stabilizing PRC1. From this set of experiments, we conclude that SCML2 is recruited to a subset of target genes through a process that requires its RNA-binding activity and that the presence of mutant SCML2AΔRBR that is not chromatin-bound causes a partial release of BMI1 and, presumably, PRC1 from chromatin.
Ribosome stalling by the C-terminal arrest sequence of SecM is a major component of gene expression control in Escherichia coli. SecM regulates the SecA-dependent secretion pathway by stalling ribosomes at distinct elongation steps of the translation cycle. Here, we present two cryo-EM structures of the SecM-stalled ribosomes at 3. 3–3. 7 Å resolution. These structures reveal two different stalling mechanisms at distinct elongation steps: one is due to the inactivation of the ribosomal peptidyl-transferase center ( PTC ), which inhibits peptide bond formation with the incoming prolyl-tRNA; the other is the prolonged residence of the peptidyl-RNA at the hybrid A/P site, which inhibits the full-scale tRNA translocation. These results demonstrate an elegant control of the translation cycle by regulatory peptides through a continuous, dynamic reshaping of the functional center of the ribosome. Our analysis of ribosome–SecM interactions at near-atomic level reveals two different mechanisms of stalling and provides rich details for how SecM nascent peptide could modulate the translation in distinct steps. Our structural data of the two predominant forms of stalled ribosomes, one in post-state and the other in hybrid rotated state, indicate that a collection of interactions between SecM and the exit tunnel cooperatively induce conformational changes of the PTC, leading to translation arrest at distinct elongation steps, including peptide-bond formation and tRNA translocation.
Human foveal cone photoreceptor topography and its dependence on eye length was investigated in a study that used a new generation Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope to image cones at and near the fovea in 28 eyes of 16 subjects. Cone density and other metrics were computed in units of visual angle and linear retinal units. The study found that the foveal cone mosaic in longer eyes is expanded at the fovea, but not in proportion to eye length. Despite retinal stretching, myopes generally have a higher angular sampling density in and around the fovea compared to emmetropes. This offers the potential for better visual acuity in myopes. Reports of deficits in best-corrected foveal vision in myopes compared to emmetropes cannot be explained by increased spacing between photoreceptors caused by retinal stretching during myopic progression. The study provides the first measures of foveal cone density as a function of axial length in living eyes and discusses the physical and visual implications of these findings.
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive disease in infants, especially in low-income settings. Asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx is a prerequisite for disease, but variability in its duration is currently only understood at the serotype level. Here we developed a model to calculate the duration of carriage episodes from longitudinal swab data, and combined these results with whole genome sequence data. We estimated that pneumococcal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the phenotype variation, whereas the host traits considered here ( age and previous carriage ) accounted for less than 5%. We further partitioned this heritability into both lineage and locus effects, and quantified the amount attributable to the largest sources of variation in carriage duration: serotype ( 17% ), drug-resistance ( 9% ) and other significant locus effects ( 7% ). A pan-genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences as being associated with decreased carriage duration independent of serotype, potentially by disruption of the competence mechanism. These findings support theoretical models of pneumococcal competition and antibiotic resistance. We found that despite a range of other factors such as host age which are known to cause carriage duration to differ, sequence variation of the pneumococcal genome explains most of this variability ( 63% ). Common serotypes and resistance to erythromycin cause some of this effect ( 19% total ), as does the presence or absence of particular prophage sequence in the genome. We provide a quantitative estimate of how closely transmission pairs share their carriage duration, and show evidence for differences both between and within serotypes. The implication of phage as having a significant effect on carriage duration has interesting corollaries on pneumococcal genome diversification through frequent infection and loss of prophage, even during carriage episodes in this dataset.
Cardiac repolarization is determined in part by the slow delayed rectifier current ( IKs ), which is conducted by the tetrameric voltage-gated ion channel, KCNQ1, and its β-subunit, KCNE1. The stoichiometry between α and β-subunits has been controversial, with studies reporting either a strict 2 KCNE1:4 KCNQ1 or a variable ratio up to 4:4. We used IKs fusion proteins linking KCNE1 to one ( EQ ), two ( EQQ ) or four ( EQQQQ ) KCNQ1 subunits to reproduce compulsory 4:4, 2:4 or 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole cell and single-channel recordings showed EQQ and EQQQQ to have increasingly hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter first latency of opening compared to EQ, all abolished by the addition of KCNE1. As well, using a UV-crosslinking unnatural amino acid in KCNE1, we found EQQQQ and EQQ crosslinking rates to be progressively slowed compared to KCNQ1, which demonstrates that no intrinsic mechanism limits the association of up to four β-subunits within the IKs complex.
Inflammation is a double-edged sword in the context of tissue regeneration. On the one hand, it is required for proper tissue repair and regeneration. On the other hand, excessive inflammation can lead to tissue damage and impair regeneration. In this study, we have elucidated the role of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 beta ( Il1b ) in zebrafish fin fold regeneration. We have shown that Il1b is expressed by epithelial cells in response to tissue injury, and that its prolonged expression leads to apoptosis of regenerative cells. We have further shown that macrophages are responsible for attenuating Il1b expression and resolving inflammation, and that they play a critical role in tissue regeneration by regulating the expression of regeneration-induced genes. We have demonstrated that a proper level of Il1b expression and inflammatory response, which are tuned by macrophages, is necessary for progression of tissue regeneration. Our study highlights the function of Il1b and the inflammatory response in tissue regeneration. We have shown that Il1b plays an indispensable role in normal tissue regeneration by activating expression of regeneration-induced genes, and that excessive Il1b signaling and inflammation can lead to apoptosis of regenerative cells. We have also shown that myeloid cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages, are essential for survival of regenerative cells, and that macrophages play a critical role in tissue regeneration by attenuating Il1b expression and resolving inflammation.
Proteins in the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells, such as Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, and Haloferax volcanii, have been found to have their translational diffusion coefficients dependent on their surface properties and the ionic strength of the cytoplasm. In E. coli, we find that proteins with a positive net charge diffuse up to 100-fold slower than those with a negative net charge. This effect is weaker in L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in diffusion coefficient is mainly caused by the binding of positive proteins to ribosomes, with dissociation constants ( KD ) on the order of micromolar. This suggests that non-specific interactions between proteins and ribosomes are not necessarily weak. In E. coli, the diffusion coefficients of proteins depend on their net charge and the distribution of charge over the protein surface. The diffusion becomes even slower when cells are exposed to an osmotic upshift. In L. lactis and Hfx. volcanii, not only do positive proteins diffuse slowly, but their binding to ribosomes might also inhibit protein synthesis by affecting the assembly or activity of ribosomes. We find that 18 ribosomal proteins in E. coli have a net charge of more than +10, and if the findings on GFP are transferable to ribosomal proteins, then these ribosomal proteins experience a drop in diffusion coefficient of more than 5-fold. To determine the consequences of our findings, we analyzed the proteomes of E. coli, L. lactis, Hfx. volcanii, and four endosymbiotic bacteria. We determined how a protein will diffuse in light of the composition of the proteome, for which we need to know both the net charges and the abundances of all proteome components. We also determined how the ribosomes affect the diffusion of the proteome constituents, for which we need to know the net charge of the proteins.
Regeneration is a widespread phenomenon in the animal kingdom, but the mechanisms that activate regeneration remain poorly understood. Planarians are capable of whole-body regeneration and mount distinct molecular responses to wounds that result in tissue absence and those that do not. In this study, we describe the role of a follistatin homolog, Smed-follistatin, in planarian regeneration. We show that Smed-follistatin is required for planarians to mount a regenerative response following injuries that result in tissue absence, but not for normal tissue turnover. We also identify two activin homologs, Smed-activin-1 and Smed-activin-2, as required for the Smed-follistatin phenotype. Finally, we show that Smed-follistatin is wound-induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries that cause tissue absence. These data suggest that Smed-follistatin inhibits Smed-activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence. We propose that wound-induced expression of Smed-follistatin allows for regenerative responses to be initiated specifically as a consequence of tissue absence. Smed-follistatin is the first gene known to be required for regeneration-specific responses in planarians. However, not all missing-tissue responses are abolished following Smed-follistatin inhibition. For example, neoblast migration to amputation sites occurred normally in Smed-follistatin ( RNAi ) animals, despite the absence of a normal proliferative response. These data suggest that Smed-follistatin inhibits Smed-activin proteins to trigger regeneration specifically following injuries involving tissue absence and identify a mechanism critical for regeneration initiation, a process important across the animal kingdom.
Microsatellite instability ( MSI ) is a hallmark of mismatch repair ( MMR ) -deficient tumors. MMR deficiency leads to DNA replication errors that accumulate as indel mutations in mono- and di-nucleotide repeats in tumor tissue, but not in normal surrounding tissue. Here, we show that MMR-deficient tumors have a unique mutation signature that is distinct from other tumor genomes, but surprisingly similar to germ-line DNA. This suggests that a substantial fraction of human genetic variation arises through mutations that escape MMR. We also identify a large set of recurrent indels that may serve to detect MSI. Using endometrial tumors with immunohistochemically proven MMR deficiency, we optimize a novel marker set capable of detecting MSI and show it to have greater specificity and selectivity than standard MSI tests. Moreover, we show that recurrent indels are enriched for the ‘DNA double-strand break repair by homologous recombination’ pathway. Consequently, DNA double-strand break ( DSB ) repair is reduced in MMR-deficient tumors, triggering a dose-dependent sensitivity of MMR-deficient tumor cultures to DSB inducers.
Magnets are a class of light-inducible dimerization protein modules engineered from the Neurospora crassa photoreceptor Vivid. These modules enable precise temporal and spatial control of biological processes in a non-invasive fashion. Magnets consist of two components, nMag ( negative Magnet ) and pMag ( positive Magnet ), which are well-tolerated as protein fusion partners and are photoreceptors requiring simultaneous photoactivation to interact. This enables high spatiotemporal confinement of dimerization with a single excitation wavelength. However, Magnets require concatemerization for efficient responses and cell preincubation at 28°C to be functional. To overcome these limitations, we engineered an optimized Magnets pair that requires neither concatemerization nor low temperature preincubation. These ‘enhanced’ Magnets ( eMags ) were validated by using them to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, to induce organelle contacts, and to reconstitute OSBP-VAP ER-Golgi tethering implicated in phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate transport and metabolism. eMags represent a very effective tool to optogenetically manipulate physiological processes over whole cells or in small subcellular volumes. The resulting reagents, ‘enhanced Magnets’ ( eMags ), have greater thermal stability and dimerization efficiency, as well as faster association and dissociation kinetics. We confirmed their effectiveness in a variety of applications including protein recruitment to different organelles, the generation/expansion of organelle contact sites, and the rapid and reversible reconstitution of VAP-dependent inter-organelle tethers that have key regulatory functions in lipid transport.
Activation of GCN2 Kinase by Ribosome Stalling Links Translation Elongation with Translation Initiation  
    Ribosome stalling during translation has been shown to cause neurodegeneration, but the signaling pathways triggered by stalled elongation complexes are unknown. We investigated these pathways by analyzing the brain of C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice in which neuronal elongation complexes are stalled at AGA codons due to deficiencies in a tRNAArgUCU tRNA and GTPBP2, a mammalian ribosome rescue factor. We detected increased levels of phosphorylation of eIF2α ( Ser51 ) prior to neurodegeneration in these mice. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated activation of ATF4, a key transcription factor in the integrated stress response ( ISR ) pathway. Genetic experiments showed that this pathway was activated by the eIF2α kinase, GCN2, in an apparent deacylated tRNA-independent fashion. Furthermore, we found that the ISR attenuates neurodegeneration in C57BL/6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice, underscoring the importance of cellular and stress context on the outcome of activation of this pathway. These results demonstrate the critical interplay between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during cellular stress. We show that GCN2 is activated in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mutant brain in a tRNAdeacyl-independent manner prior to the onset of neurodegeneration. Activation of this kinase results in eIF2α phosphorylation and induction of ATF4-target genes in the cerebellum and hippocampus of B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- mice. Our genetic studies demonstrate that GCN2 activation functions to attenuate neurodegeneration in the B6J-Gtpbp2nmf205-/- brain. These results suggest that ribosome stalling activates GCN2 as a previously unknown regulatory mechanism that links the elongation and initiation steps of translation.
Adult height has changed substantially and unevenly in the world’s countries over the past century. We reanalysed 1472 population-based studies with measurement of height on more than 18. 6 million participants to estimate mean height for people born between 1896 and 1996 in 200 countries. The largest gain in adult height over the past century has occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20. 2 cm and 16. 5 cm taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan African countries and in South Asia over the century of analysis. The tallest people over these 100 years are men born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, whose average heights surpassed 182. 5 cm, and the shortest were women born in Guatemala in 1896 ( 140. 3 cm; 135. 8–144. 8 ). The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was 19–20 cm a century ago, and has remained the same for women and increased for men a century later despite substantial changes in the ranking of countries.
Opioid-induced respiratory depression (OIRD) is a major cause of death in the United States, with the number of opioid overdose deaths quadrupling between 1999 and 2017. To better understand the neural mechanisms underlying OIRD, we investigated the effects of opioids on breathing in mice. We found that opioids depress breathing through two primary sites in the brainstem: the preBötzinger Complex ( preBötC ), where the breathing rhythm originates, and the solitary nucleus. We used genetic tools to reveal that just 70–140 neurons in the preBötC are responsible for its sensitivity to opioids. These neurons are glutamatergic and express the µ-Opioid receptor ( Oprm1 ). We also found that just 50 Dbx1/FOXP2 and 20 FOXP2 neurons in the preBötC are sufficient to rescue opioid depression of the preBötC rhythm. We hypothesize that opioids are primarily acting by silencing presynaptic release, effectively removing these neurons from the network. Alternatively, it is proposed that just a small subset of preBötC excitatory neurons may generate the inspiratory rhythm, and perhaps these key Oprm1 neurons are enriched within this subgroup. We found that Oprm1 is broadly expressed in both the central and peripheral nervous systems, including sites that could modulate breathing. We also found that the combined deletion of µ-Opioid receptor from both sites essentially eliminates OIRD, even to extremely high doses of the potent opioid fentanyl. This suggests that targeting just these two sites is sufficient to rescue opioid respiratory depression. We interpret the small remaining effect of opioids we observe to be due to incomplete transduction of these brain areas but cannot rule out other minor contributing sites.
Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) and its satellite virus, hepatitis D virus ( HDV ), are major causes of liver disease worldwide. HBV infection is a major public health problem, and co-infection with HDV is associated with more severe disease. Both HBV and HDV use HBV envelope proteins to enter liver cells. The pre-S1 domain of the HBV envelope protein is a key determinant for receptor binding, but the identity of the receptor has been unknown. Here, we show that sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide ( NTCP ) is a functional receptor for both HBV and HDV. NTCP is a multiple transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. We used near zero distance photo-cross-linking and tandem affinity purification to reveal that the receptor-binding region of the pre-S1 domain of the HBV envelope protein specifically interacts with NTCP. Silencing NTCP inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NTCP expression rendered nonsusceptible hepatocarcinoma cells susceptible to these viral infections. Moreover, replacing amino acids 157–165 of nonfunctional monkey NTCP with the human counterpart restored its ability to support both viral infections. These results demonstrate that NTCP is a functional receptor for HBV and HDV, and that residues between 157 and 165 of NTCP are crucial for binding to the receptor-binding region of the pre-S1 domain of the HBV envelope protein.
Sepsis leads to long-lasting changes in the phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in protecting the body against infections. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's response to an infection becomes uncontrolled and causes widespread inflammation. While early treatment of sepsis has improved survival rates, those who survive can enter a state of chronic immunoparalysis, characterized by a decrease in the number of immune cells, including memory CD8 T cells, and impaired immune function. Memory CD8 T cells are important for providing long-term immunity against infections by rapidly recognizing and killing infected cells and producing cytokines to coordinate the immune response. However, sepsis can impair the function of memory CD8 T cells, making individuals more susceptible to re-infection. In the present study, we demonstrate that sepsis leads to a lasting change in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell compartment in sepsis survivors. This occurs as a result of increased proliferation of central memory CD8 T cells ( TCM ) in the lymphopenic environment that occurs after sepsis. TCM have a higher proliferative capacity than effector memory CD8 T cells ( TEM ), and this bias toward TCM alters the localization of memory CD8 T cells in the body. We also show that pre-existing memory CD8 T cells numerically recover with time after sepsis, potentially due to increased proliferation in response to the sepsis-induced lymphopenic environment. However, this recovery is accompanied by changes in the transcriptional profile and chromatin accessibility of memory CD8 T cells, indicating long-lasting T cell intrinsic changes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that sepsis-induced changes in the composition of the memory CD8 T cell pool and transcriptional landscape culminate in altered T cell function and reduced capacity to control L. monocytogenes infection. Thus, sepsis leads to long-term alterations in memory CD8 T cell phenotype, protective function, and localization, potentially changing the host's capacity to respond to re-infection.
APOBEC3A ( A3A ) is a potent inhibitor of LINE-1 ( L1 ) retrotransposition, a mutagenic threat to human genomes. L1 retrotransposition is a process by which L1 elements, a family of retrotransposons, integrate into new genomic locations. A3A is a member of the APOBEC3 gene family, which consists of seven enzymes that catalyze the deamination of cytidine nucleotides to uridine nucleotides ( C-to-U ) in single-strand DNA substrates. Although A3A is the most potent inhibitor of L1 retrotransposition in cultured cell assays, the molecular mechanism by which it inhibits L1 retrotransposition has remained enigmatic. Previous characterization of L1 retrotransposition events generated in the presence of A3A did not yield evidence of deamination. Here, we have used in vitro and in vivo assays to demonstrate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration. These data provide a mechanistic explanation of how the A3A cytidine deaminase protein can inhibit L1 retrotransposition. We further demonstrate that engineered L1 retrotransposition events derived from cultured human cells that co-express A3A and the uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor protein ( UGI ) contain strand-specific, A3A-mediated C-to-U deamination events. Together, these data indicate that A3A can inhibit L1 retrotransposition by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA that arises during the process of L1 integration.
Rem2 is a non-canonical Ras-like GTPase that plays an important role in regulating neuronal excitability and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience. We investigated the role of Rem2 in visual circuit plasticity and found that Rem2-/- mice fail to exhibit normal ocular dominance plasticity during the critical period. At the cellular level, our data establish a cell-autonomous role for Rem2 in regulating intrinsic excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons, prior to changes in synaptic function. Consistent with these findings, both in vitro and in vivo recordings reveal increased spontaneous firing rates in the absence of Rem2. Our data indicate that Rem2 functions at the nexus of a signaling network that senses and responds to changes in neuronal activity in order to preserve proper circuit function in the face of changing sensory experience. In the future, defining these Rem2-dependent signaling mechanisms will elucidate the molecular mechanisms that instruct activity-dependent modifications of neural circuitry. Our findings raise the possibility that Rem2 may play an important role in regulating the absolute responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation, such as through regulation of neuronal excitability or synaptic scaling. In order to gain more insight into the circuit mechanisms that might underlie the observed ocular dominance plasticity deficits of Rem2-/- mice, we went on to examine adult ocular dominance plasticity. Our findings that Rem2 functions as a regulator of experience-dependent plasticity at the morphological, cellular and circuit levels provide an important step forward in connecting molecular regulators of neuronal morphology with broader circuit function.
Magnetogenetics is an emerging field that aims to engineer cells to be responsive to magnetic fields for the purpose of controlling their activity. Recent reports have suggested that magnetic fields can be used to modulate membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion channel protein and then tugging the ferritin or heating it with a magnetic field ( Stanley et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2016; Qin et al., 2016 ). However, I argue that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics. The forces or torques or temperatures produced by magnetic fields are too small by many orders of magnitude for the desired effects on molecular orientation or on membrane channels. If the phenomena occurred as described, they must rely on some entirely different mechanism. Barring dramatic new discoveries about the structure of biological matter, the proposed routes to magnetogenetics based on either pulling or heating a ferritin/channel complex with magnetic fields have no chance of success. This is because ferritin is a large protein complex with 24 subunits that forms a spherical shell about 12 nm in diameter. The paramagnetic nature of protein complexes is found to seriously limit their utility for engineering magnetically sensitive cells. The forces or torques or temperatures produced by magnetic fields are too small by many orders of magnitude for the desired effects on molecular orientation or on membrane channels. If the phenomena occurred as described, they must rely on some entirely different mechanism. The report by Wheeler et al. ( 2016 ) describes the design of a molecular system intended to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the cell membrane. Their single-component protein consists of a putative mechano-sensitive cation channel ( TRPV4 ) fused on the intracellular face to two subunits of ferritin. The hope was that “the paramagnetic protein would enable magnetic torque to tug open the channel to depolarize cells”. Indeed, the report includes experimental results from several preparations suggesting that neural activity can be modulated by static magnetic fields.
Neuroblasts are a type of stem cell in Drosophila that can self-renew, differentiate, or enter quiescence. Quiescence is a state of dormancy that is poorly understood, but is highly relevant for stem cell-based therapeutics. In this study, we show that the differentiation factor Prospero is transiently detected at low levels in the neuroblast nucleus just prior to entry into quiescence. We find that loss of Prospero prevents entry into quiescence, whereas a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero drives proliferating larval neuroblasts into quiescence. We propose that Prospero levels distinguish three progenitor fates: absent for self-renewal, low for quiescence, and high for differentiation. We show that nearly all of the neuroblasts that were quiescent at 12 hr after induction had reactivated proliferation and re-expressed progenitor markers. In addition, precocious low level nuclear Prospero could advance the timing of NB3-3T quiescence. We conclude that transient, low-level nuclear Prospero is sufficient to induce neuroblast quiescence. Furthermore, we show that a pulse of nuclear Prospero precisely matches the timing of neuroblast quiescence: it occurs earlier in pdm mutants, and later in cas mutants. We conclude that a pulse of low level nuclear Prospero marks neuroblast entry into quiescence, suggesting a functional relationship.
Uncoating of the HIV-1 capsid is a tightly regulated disassembly process that is required for the release of the viral cDNA prior to nuclear import. To understand the intrinsic capsid disassembly pathway and how it can be modulated, we have developed a single-particle fluorescence microscopy method to follow the real-time uncoating kinetics of authentic HIV capsids in vitro immediately after permeabilizing the viral membrane. Our results show that the opening of the first defect in the lattice is the rate-limiting step of uncoating, which is followed by a rapid and catastrophic collapse of the capsid. The capsid-binding inhibitor PF74 accelerates capsid opening but stabilizes the remaining lattice. In contrast, binding of a polyanion to a conserved arginine cluster in the lattice strongly delays initiation of uncoating but does not prevent subsequent lattice disassembly. Our observations suggest that different stages of uncoating can be controlled independently with the interplay between different capsid-binding regulators likely to determine the overall uncoating kinetics. We have developed an in vitro single-molecule fluorescence imaging assay that allows us to follow the uncoating kinetics of hundreds of individual HIV capsids in a single experiment. This type of single-molecule analysis has the advantage that it can resolve intermediates in the disassembly pathway that are otherwise averaged out in traditional ensemble assays. We observed that the integrity and stability of capsids in a population is highly heterogeneous, whereby the majority of capsids contain defects and/or uncoat immediately after removal of the viral membrane. In the absence of capsid binders, uncoating is an all-or-none process that proceeds rapidly after the first defect is created. The half-life of the HIV capsid is sufficiently long to use PFO-permeabilized viral particles as a platform to quantify the binding of labeled proteins to authentic viral capsids at the single-particle level.
The cJUN NH2-terminal kinase ( JNK ) signaling pathway is known to promote cell proliferation by activating the AP1 transcription factor. However, the role of JNK signaling in breast cancer development has been unclear. In this study, we examined the effect of JNK deficiency in the murine breast epithelium and found that loss of JNK signaling caused genomic instability and the development of breast cancer. Moreover, JNK deficiency caused widespread early neoplasia and rapid tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer. This tumor suppressive function was not mediated by a role of JNK in the growth of established tumors, but by a requirement of JNK to prevent tumor initiation. Together, these data identify JNK pathway defects as ‘driver’ mutations that promote genome instability and tumor initiation. Furthermore, we show that JNK plays a key role in the initiation of tumor development. The frequent JNK pathway loss-of-function mutations in human breast cancer may therefore represent ‘driver’ mutations that promote tumor development. We find that JNK loss plays a key role at the early stages of breast cancer development by promoting mammary gland neoplasia. This observation likely accounts for the effect of mutational inactivation of JNK signaling to promote tumor development. The major conclusions of this study are that JNK deficiency in the mammary epithelium can cause murine breast cancer and that JNK deficiency rapidly accelerates tumor development in a mouse model of breast cancer.
Ciliogenesis is the process by which eukaryotic cells form cilia, which are microtubule-based structures that protrude from the cell surface and are involved in sensory perception, motility, and signaling. While the pathways controlling ciliogenesis have not been fully elucidated, we recently identified peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase ( PAM ), an enzyme required for generating amidated bioactive signaling peptides, in Chlamydomonas and mammalian cilia. Here, we show that PAM is required for the normal assembly of motile and primary cilia in Chlamydomonas, planaria and mice. In Chlamydomonas, PAM knockdown lines failed to assemble cilia beyond the transition zone, had abnormal Golgi architecture and altered levels of cilia assembly components. In planaria, decreased PAM gene expression reduced motile ciliary density on the ventral surface and resulted in the appearance of cytosolic axonemes lacking a ciliary membrane. In mice, the architecture of primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells in PAM-/- embryos was also aberrant. Our data suggest that PAM activity and alterations in post-Golgi trafficking contribute to the observed ciliogenesis defects and provide an unanticipated, highly conserved link between PAM, amidation and ciliary assembly.
Myosin III ( Myo3 ) and the actin-bundling protein Espin play a crucial role in the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells. Defects in these proteins cause hereditary hearing impairments. Myo3 interacts with Espin1 through its tail homology I motif ( THDI ), but the mechanism by which Myo3 acts through Espin1 to regulate actin bundle assembly and stabilization was not clear. Here, we show that Myo3 THDI contains a pair of repeat sequences capable of independently and strongly binding to the ankyrin repeats of Espin1, revealing an unexpected Myo3-mediated cross-linking mechanism of Espin1. The structures of Myo3 in complex with Espin1 not only elucidate the mechanism of the binding, but also reveal a Myo3-induced release of Espin1 auto-inhibition mechanism. We also provide evidence that Myo3-mediated cross-linking can further promote actin fiber bundling activity of Espin1. Myo3 binding can release the auto-inhibition of Espin1 and increase the diameter of Espin1-promoted actin bundles. Myo3a and Myo3b are known to co-localize with Espin1 at the tips of stereocilia of hair cells. Importantly, co-expression of Myo3a and Espin1 can further stimulate elongation of stereocilia in cultured organ of Corti hair cells. Myo3 binding promotes Espin1’s higher order actin bundling activity. The THDI mediates binding of Myo3 to its cargo protein Espin1 and allows Myo3 to transport Espin1 to the tips of actin bundle-based structures such as filopodia and stereocilia. With the help of the motor domain-mediated high affinity binding of Myo3 to actin filaments, the full-length Myo3/Espin1 complex may have even higher actin fiber bundling activity than the Myo3-ABR12/Espin1 complex studied in this work. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized direct myosin binding-induced actin bundling activity regulation mechanism of an actin filament cross-linker protein.
Voltage-gated calcium channels ( CaVs ) are essential for the function of excitable cells, such as neurons and heart and skeletal muscle cells, by translating membrane depolarization into calcium influx. These channels are structurally related to voltage-gated sodium channels ( NaVs ) and form a fourfold symmetrical ion channel superfamily. To understand the molecular mechanisms governing the specific voltage sensing properties of CaVs, we combined structure modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, free energy, and transition kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct voltage sensing domains ( VSDs ) of the eukaryotic calcium channel CaV1. 1. Our results provide a mechanistic model explaining how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels. Both VSDs displayed the typical features of the sliding helix model; however, they greatly differed in ion-pair formation of the outer gating charges. Stabilization of the activated state enhanced the voltage dependence of activation, while stabilization of resting states slowed the kinetics. This mechanism provides a mechanistic model explaining how specific ion-pair formation in separate VSDs can realize the characteristic gating properties of voltage-gated cation channels. Our advanced structure models of the activated and resting states of CaV1. 1 VSDs fill an important gap in the understanding of the voltage sensing mechanism in eukaryotic voltage-gated cation channels. All tested interaction partners suggested by the model showed the predicted effects on channel gating when experimentally tested by mutagenesis and electrophysiology analysis. Conversely, alterations of kinetic properties first recognized experimentally were reliably reproduced and explained by our computer model. Overall, the structures of the lowest energy states of CaV1. 1 VSDs display the basic features of the sliding helix model.
The role of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) in adult visual plasticity has been a subject of interest in the field of neuroscience. MMPs have been associated with experience-dependent plasticity in the primary visual cortex ( V1 ) of the juvenile brain. However, little is known about their role in this process in the adult brain. In this study, we examined the effects of MMP-inhibition on experience-induced plasticity in healthy and stroke-affected adult mice. We found that 7-day application of an MMP-inhibitor prevented visual plasticity in healthy animals. In contrast, treatment with an MMP-inhibitor once but not twice following stroke rescued plasticity, which is normally lost under these conditions. Our data suggest that an optimal level of MMP-activity is crucial for adult visual plasticity to occur. In addition, we found that a single treatment with an MMP-inhibitor after stroke rescued plasticity in both paradigms, whereas treatment with the inhibitor two times diminished the plasticity-promoting effect. Together, these data reveal a crucial role of MMPs in adult visual plasticity and suggest that MMP-activity has to be within a narrow window for experience-induced plasticity to occur. Our data further suggest that upregulation of MMP-activity shortly after a cortical lesion compromises experience-induced visual plasticity, which in turn can be rescued by brief MMP-inhibition. Precise regulation of MMP-activity therefore seems to be essential for facilitating plasticity in the adult brain and offers new opportunities in treatment and recovery after stroke.
AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate) receptors are tetrameric ligand-gated ion channels that play a crucial role in signal transduction at vertebrate excitatory synapses. These receptors consist of four subunits that assemble as a dimer-of-dimers, with two extracellular layers formed from amino-terminal domains ( ATDs ) and ligand-binding domains ( LBDs ). Recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy have enabled the determination of full-length structures of AMPA receptors in their resting, active, and desensitized states, both alone and in complex with auxiliary subunits. These structures suggest that the extracellular layer of AMPA receptors may undergo substantial lateral motions during gating, opening up along the central twofold symmetry axis. However, the structural dynamics underlying the rapid signaling of AMPA receptors are still unclear. In this study, we used bifunctional methanethiosulfonate cross-linkers to calibrate the conformations of functional AMPA receptors in the presence and absence of the auxiliary subunit Stargazin. Our data indicate that the extracellular layer of AMPA receptors can become trapped in stable, opened-up conformations, especially upon long exposures to glutamate. In contrast, the presence of Stargazin limits this conformational flexibility. Thus, under synaptic conditions, where brief glutamate exposures and the presence of auxiliary proteins dominate, the extracellular domains of AMPA receptors are likely to remain compact during gating. We conclude that the extracellular domains of synaptic AMPA receptors are unlikely to undergo large structural rearrangements during synaptic transmission and instead work in a fairly compact conformational regime, unless faced with long exposures to glutamate in pathological conditions.
Helminth infections induce a strong anti-parasite type 2 immune response in the murine intestine, characterized by mucus production, tissue remodeling, and immune cell infiltration. However, single cell isolation from helminth-infected murine intestines has been notoriously difficult due to these strong immune responses. To overcome this challenge, we optimized a standard intestinal digestion protocol to successfully isolate millions of immune cells from the heavily infected duodenum. To validate that these cells gave an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses, we analyzed them using a 23-color spectral flow cytometry panel and confirmed our findings by confocal microscopy. Our cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis allowed us to identify many known hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection. These hallmarks included changes in the frequency of B220+, Siglec F+, CD3+ CD4+, CD3+ CD4-, and CD64+ cells, which were faithfully reported by both spectral flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. Importantly, many of these changes were only observed locally, highlighting the requirement for good cell isolation techniques to investigate intestinal responses against helminths directly. Our optimized cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis have the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses that have previously been unfeasible.
Proteasomal protein degradation is a key determinant of protein half-life and cellular processes ranging from basic metabolism to immunological processes. Despite its importance, the mechanisms regulating proteasome activity are only incompletely understood. Here, we use an iterative and tightly integrated experimental and modelling approach to develop, explore and validate mechanistic models of proteasomal peptide-hydrolysis dynamics. The 20S proteasome is a dynamic enzyme and its activity varies over time because of interactions between substrates and products and the proteolytic and regulatory sites; the locations of these sites and the interactions between them are predicted by the model, and experimentally supported. The analysis suggests that the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of the substrates into the proteasome. The transport efficiency varies between human standard- and immuno-proteasomes, thereby impinging upon total degradation rate and substrate cleavage-site usage. We combine carefully designed experimental assays with detailed modelling to shed light on these mechanisms. The most direct insights come from carefully chosen short fluorogenic peptides, which have a single proteasome-catalyzed cleavage site, which in turn allows us to follow the kinetics in real time. We observe similar proteasome dynamics over time when using purified 20S proteasome as well as protein homogenates, where 20S proteasomes are surrounded by several regulatory molecules. This suggests that with the present model we describe a core of proteasome features that could reflect proteasome dynamics also in more complex scenarios such as might exist inside the cellular environment.
The β-alanine transporter BalaT is required for visual neurotransmission in Drosophila. The recycling of neurotransmitters is essential for sustained synaptic transmission. In Drosophila, histamine recycling is required for visual synaptic transmission. Synaptic histamine is rapidly taken up by laminar glia, and is converted to carcinine. After being delivered back to photoreceptors, carcinine is hydrolyzed to release histamine and β-alanine. This histamine is repackaged into synaptic vesicles, but it is unclear how the β-alanine is returned to the laminar glial cells. Here, we identified a new β-alanine transporter, which we named BalaT ( Beta-alanine Transporter ). Null balat mutants exhibited lower levels of β-alanine, as well as less β-alanine accumulation in the retina. Moreover, BalaT is expressed and required in retinal pigment cells for maintaining visual synaptic transmission and phototaxis behavior. These results provide the first genetic evidence that retinal pigment cells play a critical role in visual neurotransmission, and suggest that a BalaT-dependent β-alanine trafficking pathway is required for histamine homeostasis and visual neurotransmission. We propose that a novel β-alanine transporter, BalaT, functions in retinal pigment cells to help recycle β-alanine. Disrupting the synthesis of histamine and carcinine abolishes photoreceptor synaptic transmission ( Borycz et al., 2002; Burg et al., 1993 ). The transport of β-alanine seems less important, as it is present at higher concentrations in Drosophila. Therefore, β-alanine recycling is essential for maintaining histamine homeostasis and photoreceptor synaptic transmission. In addition, establishing and maintaining a β-alanine pool play key roles in sustaining visual synaptic transmission. The majority of pigment granules, which reduce the intensity of light exposure, are formed in retinal pigment cells of the Drosophila compound eye. The finding that high levels of β-alanine are detected in retinal pigment cells suggested that pigment cells may be critical for the transport and storage of β-alanine in this system ( Borycz et al., 2012; Chaturvedi et al., 2014 ). To address these questions, we sought to determine whether there was a β-alanine transporter that was required for Drosophila vision transmission.
Cellular redox homeostasis plays a crucial role in the aging process, but the precise role that oxidants play in aging is still unknown. Here, we report that chronologically aging yeast cells undergo a sudden redox collapse, which affects over 80% of identified thiol-containing proteins. This redox collapse is not triggered by an increase in endogenous oxidants, but rather by a substantial drop in cellular NADPH, which normally provides the electron source for maintaining cellular redox homeostasis. This decrease in NADPH levels occurs very early during lifespan and sets into motion a cascade that is predicted to down-regulate most cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a near-universal lifespan extending measure, increases NADPH levels and delays each facet of the cascade. Our studies reveal a time line of events leading up to the system-wide oxidation of the proteome days before cell death.
Homochirality is a fundamental property of the biological macromolecular world and is essential for cell survival. In this study, we present the mechanistic basis of a configuration-specific enzyme, dimeric D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacylase ( DTD ) from Plasmodium falciparum, that selectively removes D-amino acids erroneously coupled to tRNAs. The crystal structure of DTD in complex with a substrate-mimicking analog shows how it uses an invariant ‘cross-subunit’ Gly-cisPro dipeptide to capture the chiral centre of incoming D-aminoacyl-tRNA. This unique side chain-independent mode of substrate recognition provides a clear explanation for DTD’s ability to act on multiple D-amino acids. The strict chiral specificity of DTD elegantly explains how the enriched cellular pool of L-aminoacyl-tRNAs escapes this proofreading step. Such a side chain-free recognition mechanism provides the basis for how nature has designed a single deacylase to deal with any D-aa-tRNA and reveals the crucial role played by weak hydrogen bonds in D-chirality selection. If an L-aa was to bind in this pocket, it would have to do so in one of the three theoretically possible conformations. The study provides insights into a fundamental enantioselective mechanism involved in enforcement of homochirality in proteins by specifically decoupling D-aas from tRNAs.
Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) is a chloride ion channel that belongs to the superfamily of ATP binding cassette ( ABC ) proteins. Following phosphorylation of the cytosolic regulatory ( R ) domain by cAMP-dependent protein kinase ( PKA ), CFTR channels are gated by cytosolic ATP. In wild-type CFTR, ATP-binding-induced dimerization of two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains ( NBDs ) opens the pore, and dimer disruption following ATP hydrolysis closes it. However, spontaneous openings without ATP are rare in wild-type CFTR, but in certain CF mutants constitute the only gating mechanism, stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CFTR potentiator. Here, we show that spontaneous openings are also strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may therefore occur even without ATP. We correlate energetic coupling between residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous pore opening/closure in single CFTR channels. We show that spontaneous openings are strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which may therefore occur even without ATP. Coordinated NBD/pore movements are therefore intrinsic to CFTR: ATP alters the stability, but not the fundamental structural architecture, of open- and closed-pore conformations. This explains correlated effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP-driven and spontaneous activity, providing insights for understanding CF mutation and drug mechanisms. Our results argue that upon pore opening its remaining NBD-TMD coupling machinery undergoes movements similar to those that accompany NBD dimerization when neither 'limb' is truncated.
Transmembrane proteins embedded in lipid bilayers can be stabilized by a pre-transition ( or pre-melting ) effect for the first-order transition between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane. This effect, referred to as the 'orderphobic effect', is analogous to the hydrophobic effect and is mediated by proximity to the order–disorder phase transition and the size and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces arising from this effect are significantly larger than those that could arise from membrane elasticity for the membranes considered. The orderphobic effect leverages the power of a phase transition, depending in this case on the ability of the orderphobic protein to induce a disordered layer in its vicinity. This ability depends upon the proximity to the membrane’s phase transition, and, for the simple protein models considered in this paper, it depends upon the protein’s radius and hydrophobic mismatch with the membrane. For instance, at zero lateral pressure and 294 K in the model DPPC membrane, we find that the average thicknesses of the hydrophobic layers in the ordered and disordered states are 𝒟o=3. 1 nm and 𝒟d=2. 6 nm, respectively. A transmembrane protein with hydrophobic thickness of size ℓ≈2. 6 nm will therefore favor the structure of the disordered phase. If the protein is large enough, it can melt the ordered phase near the protein and result in the formation of an order–disorder interface. Our prediction of enhanced lipid mobility surrounding orderphobic proteins may be amenable to experimental tests by single molecule tracking techniques. Biological membranes and transmembrane proteins are far more complicated than the models considered in this paper. Part of the complexity is associated with multiple components, which allow for more than one order–disorder transition. Further, there is a dual to the orderphobic effect: a transmembrane protein in the disordered phase that favors the ordered phase can nucleate an ordered region and order–disorder interface. For example, one of our model proteins with a positive mismatch ( ℓ=𝒟o ) would induce order in its vicinity. This effect is illustrated in the Appendix. Interfaces separating the ordered and disordered regions will again provide a force for assembly. A consequence of the regular tail packing is that hydrophobic thickness of the ordered phase, 𝒟o is larger than that of the disordered phase, 𝒟d. Correspondingly, the area per lipid in the ordered phase is smaller than that in the disordered phase.
Fluorescent calcium indicators are widely used to investigate neural dynamics, but the relationship between fluorescence and action potentials ( APs ) remains unclear. Most APs can be detected when the soma almost fills the microscope’s field of view, but calcium indicators are used to image populations of neurons, necessitating a large field of view, generating fewer photons per neuron, and compromising AP detection. Here, we characterized the AP-fluorescence transfer function in vivo for 48 layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in primary visual cortex, with simultaneous calcium imaging and cell-attached recordings from transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6s or GCaMP6f. While most APs were detected under optimal conditions, under conditions typical of population imaging studies, only a minority of 1 AP and 2 AP events were detected ( often <10% and ~20–30%, respectively ), emphasizing the limits of AP detection under more realistic imaging conditions. To construct AP-calcium fluorescence response curves, we first identified all isolated AP events. For GCaMP6s, isolated events were separated from previous and subsequent events by ≥1000 and ≥500 ms, respectively. For GCaMP6f, isolated events were separated from previous and subsequent events by ≥300 ms. One result of finding isolated events is that only a minority of APs were used to construct AP-calcium fluorescence response curves. Within each event, APs were summed over 250 ms. We then tested the performance of several spike inference models, detecting APs under optimal conditions ( models refined using the spiking information, with the soma filling the field of view ) and under the less optimal conditions typical of population imaging experiments. Our results provide insight into the relationship between spiking activity in vivo and fluorescence signals and will aid the interpretation of existing and future calcium imaging datasets.
Neotrogla, a sex-role reversed cave insect, has evolved a unique biological switching valve within its female genitalia. The valve complex is composed of two plate-like sclerites, a closure element, and in-and-outflow canals. Females of Neotrogla possess a penis-like intromittent organ, which they use to coercively anchor males and obtain voluminous semen. The semen is packed in a capsule that is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition. The valve complex has two slots for insemination, allowing Neotrogla females to continue mating while the first slot is occupied. In conjunction with the female penis, this switching valve is a morphological novelty that enables females to compete for seminal gifts in their nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation times and multiple seminal injections. The evolution of this switching valve may have been a prerequisite for the reversal of the intromittent organ in Neotrogla. Females of Neotrogla use the switching valve to actively control the direction of seminal flow, allowing them to receive two seminal packages from the same or different males within a short time span. The switching valve enables females to selectively use one of two slots for insemination, leaving the other slot empty. This allows them to immediately receive an additional seminal package from the same or other males by using the empty slot. The presence of a spermathecal plate with a valve function to control seminal flow may further refine our understanding of the causes and consequences of the reversed sexual selection in this genus.
Synaptic-soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) proteins play a crucial role in the rapid exocytosis of neurotransmitters at the synapse. However, the stage-wise folding/assembly of SNARE proteins and the role of Munc18-1 in this process are not well understood. Using optical tweezers, we observed four distinct stages of assembly in SNARE N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains (NTD, MD, CTD, and LD, respectively). We found that SNARE layer mutations differentially affect SNARE assembly and exocytosis, suggesting that NTD and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, respectively, whereas MD regulates SNARE assembly and fusion. Munc18-1 initiates SNARE assembly and structures the t-SNARE C-terminus independent of the syntaxin N-terminal regulatory domain (NRD) and stabilizes the half-zippered SNARE complex dependent upon the NRD. Our observations demonstrate distinct functions of SNARE domains whose assembly is intimately chaperoned by Munc18-1. In the absence of Munc18-1, SNAP-25 tends to dissociate from the tethered syntaxin and VAMP2 when the t-SNARE complex is unfolded. In contrast, in the presence of Munc18-1, 45% of completely unfolded SNARE complexes show full reassembly, suggesting that Munc18-1 holds the SNAP-25 molecule together with the tethered syntaxin or VAMP2 as t-SNARE unfolds. We observed three force-dependent activities of Munc18-1 in SNARE assembly, consistent with the previously reported multiple modes of binding between Munc18-1 and the SNARE complex. The most distinct Munc18-1 activity is to enhance de novo SNARE assembly. We propose a working model to account for the multiple roles of Munc18-1 in stage-wise SNARE zippering and membrane fusion, suggesting that Munc18-1 mainly acts on the folding intermediates of SNAREs to chaperone their assembly.
Integrin adhesomes are pre-assembled in the cytosol as multi-protein building blocks that facilitate the rapid and modular assembly of cell-matrix adhesion sites. These building blocks are spatially uniform around stationary focal adhesions and exchange symmetrically with the cytosol without altering their composition. This exchange ensures that the building blocks enter and exit adhesion sites without being modified, thereby preserving the assembly logic of the system. The integrin adhesome is extensively pre-assembled in the cytosol, forming multi-protein building blocks that are predominantly corresponding to the functional layers across focal adhesions, including anchoring and integrin regulation, force transduction, and actin regulation. These building blocks are size-confined and cannot form bigger structures in the cytosol due to dependencies between protein interactions. We propose that at the plasma membrane, the system can be locally switched on to self-assemble adhesion sites by passing through checkpoints that induce additional protein interactions in the integrin adhesome. This process would otherwise lose control on the identity of the co-recruited proteins when recruiting a protein embedded in a multi-protein building block, leading to the formation of aberrant structures. In order to understand the assembly logic of adhesion sites, it would be important to integrate interaction-dependencies across the integrin adhesome.
The 1/f spectral slope of the electrophysiological power spectrum, which reflects the non-oscillatory, scale-free component of neural activity, has been identified as a common electrophysiological marker that tracks states of reduced arousal in humans, including different sleep stages as well as anesthesia. Using intracranial and surface EEG recordings in four independent data sets, we demonstrate that the spectral slope discriminates wakefulness from propofol anesthesia, non-rapid eye movement ( NREM ) sleep, and rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep. The spectral slope becomes more negative ( i. e. the power spectrum steeper ) in sleep and under anesthesia compared to wakefulness. Importantly, we also show that the spectral slope can discern wakefulness from NREM as well as REM sleep solely based on the neurophysiological brain state. Our results provide empirical evidence for the notion that the slope in the range from 30 to 45 Hz correlates well with all stages of arousal. We demonstrate that the spectral slope tracks changes in arousal levels in both propofol anesthesia and sleep in humans with high temporal precision and is observable on a wide range of timescales from sub-second epochs to full night recordings. The spectral slope mirrors the rapid changes in excitability observed over the course of a slow wave directly tracking cortical ‘up- ‘and ‘down-states’, hence, providing a mechanistic link between the spectral slope and population synchrony during slow oscillations.
Chloroplasts in plant cells are surrounded by dynamic tubular extensions called stromules, which have recently been shown to play a role in innate immunity. In this study, we demonstrate that stromules extend along microtubules ( MTs ) and that the organization of MTs directly affects stromule dynamics. We show that stabilizing MTs either chemically or genetically increases the number and length of stromules. Although actin filaments ( AFs ) are not required for stromule extension, they do provide anchor points for stromules. Interestingly, there is a strong correlation between the direction of stromules from chloroplasts and the direction of chloroplast movement. Our results show that MTs and AFs may facilitate perinuclear clustering of chloroplasts during an innate immune response. We propose a model in which stromules extend along MTs and connect to AF anchor points surrounding nuclei, facilitating stromule-directed movement of chloroplasts to nuclei during innate immunity. Our results show that MT-mediated stromule extension and AF-mediated stromule anchoring are two complementary activities during stromule formation and movement. We provide mechanistic insights into how interactions with the cytoskeleton form and stabilize stromules. Furthermore, we describe a new type of organellar movement along MTs that is stromule-directed and reveal a mechanism for perinuclear clustering during innate immunity.
Evolutionary information can be used to make accurate predictions of residue–residue interactions across protein interfaces. We find that residue pairs identified using a pseudo-likelihood-based method to covary across protein–protein interfaces in the 50S ribosomal unit and 28 additional bacterial protein complexes with known structure are almost always in contact in the complex, provided that the number of aligned sequences is greater than the average length of the two proteins. We use this method to make subunit contact predictions for an additional 36 protein complexes with unknown structures, and present models based on these predictions for the tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic ( TRAP ) transporter, the tripartite efflux system, the pyruvate formate lyase-activating enzyme complex, and the methionine ABC transporter. The results with the 50S ribosome and the protein pairs in the benchmark suggest that interactions can be accurately predicted across protein–protein interfaces given a sufficient number of aligned sequences. In a large set of complexes of known structure, we find that covarying pairs of positions are almost always in contact in the three-dimensional structure, provided there are sufficient aligned sequences. We find further that significant residue–residue covariance occurs frequently between physically interacting protein pairs but very rarely between non-interacting pairs, and hence should be useful for predicting whether two proteins interact. We use the pseudo-likelihood method to predict contacts across protein-interfaces for 36 evolutionarily conserved complexes of unknown structure and present structure models for four of the complexes particularly well constrained by these data.
Active sensing is a strategy used to interpret visual scenes by accumulating information from multiple locations in a scene. In a visual categorization task, we used a novel gaze-contingent paradigm to show that participants' scan paths follow an active sensing strategy that incorporates information already acquired about the scene and knowledge of the statistical structure of patterns. We found that categorization performance was markedly improved when locations were revealed to participants by an optimal Bayesian active sensor algorithm. By using a combination of a Bayesian ideal observer and the active sensor algorithm, we estimated that a major portion of the apparent suboptimality of fixation locations arises from prior biases, perceptual noise and inaccuracies in eye movements, and the central process of selecting fixation locations is around 70% efficient in our task. Our results suggest that participants select eye movements with the goal of maximizing information about abstract categories that require the integration of information from multiple locations. In order to study eye movements in a more principled quantitative manner, we estimated the efficiency of eye movements in a high-level task on a fixation-by-fixation basis. Our participants' eye movements were substantially more efficient than heuristic strategies that only employed a subset of the elements of a fully closed-loop active sensing strategy, and were about 70% as efficient as the optimal active sensor that operated with the participants' own prior bias, perception noise, and saccadic inaccuracies. We designed an experiment with visual patterns that were statistically well-controlled and relatively simple, while ensuring that foveal vision would dominate by using a gaze-contingent categorization task in which we tracked the eye and successively revealed small apertures of the image at each fixation location.
Nucleocytoplasmic transport is tightly regulated by the nuclear pore complex ( NPC ), which allows thousands of molecules to cross the NPC, including large cargoes such as pathogens, mRNAs, and pre-ribosomes. However, there is little quantitative understanding of the requirements for nuclear import of these large cargoes, especially the role of multivalent binding to transport receptors via nuclear localisation sequences ( NLSs ) and the effect of size on import efficiency. Here, we show that the requirements for nuclear transport of large cargoes can be recapitulated by a simple two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux with the energetics of large cargo transport through the NPC. We assayed nuclear import kinetics of 30 large cargo models based on four capsid-like particles in the size range of 17–36 nm, with tuneable numbers of up to 240 NLSs. Our results show that the requirements for nuclear transport scale non-linearly with size and can be recapitulated by a two-parameter biophysical model that correlates the import flux to the energetic requirements for nuclear transport. For small cargo transport, biochemical or physicochemical properties of the cargo surface have been shown to influence nuclear transport. We anticipate that basic principles of our work could also help in the future to better understand export of large cargoes, such as pre-ribosomal subunits and large RNA export complexes. Our model implicitly assumes that the capsids do not interact with each other during transport through the pore. However, cargoes that present a nuclear localisation sequence ( NLS ) and bind nuclear transport receptors ( NTRs ) can rapidly enter into the nucleus.
CD28 is a co-stimulatory molecule that plays a critical role in the activation of helper T cells. While it is well established that CD28 is essential for T cell priming and differentiation into effector T cell subsets, it is not known whether CD28 has functions in maintaining T cell responses following activation. To determine the role of CD28 after T cell priming, we generated a strain of mice where CD28 is removed from CD4+ T cells after priming. We show that continued CD28 expression is important for effector CD4+ T cells following infection; maintained CD28 is required for the expansion of T helper type 1 cells, and for the differentiation and maintenance of T follicular helper cells during viral infection. Persistent CD28 is also required for clearance of the bacterium Citrobacter rodentium from the gastrointestinal tract. Together, this study demonstrates that CD28 persistence is required for helper T cell polarization in response to infection, describing a novel function for CD28 that is distinct from its role in T cell priming. We show that CD28 expression is required after T cell priming for the expansion of Th1 cells and for the differentiation and maintenance of Tfh cells. Maintained CD28 expression is also required for clearance of the enteropathic bacteria C. rodentium after oral infection. This demonstrates that CD28 expression is required after T cell priming for intact effector CD4+ T cell responses during infection. To determine if maintained CD28 expression is important for the immune response to bacterial infection, and not only viral infection, we infected Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice with Citrobacter rodentium, an enteric mucosal murine pathogen that elicits a robust humoral and cellular immune response. We show that Cd28flox/flox Ox40cre/+ mice are unable to clear Citrobacter rodentium from their gastrointestinal tract following oral infection.
Helicobacter pylori is a spiral-shaped bacterium that efficiently colonizes the human stomach. The helical shape of H. pylori is essential for its ability to colonize the stomach, but the molecular mechanisms that generate this shape are not well understood. The helical centerline pitch and radius of H. pylori dictate surface curvatures of considerably higher positive and negative Gaussian curvatures than those present in straight- or curved-rod H. pylori. To investigate how H. pylori achieves diameter control while maintaining sidewall curvature, we employed two metabolic probes to investigate peptidoglycan ( PG ) synthesis patterning in H. pylori. Using superresolution microscopy and 3D quantitative image analysis, we show that synthesis is enhanced at negative Gaussian curvature as well as at a limited range of positive Gaussian curvatures. We furthermore investigate the localization of cytoskeletal proteins MreB and CcmA. We propose that MreB promotes the peak of PG synthesis we observed at negative Gaussian curvature given its preference for this curvature in H. pylori and its role in localizing PG synthesis activity in other organisms. To enable maintenance of high sidewall curvature in the presence of the MreB-driven straight-rod cell growth pattern, we suggest that H. pylori augments the default rod pattern by means of enhanced growth at the major axis area that is independent of MreB. H. pylori leverages the bactofilin CcmA, which localizes preferentially to the major helical axis area, to promote synthesis at positive Gaussian curvatures on the sidewall and supplements the MreB-associated enhanced synthesis that is enriched at negative Gaussian curvatures. We demonstrate that, as in straight-rod shaped E. coli cells, MreB is enriched at negative curvature. CcmA is enriched at the window of positive Gaussian curvatures where enhanced synthesis is observed. We propose that both MreB and CcmA help maintain PG synthesis activity locally and that PG synthesis patterning is one mechanism that plays a fundamental role in helical cell shape maintenance.
Cdc48, a ubiquitin-selective chaperone, plays a critical role in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics by integrating the activities of two deubiquitylases ( DUBs ), Ubp12 and Ubp2. These DUBs exert opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion by cleaving different ubiquitin chains on the mitofusin Fzo1. Ubp12 promotes mitochondrial fusion by stabilizing pro-fusion ubiquitylation on Fzo1, while Ubp2 inhibits fusion by removing ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that target it for proteasomal degradation. We show that Cdc48 negatively regulates Ubp12, which in turn stabilizes Ubp2, thereby facilitating the removal of ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that inhibit fusion. This cascade ensures a tight control of Fzo1 ubiquitylation at levels sufficient to allow mitochondrial fusion while preventing unnecessary ubiquitylation that targets Fzo1 for proteasomal turnover. We propose that Ubp12 recognizes ubiquitylated chains on Fzo1 composed of a very small number of ubiquitin moieties, which are too short to target proteasomal turnover. In contrast, Ubp2 recognizes and cleaves ubiquitin chains on Fzo1 that target it for proteasomal degradation and inhibit mitochondrial fusion. The cascade between Ubp12 and Ubp2 also allows revising recent results linking Ubp2 and Mdm30 ( Cavellini et al., 2017 ). Mdm30 catalyzes the formation of pro-fusion ubiquitin forms on Fzo1 ( Cohen et al., 2008 ). In conclusion, we have unraveled a new cascade of ubiquitylation events, comprising Cdc48, Ubp12, and Ubp2, that fine-tunes the fusogenic activity of Fzo1.
The ventral occipito-temporal cortex ( VOTC ) is a region of the brain that is traditionally associated with the processing of visual information. However, recent studies suggest that VOTC may also play a role in the processing of auditory information. In this study, we investigated whether vision is necessary for the development of the categorical organization of VOTC. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to characterize VOTC responses to eight different sound categories in sighted and congenitally blind individuals. We also used fMRI to characterize VOTC responses to visual stimuli in a separate group of sighted individuals. Our results show that VOTC reliably encodes sound categories in both sighted and blind individuals, using a representational structure and connectivity that is partially similar to the one found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind than in the sighted group, using a representational format that is closer to the one found in vision. Crucially, VOTC in blind individuals represents the categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. This suggests that sounds trigger categorical responses in the VOTC of congenitally blind and sighted individuals that partially match the topography and functional profile of the visual response, despite qualitative nuances in the categorical organization of VOTC between modalities and groups. Our results demonstrate that a categorical organization similar to the one found in vision can emerge in VOTC in the absence of visual experience, and that such categorical response to sounds is actually enhanced and more stable in congenitally blind individuals. We also show that categorical membership is the main factor that predicts the representational structure of sounds in VOTC in blind individuals, rather than lower-level acoustic attributes of sounds that are at least partially at the basis of category selectivity in the temporal cortex.
Entomophthora muscae ( E. muscae ) is a behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen that infects Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly. We recently discovered a strain of E. muscae infecting wild Drosophila and established a method to infect D. melanogaster in the laboratory. Lab-infected flies exhibit moribund behaviors characteristic of E. muscae infection, such as climbing upward, extending their proboscides, and raising their wings to clear a path for infectious spores to launch from their abdomens. We found that E. muscae invades the nervous system of D. melanogaster, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus could induce behavioral changes. We believe that this new system will enable rapid progress in understanding how E. muscae manipulates host behavior, given the vast molecular toolkit available for D. melanogaster.

Eukaryotic RNA degradation pathways play a crucial role in RNA processing, regulation of RNA levels, and surveillance of aberrant or poorly functional RNAs in cells. In this study, we report transcriptome-wide RNA-binding profiles of 30 general RNA degradation factors in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( S. cerevisiae ). We used photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation ( PAR-CLIP ) to systematically generate transcriptome-wide protein binding profiles for these factors. Our results reveal the distribution of degradation factors between different RNA classes and are consistent with the canonical degradation pathway for closed-loop forming mRNAs after deadenylation. Modeling based on mRNA half-lives suggests that most degradation factors bind intact mRNAs, whereas decapping factors are recruited only for mRNA degradation, consistent with decapping being a rate-limiting step. Decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-optimal codons, consistent with rapid degradation of inefficiently translated mRNAs. Our results also suggest that the nuclear surveillance machinery, including the complexes Nrd1/Nab3 and TRAMP4, targets aberrant nuclear RNAs and processes snoRNAs. Our dataset provides a rich resource for future studies of eukaryotic RNA degradation pathways, mechanisms, and the integration of mRNA metabolism.
Camalexin is one of the most potent defense compounds in Arabidopsis thaliana that can be rapidly induced by bacterial and fungal infections. However, the mechanisms that enable the rapid activation of camalexin biosynthesis genes upon a pathogen signal remain unknown. In this study, we found that camalexin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications with opposite effects on gene expression, trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 ( H3K27me3 ) and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 ( H3K18ac ), to form a previously uncharacterized type of bivalent chromatin. We named this bivalent chromatin kairostat. By combining publicly available epigenomic data with in vivo chromatin modification mapping, we found that both H3K27me3 and H3K18ac are required to determine the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of the stress response. In mutants with reduced H3K27me3 or H3K18ac, the induction kinetics of camalexin biosynthesis genes and metabolite accumulation was accelerated or delayed, respectively. Our results provide new evidence for how chemical defense mediated by camalexin may be regulated at the epigenetic level. We found that H3K27me3 and H3K18ac co-localized on camalexin biosynthesis genes forming a previously uncharacterized form of bivalent chromatin. We examined the role of H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin on the induction of camalexin biosynthesis genes by combining publicly available epigenomics data with genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry. Our study indicates that the H3K27me3-H3K18ac bivalent chromatin plays an important role in controlling the timely induction of gene expression upon stress stimuli in plants.
Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) is a histone methyltransferase that plays a critical role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression. Here, we show that the PRC2 subunit EZH2 is expressed in astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells ( NSCs ) in the adult mouse subventricular zone ( SVZ ), and is required for neurogenesis independent of its role in SVZ NSC proliferation. We found that Ink4a/Arf-deficiency in Ezh2-deleted SVZ NSCs rescues cell proliferation, but neurogenesis remains defective, indicating that EZH2 has a role in SVZ neurogenesis that is distinct from its function in Ink4a/Arf repression. Olig2 is a direct target of EZH2, and repression of this bHLH transcription factor is critical for neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, EZH2 prevents the inappropriate activation of genes associated with non-SVZ neuronal subtypes. In the human brain, SVZ cells including local astroglia also express EZH2, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. Thus, EZH2 is an epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SVZ astrocytes, orchestrating distinct and separable aspects of adult stem cell biology. Our studies establish EZH2 as a distinguishing feature of astroglial cells in the postnatal neurogenic SVZ of both the mouse and human brain. We identify distinct and separable roles for EZH2 in the production of new neurons from a multipotent stem cell population. These results provide novel insights into the complex role that this Polycomb repressive factor plays in normal development and gliomagenesis.
Viruses infecting uncultivated SUP05 bacteria in marine oxygen minimum zones ( OMZs ) play a crucial role in modulating microbial communities and ecosystem functions. However, due to cultivation bottlenecks, specific virus–host interaction dynamics remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined 127 single-cell amplified genomes ( SAGs ) from uncultivated SUP05 bacteria isolated from a model marine OMZ to identify 69 viral contigs representing five new genera within dsDNA Caudovirales and ssDNA Microviridae. We found that ∼1/3 of SUP05 bacteria is viral-infected, with higher infection frequency where oxygen-deficiency was most severe. Our results suggest that SUP05 viruses persist for years, but remain endemic to the OMZ. We also identified virus-encoded dissimilatory sulfite reductase, which posits a role for viruses in modulating the marine sulfur cycle by reprogramming their host's energy metabolism. Analyses of 186 microbial and viral metagenomes revealed patterns of co-infection between dsDNA and ssDNA viruses, suggesting previously unrecognized cooperation modes. Our results demonstrate closely coupled SUP05 virus–host co-evolutionary dynamics with the potential to modulate biogeochemical cycling in climate-critical and expanding OMZs.
Intraflagellar transport ( IFT ) is a highly conserved mechanism responsible for the assembly and maintenance of cilia and flagella in eukaryotic cells. IFT is mediated by more than 20 IFT proteins, but the functions of individual IFT proteins are mostly unclear. To address this issue, we focused on TTC26/DYF13, a putative IFT protein. We show that TTC26/DYF13 is an IFT complex B protein in mammalian cells and the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ( C. reinhardtii ). Using live imaging and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate that knockdown of TTC26/DYF13 in zebrafish embryos or mutation of TTC26/DYF13 in C. reinhardtii produces short cilia with abnormal motility. Surprisingly, IFT particle assembly and speed are normal in dyf13 mutant flagella, unlike in other IFT complex B mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analyses indicate that a particular set of proteins involved in motility is specifically depleted in the dyf13 mutant. These results support the concept that different IFT proteins are responsible for different cargo subsets, providing a possible explanation for the complexity of the IFT machinery. Unlike other complex B proteins, a deletion mutant of dyf13 in C. reinhardtii still has flagella, indicating that TTC26/DYF13 is not required for ciliogenesis per se. However, the flagella are slightly shorter with pronounced motility defects. Similar phenotypes are observed in zebrafish cilia when ttc26 is depleted. Although IFT particle movement seems normal in dyf13 mutant flagella, specific inner dynein arm components are reduced in flagella of dyf13 mutants, indicating a specific role for TTC26/DYF13 in transport of a subset of ciliary proteins.
Lymphatic endothelial cells ( LECs ) play a crucial role in the metastasis of melanoma, a type of skin cancer. In this study, we investigated how LECs affect the behavior of melanoma cells in the tumor microenvironment. We found that when melanoma cells are exposed to LECs in a 3D co-culture, they become more invasive and are more likely to metastasize to distant organs in mice. This effect is dependent on the presence of matrix-metalloproteinase-14 ( MMP14, also known as MT1-MMP ), Notch3, and β1-integrin in the melanoma cells. Notably, MMP14 is necessary for LEC-induced Notch3 induction and coincident β1-integrin activation in the melanoma cells. Moreover, MMP14 and Notch3 are required for LEC-mediated metastasis of melanoma cells in zebrafish xenografts. This study reveals a unique mechanism by which LECs promote melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch from 3D growth to an invasive sprouting phenotype in the melanoma cells. Importantly, the interaction of melanoma cells with LECs leads to significantly increased metastasis of melanoma xenografts in vivo, which is dependent on MMP14 and Notch3. We also found that LEC contact induces β1-integrin activation in the metastatic melanoma cells, which is required for the 3D sprouting of these cells. The upregulation of Notch3 upon LEC priming provides strong support that our LEC-melanoma interaction model can reveal clinically relevant molecules for cancer dissemination and thus has high potential for identifying previously unrecognized pathways and molecules contributing to the lymphatic metastasis of melanoma.
MicroRNA-9 ( miR-9 ) is a conserved noncoding RNA that functions as a posttranscriptional regulator of gene expression. It is one of the most abundant miRNAs in the brain and has been well characterized in neural progenitors. However, the role of miR-9 in dendritic and synaptic development remains largely unknown. In order to study miR-9 in vivo, we developed a transgenic miRNA sponge mouse line that allows for conditional inactivation of the miR-9 family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Using this novel approach, we found that miR-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-9-mediated downregulation of the transcriptional repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth. In this study, we focused on the postmitotic stages of neuronal differentiation and demonstrated a critical role for miR-9 in the control of dendritic development in vivo. We found that inhibition of miR-9 results in aberrant dendritic growth in vivo, accompanied by a concomitant impairment in synaptic transmission. Our results define a key role for miR-9 during postmitotic differentiation of neurons. We present a new double reporter mouse line that helped to characterize the activity pattern of miR-9 in different cell types in the brain. The analysis of the miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mouse line showed that inhibition of miR-9 results in aberrant dendritic growth in vivo, accompanied by a concomitant impairment in synaptic transmission. We describe for the first time a conditional transgenic sponge mouse model. We derived two different strains for in vivo analysis: ( i ) a reporter mouse line to monitor miR-9 activity with single-cell resolution and ( ii ) a line for miR-9 loss-of-function studies. Using the latter, we revealed a novel developmental role of miR-9 in the postmitotic differentiation of neurons, as a key regulator of dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo. In summary, we describe the first transgenic sponge mouse line that allows for conditional inactivation of an miRNA family in a spatio-temporal-controlled manner. Analysis of this miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mouse line reveals a prominent role for miR-9 on postmitotic neuronal differentiation as a regulator of dendritic development through repression of REST expression. This indicates that effects found in miR-9-SpNestin-Cre mice are essentially cell-intrinsic and that miR-9 exerts its proactive function in modeling dendritic arbors as a key player of neuronal genetic programs controlling dendrite development. Furthermore, we found that basal synaptic transmission was impaired in miR-9 sponge expressing mice.
Social visual engagement difficulties are a hallmark early sign of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and can be quantified using eye tracking methods. However, it is unclear how these difficulties are linked to atypical early functional brain organization in ASD. Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data in a large sample of ASD toddlers and non-ASD comparison groups, we find that ASD is characterized by functional hypoconnectivity between the default mode network (DMN) and visual and attention networks. We identify an ASD subtype with pronounced early social visual engagement difficulties, termed GeoPref ASD, which is characterized by marked DMN-occipito-temporal cortex (OTC) hypoconnectivity. This hypoconnectivity is also related to increased severity of social-communication difficulties, but only in GeoPref ASD. Early and pronounced social-visual circuit hypoconnectivity is a key underlying neurobiological feature describing GeoPref ASD and may be critical for future social-communicative development and represent new treatment targets for early intervention in these individuals. We find that this subtype can be identified with high levels of precision via a simple eye tracking test of social or non-social visual preferences in very early development. Early social-visual functional hypoconnectivity is a key underlying neurobiological feature describing GeoPref ASD and may be critical for future social-communicative development. This finding suggests that in ASD within the first 4 years of life the developing ‘social brain’ default mode network is on-average functionally disconnected from visual cortices and the dorsal attention network. This finding is important with respect to why social engagement difficulties are a hallmark symptom in early ASD development and shared across most ASD toddlers.
In Drosophila melanogaster, the hematopoietic organs produce two types of mature hemocytes: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. Plasmatocytes are phagocytic cells and are often functionally compared to vertebrate macrophages. Crystal cells, on the other hand, have not been observed to divide during larval stages and do not enter circulation in homeostatic conditions. Despite this, the number of circulating and sessile crystal cells increases throughout larval development. We show that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate through a Notch-dependent process of plasmatocyte transdifferentiation. This process occurs in the sessile hemocyte clusters and is contingent upon the integrity of these structures. The existence of this hematopoietic tissue, relying on structure-dependent signaling events to promote blood homeostasis, creates a new paradigm for addressing outstanding questions in Drosophila hematopoiesis and establishing further parallels with vertebrate systems. In vertebrates, macrophages are the most plastic cells in the hematopoietic tissue and their specialization in vivo depends on the local microenvironment provided by the tissue they colonize. Similarly, in Drosophila larvae, the microenvironment provided by hemocyte clusters is necessary to induce crystal cell differentiation from plasmatocytes, namely through a cell-contact mechanism involving Notch-Serrate signaling.
Yeast aneuploidy, which is the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes, has been linked to a wide range of diseases. However, aneuploidy also plays a role in the evolution of new phenotypes. Laboratory strains of yeast are extremely sensitive to aneuploidy, but we show here that aneuploidy is surprisingly common in wild yeast isolates. These wild yeast strains show lower-than-expected expression at many amplified genes. We generated diploid strain panels in which cells carried two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes, to show that gene-dosage compensation functions at 10–30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher expression constraint in wild populations—but they show elevated rates of gene amplification, suggesting that copy-number variation is buffered at these genes. We find that aneuploidy provides a clear ecological advantage to oak strain YPS1009, by amplifying a causal gene that escapes dosage compensation. Our work presents a model in which dosage compensation buffers gene amplification through aneuploidy to provide a natural, but likely transient, route to rapid phenotypic evolution. We report that chromosomal amplification is common in non-laboratory yeast strains, which are inherently tolerant of aneuploidy and display an active mode of gene-dosage compensation at the transcript level, for specific classes of amplified genes. Strikingly, genes subject to dosage compensation are buffered against copy-number variation ( CNV ) and thus show elevated rates of gene amplification in natural isolates. Our results provide new insight into a long-standing conundrum: how do cells tolerate duplication of toxic genes long enough for new phenotypes to evolve? Our results show that up to 40% of amplified genes in naturally aneuploid strains show lower-than-expected expression. The reduced expression is in part due to heritable polymorphisms that down-regulate expression from amplified genes, some of which may have been selected for during the adaptation to aneuploidy.
Xenopsin is a recently classified subtype of opsin photopigment that challenges our views on opsin and photoreceptor evolution. Originally thought to belong to the Gαi-coupled ciliary opsins, xenopsins are now understood to have diverged from ciliary opsins in pre-bilaterian times. In this study, we characterized xenopsin in a flatworm, Maritigrella crozieri, and found that it is expressed in ciliary cells of the eyes in the larva and in extraocular cells around the brain in the adult. These extraocular cells house hundreds of cilia in an intra-cellular vacuole called a phaosome. Functional assays in human cells show that Maritigrella xenopsin drives phototransduction primarily by coupling to Gαi. These findings highlight similarities between xenopsin and c-opsin and reveal a novel type of opsin-expressing cell that, like jawed vertebrate rods, encloses the ciliary membrane within their own plasma membrane. In the adult we find xenopsin+, extraocular, ciliary cells and we characterize their distinct ultrastructure, revealing that, like jawed vertebrate rod photoreceptors, they enclose their cilia inside their own plasma membrane. We then carry out the first functional cellular assays on a xenopsin, exploring whether polyclad xenopsin can form a photopigment, and which classes of Gα protein it can couple to. We have provided two pieces of evidence that suggest Gαi coupling of xenopsin; primary activation of a Gαi signal transduction cascade in living human cells, and xenopsin and Gαi localization in the same putative ciliary photoreceptor in a flatworm. We have also shown xenopsin protein expression on cilia of cells that form eyes, supporting the possibility that the VxPx motif is also involved in transporting xenopsin to cilia. The discovery of xenopsin+ ciliary cells in the eyes of protostome larvae challenged our views on opsin and photoreceptor evolution by deviating from the invertebrate trend of extraocular ciliary photoreceptors and ocular rhabdomeric/microvillar photoreceptors. Together our findings show similarities between xenopsin and c-opsin and provide the first molecular and functional evidence of ciliary photoreceptors in flatworms.
In Drosophila, the integration of spatial and temporal cues is required to specify neuronal diversity, but how these cues are integrated in neural progenitors ( neuroblasts ) remains unknown. To address this question, we used Targeted DamID to identify the genomic binding sites of the temporal transcription factor Hunchback ( Hb ) in two neuroblasts ( NB5-6 and NB7-4 ) that make different progeny. We found that Hb targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Moreover, each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. Importantly, the Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor, expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4. Our data support a model in which early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage. We identified over 100 loci that are differentially bound by Hb in NB5-6 or NB7-4, which are excellent candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification.
P2X receptors are a family of ligand-gated ion channels that function by opening a transmembrane pore in response to extracellular adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ). The mechanism of pore opening in P2X receptors has been a subject of controversy, with recent crystal structures revealing molecular motions of the extracellular domain following agonist binding. However, the mechanism of pore opening remains poorly understood. Here, we report on the use of photo-switchable cross-linkers as molecular tweezers to monitor a series of inter-residue distances in the transmembrane domain of the P2X2 receptor during activation. These experimentally based structural constraints combined with computational studies provide high-resolution models of the channel in the open and closed states. We show that the extent of the outer pore expansion is significantly reduced compared to the ATP-bound structure. Our data further reveal that the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining helices come closer during opening, likely through a hinge-bending motion. These results provide new insight into the gating mechanism of P2X receptors and establish a versatile strategy applicable to other membrane proteins. In this study, we report on the use of molecular photo-switchable tweezers in conjunction with molecular dynamics ( MD ) simulations to explore the function of a trimeric ion channel. We show that a vertical decrease of the distance separating the inner and outer ends of adjacent pore-lining TM2 helices, likely through bending at a critical ‘gating hinge’, is essential for activation of the P2X2 receptor. Our data demonstrate that TM2 helices in the P2X2 receptor contain a critical ‘hinge’, which facilitates their vertical bending, allowing the inner and outer ends of adjacent TM2 helices to come closer during activation.
Cytokinesis, the physical division of one cell into two, has long been assumed to be powered by a similar molecular mechanism in all animal cells. However, growing evidence suggests that cytokinetic regulation in individual cell types has more variation than previously realized. In the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, each blastomere has a distinct cell fate, specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute drug treatment, we identified cell-type-specific variation in the cytokinetic requirement for a robust forminCYK-1-dependent filamentous-actin ( F-actin ) cytoskeleton. In one cell ( P2 ), this cytokinetic variation is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in another cell ( EMS ) this variation is cell-extrinsically regulated, dependent on both SrcSRC-1 signaling and direct contact with its neighbor cell, P2. Thus, both cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinetic variation in individual cell types and can protect against division failure when the contractile ring is weakened. We used thermogenetics, drug treatment, and embryo microdissection to probe the mechanisms of cell-type-based variation in the regulation of cytokinesis among individual blastomeres within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. We found cell-type-specific differences in both the functional levels and temporal window of activity required for forminCYK-1 activity, but not myosin-IINMY-2 activity, during cytokinesis. We found that, similar to in the one-cell embryo, formincyk-1 ( ts ) embryos again showed cell type variation in the temporal requirement for activity among individual blastomeres. In our previous analysis of the one-cell C. elegans embryo, cytokinesis failed 100% of the time with forminCYK-1 inactivation by thermal upshift to restrictive temperature at any time before mid-ring constriction ( Davies et al., 2014 ). We used fast-acting temperature-sensitive ( ts ) alleles to inactivate two cytokinesis proteins essential for contractile ring constriction in the one-cell embryo ( Davies et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2010 ) : the motor myosin-II ( NMY-2 in C. elegans, hereafter myosin-IINMY-2 ) and the diaphanous formin CYK-1 ( hereafter forminCYK-1 ). We identified cell-type-specific variation in four-cell embryos in the molecular requirement for forminCYK-1, but not myosin-IINMY-2. Together, our data show that both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms contribute to cytokinetic diversity and promote robust cytokinesis when the contractile ring is weakened in specific cell types within the four-cell C. elegans embryo. Therefore, in the four-cell C. elegans embryo, each cell has a unique cell identity and can be individually scored for contractile ring constriction during cytokinesis.
The flagellar sheath, a membranous structure that encases the flagellar shaft of some bacteria, has long been an enigma in the field of microbiology. While it has been hypothesized that the sheath may allow these bacteria to evade host responses to the immunogenic flagellin subunit, we now demonstrate that the rotation of the sheathed flagellum in both the mutualist Vibrio fischeri and the pathogen Vibrio cholerae promotes the release of a potent bacteria-derived immunogen, lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ). LPS is found in the flagellar sheath and is a potent activator of host immune responses. We further present a new role for the flagellar sheath in triggering, rather than circumventing, host immune responses in the model squid-vibrio symbiosis. Such an observation not only has implications for the study of bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella, but also raises important biophysical questions of sheathed-flagellum function. Using the model squid-vibrio symbiosis as a tool to probe the effect of the enigmatic flagellar sheath on host recognition, we uncover a previously unrecognized role for the rotation of sheathed flagella in mediating the release of LPS in both V. fischeri and its pathogenic congener V. cholerae. The flagellar sheath has proved problematic to study; indeed, to our knowledge, there are no mutations that result in the loss of a sheath in otherwise sheathed flagella. Thus, the functional role of the sheath, even as it relates to bacterial motility, remains poorly characterized, and observation of this new phenomenon for the flagellar sheath furthers our understanding of this enigmatic structure and its contribution to bacterial virulence. Further work will build upon these discoveries and clarify the mechanisms underlying signaling during initiation of the squid-vibrio symbiosis; such work includes characterizing the composition of LPS released by V. fischeri during flagellar rotation, identifying the squid receptors that recognize V. fischeri LPS ( Goodson et al., 2005; Krasity et al., 2011 ), and determining any role flagellin may have in activating host responses.
Genome instability is a phenomenon associated with mitotic errors and cancer that can lead to deleterious rearrangements, but also genetic novelty. Here, we describe extreme chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination, a process resulting from hybridization of Arabidopsis plants expressing different centromere histones H3. This process results in the formation of shattered chromosomes from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single, laggard chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucleus. Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by repair through non-homologous end joining ( NHEJ ) or stalled fork repair. Furthermore, mutation of the NHEJ factor DNA Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery. These findings provide a tractable, natural system towards investigating the causes and mechanisms of complex genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with several human disorders. Our results provide evidence for the occurrence of chromosome restructuring when diverged individuals hybridize, identifying a centromere-based mechanism for genomic instability. This phenomenon studied here depends on chimeric CENH3, but a similar effect was observed when the haploid inducer strain expresses CENH3 of a close species. In addition, our results obtained using DNA ligase4-2 mutants suggest that the NHEJ pathway plays an important role in the repair of the haploid inducer chromosomes that contribute to diploid and aneuploid progeny, such that when NHEJ is inhibited, haploid induction frequency increased. Our in silico reconstruction suggests that NHEJ is involved in repairing breaks that occurred on the shattered chromosomes. This result indicates that NHEJ contributes to formation or persistence of aneuploid and diploid progeny and that unrepaired double-stranded DNA breaks increase elimination of the haploid inducer genome, similar to observations in mouse-human hybrid genome elimination. We hypothesize that missegregated chromosomes enter a degradative pathway initiated by endonucleolytic breaks. Occasionally, such chromosomes are rescued.
Latent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) infection is causally linked to several human cancers. EBV expresses viral oncogenes that promote cell growth and inhibit the apoptotic response to uncontrolled proliferation. The EBV oncoprotein LMP1 constitutively activates NFκB and is critical for survival of EBV-immortalized B cells. However, during early infection EBV induces rapid B cell proliferation with low levels of LMP1 and little apoptosis. We sought to define the mechanism of survival in the absence of LMP1/NFκB early after infection. We used BH3 profiling to query mitochondrial regulation of apoptosis and defined a transition from uninfected B cells ( BCL-2 ) to early-infected ( MCL-1/BCL-2 ) and immortalized cells ( BFL-1 ). This dynamic change in B cell survival mechanisms is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on regulation of MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and BFL-1 transcription by the viral EBNA3A protein. EBNA3A regulated the BH3 profile of EBV-infected cells and suppressed apoptosis by promoting MCL-1 mitochondrial localization and increasing BFL-1 mRNA transcription. We found that mature human peripheral blood B cells depend solely on BCL-2 for survival while EBV latent infection further suppressed apoptotic priming during outgrowth by initially upregulating MCL-1, followed by BFL-1. Mechanistically, we identified a new and unique role for the viral latent protein EBNA3A in apoptosis resistance during both early and late EBV-induced B cell proliferation. Therefore, uninfected human peripheral blood CD19+ B cells depend on BCL-2 for survival and EBV upregulates additional survival proteins to potently suppress apoptosis induced by BCL-2 antagonism. Our BH3 profiling experiments predicted that EBV-infected B cells are less primed for apoptosis due to the combined protective effects of MCL-1 and BCL-2 during early proliferation with additional protection afforded by BFL-1 in immortalized B cells.
Arabidopsis thaliana, a small flowering plant, produces a diverse array of metabolites to cope with environmental challenges. These metabolites are shaped by a combination of genetics, geography, environment, and demography. In this study, we measured the variation in specialized metabolites across a population of 797 natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions from Europe. Our results show that all these factors combine to influence the specific chemotypes and their distribution. We found that causal loci in specialized metabolism contain frequent independently generated alleles with patterns suggesting potential within-species convergence. This provides a new perspective on the complexity of the selective forces and mechanisms that shape the generation and distribution of allelic variation that may influence local adaptation. The Arabidopsis-GSL system is an optimal model to study the species-wide processes driving specialized metabolite variation because the identity of the whole biosynthetic pathway is known, including the major causal loci for natural variation. This level of allelic diversity at these loci raises a question of how pathways with this level of diversity and structural variation pass through speciation boundaries. We used a family of specialized metabolites, aliphatic GSLs, and measured their amounts in seeds of A. thaliana to query how genetics, geography, environment, and demography intersect to shape chemotypic variation across Europe. Our results suggest that the intersection of environmental pressure, demography, and genomic complexity gives rise to the pattern of metabolic variation across a plant species.
Tumor-promoting function of apoptotic caspases by an amplification loop involving ROS, macrophages, and JNK in Drosophila. Here, we show that although caspases are activated in a well-studied neoplastic tumor model in Drosophila, oncogenic mutations of the proto-oncogene Ras ( RasV12 ) maintain tumorous cells in an ‘undead’-like condition and transform caspases from tumor suppressors into tumor promotors. Instead of killing cells, caspases now promote the generation of intra- and extracellular reactive oxygen species ( ROS ). One function of the ROS is the recruitment and activation of macrophage-like immune cells which in turn signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK further promotes and amplifies caspase activity, thereby constituting a feedback amplification loop. Interfering with the amplification loop strongly reduces the neoplastic behavior of these cells and significantly improves organismal survival. In conclusion, RasV12-modified caspases initiate a feedback amplification loop involving tumorous epithelial cells and macrophage-like immune cells that is necessary for uncontrolled tumor growth and invasive behavior. This work extends previous models about the conversion of Eiger and JNK signaling from anti-tumor to pro-tumor roles by oncogenic Ras and identifies caspases as essential components of this switch. Although apoptotic caspases are usually considered to be tumor suppressors, under certain conditions, for example in the presence of oncogenic RasV12 in scrib mutant cells, they can also adopt a tumor-promoting role. We report that oncogenic Ras switches the pro-apoptotic activity of caspases into a tumor-promoting one and thereby maintains scrib−/− RasV12 cells in an ‘undead’-like state. Consistently, inhibition of caspases blocks tumor growth and tissue invasion. The tumor-promoting function of apoptotic caspases is dependent on the generation of intra- and extracellular ROS which are required for neoplastic behavior of scrib−/− RasV12 clones.
Oxytocin plays an important role in mediating time perception of social interaction. Here, we report that the subjective duration of social interactions is significantly shorter than that of non-social interactions. Moreover, the strength of this effect is negatively correlated with one’s autistic-like tendency, such that socially less proficient individuals are less susceptible to the effect than socially proficient ones. Critically, intranasal oxytocin administration restores the temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals, whereas the administration of atosiban, a competitive antagonist of oxytocin, diminishes the effect in socially proficient individuals. These findings indicate that perceived time is highly idiosyncratic and ingrained with one’s personality trait. Moreover, they suggest that oxytocin is involved in mediating time perception of social interaction, further supporting the role of oxytocin in human social cognition. The temporal compression effect of perceived social interactions is manifested as motion sequences showing agents acting communicatively are perceived to be significantly shorter in duration as compared with those acting noncommunicatively. The strength of this effect is negatively correlated with one’s autistic-like tendency, such that socially less proficient individuals are less susceptible to the effect than socially proficient ones. Moreover, intranasal oxytocin administration restores the temporal compression effect in socially less proficient individuals, whereas the administration of atosiban, a competitive antagonist of oxytocin, diminishes the effect in socially proficient individuals. These findings indicate that perceived time, rather than being a faithful representation of physical time, is highly idiosyncratic and ingrained with one’s personality trait. Moreover, they suggest that oxytocin is involved in mediating time perception of social interaction, further supporting the role of oxytocin in human social cognition.
The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 virus Spike protein receptor binding domain ( RBD ) and the ACE2 cell surface protein is essential for viral infection of cells. Mutations in the RBD are present in SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern ( VOCs ) that have emerged independently worldwide. For example, the B. 1. 1. 7 lineage has a mutation ( N501Y ) in its Spike RBD that enhances binding to ACE2. There are also ACE2 alleles in humans with mutations in the RBD binding site. Here, we performed a detailed affinity and kinetics analysis of the effect of five common RBD mutations ( K417N, K417T, N501Y, E484K, and S477N ) and two common ACE2 mutations ( S19P and K26R ) on the RBD/ACE2 interaction. We analysed the effects of individual RBD mutations and combinations found in new SARS-CoV-2 Alpha ( B. 1. 1. 7 ), Beta ( B. 1. 351 ), and Gamma ( P1 ) variants. Most of these mutations increased the affinity of the RBD/ACE2 interaction. The exceptions were mutations K417N/T, which decreased the affinity. Taken together with other studies, our results suggest that the N501Y and S477N mutations enhance transmission primarily by enhancing binding, the K417N/T mutations facilitate immune escape, and the E484K mutation enhances binding and immune escape. The effect of the increased affinity for SARS-CoV-2 Spike RBD of the K26R and S19P ACE2 mutants is less clear. The evidence summarised above that WT RBD/ACE2 binding is limiting for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, suggest that carriers of these ACE2 variants will be at greater risk of infection and/or severe disease. We also examined the effect on ACE2 binding of combinations of RBD mutations, including combinations present in VOC-202102–02, a subset of the Alpha lineage ( N501Y ) with the E484K mutation, and the Beta and Gamma variants.
In this study, we report the largest map of multi-phenotype genetic interaction profiles in metazoan cells to date. The map comprises 1367 Drosophila genes implicated in cellular processes including signalling, chromatin and cell cycle regulation. We quantitatively scored 21 phenotypes in cultured cells using automated imaging. First, we inferred gene functions based on statistical genetic interactions, predicted protein complexes and clustered processes by similarity. We generated the map by co-depleting gene pairs by RNAi in cultured Drosophila S2 cells, high-throughput imaging of single-cell phenotypes, and modelling of gene–gene interactions. We selected 1367 genes implicated in key biological processes, that is, signalling, chromatin biology, cell cycle regulation and protein turnover control. Furthermore, we demonstrate an epistatic relationship between Ras/MAPK signalling and SWI/SNF regulators of chromatin remodelling, which we confirmed in vivo. We demonstrate that directional genetic interactions can be identified at a large scale and mapped to other genomic data sets to identify regulatory relationships. This unbiased mapping and automated inference of directional epistatic interactions, made possible by the multivariate phenotyping approach, revealed a detailed circuit diagram of regulatory, temporal and causal relationships of complexes that function during the M-phase of the cell cycle. Inspection of our epistatic map highlighted an unexpected link between chromatin remodelling and RAS signalling. We found genetic interactions between the SWI/SNF complex with both the SWI/SNF-associated chromatin remodeller dalao.
Heterostyly is a widespread floral adaptation that promotes outbreeding in plants. In the genus Primula ( primroses ), heterostyly is controlled by the S-locus supergene that determines the reciprocal arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between the two morphs. However, the identities of the component genes remain unknown. Here, we identify the Primula CYP734A50 gene, encoding a putative brassinosteroid-degrading enzyme, as the G locus that determines the style-length dimorphism. CYP734A50 is only present on the short-styled S-morph haplotype, specifically expressed in S-morph styles, and its loss or inactivation leads to long styles. The gene arose by a duplication specific to the Primulaceae lineage and shows an accelerated rate of molecular evolution. Thus, our results provide a mechanistic explanation for the Primula style-length dimorphism and begin to shed light on the evolution of the S-locus as a prime model for a complex plant supergene. Our combined evidence indicates that CYP734A50 represents the G locus in the Primula heterostyly supergene, whose expression in S-morph styles causes brassinosteroid degradation, limiting cell expansion and style elongation. The proposed duplication and gain of style-specific expression of CYP734A50 in the ancestor of the Primulaceae likely represents this dominant style-shortening mutation. As such, CYP734A50 is a rare example of an identified causal locus in a supergene underlying an adaptive polymorphism that opens the way for understanding the evolutionary origin of the Primula S-locus as an iconic case of a complex supergene. The CYP734A50 presence/absence polymorphism strictly cosegregates with the morph type in all heterostylous species sampled across the Primula phylogeny, and the gene is absent or inactivated in all seven cases of derived long homostyly. Together with the VIGS results, this strongly supports the conclusion that CYP734A50 is the G locus of the Primula heterostyly supergene that determines the style-length polymorphism.
Kisspeptin ( Kiss1 ) and neurokinin B ( NKB ) neurocircuits are essential for pubertal development and fertility. Kisspeptin neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus ( Kiss1ARH ) co-express Kiss1, NKB, dynorphin, and glutamate. These neurons are thought to provide an episodic, excitatory drive to gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1 ( GnRH ) neurons. However, the synaptic mechanisms of this drive are unknown. We used optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular pharmacology, and single cell RT-PCR to characterize the cellular basis for synchronized Kiss1ARH neuronal activity in mice. We found that high-frequency photostimulation of Kiss1ARH neurons evoked local release of NKB and dynorphin, which were found to synchronize the Kiss1ARH neuronal firing. The light-evoked synchronous activity caused robust excitation of GnRH neurons by a synaptic mechanism that also involved glutamatergic input to preoptic Kiss1 neurons from Kiss1ARH neurons. We propose that Kiss1ARH neurons play a dual role of driving episodic secretion of GnRH through the differential release of peptide and amino acid neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function.
Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling is known to contribute to the maintenance of pluripotency in cells and to promote mesodermal differentiation over neural differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which BMP controls differentiation are not well understood. Here, we report that BMP regulates differentiation by blocking the downregulation of Cdh1, an event that accompanies the earliest stages of neural and mesodermal differentiation. We find that loss of Cdh1 is a limiting requirement for differentiation of pluripotent cells, and that experimental suppression of Cdh1 activity rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. We further show that BMP acts prior to and independently of Cdh1 to prime pluripotent cells for mesoderm differentiation, thus helping to reinforce the block to neural differentiation. We conclude that differentiation depends not only on exposure to appropriate extrinsic cues but also on morphogenetic events that control receptivity to those differentiation cues, and we explain how a key pluripotency signal, BMP, feeds into this control mechanism. We propose that BMP suppresses differentiation by maintaining expression of Cdh1, which interferes with efficient neural and mesodermal differentiation. Higher levels of BMP also impose a posterior identity that primes cells for mesoderm and is incompatible with a neural fate. We identify the loss of Cdh1 activity as a limiting event for the earliest stages of neural differentiation and propose that BMP controls differentiation in part by maintaining Cdh1 expression. We also show that the BMP target gene Id1 imposes a proximal posterior identity on undifferentiated cells, priming them towards mesoderm.
Cep120 plays a critical role in maintaining centrosome homeostasis in quiescent cells by inhibiting the maturation of the daughter centriole. In quiescent cells, the two centrioles of the centrosome are inherently asymmetric structures that differ in age, morphology, and function. Cep120 is a daughter centriole-associated ciliopathy protein that is preferentially enriched on the outer wall of the centriolar microtubules. Depletion of Cep120 in quiescent mouse and human cells leads to the accumulation of pericentriolar material ( PCM ) components, including pericentrin, Cdk5Rap2, ninein, and Cep170. This accumulation results in increased microtubule-nucleation activity at the centrosome. Consequently, loss of Cep120 leads to aberrant dynein-dependent trafficking of centrosomal proteins, dispersal of centriolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. Our results indicate that Cep120 helps to maintain centrosome homeostasis by inhibiting untimely maturation of the daughter centriole, and defines a potentially new molecular defect underlying the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune Asphyxiating Thoracic Dystrophy and Joubert syndrome. In quiescent cells, loss of Cep120 initiates a series of changes in protein localization and abundance that ultimately result in defective ciliary assembly and function. The first step involves changes in the maturation state of the daughter centriole, on which Cep120 is preferentially enriched. These changes in turn disrupt ciliary assembly and signaling, a process that requires CS-dependent delivery of essential factors to the centrosome.
Neuron-glia interactions are essential for the maturation of neural circuits in the developing central nervous system ( CNS ). However, little is known about the pathways that mediate communication between neurons and glial cells in the developing CNS. In this study, we investigated neuron-glia signaling in the developing retina, where we demonstrate that retinal waves reliably induce calcium transients in Müller glial cells ( MCs ). During cholinergic waves, MC calcium transients were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, whereas during glutamatergic waves, MC calcium transients were inhibited by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. This indicates that the responsiveness of MCs changes to match the neurotransmitter used to support retinal waves. Using an optical glutamate sensor, we show that the decline in MC calcium transients is caused by a reduction in the amount of glutamate reaching MCs. Together, these studies indicate that neurons and MCs exhibit correlated activity during a critical period of retinal maturation that is enabled by neurotransmitter spillover from retinal synapses. We simultaneously performed whole-cell recordings of retinal ganglion cells ( RGCs ) and two-photon imaging of calcium indicators or glutamate sensors expressed specifically in MCs in order to investigate if neurotransmitters released during retinal waves reliably induce calcium transients in MCs. In addition, we determined which receptors mediate these neuron-glia interactions. We found that retinal waves were correlated with calcium transients in a large proportion of MCs, demonstrating that spontaneous activity encompasses both neuronal and glial networks at this age. Moreover, the mechanism of interaction between neurons and MCs we observed during cholinergic retinal waves is similar to previous findings in visual cortex and hippocampus, where cholinergic neuron stimulation leads to astrocyte calcium transients via activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and require IP3R2 ( Chen et al., 2012; Navarrete et al., 2012 ). Whether neuronal activity during retinal waves guides the development of MCs is still unclear. Our physiological results indicate that MCs express multiple neurotransmitter receptor types throughout this period, allowing neuronal control of MC activity to be sustained as neuronal synchronization shifts from being dependent on cholinergic to glutamatergic signaling. The proportion of MCs that responded to waves with calcium transients decreased significantly from P9 to P11, despite the presence of retinal waves.
Estimating the postmortem interval ( PMI ), or the time elapsed since death, is a critical task in death investigations. However, existing methods, such as forensic entomology, are susceptible to errors and biases. Here, we show that changes in the microbial community associated with a decomposing corpse can be used to estimate PMI. In a mouse model system, we demonstrate that microbial community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable over 48 days, allowing PMI to be estimated with an accuracy of approximately 3 days. These results provide a detailed understanding of bacterial and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system and suggest that microbial community data can be developed into a novel forensic tool for estimating PMI. We rigorously tested whether changes in microbial communities are predictable over the timeline of decomposition, which is crucial for assessing whether microbes can be used as a ‘clock’ to estimate PMI. We characterized microbial community change in three external sites and one invasively sampled internal site in 40 destructively sampled mouse corpses over 48 days. We used a combination of culture-independent, high-throughput DNA sequencing approaches to characterize bacteria, archaea, and microbial eukaryotes in each sample. Our results provide a proof-of-principle demonstration that microbial community ecology of decomposing corpses has potential to be developed into a complementary forensics tool for estimation of PMI.
Bilaterian animals share a common set of developmental genes that display conserved expression patterns in the embryo, including the Hox genes, which define different identities along the anterior–posterior axis. Hox proteins exert their function by interacting with TALE transcription factors. However, Hox and TALE members are also present in some non-bilaterian phyla, raising the question of how Hox–TALE interactions evolved to provide positional information. By using proteins from unicellular and multicellular lineages, we showed that these networks emerged from an ancestral generic motif present in Hox and other related protein families. Interestingly, Hox-TALE networks experienced additional and extensive molecular innovations that were likely crucial for differentiating Hox functions along body plans. Together, our results highlight how homeobox gene families evolved during eukaryote evolution to eventually constitute a major patterning system in Eumetazoans. We propose that Hox-TALE networks constituted an ancestral regulatory module that was later on exploited for patterning functions in Bilateria. This network was effective as soon as different interaction modes could exist with duplicated Hox family members, allowing diversifying patterning functions along the body axis. This original molecular system was subsequently co-opted by the various contexts of embryogenesis in different eumetazoan phyla, for axis or tissue patterning. Hox genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of all bilaterian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis. Given their important patterning roles, Hox genes are thought to have strongly contributed to morphological diversification of bilaterian organisms during evolution. Overall, our study describes how the molecular cues underlying the Hox–TALE patterning system in Bilateria was established stepwise during eukaryote evolution.
Synaptic and extrasynaptic localization of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) has been difficult to study due to the nanometer scale of synapses and the limitations of traditional microscopy techniques. To overcome these challenges, we used super-resolution microscopy to study the dynamics of AMPARs in rat neurons. We labeled AMPARs with fluorescent probes of different sizes, including organic dyes, small quantum dots (sQDs), and large quantum dots (bQDs). We found that >90% of AMPARs labeled with sQDs or organic dyes were diffusing in confined nanodomains within post-synaptic densities (PSDs), which were stable for 15 min or longer. In contrast, <10% of sQD-labeled AMPARs were extrasynaptic and highly mobile, while 5–10% of bQD-labeled AMPARs were in PSDs and 90–95% were extrasynaptic. These findings suggest that AMPARs rapidly enter stable nanodomains in PSDs with lifetimes >15 min and do not accumulate in extrasynaptic membranes.
Acute hypoxia is known to cause an increase in voltage-gated sodium current ( INa ) in central neurons, but the underlying mechanism has been unknown. Here, we show that hypoxia activates the Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier ( SUMO ) pathway in rat cerebellar granule neurons ( CGN ) and that SUMOylation of NaV1. 2 channels increases INa. The time-course for SUMOylation of single NaV1. 2 channels at the cell surface and changes in INa coincide, and both are prevented by mutation of NaV1. 2-Lys38 or application of a deSUMOylating enzyme. Within 40 s, hypoxia-induced linkage of SUMO1 to the channels is complete, shifting the voltage-dependence of channel activation so that depolarizing steps evoke larger sodium currents. The SUMO pathway and NaV1. 2 are identified as potential targets for neuroprotective interventions given the recognized role of INa in hypoxic brain damage.
Ross River virus ( RRV ) is an important mosquito-borne pathogen in Australia, the Pacific Islands, and potentially at risk of emerging worldwide. We built a mechanistic model for the thermal response of RRV to understand the role of temperature in its transmission. Our results show that RRV transmission peaks at moderate temperatures ( 26. 4°C ) and declines to zero at thermal limits ( 17. 0 and 31. 5°C ). The model accurately predicts that transmission is year-round endemic in the tropics but seasonal in temperate areas, resulting in a nationwide seasonal peak in human cases. Climate warming will likely increase transmission in temperate areas ( where most Australians live ) but decrease transmission in tropical areas where mean temperatures are already near the thermal optimum. These results illustrate the importance of nonlinear models for inferring the role of temperature in disease dynamics and predicting responses to climate change. Our results support a general pattern of intermediate thermal optima for transmission where the well-resolved optimal temperature is driven by adult mosquito lifespan, but upper and lower thermal limits are more uncertain and may be determined by unique traits for different vector–pathogen systems. The strongest statistical signal of temperature on disease is expected in temperate regions where mean temperature varies along the rapidly rising portion of the R0 curve ( ~20–25°C ). Additionally, upper thermal limits of mosquito-borne disease transmission are primarily determined by vector life history traits with symmetrical thermal performance curves rather than rate-based traits with asymmetrical thermal performance curves.
Motor cortical beta oscillations have been extensively studied for decades, yet their behavioral correlates remain poorly understood. To investigate how changes in population neural activity, beta oscillations, and behavior are linked, we recorded multi-scale neural activity from motor cortex while three macaques performed a novel neurofeedback task. We found that reaches preceded by a reduction in beta power exhibited significantly faster movement onset times than reaches preceded by an increase in beta power. Further, population neural activity was found to shift farther from a movement onset state during beta oscillations that were neurofeedback-induced or naturally occurring during reaching tasks. This finding establishes a population neural basis for slowed movement onset following periods of beta oscillatory activity. Notably, this shift in neural population was also seen in naturally occurring beta oscillations during reaching tasks, suggesting that beta oscillations reflect a common signature of spiking patterns even in different task contexts. This study ties together existing works on behavioral correlates of beta oscillations with hypotheses of how the motor cortex encodes movement onset through the lens of population-level neural activity. Our result that volitionally increasing and decreasing motor cortical beta power with neurofeedback precedes slower and faster movement onset times supports the hypothesis that beta oscillations are linked to neural patterns that slow onset of new movements ( Gilbertson et al., 2005 ). Our results add to previously reported findings of elevated beta power prior to and after well-trained movements ( Donoghue et al., 1998; Murthy and Fetz, 1992; Sanes and Donoghue, 1993 ). In this study, simultaneously recorded units were analyzed and shown to exhibit different activity during neurofeedback-induced beta oscillations compared with natural beta oscillations occurring during typical reaching tasks. Despite differences at an individual unit level, population-level analyses show that beta oscillations promote a consistent movement-slowing state during both the CO and NR tasks, matching what is observed behaviorally.
TRAF2 is a component of TNF superfamily signalling complexes and plays an essential role in the regulation and homeostasis of immune cells. TRAF2 deficient mice die around birth, therefore its role in adult tissues is not well-explored. The role of the TRAF2 RING is controversial, as it has been claimed that the atypical TRAF2 RING cannot function as a ubiquitin E3 ligase but counterclaimed that TRAF2 RING requires a co-factor, sphingosine-1-phosphate, that is generated by the enzyme sphingosine kinase 1 ( Sphk1 ), to function as an E3 ligase. In this study, keratinocyte-specific deletion of Traf2, but not Sphk1 deficiency, disrupted TNF mediated NF-κB and MAP kinase signalling and caused epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation. This inflammation was driven by TNF, cell death, non-canonical NF-κB and the adaptive immune system, and might therefore represent a clinically relevant model of psoriasis. TRAF2 therefore has essential tissue specific functions that do not overlap with those of Sphk1. In keratinocytes, absence of TRAF2 caused a delay in TNF-induced activation of NF-κB and MAPK, and sensitivity to killing by TNF was increased. Absence of TRAF2 in keratinocytes in vivo resulted in psoriasis-like epidermal hyperplasia and skin inflammation. Our results highlight the important role TRAF2 plays to protect keratinocytes from cell death and to down-regulate inflammatory responses. Thus, TRAF2-deficient keratinocytes do not need to be stimulated by bacteria to produce TNF, and TNF-induced death sets up a potentially vicious cycle of inflammation. Concomitant deletion of Tnf in mice with Traf2-deficient keratinocytes breaks this vicious cycle and prevents apoptosis of keratinocytes and early onset of the psoriasis-like phenotype. Primary keratinocytes isolated from wild-type, Traf2EKO and Sphk1-/- mice were tested and, similarly to MEFs and MDFs, TNF signalling was delayed and weakened in Traf2-deficient, but not Sphk1-deficient keratinocytes. Traf2-/-, but not Sphk1-/-, keratinocytes were also sensitive to TNF-induced death, and this was associated with a rapid reduction in cFLIPL levels and caspase-8 cleavage. In the absence of TNF, Traf2-deficient keratinocytes still produce inflammatory cytokines via the non-canonical NF-κB pathway that ultimately generate the same psoriasis-like phenotype in mice but with slower onset. These cytokines recruit inflammatory immune cells to the skin, including neutrophils and IFNγ+ T cells.
Synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) store and secrete non-peptide neurotransmitters at synapses. Following exocytosis, their membranes are rapidly recaptured by endocytosis and recycled for the generation of new fusion-competent SVs. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( CME ) has been proposed to play a key role in this endocytic traffic. However, we have identified a dynamin 1-, dynamin 3- and clathrin-independent pathway of synaptic vesicle recycling mediated by bulk endocytosis. Bulk endocytosis of SV membranes leads to the formation of large endocytic vacuoles ( ‘bulk’ endosomes ), which subsequently disappear in parallel with the reappearance of new SVs. We have used synapses of dynamin 1 and 3 double knock-out neurons, where CME is dramatically impaired, to gain insight into this process. Massive formation of bulk endosomes was not defective, but rather enhanced, in the absence of dynamin 1 and 3. The subsequent conversion of bulk endosomes into SVs was not accompanied by the accumulation of clathrin coated buds on their surface and this process proceeded even after further clathrin knock-down, suggesting its independence of clathrin. These findings support the existence of a pathway for SV reformation that bypasses the requirement for clathrin and dynamin 1/3 and that operates during intense synaptic activity.
Glucocorticoids are among the most commonly prescribed drugs, but there is currently no biomarker that can quantify their action. To address this need, we conducted a randomized, crossover, single-blind, discovery study to identify and validate circulating biomarkers of glucocorticoid ( GC ) action. Ten subjects with primary adrenal insufficiency ( and no other endocrinopathies ) were admitted to an in-patient clinic and studied during physiological GC exposure and withdrawal. The transcriptome in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, plasma miRNAomic, and serum metabolomics were compared between the interventions using integrated multi-omic analysis. We identified a transcriptomic profile derived from two tissues and a multi-omic cluster, both predictive of GC exposure. A microRNA ( miR-122-5p ) that was correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by GC exposure was identified ( p=0. 009 ) and replicated in independent studies with varying GC exposure ( 0. 01 ≤ p≤0. 05 ). We have generated results that construct the basis for successful discovery of biomarkers to measure effects of glucocorticoids, allowing strategies to individualize and optimize glucocorticoid therapy, and shedding light on disease etiology related to unphysiological GC exposure, such as in cardiovascular disease and obesity.
Activation of the mTORC1 complex in response to amino acids is mediated by a complex containing RAG GTPases, RAGULATOR, and the vacuolar ATPase. Amino acids cause translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes, which is an obligate step for activation. We used live imaging of the mTORC1 component RAPTOR and a cell permeant fluorescent analogue of di-leucine methyl ester to examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of this translocation. We found that translocation to lysosomes is a transient event occurring within 2 min of amino acid addition and peaking within 5 min. It is temporally coupled with fluorescent leucine appearance in lysosomes and is sustained in comparison to amino acid stimulation. Sestrin2 and the vacuolar ATPase are negative and positive regulators of mTORC1 activity in our experimental system. Phosphorylation of canonical mTORC1 targets is delayed compared to lysosomal translocation, suggesting a dynamic and transient passage of mTORC1 from the lysosomal surface before targeting its substrates elsewhere.
Antigen uptake by dendritic cells ( DCs ) and intracellular routing of antigens to specific compartments is regulated by C-type lectin receptors ( CLRs ) that recognize glycan structures. We show that the modification of Ovalbumin ( OVA ) with the glycan-structure LewisX ( LeX ) re-directs OVA to the C-type lectin receptor MGL1. LeX-modification of OVA favored Th1 skewing of CD4+ T cells and enhanced cross-priming of CD8+ T cells. While cross-presentation of native OVA requires high antigen dose and TLR stimuli, LeX modification reduces the required amount 100-fold and obviates its dependence on TLR signaling. The OVA-LeX-induced enhancement of T cell cross-priming is MGL1-dependent as shown by reduced CD8+ effector T cell frequencies in MGL1-deficient mice. Moreover, MGL1-mediated cross-presentation of OVA-LeX neither required TAP-transporters nor Cathepsin-S and was still observed after prolonged intracellular storage of antigen in Rab11+LAMP1+ compartments. We conclude that controlled neo-glycosylation of antigens can crucially influence intracellular routing of antigens, the nature and strength of immune responses and should be considered for optimizing current vaccination strategies.
Burkholderia thailandensis is a bacterium that uses acyl-homoserine lactone ( AHL )-mediated quorum sensing ( QS ) to regulate the expression of hundreds of genes. QS is a form of cell-to-cell communication that allows bacteria to coordinate gene expression in response to changes in population density. Here, we show that QS also controls the expression of type VI secretion ( T6S ) toxin-immunity systems in B. thailandensis. T6S is a contact-dependent system that allows bacteria to kill or inhibit the growth of neighboring cells. We demonstrate that T6S is required to constrain the proliferation of QS mutants in colony cocultures of a BtaR1 QS signal receptor mutant and its parent. However, the BtaR1 mutant is not constrained by and outcompetes its parent in broth cocultures, presumably because no cell contact occurs and there is a metabolic cost associated with QS gene activation. The increased fitness of the wild type over the BtaR1 mutant during agar surface growth is dependent on an intact T6SS-1 apparatus. Thus, QS activates B. thailandensis T6SS-1 growth inhibition and this control serves to police and constrain QS mutants. This work defines a novel role for T6Ss in intraspecies mutant control.
Glutamatergic drive along the septo-temporal axis of hippocampus boosts prelimbic oscillations in the neonatal mouse. Long-range coupling within prefrontal-hippocampal networks that account for cognitive performance emerges early in life, and the discontinuous hippocampal theta bursts have been proposed to drive the generation of neonatal prefrontal oscillations. However, the cellular substrate of these early interactions is still unresolved. Here, we selectively target optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic projection neurons in the CA1 area of either dorsal or intermediate/ventral hippocampus at neonatal age to elucidate their contribution to the emergence of prefrontal oscillatory entrainment. We show that despite stronger theta and ripples power in dorsal hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex is mainly coupled with intermediate/ventral hippocampus by phase-locking of neuronal firing via dense direct axonal projections. Theta band-confined activation by light of pyramidal neurons in intermediate/ventral but not dorsal CA1 that were transfected by in utero electroporation with high-efficiency channelrhodopsin boosts prefrontal oscillations. Our data causally elucidate the cellular origin of the long-range coupling in the developing brain. We provide causal evidence that theta frequency-specific activation of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 area of intermediate and ventral hippocampus, but not of dorsal hippocampus, elicits broad band oscillations in the prefrontal cortex of neonatal mice via dense axonal projections. The tight coupling by synchrony and the directed information flow from hippocampal CA1 area to prefrontal cortex via direct axonal projections suggest that the hippocampus acts already at neonatal age as a drive for prefrontal activation. Moreover, the differences identified between the dorsal hippocampus – prefrontal cortex and intermediate/ventral hippocampus – prefrontal cortex communication argue for prominent augmentation of driving force along the septo-temporal hippocampal axis.
RNA polymerase II ( RNAPII ) is a crucial enzyme for transcription in mammalian cells, and its C-terminal domain ( CTD ) undergoes extensive post-translational modifications to regulate chromatin states and RNA processing. The CTD is composed of multiple heptapeptide repeats with consensus sequence Y1-S2-P3-T4-S5-P6-S7, where Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation mark transcription initiation, and Serine-2 phosphorylation coincides with productive elongation. In vertebrates, the CTD has eight non-canonical substitutions of Serine-7 into Lysine-7 ( K7 ), which can be acetylated ( K7ac ) or mono- and di-methylated ( K7me1 and K7me2 ). Here, we show that K7me1 and K7me2 are present during the earliest stages of transcription and precede or accompany Serine-5 and Serine-7 phosphorylation. In contrast, K7ac is associated with RNAPII elongation, Serine-2 phosphorylation, and mRNA expression. We identify an unexpected balance between RNAPII K7 methylation and acetylation at gene promoters, which fine-tunes gene expression levels. Using new antibodies specific to CTD-K7me1 and CTD-K7me2, we show that these novel modifications are present at the promoters of genes that are productively transcribed into mature RNA, but define the earliest stages of the transcription cycle. We also show that mutation of CTD-K7 residues is compatible with viability of mouse fibroblasts, and suggest that global serine phosphorylation and RNAPII localization are independent of the presence or absence of K7 residues. Our results suggest that the extent of productive transcription at active genes with similar RNAPII recruitment to their promoters is modulated at the level of CTD-K7 modifications, with methylation being associated with less productive transcription, and K7 acetylation being most enriched at the highest expressed genes.
Skeletal muscle satellite cells ( SCs ) are quiescent in their niche and upon muscle injury, they exit quiescence, proliferate to repair muscle tissue, and self-renew to replenish the SC population. To understand the mechanisms involved in maintaining SC quiescence, we identified gene transcripts that were differentially expressed during SC activation following muscle injury. Transcripts encoding RNA binding proteins were among the most significantly changed and included the mRNA decay factor Tristetraprolin ( TTP ). TTP promotes the decay of MyoD mRNA, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of myogenic commitment, via binding to the MyoD mRNA 3′ untranslated region. Upon SC activation, p38α/β MAPK phosphorylates MAPKAP2 and inactivates TTP, stabilizing MyoD mRNA. Satellite cell specific knockdown of TTP precociously activates SCs in vivo, enabling MyoD accumulation, differentiation, and cell fusion into myofibers. Regulation of mRNAs by TTP appears to function as one of several critical post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms controlling SC homeostasis. We propose that TTP may be involved in down-regulating MyoD mRNA and other TTP-target transcripts expressed by myoblasts, during the initial formation of a quiescent SC population or in reacquisition of quiescence following an injury. TTP suppresses transcripts for SC activation as a mechanism for immediate exit from quiescence. Upon muscle injury, p38α/β MAPK is rapidly activated resulting in phosphorylation of TTP. TTP may be required for SC quiescence as it is present in quiescent SCs, is rapidly inhibited by p38α/β MAPK signaling within minutes of SC activation, and reduces the half-life of MyoD mRNA. Therefore, loss of TTP from skeletal muscle tissue should precociously activate SCs, promoting inappropriate MyoD expression, and aberrant cell cycle entry.
Infant mice lacking the interleukin 10 receptor ( IL10R ) are known to develop very early onset inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ). However, the role of IL10R in regulating lamina propria macrophage function during infant development and whether macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling is required to prevent colitis in infancy is unknown. Here, we show that although signs of colitis are absent in IL10R-deficient mice during the first two weeks of life, intestinal inflammation and macrophage dysfunction begin during the third week of life, concomitant with weaning and accompanying diversification of the intestinal microbiota. Interestingly, macrophage depletion with clodronate inhibited the development of colitis, while the absence of IL10R specifically on macrophages sensitized infant mice to the development of colitis. These results indicate that IL10R-mediated regulation of macrophage function during the early postnatal period is indispensable for preventing the development of murine colitis. Our data demonstrate that the requirement for macrophage-intrinsic IL10R signaling develops during a critical developmental transition, which has important implications for understanding factors that initiate colitis in infants with genetic deficiencies in IL10R signaling.
Transposons and other germline genes in Caenorhabditis elegans are regulated by the piRNA pathway, which is mediated by the mutator complex that synthesizes high levels of siRNAs through the activity of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, the steps between mRNA recognition by the piRNA pathway and siRNA amplification by the mutator complex are unknown. Here, we identify the Tudor domain protein SIMR-1 as acting downstream of piRNA production and upstream of mutator complex-dependent siRNA biogenesis. SIMR-1 localizes to distinct subcellular foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, two phase-separated condensates that are the sites of piRNA-dependent mRNA recognition and mutator complex-dependent siRNA amplification, respectively. Thus, our data suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates in organizing the piRNA pathway and promoting mRNA regulation by the mutator complex. We demonstrate that SIMR-1 is required at a step between the piRNA pathway and the mutator complex. SIMR-1 may function similarly to how Krimper coordinates Ago3 and Aubergine during ping pong piRNA biogenesis in Drosophila. SIMR-1 localizes to cytoplasmic foci near P granules, Z granules, and Mutator foci, implicating a series of distinct perinuclear condensates in the regulation of mRNAs by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex. Therefore, this work identifies SIMR-1 as a factor that acts downstream of PRG-1 to mediate the production of secondary siRNAs by the mutator complex, and suggests a role for multiple perinuclear condensates to promote mRNA regulation by the piRNA pathway and mutator complex. In C. elegans, a small RNA amplification pathway dependent on the mutator complex synthesizes secondary downstream siRNAs from piRNA-targeted mRNAs to trigger robust and heritable silencing.
Bistability in Purkinje Neurons of Larval Zebrafish Reveals AMPA Receptor Mediated Synaptic Excitation Drives State-Dependent Bursting  
    Purkinje neurons are central to cerebellar function and have been shown to exhibit bistability when recorded in vitro or in vivo under anesthesia. However, the existence of bistability in vivo in awake animals is disputed. Here, we demonstrate bistability in Purkinje neurons of unanesthetized larval zebrafish ( Danio rerio ) by recording intracellularly from these neurons. We show that Purkinje neurons can be found in either a tonic or bursting mode and that they can spontaneously toggle from one mode to another. Tonic firing was seen in depolarized regimes and bursting at hyperpolarized membrane potentials. Purkinje neurons could switch from one state to another spontaneously or with current injection. While GABAAR or NMDAR were not required for bursting, activation of AMPARs by climbing fibers ( CFs ) was sufficient to trigger bursts. We also show that initiation of motor neuron spiking is correlated with increased incidence of CF EPSPs and membrane depolarization. Developmentally, bistability was observed soon after Purkinje neuron specification and persists at least until late larval stages. We conclude that bistability is a conserved feature of Purkinje neurons from fish to mammals and that AMPA receptor mediated synaptic excitation drives state-dependent bursting in Purkinje neurons of larval zebrafish.
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a fundamental cellular process by which cells internalize molecules and proteins from the plasma membrane. During this process, the actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in generating the force required to internalize endocytic pits against the tension of the plasma membrane. Here, we show that a minimal branched actin network composed of actin, the Arp2/3 complex, and capping protein is sufficient to generate sufficient force to internalize endocytic pits against mammalian plasma membrane tension. We developed a multiscale model of actin in mammalian endocytosis by combining a continuum membrane mechanics model with filament-based simulations of actin polymerization coupled to endocytic pit internalization. Our results show that a minimal branched actin network is sufficient to create sustained internalization of an endocytic pit against physiological membrane tension. Actin filament self-organization and bending, which arise from the spatial distribution of actin-coat attachments around the curved endocytic pit, allow the actin network to adapt to changing loads. We determined that ~200 molecules of Arp2/3 complex accumulate at clathrin-mediated endocytosis sites over time, and incorporating this number into our multiscale model allowed us to investigate the spatial organization of actin and force generation capacity of the endocytic network. Our results show that the actin network self-organizes around the endocytic pit, with actin filaments bending between attachment sites in the coat and the base of the pit. The elastic energy stored in bent filaments contributes to endocytic internalization, and elevated membrane tension directs more growing filaments toward the base of the pit, increasing actin nucleation and bending for increased force production.
Macropinocytosis is a cellular process by which cells internalize large volumes of extracellular fluid into large vesicles called macropinosomes. The formation of macropinosomes critically depends on the development of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, which eventually forms the macropinocytic cup. We show that in Dictyostelium cells, macropinocytic cups form around intense patches of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate ( PIP3 ), active Ras, and active Rac. These signalling patches are invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR/WAVE at their periphery, which drives the formation of a hollow ring of F-actin to extend the walls of the macropinocytic cup. We propose that cup-shaped plasma membrane structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/PIP3, which recruit a ring of actin nucleators to their periphery. Macropinosomes develop from cup-shaped projections of the plasma membrane, whose walls are driven outwards by actin polymerization, and contain a central patch of activated Ras and PIP3 throughout their life. In Dictyostelium, this patch is invariably associated with a ring of active SCAR at its edge. We propose that this ring of active SCAR is recruited by the signalling patch and drives a hollow ring of F-actin to extend the walls of the macropinocytic cup. Using lattice light sheet microscopy, we map the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators such as SCAR and WASP with respect to signalling molecules including PIP3 and active Ras. This leads us to propose a new and general hypothesis for the formation of cups from the plasma membrane.
Cohesin is a ring-shaped protein complex that holds sister chromatids together from the time of DNA replication until anaphase in eukaryotic cell division. The cohesin complex is loaded onto DNA by a distinct protein complex containing Scc2NIPBL and Scc4Mau2 ( Scc2/4 ). The Scc2/4 complex determines the localization of cohesin across the genome, and proper cohesin loading is essential for cell division. Defects in cohesin loading can cause chromosome missegregation and aberrant transcriptional regulation, leading to severe developmental defects in multicellular organisms. Here, we report the crystal structure of yeast Scc4 in complex with an N-terminal fragment of Scc2. The structure shows that Scc4 is a TPR array that envelops an extended Scc2 peptide. We demonstrate that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is required to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and to build pericentromeric cohesion. These findings reveal the role of Scc4 in determining the localization of cohesin loading and establish a molecular basis for Scc2/4 recruitment to centromeres. Using budding yeast, we show that a conserved patch on the surface of Scc4 is required to recruit Scc2/4 to centromeres and to build pericentromeric cohesion. We also demonstrate that this function is separable from the essential role of Scc2/4 in establishing sister chromatid cohesion across the genome. We have derived separation of function alleles that uncouple cohesin loading from cohesin targeting to centromeres. These experiments demonstrate that cohesin targeting in yeast depends on Scc4. We show that perturbation of the conserved patch on Scc4 eliminates centromeric localization of Scc2 in mitotic cells and reduces association of the cohesin subunit, Scc1, with the centromere and pericentromere, but not with chromosome arms.
Being born late in the active season may have important effects on the growth, fattening, winter survival, and reproduction of hibernators. In this study, we investigated the differences in growth, fattening, energetic responses, winter survival, and fecundity between early-born ( ‘EB’ ) and late-born ( ‘LB’ ) juvenile garden dormice ( Eliomys quercinus ). We found that LB juveniles grew and gained mass twice as fast as EB individuals, but reached lower fat content prior to hibernation. Torpor use was low during intensive growth, but increased during pre-hibernation fattening. LB juveniles showed higher torpor use, reached similar body sizes, but lower fat content than EB individuals before hibernation. Finally, LB individuals showed similar patterns of hibernation, but a higher proportion of breeders during the following year than EB dormice. These results suggest that torpor is incompatible with growth but promotes fattening and consolidates pre-hibernation fat depots. In garden dormice, being born late in the reproductive season is associated with a fast life history.
The C. elegans neural editome reveals an ADAR target mRNA required for proper chemotaxis. To date, the targets responsible for the chemosensory defects of C. elegans ADARs remain unknown. In the present study, we sought to understand the neurobiological effects of RNA editing in worms by dissecting the neural gene regulatory role of ADR-2, the only A-to-I editing enzyme in C. elegans. Although ADARs play critical roles in editing codons of neuronal transcripts to generate the proteomic diversity needed for proper neuronal function in mammals, our data indicate the aberrant behavioral phenotypes caused by lack of C. elegans adr-2 are a result of altered neural gene expression rather than recoding events. This is the first study to link a phenotype associated with loss of C. elegans ADAR enzymes to editing-dependent regulation of a specific gene. In this study, we have provided the first analysis of the tissue-specific role of ADR-2, both in A-to-I editing and in regulating neural gene expression in C. elegans. Combining neural cell isolation with RNA-sequencing and editing site detection with SAILOR, we identified over 7300 A-to-I editing sites in the C. elegans neural transcriptome, including 104 novel edited genes. The neural editome was queried for genes involved in chemotaxis or locomotion, and an edited mRNA, clec-41, was identified whose neural expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring clec-41 expression in adr-2 deficient neural cells rescued the chemotaxis defect, providing the first evidence that neuronal phenotypes of ADAR mutants can be caused by altered gene expression.
Influenza A virus ( IAV ) is known to induce host shutoff, a common strategy used by viruses to repress cellular mRNA translation and concomitantly allow the efficient translation of viral mRNAs. Here, we explore the mechanisms that IAV utilizes to induce host shutoff using RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling. Our results show that viral transcripts are not preferentially translated, and instead, the decline in cellular protein synthesis is mediated by viral takeover of the mRNA pool. Furthermore, our measurements reveal strong variability in the levels of cellular transcripts reduction, with short transcripts being less affected by IAV. These mRNAs that are refractory to IAV infection are enriched in cell maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation. Interestingly, we show that the continuous oxidative phosphorylation activity is important for viral propagation. Our results advance our understanding of IAV-induced shutoff and suggest a mechanism that facilitates the translation of genes with important housekeeping functions. We demonstrate that the relative reduction in cellular mRNA expression is the main cause for host shutoff during infection, and that viral mRNAs take over 53. 8% of the translation activity in the cells as 57. 3% of the mRNAs in the cells are viral at 8 hpi. Our findings are consistent with the notion that NS1 is not required for the shutoff of host cell protein production, and that PA-X endonuclease activity plays a dominant role in host shutoff during IAV infection.
Gradients of signaling proteins are essential for inducing tissue morphogenesis. However, the mechanisms of gradient formation remain controversial. In this study, we characterized the distribution of fluorescently-tagged signaling proteins, FGF and FGFR, expressed at physiological levels from the genomic knock-in alleles in Drosophila. FGF produced in the larval wing imaginal-disc moves to the air-sac-primordium ( ASP ) through FGFR-containing cytonemes that extend from the ASP to contact the wing-disc source. The number of FGF-receiving cytonemes extended by ASP cells decreases gradually with increasing distance from the source, generating a recipient-specific FGF gradient. Acting as a morphogen in the ASP, FGF activates concentration-dependent gene expression, inducing pointed-P1 at higher and cut at lower levels. The transcription-factors Pointed-P1 and Cut antagonize each other and differentially regulate formation of FGFR-containing cytonemes, creating regions with higher-to-lower numbers of FGF-receiving cytonemes. These results reveal a robust mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific gradient contours through feedback regulation of cytoneme-mediated dispersion.
α-helical coiled coils are the best-understood protein fold, with their backbone structure uniquely described by parametric equations. This level of understanding has allowed for unprecedented manipulation of their structure. However, we describe here the unexpected formation of a new type of fiber by the simple insertion of two or six residues into the underlying heptad repeat of a parallel, trimeric coiled coil. These insertions strain the supercoil to the breaking point, causing the local formation of short β-strands, which move the path of the chain by 120° around the trimer axis. The result is an α/β coiled coil, which retains only one backbone hydrogen bond per repeat unit from the parent coiled coil. Our results show that a substantially novel backbone structure is possible within the allowed regions of the Ramachandran space with only minor mutations to a known fold. We find that insertions of 2 and 6 residues break the α-helices to form short β-strands, which associate into a triangular supersecondary structure we name the β-layer. We propose that it should be possible to reduce this structure by removing three α-helical residues and thus the single remaining backbone hydrogen bond from the parent structure. Such a minimalistic α/β coiled coil would be built of hexads, with three residues in the β and three in the α region of the Ramachandran plot. We also find that β-layers are repetitively found in natural coiled coils, forming regular fibers with alternating α- and β-structure, a protein fold that has not been described so far.
Epsin is an evolutionarily conserved protein that plays a critical role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the process by which cells internalize proteins and lipids from the cell surface by forming clathrin-coated pits that invaginate and then fission to form vesicles. Epsin has been implicated in clathrin coat dynamics, but its most critical function in this process has remained elusive. To elucidate the function of epsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we generated embryonic fibroblasts from conditional epsin triple knockout mice. These cells displayed a dramatic cell division defect and a robust impairment in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with an accumulation of early and U-shaped pits. This defect correlated with a perturbation of the coupling between the clathrin coat and the actin cytoskeleton, which we confirmed in a cell-free assay of endocytosis. Our results indicate that a key evolutionary conserved function of epsin is to help generate the force that leads to invagination and then fission of clathrin-coated pits. Epsin achieves this by coupling the endocytic clathrin coat to the actin cytoskeleton in cooperation with Hip1R. This coupling helps to invaginate the pit and is critical for the transition between shallow/U-shaped and deep invaginated pits. In addition to its role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, epsin has also been implicated in clathrin-independent endocytosis and has a weak interaction with the SNARE synaptobrevin 2/VAMP2.
Asthma among schoolchildren in urban Uganda is strongly associated with a number of risk factors, according to a case-control study conducted among 555 cases and 1115 controls. The main risk factors for asthma were found to be higher parental socio-economic status, with children whose fathers had a tertiary education having a 2. 32-fold increased risk of asthma ( 95% CI: 1. 71–3. 16 ) and children whose mothers had a tertiary education having a 1. 85-fold increased risk ( 95% CI: 1. 38–2. 48 ). The area of residence at birth was also found to be an important risk factor, with children born in small towns or cities having a 2. 16-fold ( 95% CI: 1. 60–2. 92 ) and 2. 79-fold ( 95% CI: 1. 79–4. 35 ) increased risk of asthma, respectively, compared to children born in rural areas. In addition, a parental history of asthma, children’s own allergic conditions, atopy, and cooking on gas/electricity were also found to be associated with an increased risk of asthma. The study found a strong rural-town-city risk gradient for asthma, with the highest risk among children born in small towns and cities. This risk increased further in the presence of other asthma risk factors such as parental history of allergic disease, children’s own atopy, higher measures of socio-economic status, and urbanicity.
Mutations in the leopard ( leo ) gene, which encodes Connexin 41. 8 ( Cx41. 8 ), a gap junction subunit, cause a series of spotted patterns in zebrafish ( Danio rerio ). A new dominant allele, leotK3, leads to a complete loss of the pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. We identified this component as Cx39. 4 ( luchs ), which is required for stripe formation in zebrafish. However, the fins are almost not affected. Double mutants and chimeras show that leo and luchs are only required in xanthophores and melanophores, but not in iridophores, suggesting that both connexins form heteromeric gap junctions. The phenotypes indicate that these promote homotypic interactions between melanophores and xanthophores, respectively, and that these cells instruct the patterning of the iridophores. Fish homozygous for leotK3 or trans-heterozygous for leotK3 over leot1 show an identical phenotype of a completely dissolved pattern. Individual melanophores that hardly cluster together are still present, mostly associated with blue iridophores. This suggests that the dramatic expansion of the dense iridophores is an indirect effect, possibly caused by mutant xanthophores covering the iridophores. Our data suggest that Cx41. 8 and Cx39. 4 interact to form heteromeric gap junctions and that these channels are responsible for some of the interactions that take place among chromatophores while the pigment pattern is established.
The evolution of olfactory receptors in insects is a complex process that has been studied extensively in neopteran insects. However, the identity of the receptors involved in olfaction in the evolutionarily more ancient apterygote insects and paleopteran insects is unknown. We investigated the olfactory system of the primary wingless bristletail Lepismachilis y-signata ( Archaeognatha ), the firebrat Thermobia domestica ( Zygentoma ) and the neopteran leaf insect Phyllium siccifolium ( Phasmatodea ). Our data suggests that the coreceptor Orco evolved after the bristletails split from its last common ancestor with the remaining insects. However, an olfactory system that relies both on ORs and Orco seems to have evolved after the emergence of wings. Insects detect volatile molecules using olfactory ( OR ) or ionotropic receptors ( IR ) and in some cases gustatory receptors ( GRs ). While IRs are expressed in olfactory organs across Protostomia, ORs have been hypothesized to be an adaptation to a terrestrial insect lifestyle. Our data suggests that ORs did not arise as an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle, but evolved later in insect evolution, with Orco being present before the appearance of ORs. Insects provide us with an excellent opportunity to study groups of animals that have retained ancestral characteristics and understand how the specific building blocks in olfaction have evolved in both insects and other animals. We selected insects at crucial positions of the phylogenetic tree with a functional olfactory system adapted to terrestrial conditions and detection of volatile chemicals. In neopteran insects, most volatile stimuli are recognized by members of the olfactory receptor family ( ORs ). ORs are multitransmembrane domain proteins unrelated to nematode or vertebrate olfactory receptors, displaying a distinct membrane topology.
Malaria remains a major public health problem in many parts of the world, with the global burden of the disease having decreased over the last decade. Asymptomatic malaria infections, which are not normally diagnosed or treated, pose a major hurdle for elimination efforts. One potential solution to this problem is mass drug administration ( MDA ), which aims to interrupt malaria transmission. However, the success of MDA depends on adequate population participation. In this study, we present a detailed spatial and temporal analysis of malaria episodes and asymptomatic infections in four villages undergoing MDA in Myanmar. Our results suggest that individuals from neighborhoods with low MDA adherence had 2. 85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-MDA in comparison to those from high adherence neighborhoods, regardless of individual participation. This suggests that there is a herd effect, where the overall level of MDA adherence in a neighborhood can provide additional levels of population protection against malaria. We also found that high mosquito biting rates, living in a house with someone else with malaria, or having an asymptomatic malaria infection were predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to MDA, even in villages with high overall participation, may frustrate elimination efforts. Our study is the first to document a herd effect conferred by MDA for Plasmodium falciparum malaria. We found that clinical episodes decreased among all groups for a longer period than the prophylactic effect of the administered antimalarials, suggesting that MDA can provide additional levels of population protection against malaria.
Drosophila melanogaster and mammals share a high level of conservation of transcription factor ( TF ) binding specificities. We determined the binding specificities of 242 Drosophila TFs and compared them to human and mouse data. This analysis revealed that TF binding specificities are highly conserved between Drosophila and mammals, and that for orthologous TFs, the similarity extends even to the level of very subtle dinucleotide binding preferences. The few human TFs with divergent specificities function in cell types not found in fruit flies, suggesting that evolution of TF specificities contributes to the emergence of novel types of differentiated cells. The conservation of TF binding specificity extends to secondary modes of binding, and even subtle dinucleotide preferences, suggesting that TF binding specificities are not subject to substantial evolutionary drift. In addition to extending the repertoire of Drosophila TF binding specificities by providing 122 novel high-resolution motifs, our dataset sheds light on new features of Drosophila TF DNA-binding characteristics. TFs that belong to the same structural family generally bind to similar sites. Drosophila has many genes that are orthologous to human TF genes with highly conserved DBD protein sequences even though these species diverged over 600 million years ago. We show here that orthologous TFs have almost identical core DNA binding profiles, flanking sequences, and secondary modes of binding.
Cardio-pulmonary co-development during human embryogenesis is a complex process that involves extensive crosstalk between the developing heart and lung. However, there is currently a lack of in vitro models that can recapitulate this process. Here, we report a novel strategy for directing the simultaneous induction of both mesoderm-derived cardiac and endoderm-derived lung epithelial lineages within a single differentiation of human-induced pluripotent stem cells ( hiPSCs ) via temporal specific tuning of WNT and nodal signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Using 3D suspension culture, we established concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues ( μTs ) that effectively segregated into separate cardiac and pulmonary μTs upon withdrawal of WNT agonist. This model offers an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interaction and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis. We demonstrated that upon co-induction of mesoderm and endoderm, a series of shared signaling events were capable of driving simultaneous cardiac and pulmonary specification from their respective germ-layer progenitors. Upon transitioning the co-induced cardiac and pulmonary progenitors to 3D suspension culture, we observed expedited alveolar maturation within 3 days, which was supported by the accompanying cardiac lineage. This work therefore delivers an effective in vitro model for studying the mechanistic interplay between the developing heart and lung during human embryogenesis, and offers a novel model for investigating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying human cardio-pulmonary co-development and tissue boundary formation.
While mutation rates are generally considered a slowly-evolving parameter in organisms, we demonstrate an unexpected flexibility in cellular mutation rates in Escherichia coli as a response to changes in selective pressure. We show that hypermutation independently evolves when different E. coli cultures adapt to high ethanol stress. Furthermore, we find that hypermutator states are transitory and repeatedly alternate with decreases in mutation rate. Specifically, population mutation rates rise when cells experience higher stress and decline again once cells are adapted. We identify cellular mortality as the major force driving the quick evolution of mutation rates. Our results shed new light on the dynamics of mutation rate evolution and help explain the prevalence of hypermutation in various settings, ranging from emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes to cancer relapses upon chemotherapy. In this study, we used E. coli exposed to high ethanol stress as a model system to better understand the dynamics of hypermutation under near-lethal, complex stress. We found that in addition to the increase in mutation rate, hypermutator states are transitory and mutation rates decrease again once cells are adapted to the stressful environment. We identify cellular mortality as a major modulator of the population mutation rate.
SnRK1-triggered switch of bZIP63 dimerization mediates the low-energy response in plants. SnRK1 is a conserved kinase that plays a central role in the low-energy response in animals, yeast, and plants. In plants, SnRK1 acts as a metabolic master regulator by modulating the activity of key metabolic enzymes and reprogramming gene expression. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis transcription factor bZIP63 is a key regulator of the starvation response and a direct target of SnRK1. Phosphorylation of bZIP63 by SnRK1 changes its dimerization preference, thereby affecting target gene expression and ultimately primary metabolism. We found that the SnRK1 kinase AKIN10 is the major kinase responsible for the starvation-induced hyper-phosphorylation of bZIP63. The importance of bZIP63 phosphorylation at the SnRK1 target sites for its in planta function was further underlined by complementation of the bzip63 mutant with genomic bZIP63 constructs. The bzip63 mutant exhibited starvation-related phenotypes, which could be functionally complemented by wild type bZIP63, but not by a version harboring point mutations in the identified SnRK1 target sites. We show that bZIP63 is an important metabolic regulator, especially under stress/starvation conditions, and that bZIP63 is phosphorylated at multiple sites in vivo in a sugar- and energy-dependent manner.
NMDA receptors ( NMDARs ) are a class of glutamate receptors that play a crucial role in synaptic plasticity and learning. NMDARs are heterotetramers composed of different subunits, including GluN1, GluN2A, and GluN2B. Here, we describe a novel synaptonuclear signaling pathway that specifically links activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs to nuclear gene expression. We identified RNF10 as a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger that is activated by calcium signals at the postsynaptic compartment and elicits discrete changes at the transcriptional level. RNF10 is enriched at the excitatory synapse where it associates with the GluN2A subunit of NMDARs. Activation of synaptic GluN2A-containing NMDARs and induction of long-term potentiation ( LTP ) lead to the translocation of RNF10 from dendritic segments and dendritic spines to the nucleus. We provide evidence for importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. Notably, RNF10 silencing prevents the maintenance of LTP as well as LTP-dependent structural modifications of dendritic spines. RNF10 dissociates from the NMDAR complex in an activity-dependent manner and we provide evidence for the importin-dependent long-distance transport from synapto-dendritic compartments to the nucleus. The intracellular C-terminal domain of GluN2A contains several target sequences for downstream signaling and scaffolding molecules. Notably, RNF10 represents a novel synaptonuclear protein messenger responsible for long-lasting re-shaping of dendritic spines as observed after specific synaptic stimuli and required for postsynaptic modifications needed to convey LTP induction. This result strongly indicates that an impaired RNF10-mediated synaptonuclear signaling and not a reduction of RNF10 synaptic levels is responsible for the reduction of dendritic spine density observed following RNF10 silencing.
Swi2/Snf2 ATPases are a family of enzymes that remodel protein:DNA complexes to regulate the structure and epigenetic state of chromatin regions during transcription, DNA replication, and DNA repair. Here, we report the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of Mot1, a single subunit Swi2/Snf2 ATPase, in complex with TATA box-binding protein ( TBP ), DNA, and the transcription regulator negative cofactor 2 ( NC2 ) at 3. 8 Å resolution. Our data show that Mot1 reduces DNA:NC2 interactions and unbends DNA as compared to the TBP:DNA:NC2 state, suggesting that Mot1 primes TBP:NC2 displacement in an ATP-independent manner. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data suggest that the Swi2/Snf2 domain of Mot1 associates with the upstream DNA and the histone fold of NC2, thereby revealing parallels to some nucleosome remodelers. This study provides a structural framework for how a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase interacts with its substrate DNA:protein complex. Swi2/Snf2 enzymes typically remodel protein:DNA complexes by disrupting the interface between the nucleic and protein partners of the target complex. Our study provides the first pseudoatomic view of a Swi2/Snf2 ATPase in complex with a DNA:protein substrate complex. The association of Mot1 with the TBP:DNA:NC2 complex results in some unexpected conformational changes that may have implications for understanding the ATP-dependent dissociation mechanism.
Ternatin is a cytotoxic and anti-adipogenic natural product whose molecular mode of action was previously unknown. A series of cyclic peptides with partially elucidated structures inspired the design of synthetic variants of ternatin, which are up to 500-fold more potent against cancer cells than the natural product itself. Using a photo-affinity probe, we identified the translation elongation factor-1A ternary complex ( eEF1A·GTP·aminoacyl-tRNA ) as a specific target of ternatin and its synthetic variants. This is the first report of a small molecule binding to the eEF1A ternary complex. Mutations in domain III of eEF1A prevent ternatin binding and confer resistance to its cytotoxic effects, implicating the adjacent hydrophobic surface as a functional hot spot for eEF1A modulation. Two structurally unrelated natural products, didemnin and cytotrienin, also compete with ternatin for binding to the eEF1A ternary complex. These findings suggest that the eukaryotic elongation factor-1A and its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacyl-tRNA are common targets for the evolution of cytotoxic natural products. Ternatin and its synthetic variants inhibit cellular protein synthesis with potencies that correlate with their ability to block cell proliferation. Photo-ternatin crosslinked to purified eEF1A only in the context of its ternary complex with GTP and aminoacylated tRNA.
Inositol 5-phosphatase OCRL is a direct clathrin interactor that is recruited to late-stage clathrin-coated pits. Mutations in OCRL cause Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease, which have been primarily attributed to intracellular sorting defects. Here, we show that OCRL loss in Lowe syndrome patient fibroblasts impacts clathrin-mediated endocytosis and results in an endocytic defect. These cells exhibit an accumulation of clathrin-coated vesicles and an increase in U-shaped clathrin-coated pits, which may result from sequestration of coat components on uncoated vesicles. Endocytic vesicles that fail to lose their coat nucleate the majority of the numerous actin comets present in patient cells. We found that SNX9, a clathrin-binding protein associated with late-stage endocytic clathrin-coated pits, directly binds OCRL. The absence of OCRL in patient cells impairs endocytic clathrin coat dynamics and results in an endocytic defect. These cells accumulate clathrin-coated vesicles that fail to lose their coat and nucleate at least a cohort of the intracellular actin comets previously described in Lowe syndrome patient cells. Our findings suggest that OCRL participates in uncoating and thus facilitates the recycling of endocytic factors, a process required for the normal progression of endocytosis. These results indicate that OCRL acts as an uncoating factor and that defects in clathrin-mediated endocytosis likely contribute to pathology in patients with OCRL mutations.
Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway plays a crucial role in the development of colorectal cancer. However, the identification of effective Wnt inhibitors for cancer treatment remains a significant challenge. In this study, we have identified a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216/β-catenin regulatory axis that promotes the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and intestinal tumorigenesis. FAK and PYK2, which are elevated in adenomas of APCmin/+ mice and human colorectal cancer tissues, function redundantly to promote the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3βY216, leading to β-catenin accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis. We have previously shown that Wnt-induced β-catenin accumulation requires Wnt-induced GSK3β/β-TrCP interaction. In this study, we have revealed that phosphorylation of GSK3βY216 is a molecular determinant of GSK3β recruitment of β-TrCP. Furthermore, we have shown that pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 suppresses adenoma formation in APCmin/+ mice, accompanied by reduced intestinal levels of phospho-GSK3βY216 and β-catenin. These results indicate that the FAK/PYK2/GSK3βY216 axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis.
Vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms play a crucial role in the control of posture and locomotion. The neural control of transitions between posture and movement requires the regulation of reflex-stabilizing mechanisms to enable motion. According to optimal feedback theory, such transitions require the disengagement of one motor control policy before the implementation of another. To test this possibility, we investigated the continuity of vestibular control of balance during transitions between quiet standing and locomotion and between two standing postures. Healthy subjects initiated and terminated locomotion or shifted the distribution of their weight between their feet, while exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli ( EVS ). The relationship between EVS and ground reaction forces was quantified using time-frequency analyses. Discontinuities corresponding to null coherence periods were observed preceding the onset of movement initiation and during the step preceding locomotion termination. These results show humans interrupt the vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms to transition between motor states, suggesting a discrete change between motor control policies, as predicted by optimal feedback theory. The vestibular system encodes motion of the head in space, and is vital to our ability to maintain stability during both quiet standing and locomotion. Vestibular signals influence the activation of muscles engaged in the control of posture. In order to transition between two motor states, balance correcting responses are disrupted. Indeed, prior to the transitions tested, the vestibular influence on whole-body balance responses is suspended. The suspension of vestibular-evoked responses at movement initiation starts while subjects are still maintaining quiet upright stance, well before the transition onset. Importantly, the suppression of vestibular balance stabilizing mechanisms is not specific to one type of transition, suggesting it represents a general control process that occurs during transitions between standing balance and other motor states. Thus, our results demonstrate that humans ‘stop balancing’ before they start moving and ‘stop moving’ before they start balancing again. The period of suspension of vestibular-evoked responses appears related to the different relative sensory feedback gains needed to control whole-body movements by the quiet standing and locomotor control policies.
In cyanobacteria, the transcription factor RpaA is the master regulator of the circadian output pathway, which drives genome-wide oscillations in mRNA abundance. Deletion of rpaA has no effect on viability in constant light conditions, but renders cells inviable in cycling conditions when light and dark periods alternate. We investigated the mechanisms underlying this viability defect and found that the rpaA- strain cannot maintain appropriate energy status at night, does not accumulate carbon reserves during the day, and is defective in transcription of genes crucial for utilization of carbohydrate stores at night. Our results highlight how a circadian output pathway controls and temporally coordinates essential pathways in carbon metabolism to maximize fitness of cells facing periodic energy limitations. We show that the phosphorylated form of RpaA, regulated by the circadian clock, is critical for the coordination of carbon anabolism and catabolism and thus cell viability in light/dark cycles. Deletion of rpaA prevents glycogen accumulation in light and renders cells unable to utilize existing glycogen at dusk. This leads to alterations in cellular energy charge and a severe reduction in fitness. Our data support a model in which anticipation of periodic dark-induced resource limitation is one essential role of the cyanobacterial circadian system. The output of the core oscillator, through regulation of RpaA activity, temporally coordinates metabolism to prepare cells for the metabolic demands of periods of darkness. Our results provide insight into the role of the circadian output pathway in enhancing fitness of cyanobacteria through coordination of central carbon metabolism with the metabolic demands imposed by periodic changes in the external environment.
PIB-4-type ATPases are a subclass of transition metal transporting P-type ATPases that play a crucial role in maintaining heavy metal homeostasis in all organisms. These proteins are essential for the efflux of heavy metals such as copper, zinc, cobalt, nickel, and calcium from the intracellular milieu. However, the metal specificity of PIB-4-ATPases remains elusive, with some members having a confirmed cobalt specificity, while others have broader or altered ion transport profiles. Here, we present the first structure of an archetypal PIB-4-ATPase, sCoaT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS14-1, and provide fundamentally new insights into the mechanism and diversity of heavy metal transporters. The structure of sCoaT reveals an eight helix M-domain configuration, devoid of classical heavy metal-binding domains ( HMBDs ), at least in members without extended N-termini. We also reveal several novel P-type ATPase features, including a dual role in heavy metal release and as an internal counter ion of an invariant histidine. Furthermore, we establish that the turnover of PIB-ATPases is potassium independent, contrasting to many other P-type ATPases. Our results open up for efforts in drug discovery, since PIB-4-ATPases function as virulence factors in many pathogens.
Monoallelic expression ( MAE ) is a phenomenon in which one allele of a gene is expressed while the other allele is silenced. In mammals, MAE has been observed in a variety of autosomal genes that play critical roles in human diseases. However, the regulation of MAE has been difficult to study due to the clonal nature of MAE. In this study, we report a chromatin signature that distinguishes MAE genes in human cells with great accuracy. This signature consists of chromatin marks associated with active transcription ( H3K36me3 ) and silencing ( H3K27me3 ) simultaneously occurring in the gene body. We found that the MAE signature is present in ∼20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and over 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types. Notably, it is enriched among key developmental genes that have bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. Our results open a new approach to the study of MAE that is independent of polymorphisms, and suggest that MAE is linked to cell differentiation. Upon applying this approach to a variety of cell types, we estimate that up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes showed the chromatin signature of MAE. Since detection of the MAE signature does not rely on SNPs or on sample clonality, we expect that this approach will make feasible the analysis of MAE in primary samples, including systematic comparisons of normal and diseased tissue.
ClpC is a central AAA+ chaperone in Gram-positive bacteria that forms a protease complex with the peptidase ClpP. This complex is essential for bacterial virulence and stress resistance. ClpC is activated by the adaptor protein MecA, which targets substrates and stimulates ClpC ATPase activity. We show that ClpC is repressed in its ground state by forming large two-helical assemblies that associate via head-to-head contacts between coiled-coil middle domains ( MDs ). These assemblies sequester ClpC molecules in an inactive resting state and restrict binding of substrates, ClpP, and adaptor proteins, as well as ATP hydrolysis. ClpC forms a planar ring structure when MecA binds to MD interaction sites, converting the resting state to an active state. Loss of ClpC repression in MD mutants causes constitutive activation and severe cellular toxicity. These findings reveal an unexpected regulatory concept executed by coiled-coil MDs to tightly control AAA+ chaperone activity. ClpC MDs form intermolecular head-to-head contacts allowing docking of two layers of ClpC molecules arranged in a helical conformation. The formation of this structure also involves ATP binding to AAA domains. We define this large ClpC assembly as an inactive resting state, as it strongly restricts binding of substrates, ClpP, and adaptor proteins and does not allow for efficient ATP hydrolysis. Mutating a key regulatory MD residue of ClpE also causes cellular toxicity, suggesting that the repressing mode of MDs established here for ClpC is also operational in ClpE and ClpL and thus is a more general mechanism for controlling bacterial AAA+ chaperone systems. Severe toxicity of ClpC and ClpE MD mutants qualifies these AAA+ chaperones as targets for antimicrobials.
Muscle stem cells, also known as adult muscle precursors ( AMPs ), play a crucial role in the development and regeneration of adult muscles in Drosophila. However, how these stem cells maintain their quiescent state and how they are reactivated remains poorly understood. In this study, we applied a Drosophila model to follow the behavior of AMPs in vivo. We found that emerging AMPs send out thin filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles, suggesting that muscles could play a role in AMP reactivation. Indeed, our genetic analyses indicate that muscles send inductive dIlp6 signals that switch the Insulin pathway ON in closely associated AMPs. This leads to the activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dMyc. Our data show that dMyc is required for AMP reactivation and proliferation, and that Notch acts downstream of the Insulin pathway and dMyc functions downstream of Notch. These findings suggest that muscle behaves as an AMP niche and plays a driving role in AMP reactivation in later larval life. We propose that the muscle niche-induced Insulin/Notch/dMyc cascade plays a key role in setting the activated state of AMPs. Our results provide evidence that the proliferation of muscle stem cells is regulated by the same set of genes in both Drosophila and vertebrates.
Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the basal ganglia, a group of structures in the brain that play a crucial role in movement control. The substantia nigra pars reticulata ( SNr ), a major output of the basal ganglia, is composed of spontaneously active GABAergic neurons that provide tonic inhibition of downstream brain areas. These neurons fire spontaneously at high rates, which is crucial for their function in brain circuits. However, the molecular basis of this spontaneous firing remains poorly understood. Here, we report that the sodium leak channel, NALCN, is the molecular basis of the depolarizing 'leak' current that supports the spontaneous firing of SNr neurons. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual mouse SNr neurons and found that NALCN is the highest expressed nonselective cation channel ( NSCC ) in SNr neurons. We also found that SNr neurons lacking NALCN have impaired spontaneous firing. In addition, we discovered that NALCN is involved in the modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and by activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Our findings suggest that disruption of NALCN could impair the basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie the severe motor deficits in humans carrying mutations in NALCN.
Microorganisms are a rich source of antibiotics, which have saved millions of lives since the 20th century. However, the majority of microbial diversity remains inaccessible for cultivation and exploration due to the stochastic nature of culturing recalcitrant bacteria. Conventional methods are limited by low throughput and sensitivity. Here, we introduce a droplet-based microscale cultivation system that is directly coupled to a high-throughput screening for antimicrobial activity prior to strain isolation. We demonstrate that highly parallelized in-droplet cultivation starting from single cells results in the cultivation of yet uncultured species and a significantly higher bacterial diversity than standard agar plate cultivation. Strains able to inhibit intact reporter strains were isolated from the system, and a variety of antimicrobial compounds were detected for a selected potent antibiotic producer. We verified our cultivation and screening strategy by culturing a complex bacterial community derived from a soil sample in a growth substrate designed accordingly and compared the cultivation outcome to classical agar plate cultivation for the same sample. For one of the isolates that showed antimicrobial activity in the droplet screening, we identified and characterized the secreted metabolites. The combination of bacterial strain discovery during the in-droplet cultivation phase with subsequent selection of the most auspicious candidates for natural product biosynthesis through a highly robust reporter assay will streamline our efforts towards new scaffold structures for the development of antibiotics. We devised an innovative microscale cultivation strategy utilizing a modular droplet-microfluidic platform and mimicking environmental conditions in situ. A miniaturized droplet volume of 200 pL facilitated high-density long-term cultivation of 2 million compartmentalized single cells in a total volume of 1. 5 mL. Additionally, we were able to screen for antibiotic production, which demanded the addition of reporter strains to the cultivation compartments. We increased the practical relevance of our cultivation approach by combining it with a screening step in order to detect and specifically select droplets containing environmental cells producing compounds with antibiotic activity. Even though axenic cultures of putative new species could not be maintained with standard microbiological cultivation after isolation from droplets, the cells could be used for obtaining high-quality genome information.
Leukotriene A4 hydrolase ( LTA4H ) is an enzyme involved in the regulation of inflammatory eicosanoids, which play a role in the pathophysiology of tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ). TBM has a high mortality rate, but adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids reduce mortality by only 30%, suggesting that inflammatory pathophysiology causes only a subset of deaths. In Vietnam, the survival benefit of anti-inflammatory corticosteroids was most pronounced in patients with a C/T promoter variant in the LTA4H gene encoding an enzyme that regulates inflammatory eicosanoids. However, an Indonesia study did not find an LTA4H TT genotype survival benefit. Using Bayesian methods to analyse both studies, we find that LTA4H TT genotype confers survival benefit that begins early and continues long-term in both populations. This benefit is nullified in the most severe cases with high early mortality. LTA4H genotyping together with disease severity assessment may target glucocorticoid therapy to patients most likely to benefit from it. The LTA4H TT effect was thought to be limited to the least severe patients in both cohorts because the Indonesia cohort was skewed towards more severe disease on presentation. The beneficial effect of dexamethasone to the LTA4H TT group may simply not have had time to come into play in Grade 3 Indonesia patients. Alternatively, Indonesia Grade 3 patients may have presented with a greater degree of dysregulated inflammation in a manner not revealed by standard metrics of judging disease severity. Noting that the Indonesia cohort presented with more severe disease and died earlier, it is more likely that the beneficial effects of dexamethasone for the LTA4H TT genotype were nullified in more severe disease. This concept of the disease being too severe for outcomes to be influenced by intervention has precedent.
Netrin-1 is an axon guidance molecule that plays a crucial role in the development of the nervous system. However, it is unclear how growth cones can transduce local spatial cues into protrusive forces to decide the migratory direction of axons. Here, we show that knockout mice of Shootin1 display abnormal projection of forebrain commissural axons, a phenotype similar to that of the axon guidance molecule netrin-1. We demonstrate that shallow gradients of netrin-1 elicit highly polarized Pak1-mediated phosphorylation of shootin1 within growth cones. This phosphorylation increases shootin1 interaction with the cell adhesion molecule L1-CAM, which in turn promotes F-actin–adhesion coupling and concomitant generation of forces for growth cone migration. Moreover, the spatially regulated shootin1 phosphorylation within growth cones is required for axon turning induced by netrin-1 gradients. Our study defines a mechano-effector for netrin-1 signaling and demonstrates that shootin1 phosphorylation is a critical readout for netrin-1 gradients that results in a directional mechanoresponse for axon guidance. We show that shootin1a is expressed at high levels in developing forebrain commissural axons and that Shootin1 knockout mice display abnormal guidance of these axons, a phenotype similar to that of Netrin-1 knockout mice. Notably, very small spatial differences in netrin-1 concentration elicit highly polarized directional phosphorylation of shootin1a within growth cones. Netrin-1–elicited shootin1a phosphorylation promotes direct interaction between shootin1a and L1-CAM, thereby generating traction force for growth cone motility. Furthermore, disturbance of the spatially regulated shootin1a phosphorylation within growth cones inhibits axon turning, but not axon outgrowth, induced by netrin-1 gradients.
Hummingbirds are known for their unique ability to hover in mid-air and produce a characteristic humming sound. However, the biophysical origin of this humming sound is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated how the flapping wings of hummingbirds generate unsteady aerodynamic forces as well as their namesake acoustic humming signature. We combined in vivo measurements of the 3D aerodynamic forces generated by freely hovering hummingbirds using a new aerodynamic force platform with in vivo nearfield acoustic holography using a 2176 microphone array. We also developed an idealized acoustic model that integrates the aerodynamic forces with wing kinematics to predict the sound radiated due to the oscillating forces from flapping wings. Our measurements and model show that hovering hummingbirds generate a highly directional hum, with the broadband acoustic pressure primarily oriented downward opposing gravity. The acoustic directivity and orientation of the harmonic components depend on harmonic parity. We found that the characteristic humming timbre and radiated power of the hummingbird’s flapping wings originate from the higher harmonics in the aerodynamic forces that support their bodyweight. Our model analysis across insects and birds shows that allometric deviation makes larger birds quieter and elongated flies louder, while also clarifying complex bioacoustic behavior. We also found that the farfield hum of flapping mosquito wings is primarily driven by aerodynamic force fluctuation, as shown by numerical simulation of the Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings aeroacoustic equation. These findings point to the potential role of oscillating aerodynamic forces in generating wing hum.
BCL-2 family proteins are a group of proteins that play a crucial role in the regulation of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. In this study, we used a combination of ancestral protein reconstruction and continuous evolution technology to investigate the roles of chance, contingency, and necessity in the evolution of BCL-2 family proteins. We focused on the evolution of protein–protein interaction ( PPI ) specificities that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary trajectories from multiple ancestral proteins, we found that contingency generated over long historical timescales steadily erased necessity and overwhelmed chance as the primary cause of acquired sequence variation. Our results suggest that patterns of variation in BCL-2 sequences are idiosyncratic products of a particular and unpredictable course of historical events. In other words, the sequences of present-day BCL-2 family proteins reflect the interaction of accumulated chance events during descent from common ancestors with necessity imposed by physics, chemistry, and natural selection. We found that contingency generated by sequence change over phylogenetic timescales plays a profound role in BCL-2 family protein sequence evolution under laboratory selection for new functions. Our results indicate that the paths through sequence space leading to historical PPI specificities changed repeatedly during the BCL-2 family’s history, even during intervals when the proteins’ PPI binding profiles did not evolve. We also found that chance arose because many sets of mutations could alter specificity at any timepoint, and contingency arose because historical substitutions changed these sets. Our results suggest that present-day BCL-2 family proteins are largely physical anecdotes of their particular unpredictable histories.
The continent of sub-Saharan Africa is home to a diverse array of population groups, each with their own unique genetic history. A genome-wide, haplotype-based analysis of a collection of 48 sub-Saharan African groups reveals that most populations share ancestry with groups from outside of their current geographic region as a result of gene-flow within the last 4000 years. We show that coastal populations experienced an influx of Eurasian haplotypes over the last 7000 years, and that Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo speaking groups share ancestry with Central West Africans as a result of recent population expansions. Our analysis provides insight into haplotype sharing across different ethno-linguistic groups and the recent movement of alleles into new environments, both of which are relevant to studies of genetic epidemiology. We identify clear, but complex, evidence for the movement of Eurasian ancestry back into the continent as a result of admixture over a variety of timescales. The African Genome Variation Project ( AGVP ) has described the novel and important influence of both Eurasian and hunter-gatherer ancestry on the population genetic history of sub-Saharan Africa. However, questions remain of the extent and timing of key events, and their impact on contemporary populations. Our analysis reveals smaller groups, and often differentiates closely related populations consistent with self-reported ancestry. We describe these patterns by measuring gene-flow between populations and relate them to potential historical movements of people into and within sub-Saharan Africa.
Early development in many animals is characterized by rapid cleavages that lead to a dramatic decrease in cell size. However, how the mitotic spindle adapts to changing cell dimensions is not well understood. To address this question, we established an in vitro system using cytoplasmic extracts prepared from Xenopus laevis embryos that recapitulates in vivo spindle size differences between stage 3 ( 4 cells, 37 µm ) and stage 8 ( ∼4000 cells, 18 µm ). Using this system, we identified the kinesin-13 kif2a as a driver of developmental spindle scaling whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by the transport receptor importin α, and activated in stage 8 when importin α partitions to a membrane pool. Altering spindle size in developing embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. Thus, spindle size in Xenopus development is coupled to cell size through a ratiometric mechanism controlling microtubule destabilization. This mechanism is consistent with the gradual change from meiotic to mitotic spindle morphology observed during early mouse development and suggests that the physical changes in embryonic cell size can impact biochemical reactions that alter spindle architecture.
Riboswitch aptamers are RNA molecules that can bind to specific ligands to regulate gene expression. In this study, we report the discovery of riboswitch aptamers for phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate ( PRPP ) that exist either as singlets or as tandem arrangements with guanine aptamers. These tandem guanine-PRPP aptamers can bind to their target ligands, either independently or in combination, to approximate the function of an IMPLY Boolean logic gate. This means that they can regulate the transcription of messenger RNAs for de novo purine biosynthesis in bacteria based on the presence or absence of both guanine and PRPP. The existence of these sophisticated all-RNA regulatory systems supports the hypothesis that RNA World organisms could have managed a complex metabolic state without the assistance of protein regulatory factors. The guanine-PRPP system is the only example of two tandem aptamers with different ligand specificities that share the same expression platform, allowing for a new type of logic function to be implemented. This system demonstrates complex chemical sensing and regulatory functions, and it is likely that additional variations of two-input Boolean logic gates will be represented by tandem riboswitches that have yet to be discovered in modern cells. The discovery of tandem guanine-PRPP riboswitches serves as additional demonstrations of how complex molecular devices can be formed purely from RNA.
The number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential is a fundamental property that dictates the reliability of synaptic transmission. However, the source of variability in this property is unclear. The prevailing view is that the number of vesicles released reflects variability in vesicle release probability, a notion that is well-supported by the calcium-dependence of release mode. However, we now demonstrate that the number of vesicles released is regulated by the size of the readily-releasable pool ( RRP ), upstream of vesicle release probability. The RRP is a functional measure of the number of release-competent vesicles per active zone, which is under the control of synapsins and constrains the number of vesicles released. Our results point to a model wherein protein kinase A ( PKA ) and its vesicle-associated target, synapsin, dynamically control release site occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles released without altering release probability. Together these findings define molecular mechanisms that control multivesicular release ( MVR ) and functional diversity of synaptic signaling. MVR is widespread in the rodent CNS and appears to be the dominant release mode in human cortex. However, some synapses are limited to the release of a single vesicle per active zone, termed univesicular release ( UVR ). Understanding the mechanisms that determine whether an active zone supports UVR or MVR is important to understand synaptic diversity as well as to develop unifying models of presynaptic function that account for multiple presynaptic parameters.
Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) is a retrovirus that selectively packages a dimeric, unspliced viral RNA genome in the presence of a large excess of cytosolic human RNAs. However, the mechanism by which this selective packaging occurs is not well understood. In this study, we used a minimal system consisting of purified RNAs, recombinant HIV-1 Gag and giant unilamellar vesicles to recapitulate the selective packaging of the 5’ untranslated region of the HIV-1 genome in the presence of excess competitor RNA. We found that the ability of HIV-1 Gag to selectively package its RNA genome and its self-assembly on membranes are interdependent on one another. Mutations in the CA-CTD domain of Gag which subtly affect the self-assembly of Gag abrogated RNA selectivity. We further found that tRNA suppresses Gag membrane binding less when Gag has bound viral RNA. These results suggest that a viral RNA with several high-affinity binding sites for Gag can recruit several Gag molecules to the membrane if only one of them dissociates from its membrane-occluding tRNA. In summary, our study leads to a model for HIV-1 genome selection where the NC domain of Gag is necessary but not sufficient for the selective packaging of the HIV-1 genomic RNA.
