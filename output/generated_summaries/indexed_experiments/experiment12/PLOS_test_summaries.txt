Researchers have made significant progress in reducing the number of reported cases of Gambian human trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) cases over the past two decades, but pockets of infection remain, making it crucial to assess which areas are on track for elimination and where efforts should be focused. A mathematical model was developed for the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to capture the dynamics of the disease at a local level of approximately 10,000 people. This is the first time a stochastic model has been directly fitted to data, allowing for quantification of uncertainty in results. The model was applied to 16 health areas in Mosango zone, Kwu province, reflecting spatial heterogeneity in cases. Under current strategies, Kinamba II, with a third of the zone's cases, is predicted to have the latest year of elimination. Deterministic and stochastic models were compared, with the latter producing virtually indistinguishable results but faster computation times. This suggests using deterministic fits for larger areas, but stochastic for capturing parameter variation and elimination estimations.
Researchers have developed a new approach to analyze the tumor microenvironment (ME) of cancer patients to better understand how it affects patient outcomes and treatment with immunotherapies. The ME is made up of various cell types of cells and immune cells that interact with each other, making it complex to study. The new method uses spatial functions to summarize relationships between cells and apply data analysis to predict patient outcomes and identify important interactions. This approach was tested on simulated data and real data from patients with triple-negative breast and lung cancer. 

The method works by creating functions for cell-cell interactions, reducing data with principal component analysis, and combining with patient data like age and sex, then using a random forest model to predict outcomes. Spatial functions have been used before in ME analysis. An example shows immune cell distribution around tumor cells in a breast cancer patient. 

The new method aims to compare ME between patient groups and predict a new patient's group using ME data. Various technologies exist, each with trade-offs, for this purpose. Comparing ME shows relationships between cell types, like tumor and immune cells, or proteins, predict outcomes and guide treatments. The new method identifies differences between groups and predicts patient group using ME data. It was tested on TNBC and lung data from multiplex ion imaging, comparing "compartmentalized" and "mixed" groups based on tumor-immune interactions.
Researchers studied how abnormal neural synchronization in the brain, which is linked to several disorders, affects brain function. They computationally analyzed how neuronal dynamics, synaptic weights, and network structure change, particularly during synchronization and how they are affected by external perturbations. To investigate the impact of different plasticity mechanisms, they combined a network of excitatory and fire neurons with synaptic and structural plasticity: (i) only spike-timing plasticity (STDP), (ii) only homeostatic structural plasticity (SP), (iii) a combination of ST and SP, and (iv) combination of ST and SP with weight-dependent pruning. To accommodate diverse neuronal firing timescales, they introduced a simple stochastic model for detailed analysis. Network theory revealed that structural reorganization remarkably enhances network synchrony. Weaker connections were preferentially eliminated by weight-dependent pruning, synchrony was achieved with sparser connections in ST-only model. Strengthening contacts from high-firing neurons to low-firing and weakening in opposite, followed by removal, allowed strong synchrony with fewer connections. This reorganization resulted in degree-degree correlations and assortativity. They compared stimulation-induced desynchronization in ST-only model with desynchronization models (iii and iv). Latter required higher intensity for long-term desynchronization. These findings may inform future clinical studies with invasive or non-invasive modalities for long-lasting relief, e.g. Parkinson's disease.
Researchers have been trying to understand how some animals can regenerate large parts of their nervous system after injuries. This is a complex process because it requires restoring the right number and pattern of different types of neurons. In planarians, a type of flatworm, neurons and glia (supportive cells) are regenerated from distinct stem cells. The study found that planarians first regenerate neurons expressing a specific gene called delta-2 in the central and peripheral nervous system. Later, glia are specified from mesoderm-like progenitors expressing notch-1. Inhibiting delta-2 or notch-1 reduced glia in planarians, but not other cell types. Losing delta-2-expressing neurons prevented glia differentiation, while transplanting delta-2-express neurons created glia at a new location. This suggests a model where delta-2-express neurons instruct gl progenitors to become glia, a mechanism for coordinated regeneration. 

A model was proposed where delta-2-express neurons interact with notch-express progenitors to regenerate planarian neurons and glia. Observations suggest delta-2 acts in neurons and notch-1 in progenitors during glia regeneration. This presents a solution to the challenge of coordinated regeneration between neurons and glia, where delta-2 on neurons and notch-1 progenitors specify gl fate. The mechanism is modular, allowing new gl configurations in the nervous system by neurons gaining or losing delta-2 and accessing progenitors.
Researchers investigated the role of gamma-delta (γδ) T cells in the development of broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV. They studied participants who were previously identified as "broad" and "non-road" neutralizers, meaning some developed broad neutralizing antibodies and others did not. The study found that γδ T cells were activated early in the first weeks of HIV infection and associated with viral load. Certain markers on γ T cells, CD16 on V1 and CD57 on V2, were higher in participants who developed broad neutralizing antibodies and associated with their development later. Levels of CD16 on V1 cells also linked to early production of virus-specific IgM antibodies. In contrast, V1 cells expanded during chronic infection and not associated with viral load. CD16 on V1 and CD57 on V2 were higher in participants who developed breadth and associated with neutralization later. The study found V2 T cells reduced early in acute infection and loss associated with viral load. Understanding how γ T cells promote broad neutralizing antibodies could help develop vaccines targeting these cells to improve immune responses, especially broad and potent antibodies to HIV Env. The study evaluated γ T frequency and phenotype from pre-HIV to acute infection in participants with or without neutral breadth, evaluating their contribution to viral control and humoral responses. V2 T lower at 18 days post-HIV positive in developed breadth, reflecting higher viral load. CD on V1 and V2 as well as CD on V2 were higher in developed breadth.
Researchers have discovered that cancer cells secrete two proteins, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-8 (IL-8), which work together to enhance the spread of cancer to other parts of the body. Blocking these proteins with a new type of antibody, called a bispecific antibody (Bs), significantly reduced cancer spread in mouse models. Bispecific antibodies are promising for treating cancer because they can target two proteins at once, but understanding how they work is crucial for their effectiveness. A model was created to study a bis antibody targeting IL-6 and IL-8 receptors, which are involved in cancer spread. The model includes equations for the receptors, antibodies, and complexes formed when they bind. To better understand how to target IL-6 and IL-8 for cancer treatment, a bis antibody, BS1, was engineered against IL-6 and IL-8 receptors. BS1 has two parts: an anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-8 antibodies. Studies suggest targeting IL-6, IL-8, and their receptors is a promising way to stop cancer spread and death. Monoclonal antibodies have been used to treat cancer for 20 years due to their specificity, stability, and actions. To understand how bis antibody concentration affects complex formation, simulations were done over a range of concentrations and cell IL-6 and IL-8 levels. The amount of receptors and their ratio affects bis binding. When IL-6 and IL-8 are equal, bis binding is similar to combining anti-IL-6 and anti-IL-8 antibodies.
Researchers studied the role of ZYG-8, a protein involved in cell division, in Caenorhabditis elegans oocytes. They found that depleting Z-8 resulted in elongated spindles with pole and midindle defects. Experiments with monopolar spindles showed that Z-8 depletion led to excess forces within the spindle, suggesting a role in regulating the force-generating motor BM-1/kines-5. Z-8 is also required for microtule dynamics within the oocyte and its kinase activity is needed for both meiosis and mitosis. The study reveals new roles for Z-8 in oocytes and how centromal spindles are stabilized for faithful meiosis. Z-8 regulates microt dynamics to facilitate proper turnover of microtules within the spindle and influences activity of motors that walk along microtules to stabilize the spindle. It has a microtule-binding doubleort domain and kinase domain. Previous studies showed Z- is required for proper spindle positioning in mitotically dividing embryos and modulates microule dynamics in mitosis. Z- is required for assembly and stability of the oocyte spindle and its kinase is needed for functions in both meiosis and mitosis.
Researchers investigated the relationship between circulating metabolites, type 2 diabetes (T2), and genetics in the UK Biob dataset using the Nightingale panel of 249 metabolites, 92% of which are lipids. They found 79 metabolites with a causal association to T2, spanning lipid-related classes except glucose and tyrosine. Twice as many metabolites are causally affected by T2, spanning all classes including branched amino acids. Using quantitative trait locus (Q) analysis, they described four metabolites replicated in the Estonian Biob dataset, with genetic loci in different regions attenuated in T2 cases compared to controls. Variants from the Q analysis are significant for metabolites in the population but not associated with T risk, suggesting T consequences on genetic regulation. Through differential analysis, 165 metabolites associated with microvascular, macro, or both types of T complications were found, with few discriminating between classes. 40 are not causally linked to T in either direction, suggesting mechanisms specific to complications. The study provides a map of T consequences on metabolite levels and regulation, enabling understanding of T trajectory to complications.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) colonizes humans and causes infections, ranging from mild to life-threatening conditions. They found two ways the host can survive infection: resistance, which limits the pathogen burden, and tolerance, which limits the health impact of the pathogen. In previous work, they established that mouse line CC061 is highly susceptible to Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infection, while CC024 is tolerant. To identify host genes involved in tolerance, they crossed CC061 and CC mice to generate F1 and F2 populations. Survival after MR infection in F and F generations was 65% and 55, following a complex inheritance pattern for CC increased survival. Colonization in F animals was more extreme than parents, suggesting segregation of genetic factors. They identified a Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on chromosome 7 for survival and weight change after infection, with the WSB/EJ allele in CC mice contributing to MR tolerant phenotype. Two genes, Car1 and Car2, with high-impact variants in this region, are receptors for complement Ca, anaphylato, which can trigger massive immune response by binding. They hypothesize Ca may have altered binding variant in CC mice, reducing damage by cytokine storm, resulting in ability to tolerate higher pathogen and longer.
Researchers studied how genetic interactions between genes affect adaptation to a changing environment. They used a model of a simple gene network, called an autoregulation motif, to simulate how a trait evolves over time. They compared this to a traditional model that only considers direct relationships between genes and traits. The study found that the network model had fewer beneficial mutations with large effects than expected, and a complex distribution of effects among all mutations, including some that were harmful. This is similar to the concept of "cost of complexity" where traits are connected and limit adaptation. The results suggest that interactions between genes can create complex distributions of fitness effects. 

The study combined biological modeling with tools to evaluate the shape of beneficial mutations during adaptation, finding differences from classical expectations in some cases. Both models showed similarities in key aspects of adaptation, such as the number of steps and distribution of effects among beneficial mutations. However, the network model had fewer large-effect mutations and approached the optimum slower than the traditional model. This was also seen in the rate of trait evolution, with the network model adapting more slowly. The study explored how a gene network influences evolution in an adaptive scenario. Traditional models rely on direct genotype-phenotype relationships, ignoring gene interactions that drive trait expression. The researchers considered a simple network to motivate their approach and implemented a nonlinear map into adaptive theory. A trait is based on a network of genes and regulatory elements controlling protein expression.
Researchers have proposed a new understanding of how the brain's cortical circuits integrate information from different sources to form a reliable basis for behavior. They suggest that neurons can optimally integrate information according to Bayesian theory, but the biological implementation of this process is unclear. A novel view of conductance-based neurons and synapses shows they can naturally perform optimal integration. In this view, apical dendrites represent expectations and basal dendrites represent likelihoods of somatic potentials, which are parametrized by reversal potentials and conductances. This leads to the somatic compartment computing the posterior. A gradient-based plasticity rule allows neurons to learn target distributions and weight inputs by their reliabilities. The theory explains experimental findings on single-cell and multi-sensory integration and makes predictions on Bayesian dendritic and synaptic plasticity.

The brain's physics can be seen as Bayesian computations. Conduct-based models naturally compute posterior distributions from likelihood and prior in dendritic compartments. Somatic membrane dynamics is derived from gradient ascent on posterior and synaptic plasticity matches posterior to target. Before plasticity, a consequence of dynamics from Bayesian view is discussed. Conduct-based integration predicts different properties from classical models. In absence of input, somatic potentials reflect prior. Dendritic adjusts reliability to past success in matching somatic distributions. Framework derives membrane dynamics and plasticity via ascent on log-posterior. Simulations demonstrate learning multisens task.

A probabilistic view of single computation shows top-down approach yields same membrane dynamics. Gaussian priors reflect summation of inputs yields normal, in agreement with data.
Researchers have used the AlphaFold database to predict and classify domains in 48 whole proteomes from various organisms, including zebraf, fruit flies, and E. coli. coli. They found that 90% of residues in these proteomes could be classified, with 746,349 domains identified from 536,808 proteins containing 226,424 amino acids. The study compared homologous groups in eukaryotes and bacteria, finding eukotes have more disordered regions and unassigned domains, and a higher proportion of proteins with globular and small repeats. Shared domains between eukotes and bacteria include Rossm, TIM barrels, and P-loop. The researchers also compared homolog groups from the proteome to the EC reference database and found that structure predictions enriched previously unannotated domains. The study suggests convergence between sequence and structural classifications for well-understood families, but still finds new domains in less populated groups. The classification of domains into easily recognizable, difficult-to-recognize, and unstructured regions is a useful strategy for large datasets.
Researchers studied the life cycle of BK polyomavirus (BKPyV), a common cause of kidney failure in transplant patients, to understand how it replicates and infects cells. They used single-cell analysis to track the expression of a viral protein called TAg throughout the cell cycle and found that robust TAg expression is required for viral replication, contradicting the current model that TAg is expressed early and pushes cells into the S phase for replication. Instead, their data suggests that BKV requires an initial S phase to replicate. This aligns with other small DNA viruses like papilloma and adenoviruses. Early on, TAg was consistently observed in cells with more than 4N DNA, indicating BKV production depends on initial S phase. To confirm, they used inhibitors to prevent cellular replication and found that viral replication relies on initial S phase. BKV is unusual as it re-replicates host DNA and re-replication is needed for replication. The current model proposes early TAg causes S entry for viral replication, but their data shows canonical licensing and firing mechanisms are required for re-replication. This changes the understanding of BKV life cycle to include initial S for robust TAg and viral production. Late genes showed VP/3 expression followed TAg as cells progressed to-replication, suggesting virions formed in replicating cells. This agrees with BKV cycle where TAg precedes late proteins but replication after 4N.
Researchers have developed a new method called FIO, a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) fine-mapping method for identifying genes associated with binary traits such as diseases. Unlike existing methods, FIO models all genes on a chromosome together to capture correlations between genes, increasing its power. FIO uses a probit model to link genetically regulated expression to binary outcomes, accounting for correlations between genes in linkage disequilibrium. This reduces false discoveries and increases power over existing methods. Simulations and real data from the UK Biob show FIO reduces the size of causal gene sets by 27.9-36% and identifies multiple genes associated with diseases, including asthma, gout, and hypertension.
Researchers studied the role of two proteins, Btn2 and Hsp42, in protecting cells from damage caused by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress, caused by exposure to hydrogen peroxide, can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation, which can be toxic to cells. The study found that Btn and Hsp play a key role in sequestering misfolded proteins into specific sites within cells, preventing potential dysfunction and toxicity. When these proteins are absent, cells become more sensitive to oxidative stress. The study also identified the Sup35 translation factor as a substrate for sequestration and showed that Btn and Hsp suppress the formation of a protein called the [PS+] prion, which is an amyloid form of Sup35. In the absence of sequease activity, prion formation occurs at multiple intracellular sites during oxidative stress. The study suggests that sequestration is a defense mechanism to mitigate protein-induced aggregation damage.
Researchers conducted a large-scale CRISPR screen to identify non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with glioblastoma (GB) invasion. Most studies on GB have focused on coding genes, but few have evaluated the role of non-coding RNAs without protein-coding potential in invasion. They used CRISPR-interference (CRPR) to evaluate the function of GB-associated lRNAs in an unbiased screen, characterizing and exploring the mechanism of identified candidates. A CRPR lRNA loss-of-function screen was implemented to evaluate the association of lRNA knockdown (KD) with invasion in Matrig. Top candidates were validated using CRPR and oligonucleotide (AS)-mediated knock in three tumor lines. Clinical relevance of candidates was assessed via The Cancer Atlas (TA) and Genotypeissue (GT) expression analysis. Mediators of lRNA effect were identified via differential expression following lRNA KD and assessed for invasion using knock and rescue experiments. Forty lRNAs were significantly associated with a 33-83% decrease in invasion (p<0.01) upon knock. The top candidate, LINC45, identified a previously unannotated lRNA, demonstrated an 82.7% decrease in tumor invasion upon knock, while L45 expression was associated with patient survival and tumor grade (p<0.0001). RNA analysis of L45 knock revealed WAS3, implicated in tumor invasion studies, was highly correlated with lRNA, while WAS KD was associated with significant decrease in invasion. WAS overexpression rescued invasive function lost with L45 KD. CRPR screening identified L45 as critical to GB invasion, associated with tumor grade and survival.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes sequences of auditory stimuli using electroencephographic (EEG) data from participants exposed to a sequence of sounds generated by a stochastic process. They aimed to identify the types of models the brain uses to perform this task. A new clustering procedure was developed to group EEG signals based on their similarity, allowing for a more parsimonious model of the data. Unlike previous studies, this approach did not assume a specific type of model used by the brain, leaving the identification of the actual model used by the brain an open question. The procedure was able to extract regularities from the data matching the algorithm used to generate the sequence of sounds. The sequence generation process was defined by a tree and family of probabilities for each next stimulus given past context. The brain was found to use the recurrence of a strong auditory stimulus to build a model of the sequence.
Researchers have identified a limitation in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology, a method used to analyze gene expression and cellular composition at single-cell resolution, which fails to account for cell-to-cell variations in transcript size and dissociation/processing-induced gene expression. This is particularly problematic when analyzing heterogeneous solid organs that require dissociation for analysis, leading to discrepancies between bulk RNA-seq results and reconstituted bulk-seq using sc-se data. To address this, a computationally calculated "cell-specific weighting factor" (cWF) is proposed. The study introduces the concept and method of computation and reports WF for 76 cell types across 10 solid organs, validated by accurate reconstitution and deconvolution of bulk-se data using sc-se data and WF of composite cells. Additionally, WF effectively predicts aging progression, suggesting diagnostic applications and association with aging mechanism. The study provides a method to solve limitations of sc-se analysis of solid organs and suggests biological significance of WF.
Mendelian randomization (MR) is a statistical approach that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables to estimate the effect of a single exposure on an outcome. Multivariable MR (MVM) extends this to estimate the direct effect of multiple exposures simultaneously. However, MVM can be biased by the presence of pleiotropic variants used as instrumental variables, violating one of the core assumptions. Genetic variants giving outlying estimates are considered potentially pleiotropic. Radial plots can help identify these variants, but analogous plots for MVM have been unavailable due to the multidimensional analysis. A radial formulation of MVM and adapted radial plot are proposed, allowing the effect of each exposure within M analysis to be visualized. Radial MVM includes removal of outlying SNPs violating M assumptions. A RVMR package is presented for implementing the methods. Simulations and analyses demonstrate effectiveness of radial M. Outliers can be visualized and removed through radial M, decreasing bias in effects under pleiotropy. Radial M is applied to estimate lipid on coronary disease.
Researchers studied the behavior of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) over a period of 7 days to understand how their behavior changes across different timescales. They recorded the flies at 100 frames per second using a camera and used a deep learning framework to create a dataset of nearly 2 billion instances of the flies' postures. The team identified stereotyped behaviors such as grooming, probis extension, and locomotion and used the data to explore how the flies' behavior changes throughout the day and experiment. They found daily patterns in these behaviors, including trends in grooming, probis extension, and locom speed, which added to what is known about the flies' circadian cycle. A unique point in the flies' daily pattern was found to be the hour after dawn, which tracked with other indicators of health such as locom speed and time spent resting. High-resolution data revealed differences in morning and evening peaks of activity, primarily in grooming behavior, and daily patterns in all behaviors, including grooming, probis extension, and locomotion. A decline was seen in difference between day and night hours as flies weakened and died, similar to weakening circadian rhythms with age.
Researchers studied the protein tyrosine phosphatase nonceptor PTP-22 in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans and found it plays a role in molting, cell adhesion, and cytoskeletal regulation. They used a non-b genetic screen to find that loss of PTP-22 phosphat activity suppressed mol defects caused by loss-function mutations in the conserved NIMA kinases NE-2 and NE-3, which act at the interface of membrane and actin regulation. To understand P-22 functions, they carried out proximity studies to identify interactors of P-22 during development and found the CDC guanine nucleotide exchange factor DN-1 as an in vivo partner of P-22. Loss of DN- also suppressed ne-associated molting defects. P-22 was found in several epidermal complexes, including hemidesomes, suggesting it plays a role in maintaining tissue integrity. It was also implicated in nucleocytoplasm transport and mRNA regulation, particularly in the germline, as one-third of proteins identified by P- proximity are gran components. These studies highlight the utility of genetic and proteomic approaches for identifying novel functions.
Researchers have identified a significant challenge in the fight against malaria, as resistance to the commonly used antimalarial drug, artemisinin, is spreading in Southeast Asia. If artem resistance expands to Africa and India, malaria-related deaths are expected to increase substantially. To prioritize malaria control measures, understanding the levels of artem resistance in Southeast Asia is crucial, but data on artem resistance are limited. A comprehensive database from the World Antimal Resistance Network was used to analyze the prevalence of non-synonymous mutations in the Kel 13 gene, associated with artem resistance, and a Bayesian geostat model was applied to produce spatio-temporal predictions oftem resistance. The results show an expansion of the K mutation across the Greater Mekong region from 2000 to 202, with the most change occurring between 2010 and 2015. The study provides critical information for malaria elimination goals in Southeast Asia by predicting the first spatio-temporal and extents oftem resistance at the subcontinent level.

A geostat model was developed to predict the presence of molecular markers associated with artem resistance in the Kel 13 gene, calibrated to the most comprehensive dataset from the Worldimal Resistance Network. Spatio-temp maps of K marker prevalence are presented to support monitoring resistance in Southeast, targeting preventive strategies and elimination efforts. No fine-scale predictive maps exist for artem resistance in Southeast, but molecular markers associated with resistance can be used. A significant amount of data exists on the prevalence of these markers, allowing predictive spatio-temp maps to be generated for the first time of the resistance landscape to artem derivatives in the Greaterong region.
Researchers have studied the function of proteins called NLR1 and CARD8, which play a crucial role in the body's immune response to infection. These proteins exist in different forms due to a process called autoproteolysis, resulting in full-length, cleaved N-terminal, and cleaved-terminal peptides that form autoinhibitory complexes. The study found that NLR paralogs and CARD form conserved autohibitory complexes involving N-terminal and cleaved-terminal interactions, but with distinct mechanisms. The linker region between LRR and FI in murine NLR1 plays a key role in forming N-terminal autohibitory complexes, while the Z5 of rat NLR and CARD mediate N-terminal interaction. The protease dipeptid peptidase 9 (DPP9) interacts with these complexes, forming FL-PP-CT and NT-PP-CT complexes, but not with N-terminal of human NLR1. Functional assays showed DPP is involved in N-terminal complex of rodent NLR and CARD, but does not affect inhibitory activity. The study enhances understanding of regulatory functions of FI-containing proteins in inflamome autohibition and underscores complexity of interactions in immune response. NLR paral and CARD exist in steady state characterized by formation of N-terminal and FL autohibitory complexes, suggesting conserved mechanism among FI-containing proteins. Protease D9 forms ternary complex with FI and U of NLR1, NLR, and CARD, preventing oligomerization and inflame activation.
Researchers have found that defects in protein homeostasis, or the balance of proteins within cells, can lead to proteotoxic stress, which affects cellular fitness and overall health. In various tissues, cell-based mechanisms detect and eliminate compromised cells, referred to as "losers," by healthier neighbors. However, the connection between proteotoxic stress and cell survival remains unclear. This study reveals the role of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi localized protein R1 (Rer1) in regulating protein homeostasis in the Drosophila wing epithelium. Results show that loss of R1 leads to proteotoxic stress and PER-mediated phosphorylation of eukary initiation factor 2. Analysis found that R1 mutant cells are identified as losers and eliminated through competition. Interestingly, R1 levels are upregulated upon My-overexpression causing overgrowth, despite high prote stress. Results suggest increased R1 levels provide protection to My-overexpressing cells by alleviating prote stress and supporting overgrowth. This demonstrates R1 as a novel regulator of proteasis in Dophila and its role in competitive survival.
Researchers have found that mutations in the CHEK2 gene are associated with an increased risk of breast and other cancers. However, most of the 3,188 amino acid changes caused by non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) of CHE2 have not been tested for their impact on the function of the CHE2-encoded protein (CHK2). To test the function of these variants, researchers used a method called yeast complementation, where they tested the ability of CHE2 variants to complement a yeast ortholog of CHE2, RAD53. This method has been used to provide information on over 100 CHE2 SNVs and aligns with functional assays in human cells and pathogenicity. In this study, researchers tested all 4,887 possible SNs in the CHE2 reading frame for ability to complement RAD53 using a high-throughput technique called deep mutational scanning (DMS). Of the non-syn changes, 770 were damaging to protein function while 2,417 were tolerated. The results correlate with previous structure and function data and provide an additional functional assay for variants of uncertain significance in clinical databases. This approach can be used to predict pathogenicity of CHE2 variants of uncertain found in screening and applied to other cancer genes.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae creates genetically and physically distinct populations. This occurs through the inversion of DNA sequences in the opacity determinant (cod) locus, resulting in a switch between opaque and transparent colonies. The study found that the Spx1-Ten toxin-antitoxin system regulates the orientation of these inversions, affecting the bacterial epigenome and traits, such as colony opacity. The system is a type II toxin-antitoxin system, where toxin TenA is repressed by antitoxin Spx1. Overexpression of Ten leads to growth arrest in E. coli and autolysis in S. pneumonia, while antitox Spx1 represses the transcription of the sp1-ten operon. Ten binds to ribosome factor Rim, reducing alternative factor ComX, which activates transformation genes. Reduced ComX enhances invertase Psr, favoring transparent colony-associated hS configurations. Moderate Ten expression reshapes pneumoccal epigen and colony. Spontaneous variations in the promoter region generate subpopulations with epetic and phenotypic diversity.
Researchers have developed a new method called generalized contrastive PCA (gcPCA) to compare two datasets collected under different experimental conditions and extract low-dimensional patterns enriched in one. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA), cannot accomplish this because they operate on one dataset at a time. Contrastive PCA was proposed to address this issue but has limited adoption due to requiring a hyperparameter, resulting in multiple solutions with no way of knowing which is correct, and treating foreground and background conditions differently. gcPCA is a flexible, hyperparameter-free approach that solves these problems. It analyzes the role of the hyperparameter in contrast PCA and eliminates it by introducing a normalization factor to mitigate bias towards high-variance dimensions. gc finds dimensions that exhibit largest changes in variance between conditions by examining covariance structure of datasets. This builds on contrast PCA but solves its problem of requiring a hyperparameter. gc is demonstrated in analyzing high-dimensional biological data, including unsupervised detection of hippocampal replay in neurophysiological recordings and heterogeneity of type II in single-cell RNA sequencing. gc is a fast, robust, and easy-to-use method facilitating analysis of high-dimensional datasets to gain insights into complex phenomena.
Researchers have created a detailed model of how B cell receptor (BCR) signaling works in Burkitt lymphoma cells, a type of blood cancer. BCR signaling is crucial for B cell survival and maturation, but is often deregulated in B cell lymphomas. The study focused on the downstream pathways of BCR signaling, which is not well understood, and created a comprehensive model of the BCR network using data from Burkitt lymphoma cells BL-2 and BL-41. The model revealed feedback and cros structures in the BCR network, including a negative cros from p38 to ME/ERK. The study verified the relevance of cros in BCR and CD40 signaling in different cells and by analyzing ERK and ERK sites. The model for BL-2 cells was transferable to BL-41 and also described B signaling in diffuse large cell lymphoma lines with aberrant BCR, indicating B aberration does not cause major rewiring.
Researchers have found that the Notch receptor signaling network is crucial for tissue growth and maintenance, and its activity is regulated by two opposing mechanisms: cell-to-cell interactions between neighboring cells and cell-to-cell interactions within the same cell. Different combinations of Notch receptors and ligands elicit distinct molecular and cellular responses, determining the strength, duration, and specificity of Notch signaling. This study explores the molecular basis of Notch ligands DLL and JAG, which control angiogenic sprouting through a combination of experimental and mathematical approaches. The results show that DLL induces Notch receptor activation, while JAG blocks DLL-dependent Notch inhibition through a JAG/DLL complex formation. A new model of Notch signaling is proposed, recapitulating tip and stalk cell formation necessary for sprouting angiogenesis. The study reveals a previously overlooked role of heteromeric JAG/DLL complexes, enabling angiogenic sprouting by regulating endothelial cell differentiation into tip and stalk cells. Data argue that hetereric J/DLL complex relieves Notch receptor inhibition, enabling efficient Not signaling. Consistent with findings, DLL homomers and DLL-JAG heteromers mediate Notch inhibition. Angiogenic sprouting involves a regulated interplay between Notch and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling. A new model is proposed, incorporating DLLAG-Not signaling and DLLAG-Not-VEGF signaling.
Researchers have developed a new clustering method called Dirichlet Process Mixtures with Uncertainty (DPM) that takes into account the uncertainty associated with data points in bioinformatics and other fields. This is an extension of a Bayesian non-parametric algorithm that uses uncertainty to improve clustering results. They tested DPM on simulated data and found it outperformed existing methods. DPM was used to cluster immune-mediated diseases (IMD) using GWAS statistics, which have uncertainty linked to the sample size of the study. DPM separated autoimmune diseases from other subgroups such as adult-onset arthritis. Additionally, DPM was used to cluster gene expression datasets that have been summarized using gene signatures. A new procedure was introduced to generate a summary of a gene signature on a different dataset than where it was discovered, incorporating variability in expression across genes within individuals. Three gene datasets with IMD were analyzed using relevant signatures and DPM found associations between disease and clusters replicated across datasets. This work shows that when data has uncertainty, it should be used to inform clustering and presents a method to do so, DPM. It also presents a procedure to use gene signatures in datasets other than where they were defined, showing its value by summarizing gene data from IMD patients with relevant signatures and clustering DPM.
Researchers have found that deep neural networks, which are often used to model the primate visual system, struggle to account for the importance of shape in human vision. Unlike humans, who rely heavily on shape to judge category membership, deep networks rely more on features such as color and texture. This issue has been documented, but the underlying reasons are unclear. To investigate, researchers created artificial images where shape, color, and texture can be used to predict class. They trained networks from scratch to classify with single features and combinations, showing that some architectures are unable to learn shape, while others can use shape but are biased towards other features. The bias can be explained by interactions between weight updates in mini-batch gradient descent, suggesting different learning algorithms with sparse, local changes are required to make networks sensitive to shape and improve human vision.

The study used artificial images to understand why deep networks trained to classify develop a bias towards features like color and texture instead of shape. Some architectures, such as vision transformers, appear structurally unable to learn shape, while convolutional networks develop bias despite learning shape-based classification. Instead of changing architecture, enabling networks to recognize shape requires changes to learning. Results show that color and texture bias arise from gradient learning dynamics, specifically how gradients align with classes. Breaking this alignment requires changing gradients. Convolutional networks, except spConv, show bias for color or texture over shape. The study focuses on ConvNet to understand this bias, showing they can classify by shape but fail shape-based if color or texture is sufficient.
Researchers have developed a computational model to study the dynamics of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and their role in liver fibrosis, a condition that impairs liver function in chronic diseases. The model, based on the Kappa language, represents HSC as agents with seven physiological states that interact with TGF1 molecules, which regulate H activation and secretion of type I collagen, a main component of the extracellular matrix. Simulations revealed the critical role of HSC inactivation during fibrosis progression and reversion, showing that inactivation eliminates activated Hs during reversion, but reactivation of inactivated Hs (iSC) sustains fibrosis. The model is sensitive to TGF1 parameters, adaptable to various pathophysiological conditions, and validated with experimental data from a mouse model of C4-induced liver fibrosis. The study also predicts accumulation of iSC during chronic disease, confirmed by RNA sequencing data from patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated liverrosis, identifying iSC as novel markers of fibrosis progression. The model provides the first of H dynamics in chronic disease, exploring the regulatory role of iSC in liver homeostasis and can be generalized to fibroblasts during repair and fib in other tissues.
Researchers have developed a new meta-analysis framework to estimate the total effect of high-dimensional omics mediators, such as gene expression, on complex traits and diseases. This framework is particularly useful for large-scale genomic consortia like the Trans-Omics Precision Medicine (TOP) program, which comprises multiple cohorts with diverse technologies to elucidate genetic and biological mechanisms underlying human diseases. The new method, called MEGA, requires only summary statistics and can account for inter-study heterogeneity, such as varying genomic platforms. Simulations showed MEGA is computationally efficient and yields satisfactory results comparable to individual-level data analysis when no interudy heterogeneity exists. The method was applied to 5 TOP studies with 580 participants to estimate the effect of gene expression on age-related systolic blood pressure and sex variation in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. MEGA is available in R package Meta2 on GitHub.
Researchers have developed a new method called PWH to identify genes that drive cancer growth in individual patients. Unlike existing methods, PWH takes into account that patients with the same genetic mutations may share the same cancer-causing mechanism, but those with different mutations do not. PWH analyzes how mutated genes affect other genes in a group of patients with similar genetic profiles. Experiments on 16 cancer datasets showed PWH found known and specific drivers better than other methods. PWH also identified common and rare drivers. Personalized profiles can help understand tumor diversity and guide treatment. One predicted gene, LRP1, was tested in cell assays and increased tumor growth when overexpressed. 

PWH integrates somatic mutations, gene expression, and interaction networks to find drivers. It uses samples from same cancer type to improve prediction. For each cancer, PWH finds drivers and compares with other methods on overlap with known drivers. The number of known drivers found by methods is shown for each cancer type. 

PWH is a genome/transcript analysis to identify drivers by gene influence on networks across samples. It hypothesizes samples with same cancer type share characteristics compared to different types. Leveraging same type samples improves prediction. PWH requires samples, mutations, expression, and interaction. For each cancer, it finds drivers and compares with other methods on overlap. The number of known drivers is shown for each type.
Researchers have developed a computer model called the Virtual Epileptic Patient (VEP) that simulates epilepsy by combining personalized brain anatomy with dynamic models of abnormal brain activity. This model can generate seizure patterns similar to those recorded by invasive methods like stereoelectro EEG, allowing for testing of hypotheses before surgery. The study focused on calibrating the VE model using a global optimization approach called SaSS, a metaheuristic algorithm that uses parallel computation to find high-quality solutions without excessive time. The model was tested on synthetic data and outperformed other parallel solvers in scalability and performance. A Bayesian framework was used for hyperparameter tuning, improving accuracy and cost. Additionally, uncertainty quantification was added to assess variability in estimated parameters across problems. This study aims to improve estimation of brain areas in drug-resistant epilepsy, informing clinical decision-making. 

The VE is a model that estimates parameters in a high-dimensional space to identify brain networks involved in seizure generation. It integrates mathematical modeling of abnormal activity with patient-specific anatomy. Accurately modeling poses a challenge in inferring information from data, such as characterizing brain networks from sterelectro EEG. Optimizing parameters is essential for gaining insights into mechanisms of data-generating pathological conditions, like dynamics and connectivity of abnormal networks. The model was tested on different configurations, showing whole-brain simulations and SEEG simulations. Trajectories in phase-space for regions were illustrated.
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a significant global health issue with 10.6 million cases and 1.6 million deaths in 2021. Research has shown that TB primarily affects the lungs, but the rates of Mtb replication and death in lungs of infected animals, such as rabbits, are not well understood. Experiments were conducted with rabbits infected with a virulent M isolate, Beijing H878, carrying an unstable plasmid p10. In vitro, p10 was found to be more stable in H878 than a commonly used laboratory-adapted M strain H37R (segregation coefficient = 0.1 in H878 vs 0.18 in H37). The kinetics of plid-bearing bacteria in M-infected rabbits did not follow a monotonic decline; the percent plid cells increased between 28-56 days post-infection and remained between 84-112 days-in despite a large increase in bacterial numbers in the lung at late points. Mathematical modeling suggested a non-monot change in percent plid cells can be explained by a lung M population of at least 2 subpopulations with different replication/death kinetics: one expanding early and controlled/eliminated, while a smaller expanding at times causing a counterintuitive increase in percentid cells. A model with kinetically homogeneous M population could not explain data when run stochastically. Results suggest bacterial dynamics in granulomas are independent.
Researchers have developed a new computational tool called GlycanModeler that can predict the structure of carbohydrates, also known as glycans, attached to proteins. Determining the structure of glycans is challenging due to their complexity. Glycaner uses data from the Protein Data Bank and quantum mechanics calculations to build glycans layer by layer. The tool was tested on various glycan structures and showed high accuracy in predicting native and experimental structures. Glycaner was also used to design a new glycan to shield a protein from antibody recognition, which was experimentally verified. This work can aid in predicting glycoprotein structure, glycan masking, and experimental structure refinement.
In the fungus Penicillium oxalicum, the protein ubiquitin-protein ligase SCF (Skp-Cul-F-box) complex plays a crucial role in regulating protein quality control by targeting specific substrates for degradation. The Skp1-Cul-F-box complex recognizes substrates through interaction between the F-box protein and the substrate, with the F-box determining substrate specificity. However, the limited number of identified ubiquitin-ligase-substrate pairs is a major bottleneck in the field. In P. oxalic, transcription factors such as Brl, CreA, Xln, and Ace1 are conserved in filamentous fungi that regulate development and transcription of hemi-cellulase genes. Transcription factor Ace1, also known as Slt, positively correlates with fungal growth and conidiation and negatively with expression of hemi-cellulase genes. The ubiquitinase-substrate pair SCFbx-Ace1 is identified in P. oxum, with most PoF23 present in free form within the nucleus and a small portion associating with Sk1 to form PoF23-Skp heterodimer. Under glucose, Po23 absence results in decreased transcription of the brA gene, which encodes the master regulator of asexual development and spore pigmentation genes, and impaired conidiation. Under cellulose, transcription of hemi-cellase genes in the mutant are significantly upregulated. Po23 acts as a transcription coactivator, recognizing and activating Ace, allowing to regulate transcription of genes with different effects under signals. Po23 recognizes and activates transcription factor Ace within the nucleus, which is a ubiquitinated protein.
Researchers have studied the basement membrane (BM), a crucial component of tissues and organs, to understand how it forms and diversifies during development. They focused on the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster's follicular epithelium, which relies on a BM composed of oriented fibrils and a homogenous matrix. The team found that two proteins, Rab10 and Rab8, define parallel routes for BM protein secretion. When both routes were blocked, BM production stopped, but genetic interactions showed they competed. Rab10 promoted lateral and planar-polarized secretion, while Rab8 promoted basal secretion, leading to fibril and homogenous BM formation, respectively. The dystroph-associated protein complex (DAP) and Rab10 were found in a plan-polarized tubular compartment containing BM proteins. DAP was essential for fibril formation and sufficient to reorient secretion towards Rab10. The exocyst complex had a dual function: it interacted with dystroph to limit planar polarization and was required for Rab8 route. These results highlight mechanistic aspects of BM secretion and how diversity emerges from distinct traffic routes. The study proposes parallel secretory routes by Rab proteins with cell sites defined by polarity as a mechanism for BM diversification during development.
Researchers have developed a new machine learning model to predict HIV-1 resistance to broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), which are crucial for HIV treatment. The model, called language-based universal model (LB), uses a technique called multi-task learning (MTL) that trains on multiple antibodies at once. This approach improves predictions and addresses two challenges: underrepresented HIV-1 subtypes in current datasets, which affect model generalizability, and combinations of antibodies needed to avoid resistance to a single bnAb. The model, LB, was pre-trained on Env sequences with neutralization data and fine-tuned with non-bnAb and bnAb data. It outperformed classical machine learning algorithms, random forests and gradient boosting, in predicting HIV-1 resistance to 33 bnAbs. The study shows that multi-task learning can mitigate bias against underrepresented subtypes and learn patterns of co-resistance between antibodies, providing tools to predict epitopes and select optimal bn combinations. The model is publicly available for adaptation to other infectious diseases treated with antibody therapy.
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological disease characterized by the abnormal expansion of cancerous plasma cells in the bone marrow. Current treatments for MM vary between patients, highlighting the need for developing prognostic models to inform therapeutic decision-making. Previous models were constructed at the gene level, ignoring the fact that pathway dysfunction is associated with disease progression. This study considered two strategies to construct predictive models taking pathway information into account: pathway score method and group lasso using pathway information. The former converted gene expression to sample-wise pathway scores for fitting. Three methods for pathway calculation (ssSEA, GS, GS, and z-scores) and 14 data sources providing information were used. These methods were implemented in microarray data for MM (GSE324) and a candidate model with best performance in validation was obtained. The model was compared with gene-based and published models in external data. Effects of missing values on prediction were also investigated. Results showed grouplasso incorporating pathway information (Vax) was more competitive than gene in both internal and external validation. Immune information, including V pathways, was predictive for MM. ax also outperformed published models. The model was more resistant to missing values, and presence <5% did not deteriorate accuracy using data imputation. Pathway-based models using grouplasso were alternatives to gene-based for MM. These were documented in R package (https://github.com/ShStatMM), where data imputation was integrated for future validation.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to study the process of mitochondrial fission, which is the division of a mitochondrion into two daughter organelles. The model focuses on the role of a protein called Drp, which is involved in the fission process. The model shows that the rate of fission depends on a single parameter called mu, which represents the maximum rate of disassembling of Drp oligomers on the mitochondrial membrane. The rate of fission does not increase with mu in a straightforward way, but instead increases to a point and then decreases as mu continues to increase. This suggests that targeting certain parameters, such as the association and dissociation rates of Drp, may have a non-intuitive impact on the fission process. The model also shows that the total number of fission events over time depends strongly on mu, making it a key regulator of Drp-dependent fission. Mitochondrial fission is the process of a mitochondr dividing into two organelles. The model is a system of ordinary differential equations that focuses on Drp-dependent fission following cellular injury when Dr1 in the cytosol is increased. Dr1 has been observed on newly created ends for a period, which could be incorporated into the model with a delay or additional pool of f complexes. This would affect the pool of Dr1 and make the concentration of Dr have more effect on the rate and total number of fission.
Researchers have developed a new gene drive system using CRISPR/Cas technology to control disease-transmitting vectors and agricultural pests. The system targets the recessive female fertility gene Tyros decarboxylase 2 (T2) in the fruit fly Drosoph suuk, a significant pest. To prevent the development of resistance, they used multiple gRNAs to target functionally constrain the gene. The study found low homing in the germline, but feeding octamine restored egg-laying in T2 mutant females, making it easier to maintain the drive. A similar system was tested in Dophila melanogaster and additional drives were constructed with promoter-C9 transgenes to improve homing efficiency. Results showed genetic polymorphisms in wild populations limit the spread of gene alleles and position affects Cas9 activity. The study also highlights rescuing female infertility caused by the drive, a tool for industrial-scale production of gene transgenic insects.
Research suggests that the brain's ability to learn is not only limited by the energy needed for computation, but also by the energy required to form and store memories. Experiments have shown that even simple learning tasks, which require only a few synaptic updates, have a significant metabolic cost. Learning complex tasks, such as achieving 95% accuracy on the MNIST dataset, require at least 108 synaptic updates. This implies the brain has evolved to learn with minimal energy expenditure. The study explores the energy required for learning in feedforward neural networks using a parsimonious model, proposing two plasticity algorithms that save energy: 1) modifying only synapses with large updates and 2) restricting plasticity to subsets of synapses that form a path through the network. Vanilla backpropagation updates all synapses, even when networks are larger than needed. Restricting plasticity can save energy while incurring slightly worse learning time. This approach may lead to a better understanding of biological plasticity and a match between artificial and biological learning. The algorithms may also benefit hardware, as electronic storage is energetically costly. An abstract energy measure is introduced, assuming energy is used solely by synaptic updates, finding a square relation between energy and size, M ∝ N0.43.43. Results show large networks learn faster but use more energy, restricting plasticity can save. Plasticity is restricted to a random subset of synapses using a binary mask, drawn from a Bernoulli distribution. Skipping uninformative samples during learning leads to further savings. Future studies include adapting algorithms to task or architecture and efficient synaptic modification during transfer. The model can be refined with more data and efficiency re-examined.
Scientists have engineered the bacterium Acinetobacter bayi AD1x to have smaller genomes by deleting non-essential genes, but this often reduced its fitness. To see if evolution could restore fitness, they deleted 22-42 kilobase and 70-293 kilase regions from AD1x and let it evolve for 300 generations in simple and complex media. They sequenced the final genomes and found that fitness increased in most cases, except two that failed in one environment. Mutations in 9 genes and 2 RNAs were linked to environment and deletion. The global regulators csrA, CsrB, and Hfq were mutated across strains, but effects varied with deletion and environment. Mutations in this network likely compensated for earlier deletion in ADx ancestor. The study shows that lost fitness can be regained through evolution and often through specific and global adjustments.
Researchers have developed a new tool to control gene expression in zebraf, a vertebrate model organism, using a self-caving ribyme called T3H48. This ribyme was inserted in the intron of a reporter gene and showed rapid pre-mRNA cleavage, reducing expression by up to 20-fold, outperforming other ribymes. The ribyme was then inserted in the intron of the albino gene using CRISPR/Cas and induced a pigmentation similar to the mutant. A base-editing was used to inactivate the ribyme, showing the phenotype is reversible. A Flipp- and Cre-activatable version, Ribo, was created to control mRNA levels of alb, inducing knockdown and recapitulating the mutant phenotype. A Cre and Dre-controllable Gal/UAS in Ribo cassette was used to label cells independently of target gene expression. The Ribo cassette is introduced as a flexible tool to control endogenous expression in vertebrates, an alternative to existing knockdown strategies.
Researchers have developed a user-friendly software called "aiSEG" that can segment cells in microscopic images without the need for fluorescent labeling. This approach eliminates the need for dyes, reduces phototoxicity, and speeds up imaging. The software uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect cell structures in transmitted light images, which was previously only possible under optimized conditions. aiSEG can segment nuclei in bright field images, even in challenging conditions like low magnification and time-lapse imaging, similar to manual segmentation. It retains biologically relevant information for quantification of biosensors and signaling activity. The software is adaptable to new cases with only 32 images for retraining and accessible through command line and graphical user interface. It is agnostic to computational environments and does not require user coding experience. The software was evaluated on 1.1 million nuclei in 20,000 images from curated and novel data sets, showing accurate segmentation in different cell types and imaging modalities.
Researchers investigated whether humans rely on prior knowledge about common properties of reward-predicting features to address the challenge of identifying goal-relevant features in novel environments. One such property is the rate of change, as behaviorally relevant processes tend to change on a slower timescale than noise. They tested whether humans are biased to learn when task-relevant features change slowly rather than quickly. In two experiments and a preregister replication, 295 participants learned rewards of two-dimensional bandits with either slowly or quickly changing feature predicting the reward. Results showed participants accrued more reward when the relevant feature changed slowly and irrelevant quickly compared to the opposite. No difference was found in generalizing to unseen values between conditions. A set of function approximation Kalman filter models revealed higher learning rates for the slow feature and adjusting to relevance and speed. The improvement in performance for slow compared to fast bandits correlated with adjusting learning rates. These results suggest humans favor slower features, indicating a bias in reward learning approach.
Researchers have found that patients with estrogen receptor-negative (ER) breast cancer have the worst prognosis of all breast cancer subtypes, often experiencing rapid progression to metastatic disease after diagnosis. Metastasis is the primary cause of mortality in most solid tumors, so understanding metastatic biology is crucial for effective intervention. Using a mouse genetics approach, 12 genes associated with metastatic susceptibility were previously identified. This study extends those findings to identify Res1, a poorly characterized gene, as a novel metastasis gene in ER breast cancer. Res1 is a large, unstructured protein with conserved intron structure but poor amino acid conservation. CRISPR gene mouse models crossed with Polyoma-T antigen engineered mouse (MT-PMT) showed reduction of Res1 resulted in increased tumor growth, shortened survival, and increased lung metastases. Analysis of matched tissues revealed loss of wildtype in tumor, consistent with Res1 being a tumor suppressor. Mechanistic analysis revealed Res1 role in transcription control through association with quadruplex sequences, particularly ribosomal biogenesis. Results suggest loss of Res1 enhances progression in ER breast cancer through transcriptional and translational control.

Researchers used mouse strains with different tumor phenotypes to identify Res1 as a tumor suppressor for ER breast cancer. Genetic analysis revealed association of 5 genes with metastatic burden on chromosome 6. Expression in human cancer data and mouse samples indicated lower Res1 was associated with worse outcomes. Experimental cross between Res1 gene and Py mouse showed reduced expression increased metastatic disease and pulmonary metastases. This study provides evidence that Res1 is a tumor and metast modifier in ER breast cancer. Two other genes in the region, Ffr2 and Slc5, have not been evaluated for metast disease. Res1 is poorly characterized, producing 152 amino acids encoded by single exon. Res1 KO bred to Py model compared Py+/wt and Py/KO heterozygous. Consistent with model, Res reduction by CRPR was associated increased tumor, rapid growth, and pulmonary metastases.
Researchers investigated the roles of the DNA damage response proteins Mec1 and Rad24 in meiotic recombination in yeast. They found that loss of Rad24 reduced spore viability and recombination frequency, consistent with previous studies. However, loss of Mec1 increased recombination frequency and had less effect on spore viability. Despite these differences, complex recombination events initiated by closely spaced double-strand breaks occurred more frequently in the absence of either Rad or Mec, suggesting loss of spatial regulation at the level of double-strand break formation. Both Mec and Rad have roles in regulating crossovers (COs), with loss of either leading to more random CO distributions and reduced interference. This is similar to but less extreme than the phenotype of mutants like zip3, driven by reduced interfering CO proportion. The study highlights shared roles in CO regulation and separable roles for Rad as a pro-CO factor and Mec as a regulator of recombination frequency, loss helping to suppress broader CO defects caused by DDR abrogation. 

The researchers mapped meiotic recombination patterns at high resolution across the S. cerevisiae genome in Rad and Mec null backgrounds, revealing similar and distinct roles for Mec and Rad in regulating meiotic DSB. In wild-type cells, prophase length is 3-4 hours, coordinated with meiotic D repair via Mec-dependent Mek activation. Spore viability was increased using the nd80 system in Rad and Mec mutants, proportional to prophase length. Mec protein is likely depleted during meiotic prophase, hindering analysis of genotypes with low spore viability. RAD and H1 promote accurate D repair during meiosis, suppressing nonhomolog endjoining and Z-independent CO between heterologs.
Researchers have developed a computer-based model to study the growth and metabolism of Pneumocyst, a deadly fungus that causes life-threatening pneumonia in immunocompromised individuals and transplant patients. The fungus is difficult to culture in a lab, which has hindered research on its biology and treatment. The model, called a genome-scale metabolic model, identifies requirements and imbalances that prevent growth in vitro. It was created using published data and bioinformatics tools, and validated through analysis. The model predicts metabolic flux and critical components of Pneumyst growth, offering insights into its biology and a strategy to culture the pathogen in vitro. 

The model was tested on a related fungus, Pocystina, which grows in mice, as humans cannot be tested for ethical reasons. The model replicated growth and gene experiments, showing its potential in developing antifungal drugs. The lack of vitro methods is a major obstacle in Pneumyst research, with diagnosis relying on microscopic detection in specimens. The combination of model and experimental methods opens opportunities to overcome this bottleneck. However, Pyst's inability to grow vitro has led to a lack of data on its composition, characteristics, nutrient uptake, and enzymatic activities, hindering a comprehensive model development. This highlights the importance of experimental data in the process.
Researchers investigated whether increased levels of the transcriptional coactivator Yes-associated protein (YAP)/transcriptional coactivator with PD binding motif (TAZ) (YAP/TA) are sufficient to induce sustained proliferation in cancer cells, even at high cell densities. They created a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical model of cell proliferation incorporating the Hippo-Y/TA pathway, which regulates cell growth by inhibiting Y/TA activity. The model simulated cell-cell interactions using molecular dynamics (MD) and reaction equations, accounting for adhesion, repulsion, and friction forces between cells. The study found that a twofold increase in Y/TA levels in cancer cells was sufficient to evade cell cycle arrest, enabling continuous proliferation under high-density conditions. This model, combining cell-cell interactions and the Hipp-YTA pathway, may be used to evaluate cancer malignancy based on YTA levels, develop drugs to suppress abnormal proliferation, and determine drug dosages.
Researchers have discovered that certain proteins and RNAs with low-complex domains (LCDs) have a tendency to form molecular condensates, which are complex structures that separate from the rest of the cell. Mutations in LCDs can cause these condens to become solid-like, leading to problems. To understand how the sequence of LCDs governs condens dynamics, scientists created an energy framework that looks at the "stickiness" of the sequence rather than the specific letters. They compared sequences to random sequences and found that highly periodic patterns promote elasticity, while random sequences are more viscous. The study found that minimum periodicity is crucial for maintaining fluid condens and preventing solid-like states. The framework also explains recent findings on prion domains and predicts changes in condens viscoelasticity. The researchers introduced the Free Landscape of Stickers (FLS) model, which uses a continuous "stickiness scale to investigate the effects of low-complex patterns on condens dynamics and material properties. The study shows that complexity, quantified by periodicity and disorder, impacts the dynamics and material of condens. The framework aligns with experimental findings on pr domains and predicts alterations in viscoelastic through periodic variations. This provides a unifying perspective on sequence-encoded properties of biomolecular condens, advancing understanding their dynamics and functions.
Researchers studied how the development of ectodermal organs, such as teeth, begins with the formation of a stratified epithelial placode that invaginates into the underlying mesyme. They found that signaling molecules are crucial for epithelial morphogenesis, but how they lead to cell rearrangement and shape changes is unclear. Using the mouse dentition as a model, they discovered that non-mus myosin II is essential for dental epithelial invagination and functions by promoting cell adhesion and convergent cell movements in the supasal layer. Sh signaling controls these processes by activating myos II via AKT. Inducing AK and my II can also rescue defects caused by inhibiting Sh. Their results support a model where Sh signals through my II to power cellular rearrangement for proper epithelial invagination. 

In the mouse placode, Sh is required for narrowing the dental epithelium at the neck and invagination. They show Sh does this through promotion of My II activity. Results support a model where Sh signals through PIK/AKT and II in the epithelium to maintain cell adhesion and promote convergent movement that drives invagination. This is done by strengthening adhesion at adherens junctions and enabling convergent movement in the supasal, where cells move towards the mid. They found Sh acts through PI/A to activate II. The Sh-PI/A-II axis promotes adhesion and movement to propel invagination. My II acts to generate forces and maintain adhesion, perturbations in II impede convergent narrowing and invagination. Results show importance of II in maintaining adhesion in stratified epithelium. This is consistent with findings that II-generated forces are essential for adherence in cultured cells and deletion I and II results in mislocalized adhesion in embryos.
Researchers have developed a new method to analyze large-scale single-cell RNA and chromatin data, which provides a deeper understanding of biological mechanisms. However, current methods have limitations in preserving fine-grained cell populations and intrinsic heterogeneity between datasets. A new model, scGCN, is proposed to address this issue, achieving high performance in preserving biological variation and integrating thousands of cells in minutes with low memory. It effectively transfers labels from RNA-seq to AT-seq data, showing high accuracy and knowledge transfer across modalities. To improve robustness, more powerful transfer methods and generative models are needed. scGC is a single-cell graph convolution network that regards transfer as domain adaptation problem in learning. It integrates gene and chromatin data into a unified cell atlas. The model is a black box, difficult to understand, but enables analysis of large-scale single-cell multiomics. It combines different types of measurements, even unpaired data. The model aggregates cell and gene relationships with convolution, based on regulatory mechanisms of RNA and AT-seq. It explores MK-MD-based adaptation for transfer features, leveraging domain effects. Multiple kernels adapt representations enhance effectiveness between embeddings of RNAq and ATq. scGC transfers cell annotations across datasets, species, and layers, RNAq and ATq.
Researchers have studied the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of the Mc3 protein, a subunit of the replicative helicase, which is essential for cell growth. The NLS is a short sequence rich in basic amino acids, but identifying it is challenging due to the lack of a universally conserved sequence. Through mutagenesis and AlphaFold 3 modeling, they found that precise positioning of basic residues within the NLS is critical for nuclear transport of Mc3 through interactions with importin. Disrupting these interactions impairs the nuclear import of Mc, resulting in defective chromatin loading of the M complex and poor growth. The study provides a structure-guided framework for predicting monopart NLS, which lack a consensus sequence but retain shared characteristics with NLS of Mc3 and SV40 large antigen. Further characterization of Mc3 N will help elucidate its cell-dependent nuclear import and loading, and refine predictions of other putative NLS in nuclear proteins. Mutations of Mc at positions 2 and 3 result in defective import, chromatin association, and impaired growth. Unexpectedly, the Mc3SV-NLS mutant fails to support import, despite AlphaFold predicting similar contacts with Kap at 2 and 3. Constitutive localization is observed in full-length and C-terminal fragments of Mc lacking this NES. Defective import may compromise MCM loading, leading to growth defects.
Ataxin-2 (ATN) is a gene associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (S2), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease. The protein is a potential therapeutic target for ALS-related conditions. Atin-2 or At2 in insects functions in translational activation, translational repression, mRNA stability, and assembly of RNP-granules, mediated by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). The LSm-like domain of At2 can stimulate mRNA translation and antagonize RNP-gran assembly. This study advances previous findings through experiments on Drosoph and human Atin-2 proteins. Results of Targets of RNA Binding Proteins Identified (TRIBE) and co-localization immunoprecipitation indicate the poly-binding protein (PAB) interacting P2 motif of At-2 is a major determinant of mRNA and protein content of Atin-2 R-granules. Experiments with transgenic Dophila show the At-LS domain may protect against neurodegeneration, while P2 and unstructured IDR interactions support At2-induced cytotoxicity. The data propose how Atin-2 interactions remodel translational control and how structured and non-structured interactions contribute to specificity and efficiency of R-gran condensation as well as neurodegeneration.

Atin-2 has conserved regions: LSm (Sm), L-associated (SmAD), and P2, flanked by IDRs. Work in Doph has shown the c-terminal IDR of At is required for R assembly into granules. This study further elaborates mechanisms of At- functions in mRNA and R assembly. The P2 of At and interactions with AB are essential for assembly but required to recruit At-target RNAs and proteins into At-gran. At-2 is a translational activator, repressor, facilitator, and stabilizer of associated RNAs. Previous work showed At mutants lacking IDR for At-gran in Doph and S cells were resistant to neurode. The L-domain antagonizes At-gran. This study tested the conserved P of At, associated with AB, in this process. Using Galts-controlled el-G4 to express At- in Doph brains, RNA-Seq identified RNAs in poly selected and compared with At procedures.
Researchers studied the development and maintenance of muscle stem cells in different parts of the body, specifically the extraocular muscles (EOM) and limb muscles. They found that the gene Pitx2 plays a crucial role in the early development of muscle stem cells in the EOM, but becomes less important later on. In contrast, the gene Pax7 is essential for the maintenance of muscle stem cells in both EOM and limb. The study suggests a relay between Pit2, Myf, and Pax for stem cell maintenance in EOM. Muscle stem cells in EOM are in a resting state and do not proliferate in adults, but have more Pax+ stem cells than limb muscles. In a mouse model of muscular dystrophy, muscle cells in limb proliferate, but EOM stem cells do not. The study provides insights into why EOM are spared in muscular dystrophy and heterogeneity of stem cells along the body axis.
Researchers have identified several variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since 2020, including Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Omicron lineage, and others. These variants show different levels of virulence, antigenicity, and infectivity, requiring specific defense measures. To simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants among humans, a new infectious disease model was proposed, combining epidemiological data with physical neural networks (PINs) to develop a mechanism called VOC-informed network (VOC-IN). Experiments showed VOC-IN accurately fit reported data from British Columbia, Canada, and simulated unobserved dynamics, time-dependent parameters, and short-term predictions. Results revealed variations in control strategies across regions. VOC-IN performed well in fitting and forecasting long-term multi-wave data.

A new algorithm, VOC-IN, integrates epidemiological data, deep learning, and models to estimate COVID-19 transmission during the pandemic. It emphasizes underlying patterns in multivariate data for optimization and accurate fitting. Variants exhibit differences in transmissibility, disease, severity, immune evasion, and responsiveness to treatments. The World Health Organization defines VOCs as major evolutionary, necessitating public measures. Simulating transmission and time-dependent SARS-2 variants is crucial.

VOC-IN leverages observational data and physical principles to capture time-vary parameters. Studies have shown PINs can fit compartment models and estimate timeary parameters effectively. A VOC-IN method fits data and infers timeary parameters by encoding VOC infection, epidemiological mechanisms, and ODE into networks.
Researchers have developed a new method called CytoNet, a deep learning-based approach that improves the accuracy of image-based cell profiling by 30-68% compared to the traditional method of averaging cells. This method, called CytoNet, uses self-supervised contrastive learning in a multiple instance framework, making it easier to apply to single-cell data than previous strategies. The model achieves this by down-weighting small cells or debris and prioritizing crowded cells. CyNet requires only perturbation labels, which are available in most cell profiling datasets, making it a straightforward post-processing step for single-cell profiles that can significantly boost performance on image-based datasets. 

CytoNet is a self-supervised contrast learning approach that leverages information in profiling experiments. Contrast learning brings together data points of the same entity, such as samples, and pushes others apart in a space, capturing general features for tasks. Here, it's applied to single features, not raw pixels, making it applicable to most profiling datasets. The data is treated as a collection of sets, where each sample corresponds to a set based on mathematical definition. 

CytoNet employs Deep Sets to learn a model that aggregates single data into a profile, outperforming population-averaged profiles in predicting a compound's mechanism. The model performs quality filtering out noisy cells.
Researchers have found that the brain's ability to solve complex tasks relies on changes in how brain activity is organized in space and time. When these changes are disrupted, it can lead to difficulties with attention, distraction, and adapting to new situations, resulting in decreased efficiency and increased effort in completing tasks. To better understand this, a new method was developed to measure effort during tasks using electroencephalography (EEG) patterns. This method identifies discrete brain states and uses optimal theory. It was tested on a dataset from a spatial Stro task, a test where participants respond to one part of a stimulus while ignoring another conflicting part. Results showed a link between effort and cost, confirming the method's effectiveness in quantifying transitions. This approach opens new ways to describe cognitive effort in the brain.

A study used a stochastic framework to measure brain cost in an existing EEG dataset, confirming a correlation between cost and demand during a Stro task. This is the first application to EEG, providing a way to quantify demand in EEG experiments. A gap was bridged by generalizing the method to EEG, which measures neural activity more than fMRI. An EEG dataset was analyzed from participants performing a Stro task. A similar approach was applied to fMRI of participants performing tasks, showing cost varies between conditions. However, tasks were different and difficult to compare, so no expectations of difficulty or demand were made. This study investigated changes during tasks and if cost explains brain energy needs for differing demands. Other metrics quantify loads from microanalysis, such as entropy or Hurst exponents, lack clear interpretation as they don't account for dynamics.
Researchers investigated the role of atypical B cells (aBC) in the immune response to malaria caused by Plasmodium vivax (P. viv). They found that individuals infected with P. viv developed a specific aBC, which persisted even after recovery from the infection. To understand the function of these cells, the researchers generated a probe to detect and study P. viv-specific aBC and their ability to produce neutralizing antibodies. They found that aBC were elicited during illness and persisted after recovery, and some produced antibodies comparable to those of classicalBC. Among the aBC, two clones (A12 and B11) produced broadly neutralizing antibodies against P. viv variants. TheBC receptors of these aBC expressed unique genes, similar to classicalBC. The study suggests that P. viv infections elicit the development and persistence of aBC, which may play a role in producing antibodies against malaria. Identifying aBC subsets that produce protective antibodies is crucial for developing effective vaccines. The researchers demonstrated the generation of antigen-specific aBC in P. viv infections and their ability to secrete antibodies. In a low transmission setting, individuals with first clinical symptoms developed P. viv-specific aBC, indicating acquisition was not associated with repeated exposure. The study supports previous findings that expansion of aBC is part of the immune response to malaria and vaccinations.
Researchers have developed a new method called MR-MASHS, an extension of the MR-MASH model, to predict complex traits using genetic data from Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimates from a reference panel. Unlike MRASH, which requires individual-level data, MRASHS uses summary statistics, making it more applicable to publicly available data and scalable to large datasets. Simulations showed that MRASH is competitive and outperforms current methods for single and multi-phenotype polygenic prediction in various scenarios. A real analysis of 16 blood phenotypes in the UK Biobank showed MRASH achieved higher accuracy than competing methods for most traits, especially with smaller sample sizes. MRASH requires individual data due to privacy concerns and doesn't scale to large datasets, limiting its use in precision medicine. MRASH addresses these limitations by using summary statistics and LD estimates. It learns patterns of effect sharing across phenotypes, models dozens jointly, and is computationally efficient. Simulations and real data analysis showed MRASH is competitive with state-of-art univariate and multivariate methods, outperforming 14 of 16 blood phenotypes.
Researchers have developed a new model to predict the spread of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, by taking into account the differences in how people's susceptibility to infection in different areas and over time. This is called spatio-temporal heterogeneity. The model, called Universal Differential Equation (U), uses a neural network to approximate the rate at which people become susceptible to the disease. It was trained on data from the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai, China and compared to a traditional model that assumes everyone is equally susceptible. The new model predicted 80.06% of the population would be infected and a peak of 3.17%, compared to 99.97% and 32.78% in the traditional model. This is an 18.6% improvement in accuracy. The study also found that heterogeneity in susceptibility reduces herd immunity by 37.36% and prolongs the outbreak by 30-70 days. This new model can be used for other diseases and provides new insights into how to model heterogeneity.
Researchers have found that synapses in the brain are surprisingly noisy, consuming a lot of energy despite this noise. They propose that synapses use this noise to represent uncertainty about the activity of the postsynaptic neuron. A mathematical framework was developed showing synapse interacts with the postsyn neuron like an agent in an uncertain environment. This suggests synapse uses an internal model of somatic dynamics updated by a learning rule similar to established LTP/LTD mechanisms. Synapses also use noise to encode uncertainty of somatic potential. Each syn tries to predict postsyn dynamics, but many synapses in a network can solve problems like classification and control in dynamic environments by coordinating uncertainties. 

Synaptic transmission is debated as feature or bug in biological and artificial systems. This study shows synapses can encode uncertainty of postsyn membrane potential. The model predicts synapses should be stochastic to encode somatic potential and makes precise predictions about synaptic changes in post-spike protocols and weight. A learning rule was derived for synapses to minimize surprise, adapting efficacy to predict postsyn spikes. This rule enables synapses to adapt to backpropagating action potentials. Synaptic variability can reflect uncertainty in firing. Postsyn learns to fire according to Gaussian distributions with different spreads. Variability in firing is reflected in membrane potential during stochastic firing. Synapses learn suitable responses as behaving in unknown environment, using variability to represent uncertainty of syn about cellular state.
Researchers have developed a new method called Scup for reconstructing cell lineage trees from single-cell DNA sequencing data. This method is useful for studying cell development, differentiation, and cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing allows for more detailed analysis with higher resolution. Scup addresses challenges of single-cell sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors. It computes distances between cells and uses the neighbor-joining algorithm to reconstruct the tree. Scup is designed for embarrassingly parallel, making it faster than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining accuracy. The method's robustness was tested on synthetic and biological datasets of 18 cells. Single-cell sequencing technologies enable detailed analysis of cell development and differentiation. Scup is a probabilistic framework reconstructing cell trees from healthy diploid single-cells using whole-genome amplified DNA data. It is designed with challenges of sc-seq data in mind, fitting well with biological findings and obtaining better accuracy. Reconstructing cell trees from single data for healthy tissue is a fundamental problem with potential for studies of development and differentiation. There are two related problems for cancer: reconstruction of clonal trees and reconstruction of tumor phylogenies from cells. Several data types have been used for latter problems. Mutations are scarce reconstructing trees for healthy, implying sophisticated models and methods needed. Single DNA sequencing reveals more mutations than other data, but comes with challenges. Scup is a distance phylogen inference method reconstructing cell trees from sc-se data produced by amplifying genomes. It distinguishes somatic mutations from sequencing errors caused by amplification.
Researchers developed a new tool called the Thanzi Lae On (TLO) model to help evaluate health benefits packages (HBPs) in Malawi, a low-income country with limited healthcare resources. HBPs aim to determine which services the public healthcare system should provide. Current methods used to weigh evidence for different interventions have limitations. The LO model simulates disease incidence, health-seeking behavior, and healthcare capacity to meet demand under realistic resource constraints. It found a linear optimization-based HBP achieved an 8% reduction in disability-adjusted life years (DALs) between 2023-204 by concentrating on high-impact treatments. However, it incurred excess DALs in the first years. Other prioritization approaches, such as patient characteristics-based, achieved consistent gains year-to-year and 5% reduction in DALs over the period. The LO model provides a tool to test HBs specifically for Malawi, evaluating health gains from prioritizing services under realistic resource constraints. It addresses limitations in other methods, providing a balanced representation of the Malian healthcare system.
Researchers studied the process of meiotic chromosome pairing and segregation in the holocentric moth Plodia interpella, a species that diverged from the silkworm moth Bomby mor over 100 million years ago. They used a technique called Oligaint FISH to visualize chromosomes at high resolution and found that meiotic pairing in both species starts at gene-rich chromosome ends. Both species form rod-shaped bivalents at metaphase I, but unlike Bomby, Plodia can orient bival in multiple ways at metaphase. Kinetochores assemble at non-telomeric loci towards the center of chromosomes, regardless of where they are located in the bivalent. Sister kinchores are not paired, but four distinct kinchores are observed at metaphase. Microtubule attachments orient separated kinchores, challenging the view that paired pole-facing kinchores are required for accurate hom separation in meiosis. The study highlights the importance of exploring fundamental processes in non-model organisms, revealing novel biology.
Researchers studied the role of the median eminence (ME), a brain region that connects the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, in the development of hypopituitarism, a condition where the pituit gland doesn't produce enough hormones. They found that mutations in the SOX3 gene, a transcription factor, lead to hypopuitar, likely due to a problem in the hypothalamus, not the pit gland itself. They discovered that the absence of SO3 affects ME cells called NG2-glia, which are crucial for the pit gland's maturation, and hormone production. NG-glia renewal and oligodrocy differentiation are also affected. Treatment with low-dose aspirin, which affects NG-glia and gut microbiota, rescued hypopuitar in mutants. The study shows NG-g are essential for ME function during postnatal development and sensitive to external signals. The researchers propose that sufficient NG-g are needed in ME to support pit gland maturation as the animal becomes independent. They highlight a new role for NG-g in ME and pit maturation, and that hypop due to SO3 loss can be modified by non-genetic factors.
Researchers studied how proteins called F-act, which are important in cell movement and development, and are misregulated in diseases like cancer. They found a protein called GTP CED-10/Rac, which activates F-act, but needed to identify the protein that activates it. Another protein, CED-5/C-12, is known to activate C-10 to promote cell movement, but surprisingly, it also inhibits F-act in cell migration. To understand, they tested if C-5/C-12 is involved in cell migration and found it supports it, but with a contradictory effect. C-5/C-12 inhibits F-act in migrating cells, opposite to what was expected. They investigated if C-12 has a function called GAP, which inactivates Gases, and found a region in C- away from the activating region. Mutating this region altered cell migration, not corpse engulfment. Interfering with C-5's ability to bind Rac1/C-10 resulted in loss of both functions. Genetic studies suggest GAP acts on different Gases, proposing C-5/C-12 supports cycling multiple Gases using distinct domains to promote and inhibit F-act formation. To promote cell engulfment, C-5/C-12 activates C-10, but for migration, a different GEF must activate C-10. Other GEFs in C. elegans regulate development, mainly CDC-42 or RHO. C-5/C- and C-12 act as bipart GEF promoting C-10 during programmed cell death. C-10 also promotes tissue migration, ventral enclosure, but GEF is unknown.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes information across different timescales in the visual system of mice. They used information-theoretic and autocorrelation analysis to show that information and timescales of spiking activity increase along the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system under visual stimulation, while information-theoretic predictability decreases. In contrast, intrinsic times for spontaneous activity displayed a similar hierarchy, but predictability was stimulus-dependent. A basic network model with correlated sensory input reproduced these observations. The findings suggest the rodent visual system employs intrinsic mechanisms for longer integration in higher areas while reducing predictability for an efficient neural code. The study used predict and timescales to probe hierarchical processing in mouse cortex, finding a gradual increase in times following the anatomical hierarchy. A model with gradual increase had more power for both correlation and times, indicating hierarchical processing in visual cortex. An alternative hypothesis is that recurrence enables longer information integration, thought to cause long times in primates. However, feedforward processing predicts higher times and hierarchy under stimulation with a movie compared to spontaneous activity. The results suggest decrease in predict can be caused by increase recurrent, as stronger coupling reduces temporal correlations from stimuli. Moreover, decreasing predict reflects efficient coding, where processing removes redundancy in spike trains. The study indicates intrinsic mechanisms, such as increase recurrent, shape temporal hierarchy.
Researchers used epidural recordings from the cervical spine of human subjects to develop a computational model of the motor cortex's response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive treatment for neuropsych disorders. The goal was to understand the neural circuits engaged during TMS, which are still poorly understood. Recordings of activity from the corticospinal tract provided a direct readout of the motor cortex's response to T, allowing for modeling of neural dynamics. Sensitivity analysis identified important pathways and machine learning was used to identify common features among these pathways. Single neuron types were found to preferentially contribute to corticosp waves, with the shortest conduction delay to layer 5 pyramidal tract (PT) neurons determining wave latency. Multiple neuron types also modulated cortic waves, with both excitatory and inhibitory neurons participating. Activation of afferents to the motor cortex and specific neuron types initiated different waves. The study proposes the origins of afferents giving rise to waves. The methodology provides a workflow for sensitivity analysis on complex models relating to network structure and mechanisms of response to acute stimulation.
Cell-free placental DNA (cDNA) is present in the mother's circulation throughout pregnancy and has significant potential as a research and clinical tool to investigate the placenta's genome across gestation without invasive procedures. Since its discovery in 1997, cDNA has been used in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) to screen for fetal genetic abnormalities, notably chromosomal aneuploies. However, the biology of cDNA remains poorly understood, limiting its research and clinical utility. This review examines current knowledge of cDNA, including origins and characteristics, gaps in knowledge, and future directions.

cDNA is shed into maternal circulation as early as the fourth week of gestation and comprises up to 40% of total plasma cell-free DNA. It is representative of the full placental genome, enabling non-invasive genome characterization of the placenta. NI has been implemented to screen for common aneupies, including Trisomies 13, 18, and 21 by assessing overrepresentation of affected chromosomes in plasma-free DNA. The effectiveness of NI for aneup screening has been reviewed elsewhere.

cDNA is a powerful tool for longitudinal studies of placental development and disease, hindered by ethical and availability of early and mid-gestation samples. This opens avenues for clinical applications beyond current NI repertoire, limited to genetic screening the fetus. The distinction between free-fetal and freeplac DNA is crucial, as placentalosa can occur, where fetal and placental genomes do not match.
Researchers have found that hormone-dependent cancers, such as breast, endometrial, and ovarian, and prostate cancer, share common genetic risk factors, suggesting a common underlying cause. Genome-wide studies have identified hundreds of cancer-specific genetic variants, but also found that some regions of the genome contain variants for multiple cancer types, indicating that common genes may drive these associations. The study analyzed large-scale data from breast, endrial, ovarian, and prostate cancer variants and found similar genomic distributions to random regions, supporting that risk regions co-localize in the genome and likely contain common target genes. They identified 44 regions across the genome that contain risk for at least two of these cancers, with some containing variants for all three or four. Integrating data from diverse cell models, they annotated 53 candidate genes at these regions, which were enriched with established cancer genes but many had no known roles. Additionally, they pinpointed long non-coding RNAs as potential targets and identified risk in regions that altered transcription factors, suggesting regulatory mechanisms. Known targets were overrepresented among candidate genes, implying some may serve as targets for development or repurposing existing treatments. The study provides a framework for identifying genes driving complex traits and understanding susceptibility.
Researchers investigated the genetic cause of polymyositis in the Kiker dog breed, a disease characterized by muscle weakness and inflammation. A genome-wide study of 33 cases and 106 controls identified a region on chromosome 19 associated with the disease. Further analysis revealed a 2.9 Mb region shared by cases in the homozygous or heterozygous state. Sequencing of DNA implicated a 39 kb deletion 10 kb upstream of interleukin genes IL21 and IL2. The deletion frequency was 0.81 in cases and 0.25 in a random Kiker breed sample. Leukocytes from affected dogs homozy for the deletion overexpressed IL and IL upon mitogen stimulation. The study suggests elements 10-49 upstream of IL/IL play a role in regulation and deletion is a risk factor for polymositis in Kiker dogs. Estimated penetrance was 10-20 for homozygous and 0.5-2 for heterozygous dogs. The results indicate variants may be found at least 10 kb upstream of IL. The study demonstrates involvement of IL/IL in polymositis in Kiker, but the responsible element and function are yet to be discovered.
Researchers have developed a new language model called ESMm that can predict the stability of proteins, which is crucial for various applications such as food processing, therapeutics, and identifying pathogenic mutations. The model was trained on a large dataset of 528 natural and de novo protein sequences from 461 domains, allowing it to accommodate deletions, insertions, and multiple mutations. The study shows that ESM can be fine-tuned to predict protein stability and performs reasonably well on small domains and generalizes to sequences not in the training set. However, its performance on larger proteins lags behind state-of-the-art methods. Training on an ensemble of protein domains instead of a single domain improves the performance of the fine-tuned model. The study highlights the need for large-scale stability measurements on a diverse dataset that mirrors the distribution of sequence lengths in nature. ESM was compared to other state-of-art methods in generalizing to longer proteins and larger scaffolds.
Researchers studied the role of inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (iIR) in autoimmunity, specifically in the context of Type 1 diabetes (T1), a disease where the immune system attacks healthy cells in the pancreas. iRs are a family of receptors expressed on natural killer (NK) cells and late-stage T cells, which regulate immune responses. They found that in the presence of genes encoding their ligands, iRs have a significant effect on Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) class II associations in T1. This suggests iRs modulate CD4 T cell responses, which play a major role in T1 etiology. The study analyzed a dataset of 11,961 cases and controls and validated the results in an independent set. The findings indicate iRs decrease protective HLA class II associations, suggesting iRs regulate CD4 T responses in T1. This is in contrast to previous findings that iRs enhance protective and detrimental HLA associations in viral infections, where an enhanced T response is beneficial.
Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FE) is a leading cause of age-related vision loss and the most common repeat-mediated disease in humans. Up to 80% of FE cases have been attributed to expansion of a non-coding CTG repeat (CT18.1) within the ubiquitously expressed transcription factor gene TCF. The non-coding nature of the repeat and transcript complexity of T4 have made it challenging to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. This study comprehensively describes CT18.1-driven components of disease in primary-derived corneal endothelial cells from a large cohort of individuals with CT18-expanded and CT-independent FE. Long-read, short, and spatial transcript techniques were used to interrogate expansion-specific transcript biomarkers. Long-read sequencing and alternative splicing of short transcript data revealed altered splicing in FE and transcripts associated with CT18 expansions. Differential expression highlighted transcript consequences of FE within cells. Exon usage, pathway, and spatial transcriptomics revealed T4 isoform skewing in FE with potential consequences. Exome data from 134 FE cases identified rare and potentially deleterious T4 variants, suggesting T4 independent of CT18 may increase FE risk. This study supports two distinct pathogenic mechanisms, RNA toxicity and T4 iso-specific dysregulation, underlying FE pathophysiology.
Researchers investigated the genetic basis of low-temperature germination (LT) in rice varieties used for direct seeding in cold climates. They identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) called qLT11 in the Arroz Terra variety, which shows rapid germination at lower temperatures. The QTL was narrowed down to a 52-kb interval containing the REGULATORY FACTOR14 (GFh) gene, expressed during seed germination. The Arroz Terra allele encodes functional GFh, while Japanese variety Hitome has a 4-bp deletion in the coding region. Knocking out GFh in a near-isogenic line (NIL) with the Ar Terra allele decreased LT, while overexpressing GFh in Hitomeore increased LT, indicating GFh is the causal gene behind q11. Analysis of numerous rice accessions revealed the functionalh allele was lost in popular varieties during breeding. A NIL in the Hitome background with a 172b genomic fragment from Ar Terra including GFh showed superior LT compared to Hitome, with comparable agronomic traits. The functionalh allele from Ar Terra represents a valuable resource for direct seeding in cold regions.
Researchers studied how the hepatitis B virus (HBV) replicates its genetic material. They focused on the 8-nucleotide-long terminal redundancy (TR) on the negative DNA strand of the virus, which is derived from the reverse transcription of pregenomic RNA. They wanted to know if this TR forms a 5' or 3' flap on the DNA and if it's removed during the formation of covalently closed DNA. To answer these questions, they created a mutant HBV cell line with a specific mutation in the pregen RNA sequence, altering the 3' TR while keeping the 5 TR wild type. They found that the production of HB DNA and coval closed DNA in these cells was similar to normal cells. Next-generation sequencing showed that the positive strand of DNA and both strands of coval DNA predominantly had the wild type 2 residue, indicating the 5 TR serves as the template for DNA replication and the 3 forms a flap, which is removed during coval formation. They also found that the cellular enzyme Mus81 plays a role in coval formation, alongside the enzyme F1. They mapped the sites where these enzymes cut the TR on the DNA. This study sheds light on how HBV replicates its genetic material and contributes to understanding the virus cycle.
Researchers studied the efficiency of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) in treating wastewater from a canned pineapple factory and found that the microbial community's performance is affected by industrial operations. They developed a model, called microbe-micro interaction genome metabolic (mmEM), to understand how microbes adapt to changing conditions. The model included three main groups: sulfate-reducing bacteria (SR), methogens (MET), and sulfide-oxidizing bacteria (SO). The study found that as organic loading rates (OLR) increased, the community shifted from SO-domin to METomin, with a decline in FC performance. The model accurately predicted microbial abundance at low OL and high OL. Simulations showed SO growth constraints under high OL due to reduced sulfate-sulf cycling and acetate crossfeeding with SR. More metabolites from SR were diverted to MET, making them dominant. Cross-feeding dynamics under OL enabled scenario simulations to explore acidity impact on SO growth and FC performance. The study highlights metabolic crossfeeding's role in shaping community response to OL. Insights will inform effective FC implementation in industrial environments.
Researchers are increasingly using machine learning (ML) to guide biological discovery in medicine, such as prioritizing promising molecules for drug discovery. ML models predict properties of biological systems and researchers use these predictions to prioritize candidates for experimental validation. However, when applied to new situations, these models can be overconfident and produce many false positives. To address this, a new framework, CPEC, is proposed to quantify model uncertainty and provide a set of hypotheses with a controlled false discovery rate (FDR) specified by researchers. CPEC integrates a deep learning model with a statistical tool called conformal prediction, providing accurate and FDR-controlled predictions for a protein function. Conformal provides statistical guarantees that the expected FDR will not exceed a user-specified level with high probability. Experiments show C achieves reliable F control, better or comparable performance at lower FDR than existing methods, and accurate for underrepresented proteins. C is expected to be a tool for discovery where high validation is desired but budget is limited.
Researchers studied the role of the heat shock protein HSP-90 in a model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutations in the TARDB gene, which codes for the protein TDP-43. They found that loss of function of HSP-90 protects against T-43 neurotoxicity and neurodegeneration in adult animals. This is accompanied by a decrease in total and phosphorylated T-43 protein. They also found that HSP-90 mutation upregulates key stress responsive heat shock gene expression, including HSP-70 and HSP-16.1, and that normal levels of HSP-16.1 are required for H-90 effects on T-43. The neuroprotective effect of H-90 does not involve regulation of proteasome activity in C. elegans. The study demonstrates that H-90 chaperone activity contributes to adverse outcomes in T- proteinopathies in vivo using a whole animal model of ALS.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the reproductive system of the Artemia franciscana, a type of crustacean, using a technique called single-nucle RNA sequencing. This allowed them to identify the different types of cells present in the ovary, including germ cells, follicle cells, and muscle cells. They compared their findings to the reproductive system of the fruit fly, Drosophila, and found that many of the programs that control cell identity and function are conserved between the two species. This suggests that these programs have been in place for over 500 million years. The study also looked at how genes are regulated during meiosis, the process of cell division that leads to egg production, and found unique dynamics in Artemia. They used a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin accessibility data to understand the transcription and epigenetic dynamics of germ cells during oogenesis. The research highlights the potential of single-nucle RNA sequencing as a tool for studying meiotic sex regulation in species where it is difficult to isolate meiotic cells.
Chronic pain is a widespread and debilitating condition that costs the United States around $600 billion annually. A common symptom of chronic pain is allodynia, where non-painful stimuli produce painful responses with variable presentations across individuals. The mechanisms are unclear, but allody is hypothesized to be caused by dysregulation of excitatory-inhibitory (E) balance in pain-processing neural circuitry in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Researchers analyzed biophysically-motivated subcircuit structures in laminae-II of the dorsal horn, hypothesized to mediate two types of allody: static and dynamic. They used neural rate models to describe activity of excitatory and inhibitory interneurons within subcircuits, accounting for experimentally-observed responses under healthy conditions. A sensitivity analysis identified mechanisms likely to cause allody-producing dysregulation of subc's E signaling. Disruption of E balance occurs due to downregulation of inhibitory signaling or upregulation of excitatory responses, depending on subc structure and components involved. These results suggest diverse mechanisms may be responsible for allody, offering predictions for interindividual variability and targets for experimental studies.

The dorsal horn's multiple excitatory and inhibitory interneurons suggest dysreg may occur through multiple mechanisms dependent on the injury. Modeling interactions among interuron populations for E balance in healthy and disruption allody is a step. Painful stimuli activate excitatory cells and downstream neurons, gated by inhib populations under healthy conditions. Allody occurs when E balance is disrupted, non-pain input causes excitatory firing, activating downstream neurons. Understanding chronic pain requires underlying causes. Dysreg of E in dorsal circuit is supported by preclinical studies, but its complexity leaves questions on how dysreg occurs.

Researchers describe subc motifs in dorsal laminae-II mediating static and dynamic allody. Including spiking in rate networks allows analysis of interactions with structure maintaining or disrupting E balance. Studies show static and dynamic allody by different afferent inputs.
Researchers studied the role of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) and its cochaperones in the function of elongation factor 2 (EF2), a protein essential for accurate translation of newly synthesized proteins. They found that Hsp and cochones have distinct roles in regulating EF2, with some mutations in Hsp or cochones reducing EF levels, while others affecting sensitivity to diphther toxin, a post-translational modification of EF2. The study suggests H90 contributes to protein homeostasis not only by folding but also by enabling translation of newly synthesized proteins. Further, results show that Hsp mutants have distinct in vivo effects correlating with defects in subsets of cochones, indicating different versions of the H90 pathway chaperone different clients. The study also found that H1, a protein bridging EF with C1 and Hsp or TRC, plays a role in EF folding and translation, and that H90 has critical roles in elongation in addition to initiation. Monitoring EF folding and susceptibility to dther toxin, results indicate H and cochones have distinct roles in mediating EF function, with folding dependent on H1, C7, and C1 cochones and sensitive to H90 mutants. The study aims to understand how clients interact with H90 and cochones to provide insight into selective inhibition of H90 function. Two isoforms of yeast H90, H82 and H82, are 97% identical, and EF, encoded by E1 and E2, have 100% identical isoforms.
Researchers investigated how people make decisions in social situations when their personal preferences are disrupted, such as when they have a brain injury or are faced with new options. Participants with lesions in the insula or dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, areas involved in decision-making, played a game where choices were made alone and after seeing others' choices. Both groups showed abnormal use of standard calculations for risky options in personal decisions. However, in social situations, they followed others' choices, regardless of calculations. This suggests that in social contexts, others' choices can be a shortcut for decision-making when utility-based processing is disrupted. 

Previous studies focused on how social information affects choices with respect to individuals' risk preferences. This study looked at decisions in social contexts when utility risk preferences are inaccessible, as in individuals with certain psychologies or novel options. A task was used to examine if heuristics facilitate socially situated decision about risk when processing is disrupted. Individuals with insula or dACC lesions showed disrupted utility risk processing and used social information to guide decisions. Findings suggest conformity can serve as alternative to utility-based information in social decision-making when individuals' processing is impaired. 

A relationship was found between degree of impairment and use of 'others' choices heuristic in both lesion and control groups. Those most disrupted in utility-based decision-making conformed most with others' choices. This was replicated in an independent sample, providing evidence for a trade-off between utility processes and cognitively demanding heuristics in social decisions.
Researchers have used Richard Dawkins' biomorphs, a model of morphological evolution, to demonstrate the power of natural selection in generating order from random mutations. However, they found that biomorphs can also illustrate how developmental biases shape evolutionary outcomes. They discovered that biomorphs exhibit a type of bias called phenotypic bias, where certain phenotypes are many orders of magnitude more likely to appear through mutations than others. This bias shows a preference for simpler phenotypes with lower complexity. This bias is formalized by an information-theoretic principle, which can be understood as evolution searching the space of algorithms. Using population simulations, they showed that moderately adaptive phenotypic variation appears more frequently through mutations at the expense of highly adaptive biomorphs that are less frequent. This result and other patterns in biom's structure, such as high mutational robustness and positive correlation between evolvability and robustness, resemble molecular-phenotype maps. These patterns can be explained by a model of constrained and unconstrained genome sections. The researchers postulate that bias towards simplicity and other biom patterns may hold for developmental systems.
Researchers investigated human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems by having participants interact with a virtual double pendulum through a haptic joystick. The study consisted of three experiments where participants hit targets aligned with or offset from the nonlinear modes (N) of the system. Results showed that participants intuitively applied a control strategy to excite and stabilize the pendulum's motion close to the N, even when targets were not aligned with it. For increased accuracy, participants adjusted arm stiffness to align resonant motions with the task. This study extends existing research on human resonance sensitivity to nonlinear systems, demonstrating capabilities to control and exploit resonant motions in dynamic interactions, possibly through muscle stiffness changes. A tool was used to compute nonlinear modes in energy-conservative systems, allowing comparison with human motions. The pendulum was excited in various ways, not automatically falling to its N, and participants stabilized on a trajectory close to it by exploiting intrinsic dynamics. The study supports human sensitivity to resonance in nonlinear systems, intuitively exciting and stabilizing motions close to predicted modes.
In the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, a group of transcription factors called transition regulators (TSRs) play a crucial role in developmental processes such as biofilm formation, motility, genetic competence, and sporulation. However, the extent of their influence on bacterial physiology is not fully understood. This study demonstrates that two TS regulators, Sco and Abr, along with the Mar-family factor PR, negatively regulate the production of the iron chelator pulcherrin in B. subtilis. Genetic analysis shows that all three factors are necessary to limit pulerr production during exponential phase and influence the rate and amount of pulerr produced. Expression of the pulerr biosynthesis gene yC is under the control of Sco, Abr, and PR and correlated with the amount of pulerr produced. In vitro data indicate a direct role for Sco in controlling pulerr production with Abr and PR. The regulation by two distinct systems highlights the importance of pulerr in B. subtilis physiology. Biochemical analysis shows regulators of the pul biosynthesis operon and TS Sco and Abr bind the yC promoter with different affinities. Results indicate pulerr regulation in B. subtilis is tightly repressed during exponential growth by two regulatory systems. TS Sco and Abr have been studied for diverse roles in Bacillus physiology, including sporulation, competence, protease production, and biofilm formation. Microarray analysis of Sco on global expression was carried out in cells at different growth points in media. P and Abr regulate gene expression in vitro and evidence Sco binds yC in vitro. Together, establish a model where pul biosynthesis is regulated by nutrient levels during transition to stationary phase and input from PR linking stationary with extracellular sequestration.
After a spinal cord injury (SCI), patients may experience either detrusor-sphinct dyssynergia (DSD) or urinary incontinence, depending on the level of the injury. SD is characterized by the loss of coordinated control between the detrusor muscle, which increases bladder pressure to facilitate urination, and the urethral sphincter and pelvic muscles, which control the bladder outlet to restrict or permit emptying. Transcutaneous magnetic stimulation (TMS) applied to the spinal cord after SCI reduced SD and inence. Researchers developed a mathematical model to replicate the neuronal dysfunction of the bladder after SCI and incorporated additional neurophysiological features to replicate improvements in bladder function with lumbar T of the spine in patients with SCI. A computational model of the neural circuit of mictition based on Hodgkin-Hux equations replicated normal bladder function, added interneurons and network to reproduce dysfunctional mictition after SCI, and increased density and complexity of interactions of inhibitory and excitatory lumbar interneurons to provide diverse responses to intrinsic and extrinsic activation of interneurons after SCI. The model reproduced re-emergence of spinal voiding after SCI. Low-frequency TMS (1Hz) normalized control of voiding after SCI, while high-frequency T (30Hz) enhanced urine storage.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to estimate the growth rate of fungi from optical density (OD) data, which is easier to collect than direct measurements of fungal growth, such as hyphae length. The model accounts for the fact that OD is an indirect measure by linking it to true fungal growth, eliminating the need for new calibration data. This method outperformed other models in fitting and predicting OD growth curves and corrected discrepancies between morphology-specific rates inferred from OD versus directly measured data. The model treats OD as a variable distributed around a linear transformation of true fungal concentration, explicitly including calibration in the structure. It was tested on Aspergillus fumatus, a filamentous fungus, and showed ability to fit and predict OD time-course data and estimate morphology growth rates from directly measured data. This model is accessible to all microbiology labs that collect OD data, not just specialist labs with automated methods. Instead of directly measuring growth, indirect measures like OD can be used for growth estimation or mechanistic modeling. The model was developed for filamentous fungi, as calibration data for bacteria cannot be reused due to size and shape sensitivity of microbes. Directly fitting fungal growth to OD data resulted in misfit and lower rates compared to estimated from direct measures.
Beetles are the most diverse group of animals, with over 400,000 described species, and a wide range of sex chromosome types. Most beetles have XY sex chromosomes, but some have X0 sex determination mechanisms. Researchers created a whole-chromosome assembly of the beetle Tribolium confus, which has a neo-sex chromosome, and used 11 other beetle genomes to reconstruct sex chromosome evolution across Coleoptera. They found conserved ancestral groups of genes across beetles, while the ancestral X chromosome was maintained, but autosomes were added to the sex chromosomes. Neo-sex chromosomes evolved typical sex properties, including dosage compensation and non-random gene expression. Beetles provide a model to understand diverse sex evolution forces.

A broad phylogenetic sampling of beetles suggests they are a promising model to study sex evolution. Ancestral groups are maintained across beet, allowing study at the molecular level. The ancestral X is conserved in Coleoptera, but multiple neo-chromosomes formed in closely related species. Comparative analysis is needed to address patterns and forces across species. Researchers used genomic approaches to reconstruct sex evolution across Coleoptera, generating a new assembly for Tribolium confus and published assemblies from 11 species. Parthenogenesis was found in 7% of species, with fusions between chromosomes and autosomes creating neo-chromosomes. Sex chromosome types are typically inferred from testes, reported as XY, X0, and Xy.
Researchers studied the role of histone variant H2 (H2) in regulating gene expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. H2 is encoded by the non-essential HT1 gene and is evolutionarily conserved, and predominantly incorporated at transcription start sites by the SWR-complex (SW-C). While H2 has been implicated in transcription regulation, mutants exhibit minimal changes in gene expression compared to wild-type. However, growth defects in mutants are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of SW-C subunits, suggesting previous work may be confounded by deleterious activity of SW-C when missing H substrate. H mutants display significant growth defects in genotoxic conditions, suggesting a role in gene regulation may be uncovered after exposure to stress. To explore this, mRNA profiles were generated for wild-type, mutants, and before and after exposure to hydroxyurea (H), which induces DNA stress. Data showed H played a prominent role in activation during H exposure and was important for upregulation of several H-induced genes. Apo-SW-C contributed to defects in mutants, particularly in phosphate regulation. Mapping H incorporation before and after treatment revealed decreases at transcription sites correlated with upregulation during exposure. This study characterized the effects of H incorporation during transcriptional response to H.
Researchers have been using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA) data to advance our understanding of developmental biology, but classifying transcriptomic profiles from scRNA experiments into cell types and identifying individual cell lineages has become challenging due to the accumulation of large datasets and high dimensionality of data. To overcome this, automated classification methods are needed, but classical approaches rely on supervised training with fully annotated data, which is difficult to obtain at single-cell resolution. Instead, the authors propose using partial learning, where a set of candidate labels is given for each data point, a simpler setting than fully supervised. They extend state-of-the-art multi-classification methods, such as SVM, kNN, prototype, logistic regression, and ensemble to partial learning, and study the effect of incorporating label structure into methods, focusing on hierarchical labels observed in developmental processes. On simulated and real datasets, these extensions enable learning from partially labeled data with high accuracy, particularly prototype-based method. Performances with partially annotated data reach fully supervised. The authors study uncertainty in partially annotated data and derive prescriptive results on effect on accuracy of partial learning. Hierarchical and non-hierarchical label strategies help automated single-cell transcriptomic classification, relying less stringent annotated datasets than fully learning.
Researchers investigated the role of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (P2) in the formation of nuclear compartments such as speckles, nucleoli, and nuclear lipidlets, and its involvement in RNA polymerase II transcription. They found that P2 localization is dependent on the presence of higher-order RNA and identified proteins that associate with P2 in a higher RNA-dependent manner. Using mass spectrometry, they unveiled the RNA-dependent P2-associated (RD) proteome in human cells and found that intrinsically disordered regions (ID) with basic P2-binding motifs are prevalent in RD proteins. These ID of RD proteins exhibit enrichment for phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination sites. The study showed that bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) associates with P2 in an RNA-dependent manner via electrostatic interactions and altered P2 levels affect the number of nuclear foci of BR4. The researchers propose that P2 spatially orchestrates nuclear processes through association with RNA and RD proteins and affects their ability to form foci via phase separation, suggesting a pivotal role in establishing a functional nuclear architecture for gene expression.
Researchers investigated the evolutionary basis of phenotypic plasticity in dung beetles, specifically the Scarabinae clade, known for their diversified development of cephalic horns, which exhibit remarkable intra and interspecific variation. They generated chromosome-level genome assemblies of three Onthagini tribe species, including Onophagus taurus, O. sagarius, and Digitophagusella, and compared them to seven other Coleoptera species, identifying changes in coding sequences associated with metabolic regulation of metamorphosis. Chromatin accessibility in developing horn tissues of high and low-nutrition males and females revealed distinct cis-regulatory architectures underlying nutrition-responsive development, including a large proportion of recently evolved elements sensitive to horn determination. Binding of known and new transcription factors were enriched in nutrition-open chromatin regions. The study highlights the importance of chromatin regulation in mediating development and evolution of plastic traits, demonstrating gene networks are highly evolvable transducers of environmental and genetic signals, and provides reference genomes for three species bolstering future developmental, ecological, and evolutionary studies of this group.
Researchers used a monkey model to study Lassa fever, a disease caused by Lassa virus (LASV), to understand why some infected people recover while others die. They found that lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes and spleen, are early reservoirs for the virus in all infected animals, regardless of disease severity. However, the virus behavior and immune response differ between fatal and non-fatal cases. In fatal cases, the virus spreads to many organs and causes inflammation, while in non-fatal cases it is limited to lymphoid organs and immune cells. This study provides new insights into the dynamics of LASV infection and host response according to disease outcome. A monkey model was developed to mimic fatal and non-fatal Lassa fever, showing that lymphoid organs are crucial for virus replication in all infected animals. Two strains of LASV, Josiah and AV, were used to infect monkeys, resulting in fatal and non-severe disease, respectively. The study analyzed the dynamics of these strains to shed light on Lassa pathogenesis and immune mechanisms. Animal models are essential to understand Lassa fever and why some patients control the virus while others die. In fatal cases, the virus spreads to many organs, while in non-fatal it is limited to a few. Previous studies showed LAS strains from lineage 5 cause less severe disease than Josiah in monkeys.
Researchers have investigated the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) disruptions in neurodegenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), frontal dementia, and temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). They found that mislocalization of nuclear complex proteins, transport receptors, Ran-GTP, and RanGAP are seen in both familial and sporadic forms of these diseases. However, it is unclear whether these alterations are a primary cause or consequence of the disease. The study used two mouse models of neurodegeneration, Nemf86 and NemRg, which recapitulate cellular and biochemical aspects of neurodegenerative diseases, and found Import-β-specific nuclear block. They observed cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of proteins implicated in pathogenesis of ALS/FT and AD/AD, including TDP, Importβ, Ran1, and Ran. These findings are supported by pathological interaction between Importβ and mutant Nemf86 protein in cytoplasm accumulations. The study also identified transcriptional dysregulation in genes associated with neurogenerative disease. Pharmaceutical inhibition of Importβ in mouse and human neuronal cells induced proteinopathies and transcriptional alterations seen in mouse models. Convergent results between mouse and human cellular biology provide evidence that mislocalized and dysregulated events in multiple neurogener diseases may arise from primary defect Importβ import. This has implications for investigating sporadic forms neurogeneration from unidentified genetic and environmental perturbations Importβ function.
Scientists have been studying bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect bacteria, to understand their potential medical and biotechnological applications. To do this, they need to understand how bacteriophages infect bacteria. CRISPR-Cas, a tool that edits DNA, can be used to study this process. However, bacterophages can resist CRIS-Cas by modifying their DNA, making it hard to edit. Researchers used an enzyme, NgET, to temporarily remove these modifications, making it easier to edit bacterophage DNA. This allowed them to introduce precise changes to the bacterophage genome without leaving a scar. They used this to turn off specific enzymes that help bacteriophage infect bacteria. By removing modifications, they could see how they affect bacterophage infection without deleting genes. This approach helps study bacterophage functions and engineer them with modified DNA. Temporarily changing bacterophage modifications is useful for biology and understanding how bacteriages infect.
The genome of living cells is constantly challenged by DNA lesions that interfere with cellular processes such as transcription and replication. Multiple mechanisms work together to ensure DNA repair, gene expression, and genome stability. Large DNA lesions, such as those caused by UV light or DNA-damaging agents like 4-nitroquinoline, act as transcription and replicational roadblocks and pose a major threat to cell metabolism. When located on the transcribed strand of genes, these lesions are handled by transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TCER), a poorly understood repair pathway. Researchers used a genetic screen in yeast Saccharces cerevisiae to identify histone H2Z as an important component for transcription and DNA integrity following UV irradiation. Without HZ, repair by TCER is severely impaired and RNA polymerase II clearance is reduced, leading to an increase in double-strand breaks. HZ is needed for proficient TCER and plays a role in maintaining genome stability upon UV irradiation. The study highlights the significance of a DNA-optimized chromatin environment in maintaining genomic stability.
Researchers analyzed gene expression in the midgut, hindgut, and Malpian tub as well as microbiome in the gut of Drosoph melanogaster and their F hybrids from two divergent populations: one from the European and one from the African range. They found extensive tissue and genetic-specific effects, with tissue-specific effects stronger than genetic-specific. The two gut tissues were more similar to each other than the Malian tub. Examination of allele expression revealed both cis and trans effects more tissue-specific in different populations than conserved genes, trans effects more-specific than cis. Despite variable architecture, this was robust across tissues and backgrounds, suggesting trans variation can be fine-tuned as well as cis during divergence. Transcript data from parental and F hybrid D melanog strains showed genetic and mode of variation highly tissue and background-specific. Gene expression was similar between the Mal tub and gut, despite being part of excret and digestive system, while gut part alimentary canal. Findings demonstrate functionally interconnected tissues can show divergent architecture among and backgrounds. Overall, results yield insight into regulatory evolution, effects on tissue specificity, genetic on expression and microbiome, and importance of contextuality in studies.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the date of the first SARS-CoV-2 infection that led to the COVID-19 pandemic using a population dynamics approach and early reported cases. They validated their model with simulated data and applied it to two examples: the emergence of the Alpha variant in the UK in 2020 and the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan in 2019. The model estimated the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wu at November 28, 2019 with a 95% confidence interval of November 2-December 9, 201. This falls within previously estimated ranges using genomic data. The framework is generic and can be applied to other outbreaks beyond COVID-19. The model estimates the time between the first SARS-CoV-2 infection and the Nth symptomatic COVID-19 case at 52 days with a 95% interval of 41-78 days. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 was previously estimated to have occurred between October and December 2019 using a stochastic model and genomic data. The new method ignores genomic information and focuses on population dynamics. The estimate of the first SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wu is 8 days before a previous estimate using genomic data.
Researchers have investigated the process of homologous chromosome pairing during meiosis, which is essential for the formation of haploid gametes from diploid cells, a prerequisite for sexual reproduction. In the presence of non-homologous chromosomes, the mechanisms ensuring stable homolog alignment remained unclear, but rapid chromosome movements appeared to play a role. Apart from homolog attraction, provided by early intermediates of homolog recombination, dissociation of non-holog associations also contributed to hom pairing. An agent-based model was developed from naturally occurring chromosome dynamics, simulating unidirectional movements and collision dynamics by attractive and repulsive forces from close-range interactions. Chromosome number, size, velocity, and repulsive forces were identified as key factors in kinetics and efficiency of homolog pairing, in addition to hom attraction. Dissociation interactions between non-holog chromosomes contributed by crowding homolog into a limited area, creating conditions for close homolog attraction. The model accurately recapitulated efficiency and kinetics of hom pairing for wild-type and mutant meiosis in budding yeast, and can be adapted to nuclear and chromosome dimensions of other organisms.
A study investigated the role of microRNA-34 (miR-34) in zebraf and its interaction with the TP53 tumor suppressor gene. mi-34 is a target of p53 and its expression is induced by DNA damage. However, mi-34-null mice exhibit normal p53 responses and no cancer development, but lack of mi-34 promotes tumorigenesis in cancer-susceptible backgrounds. mi-34 genes are highly conserved between zraf and humans. In zraf, mi-34a and mi-34/c have similar expression timing but mi-34 is more abundant. DNA damage led to p53 induction of mi-34 genes, while mi-34 mutants were viable and had normal damage-induced apoptosis. mi-34 loss enhanced erythrocyte levels and upregulated my-positive hematietic stem cells. Overexpression of mi-34 suppressed reporter, not p53 induction and sensitized embryos to camothin but not γ-irradiation. The study found that mi-34 is partially dependent on p53 for induction and baseline expression, with some residual induction due to other transcription factors activated by damage. mi-34 tumor-suppressive function was demonstrated by earlier onset in mi-34 and tp mutants compared to single tp mutants. Transient overexpression of mi-34 increased sensitivity to camothin treatment but not γiradiation. Despite mi- loss not affecting p53 genes, its effects on tp mutant zraf were evaluated given epigenetic silencing of MIR34 in humans with TP mutant alleles contributes to cancer.
In the nematode C. elegans, sex determination is controlled by the master regulator OL-1 during embryogenesis. The expression of OL-1 is dependent on the ratio of X chromosomes to autosomes, which differs between hermaphrodites (XX) and males (XO). In hermaphrodites, OL-1 is highly expressed, while in males OL-1 is expressed at low levels. OL-1 is known to be critical for proper male development, but its low expression was thought to be minimal in hermrodite development. This study reveals OL- plays a role as a regulator of developmental timing in hermrodogenesis. Using imaging and bioinformatics, hermrod embryos have accelerated cell division and developmentally advanced transcription when OL-1 is lost. Further analysis shows OL- regulates initiation of dosage compensation on X chromosomes and sex-based transcription programs in hermrod. OL- mutant embryos overexpress the H3 methyltransferase MET-2 with altered H3me landscape. Loss of MET- reverses some effects of OL- loss. This demonstrates OL plays a role as regulator in embryos of both sexes, and MET as downstream of OL activity in hermrod.

In C. elegans, pathways regulated by OL- in males were examined to understand its role in hermrod development. In males, OL- represses S proteins, which regulate sex determination and dosage in herrod. The ratio of elements differs between sexes. Hermrod have X:A ratio 1, while males have X:A 0.5. Xs and ASE compete to repress/activate OL- in early, due to lower X ratio in males, OL transcription is activated. This study confirms OL is transcribed in herrod early at low levels, but shows loss results in significant transcription profile changes. OL mutant embryos show accelerated herm development and precocious establishment of dosage and sex pathways.
Researchers have developed a computational framework called MGSurveillance (Mosquito Gene Surveillance) to optimize the placement of mosquito traps for genetic surveillance in the field. This is particularly relevant for gene drive projects, which aim to control mosquito populations on a large scale, but require monitoring for unintended spread and emergence of resistant alleles. MGSurveillance takes into account biological features of mosquitoes and their habitats, such as food sources, breeding sites, and movement patterns, and trap attractiveness. It minimizes the time to detect an allele of interest, allowing for remediation when possible. The framework was tested on Anopheles gambia in São Tomé and Principe and Aedes aegypt in Queensland, Australia, demonstrating optimal trap placement. MGSurveillance is a resource for field and computational researchers interested in mosquito surveillance. The study highlights the importance of early detection, as seen in invasive species studies, where early detection minimizes impact and preserves possibility of elimination.
Researchers studied the microorganism Symbonas scillans, a 1.4 micrometer heterotrophic eukaryote, to investigate the presence of endosymbiotic bacteria in its endoplasmic reticulum. They generated amplification-free metagenomics and whole genome sequencing data from two strains, RCC257 and RCC24, but found no sequences of known endosymbiotic bacteria. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis also confirmed the absence of endobacteria. Instead, numerous contigs from both strains were related to prasiniruses infecting green algae Ostreoccus lucarin, Bathoccus prinos, and Micromonas pus. Using the Bp genome as a reference, they assembled a near-complete 190bp draft genome encoding hallmark prirus genes and two incomplete assemblies of related viruses from RCC257 and RCC. Transmission electron microscopy revealed a 190nm virus-like particle similar to the endosion originally reported in Sscillans. The study concludes that Sill does not harbor an endosymb bacterium but is associated with viruses.
A family of actin-binding proteins called leiomodin (L) plays a crucial role in muscle function. Mutations in three members of this family (MOD1-3) result in human diseases. Mutations in the predominant cardiac isoform, MOD2, lead to severe neonatal dilated cardiomyopathy. Most disease-causing mutations in the MOD gene are nonsense or frameshift, predicted to result in expression of truncated proteins. However, in nearly all cases of disease, little to no MOD protein is expressed. Researchers found that nonsense-mediated decay, a cellular mechanism that eliminates mRNAs with premature codons, underlies loss of mutant protein from two MOD2 disease-causing mutations. They generated steric-blocking oligonucleotides that obstruct the exon complex, preventing nonsense-mediated decay of MOD2 transcripts, restoring mutant expression. This lays groundwork for potential intervention in MOD-linked myopathies.

Homozygous or heterozygous mutations in MOD, the isoform in skeletal, result in nemal myopathy, a muscle disorder by weakness. Disease mutations have been found in cardiac-predant iso, MOD. A mutation in MOD results in severe neon dilated cardiopathy. In a patient with disease-causing MOD, MOD protein not detected via western blot and RT-PCR revealed decrease MOD mRNA, no preRNA. Thus, hypothesized nonsense-mediated decay underlies loss mutant expression. Two MOD disease-causing mutations associated dil cardiopathy lack MOD protein through decay. Developed steric oligonucleotides to inhibit decay MOD transcripts, increasing mutant-truncated protein.

Most MOD muscle diseases have common pathophysiology thin filaments reduced contractility weakness. Most-causing MOD genes are nonsense frameshift predicted truncated. However, in cases little no MOD expressed. Degradation mutant containing termination by decay limit effectiveness stop-read drugs. Treatment with oligonucleotides inhibiting decay combination drug promotes full protein result rescue function patients MOD.
Researchers studied how different versions of the apolipoprotein E (Apo) gene affect the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. They found that one version, Apo4, increases the risk, while another, Ap2, decreases it. To understand why, they looked at how these versions change the way proteins are made and broken down in the brain and liver of mice with the human Apo gene. They found that Ap4 and Ap2 change how proteins in the mitochondria, the energy-producing parts of cells, in the brain, but not the liver. Ap4 makes it harder for mitochondria to work together, while Ap2 makes them work better by breaking down old ones and replacing them with new ones. This suggests that Ap4 might make Alzheimer's worse by not getting rid of bad mitochondria, while Ap2 might protect by keeping them healthy. The study also found that looking at how proteins are made and broken down helps understand how they work in the body.
Researchers have developed a new tool called CRISPR-TRM (CRIS-mediated tissue-restricted mutagenesis) to knock out genes in specific cells of the Drosila nervous system, including motoneurons, muscles, and glial cells. This is a powerful approach to study gene functions during development. They validated CRPRTRM by knocking out multiple genes in each tissue and demonstrated its use with the Gal/UAS expression system and simultaneous knockout of redundant genes. They used CRTRM to discover a role for SNARE components in neuromuscular junction (NM) maintenance. They also found that the ESC pathway suppresses NM growth by downregulating retrograde signaling. Additionally, they found that axon termini of motoneurons rely on ESC-mediated intra-axonal trafficking to release extracellular vesicles at NM. The researchers successfully developed an NM CRIS mutagenesis approach to reveal genes for NM structural plasticity.
During the larval stages of Drosophila development, the lymph gland contains a pool of progenitor cells that accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is essential for their differentiation. Studies have shown that ROS triggers the activation of JNK (c-Jun Kinase), which upregulates fatty acid oxidation (FA) to facilitate progenitor differentiation. However, the entire progenitor pool does not differentiate simultaneously in late larval stages. Researchers found that the Dophila NF-κ transcription factor Rel shields the progenitor pool from metabolic pathway that induces differentiation by curtailing activation of JNK. ROS serves as a metabolic signal for progenitor differentiation, but its input is monitored by developmental TAK, regulated by Rel. This circuit ensures the stock of ROS-primed progenitors is not exhausted. The study reveals how NFκ-like factors integrate with metabolic pathways crucial for cell fate transition during development. 

The NFκ factor Rel is present in embryonic lymph, but its expression is restricted to larval progenitors. Overexpressing Rel in progenitors leads to downregulation of FA. Negative regulation of NF-κ signaling on fatty oxidation has been reported in various conditions. The progenitor population within the gland is intercepted from precocious differentiation. Developmentally, high ROS levels in blood cells elicit JNK to facilitate differentiation. The J-FA axis is essential for progenitor differentiation. The study shows Dila NFκ factor Rel expresses in ROS-rich progenitors and decreases as cells move towards differentiation. Loss of Rel from progenitors leads to activation of JFA, coaxing differentiation. Rel expression decreases in edges, inhibition T1 is lost. Absence restrains T1 results in sustained J activation, impinging FA and progenitor differentiation.
Tay-Linder syndrome (TALS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by severe microcephaly, abnormal gyral pattern, growth retardation, and bone abnormalities. It is caused by pathogenic variants in the RNUAT gene. However, a patient presented with T features but no pathogenic variants were found in RNUAT, instead the homozygous RT c.295A variant was detected by whole-exome sequencing. Analysis of the impact of the variant on RT function in centrosome engineered RT-depleted cells and patient fibroblasts revealed cell cycle and mitotic abnormalities, aneuploidy, cycle arrest, and cell death. In corticaloids, an additional function of RT in self-organisation of neural stem cells into roset was observed, with delayed ap-basal polarization. These defects contributed to delayed roset formation in RT-mated organoids, impeding growth and shedding light on mechanisms to microcephaly.
Researchers studied how the bacterium Escherichia coli adapts to survive long periods without resources by entering a state called long-term stationary phase (LT). They allowed E. coli populations to grow on rich media and then stopped providing new resources for six years, sampling hundreds of clones at 12 time points. Whole-genome sequencing revealed several aspects of adaptation dynamics. E. coli continuously adapts through convergent accumulation of mutations up to six years, establishing long-lasting lineages. These lineages are similar across populations, arising independently, with parallel adaptations occurring under LT. This structure enables identifying pairs of loci with significant mutation associations, suggesting historical contingency. Associations are frequent, with a third of mutated loci involved in at least one. Results show LT adaptation is characterized by high parallelism and frequent contingency.
Researchers have re-examined the role of the male-specific (MSA) transcript in Drosophila melanogaster, previously thought to be a non-coding RNA, and found it codes for a microptide that regulates sperm usage in mated females. MSA shares a promoter with another transcript, iab-8nc, expressed in the central nervous system, but produces a peptide while i-8 does not. The study investigated why i-8 is not translated and found that a repressive mechanism involving unique 5' exons of i-8nc prevents protein production due to upstream open reading frames in these exons. Using cell culture and transgenic analysis, they showed this mechanism relies on the presence of these open reading frames preventing downstream translation. 

The i-8 transcript is expressed in the central nervous system and its loss leads to male and female sterility due to loss of microRNA within its introns. A shorter version, male-specific MSA, is found in male abdomen and codes for microptide MSi that mediates sperm usage in mated. The difference between MSA and i-8 lies in their first exons. A previous study inserted the mCherry sequence into i-nc and found it was spliced into mature i- but no fluorescence was detected in CNS, only in male accessory glands. This suggests MSA is specific to accessory glands. The study used GFP reporter constructs and transgenic flies to show upstream AT sequences in 5 exons of i- prevent translation of i- transcript.
Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of rare, multisystem disorders characterized by seizures, hypotonia, and developmental delays. However, due to the ubiquity of glycosylation, symptoms can affect most systems. Mutations in glycosylation pathways, such as N-glycosylation, O-glycosylation, and GPI synthesis, lead to CD. Because of similar symptoms and physiology, there are likely common genetic modifiers between CD. Researchers used evolution as a tool to identify modifiers between CD glycos genes. Glycosylation is conserved from yeast to mammals. Evolutionary covariation (ERC) identifies proteins with similar rates indicate shared functions and pathways. ERC between N-glycosylation and GPI synthesis revealed signatures with ncRNA modification and DNA repair proteins. Patterns ERC based on cellular localization of GPI synthesis enzymes were also identified. Testing top candidates validated genetic interactions and identified novel modifiers of CD genes. ERC analysis disease and pathways allows prioritization of potential modifiers, providing understanding disease pathophysiology and novel targets.
Researchers have discovered a crucial step in the process of how the hepatitis B virus (HBV) assembles its genetic material into a protective shell called a capsid. They found that a protein called HBc plays a key role in this process. HBc has two parts: an N-terminal (NTD) that helps assemble the caps and C-terminal (CTD) that wraps around the genetic material called pgRNA. Phosphorylation, a chemical change that adds a phosphate group to a protein, is essential for HBCTD to work with another protein called polymerase (Pol) to package pgRNA. However, as the caps mature, HBCT undergoes dephosphorylation, losing the phosphate group, suggesting a host enzyme called phosphatase is involved. Using a specific antibody, researchers observed a transition from phosphorylated to dephosphorylated state during pg packaging. They confirmed this by substituting a single amino acid in Pol, which blocked deosphorylation. Further analysis showed that host phosphat PP is recruited by Pol's domain, not HB, and requires RNA signal to do so. This suggests Pol-pRNA complex plays a role in PP recruitment. Pol-pRNA-PP deosphory of HB-S170 is essential for pg encapsulation and associated with late endosomes/multivesicular bodies (MVs). HB may play a dual role by bringing pgRNA to phosphorylated HB and recruiting PP for completion. These findings reveal the mechanism of Pol-mediated deosphory of HB regulates pg encapsulation and potential target for antiviral development.
Researchers studied the role of bacterial symbionts in the adaptation of marine organisms to changing environmental conditions, using the closure of the Isthmus of Panama as a natural experiment. They sequenced the genomes of endosymbiotic bacteria in two sets of sister species of chemosymbivalves from genera Codia and Cten, collected on either side of the isthmus, to investigate how environmental conditions influenced the selection of symbts and their metabolic capabilities. The lucid sister species hosted Candidatus Thiazotrophia symbts, with those from the Caribbean having genetic potential for nitrogen fixation, while those from the Tropical Pacific did not. Nitrogen-fixing ability did not correspond to symbion phylogeny, suggesting convergent evolution under nutrient-poor conditions. Reconstructing the evolutionary history of nifDK operon revealed the common ancestor lacked n genes, populations in oligotrophic habitats required the operon through horizontal gene transfer from Sedimentola symbt lineage. The study suggests H of n operon facilitated diversification of globally distributed Ca Thiazro enducida clade. Nitrogen availability drove ecological diversification of chemynthetic symbt species, highlighting bacterial role in adaptation to changing conditions.
Researchers have studied the TAS2 family of protein-coupled receptors, which are responsible for detecting bitter taste in vertebrates. While most research has focused on mammals, the study of TASRs in other vertebrates has been less explored. This study analyzed 661 vertebrate genomes and found that frogs and salamanders have a high number of TASR genes, unlike other vertebrates. Most TASR genes are found in clusters, but amphibians have more clusters and genes per cluster. The study found that TASRs have one-to-one orthologs between closely related species, but total TASR count is stable in most lineages. TASR count is proportional to receptors expressed in extraoral tissues. In vitro assays, many amphibian TASRs function as tissue-specific chemosensors detecting ecologically important xeniotics. The study suggests that increases in TASR number allowed for acquisition of tissue-specific functions, or gene subfunctionalization. The study also found that the number of expressed receptors not in the tongue is proportional to the number of TASRs in the genome.
Researchers investigated the role of Notch dimerization in regulating transcription and intestinal stem cell maintenance in mice. They found that Notch dimer-deficient (NDD) mice are sensitive to environmental insults but develop normally otherwise. Transcriptomic analysis of colon spheroids showed no evidence of dimer-dependent gene regulation, impaired stem cell maintenance in vitro, and an elevated epithelial immune response, likely causing heightened sensitivity in NDD mice. Further analysis revealed an unbalanced interactome with reduced interaction of NOT2 with transcription machinery but preserved with HD2 interactome, suggesting modulation via cooperativity. The HD2 inhibitor Valpro acid (PA) prevented intestinal consequences of DD and gamma-secretase inhibitors in mice spheroids, suggesting synergy between HD activity and differentiation program in stem cells. To identify changes in dimer vs monomer Not interactome, TurboID and nano-spray MS/MS mass spectrometry in human colon cell line HT-29 showed similar biotinylated NTC and partners. Notch dimer in mammals is about proteome environment with consequences to immunity and hypersensitivity of NDD. HD3 interacts with NIC, regulating stability and activity. Not activation expands stem niche at expense of goblet and entero cells. NDD mice show environmentally modulated susceptibility DSS and decrease colonic cells.
Researchers have developed a new theory to explain how background selection affects genetic diversity and differentiation in populations. Background selection occurs when natural selection acts on deleterious (harmful) alleles, reducing diversity at linked neutral sites. The theory is split into two regimes: the background regime, where selection is strong and mutation rates are low, and the interference regime where selection is weak and mutation rates are high. Previous studies focused on the background regime, but not the interference regime. The new theory predicts the effects of migration on background selection in a subpopulation and extends the interference regime to an island model. Simulations show the theory accurately predicts genetic diversity and differentiation. Background selection may increase differentiation under high migration rates, but reduce diversity, especially in large populations. The work extends background selection theory to structured populations and suggests it may confound locus-to-locus differentiation scans. The theory accounts for migration, in addition to selection and recombination, breaking cross-gener associations between neutral and deleterious alleles. In high migration rates, deleter alleles emigrate before removal by selection, reducing background effects on differentiation and diversity.
Researchers have emphasized the importance of increasing genetic and phenotypic data to understand disease determinants, but face challenges in sharing data among institutions due to methodological barriers and privacy concerns. To address this, they developed FedGAT, a federated genetic testing tool that uses a federated statistical approach to correct for confounding and polygenic effects without sharing data among sites. Using simulated and real datasets, FedAT achieves similar results to pooled analysis under a privacy-preserving framework with practical requirements. However, federated studies have challenges, such as designing harmonized data collection and covariates, may lead to meta-analyses sharing summary statistics instead. Current research focuses on secure GWAS, but lacks correcting confounding poly effects due to complexity. The proposed FedAT integrates random effects and study designs without algorithm changes, an advantage from efficient GAT formulation. A privacy-preserving feder GW algorithm, FedAT, uses homomorphic encryption and One-Time Pad encryption to protect statistics aggregated in feder setting, increasing data sharing and protection.
Prostate cancer is a heritable disease with ancestry-based incidence and mortality, and polygenic risk scores (PRS) have shown promise in predicting disease risk, including prostate cancer. However, their accuracy continues to improve, and research aimed at enhancing their effectiveness in African and Asian populations is key for equitable use. Recent algorithm developments for PRS derivation have resulted in pan-ancestral risk prediction for several diseases. This study benchmarks the predictive power of six widely used PRS algorithms, including four that adjust for ancestry, against prostate cancer cases and controls from the UK Biob and All of Us cohorts, finding modest improvement in discriminatory ability compared to a simple method prioritizing variants, clumping, and polygenic scores. The study underscores the importance of improving risk algorithms and sampling diverse cohorts.

Advances in genetics have led to improved cross-ance PR disease prediction, but these models have not been formally assessed in prostate cancer. A comprehensive analysis across biob-scale datasets benchmarked six algorithms, finding modest over traditional methods. These are based on variant prioritization, shrinkage, joint statistics, annotation, mapping, and population heritability. This is the first study to assess panance polygenic prostate in the All Us cohort. Hierarchical clustering stratified poly scores by ancestry.

PRS-strat prostate antigen screening may reduce overdiagnosis and over-treatment with screening, but ancestry-associated incidence and outcome biases require scores work equally across populations to limit disparities. The study evaluated published scores in the UKob cohort, finding no differences in cancer or risk factors such as year, BMI, smoking, or alcohol. Public poly scores were tested in the dataset. Briefly, models were trained on allelic scoring and first 10 components with cross-validation, regardless population. Predictive models improved integration age and poly. Similar UKob, addition history and BMI did not increase power. The utility of UKob dataset shows genetic coupled with age predicts cancer.
Researchers have identified a potential treatments for DPAG1CD, a congenital disorder of glycosylation caused by mutations in the DP1 gene, which encodes the first enzyme in N-glycosylation. They used a Drosophila model of DP1CD with an improperly developed, small eye phenotype and performed a drug repurposing screen on 1,520 FDA-approved drugs, finding 42 candidates that improved the model. Notably, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor partially rescued the DP1 model, suggesting that dopaminergic signaling and binding to D2 receptors is detrimental under DP1 deficiency. This links dopamine to glycosylation and represents a new therapeutic target for DP1CD. The study also validated other drug categories, including acetylcholine, CO inhibitors, and NK1 inhibitors, revealing novel biology in DP1 mechanisms and potential new options for DP1CD.

The Dophila model was created by knocking down DP1, resulting in a small, improperly developed eye. In vitro analysis of DP1CD patient proteins showed 10-50% activity, indicating 35% of normal DP1 expression is sufficient to model DP deficiency. A drug repur screen in Dophila for DP1CD could find new therapeutics. The study screened 1,520 molecules, identifying 42 that suppress DP1CD and confirmed many interactions. Findings were verified using pharmac and genetic manipulation, aligning with known mechanisms. New connections were established between DP1 and DA, NK1, and prostagland synthesis.

Multiple drugs improved the Dila model, with 8/21 (38%) validated in further analysis and 6/16 (38) improved DP1. All tested were genetically validated by manipulating targets in Dila. The opposite effect of receptors to D2 suggested an opposite effect on eye size. Heterozygous mutations in D1 and D2 were crossed into DP1, supporting the hypothesis. DP1 flies with heterozygous D1 mutation had worse eyes than DP1 alone.
Researchers investigated how the brain represents limb position and movement through proprioception, a fundamental for controlling movement, yet poorly understood sense. They developed a topographic variational autoencoder with lateral connectivity (topoVA) to create a cortical map from natural movement data. The model, not trained on neural data, replicated two monkey reaching experiments: 1) shape and velocity of proprioceptive fields in hand-centered coordinates without arm or hand system knowledge, and 2) distribution of preferred directions from multi-electrode arrays. The model predicts: 1) blob-pinwheel geometry of preferred directions across cortex, 2) few neurons encode single joint. This provides a basis for understanding sensorimotor representations and neural manifolds, with applications in brain-computer interfaces and humanoid control. 

The model translates proprio inputs into a latent representation read as neural firing. It learns efficient spike code with minimal bias, generalizing to other sensory regions. Proprioceptive areas enable goal-directed behavior, but unclear what properties facilitate this. The model relates kinematics to proprio encoding, comparing to single-unit recordings. A novel model predicts coding and spatial organisation across cortex. The topoVA model predicts function and structure, trained, validated, and tested on human kinematics, exploring emergent proprio in its layer. Further constraints will elucidate brain principles. The model's organisational principles, based on human kinematics, extend to monkeys.
Researchers have explored the role of ethylene, a plant hormone involved in growth and stress responses, in plant-micro interactions from the plant's perspective. However, few studies have examined its role in microbes. This study found that Azospirillum brasil, a beneficial bacterium, contains a functional ethylene receptor called Azospillum Eth Response 1 (AE1), which directly binds ethylene with high affinity. Treating with ethylene or disrupting the receptor reduces biofilm formation and root colonization. RNA sequencing and metabolomics showed ethylene causes widespread changes in carbon and nitrogen metabolism, resulting in polyhydroxybutyrate accumulation. The data suggest a model where ethylene from plants alters Azir brasil's colonization density and metabolism, indicating the bacterium adapts to ethylene sensing. This provides potential targets to regulate beneficial-micro interactions.
Researchers investigated the role of the IN80 protein, a key component of the IN80 chromatin remodeling complex, in regulating gene silencing on meiotic sex chromosomes in male mice. They found that IN80 localizes to the XY body in pachene spermatocytes, suggesting a role in meiotic sex chromosome silencing. Deletion of IN80 led to increased expression of sex-linked genes and active RNA polymerase II on sex chromosomes, indicating incomplete silencing of sex-linked genes. The study suggests IN80 facilitates recruitment of DNA repair factors for silencing sex genes during pachema. This role is independent of common IN80 target H2A. Instead, IN80 reduces chromatin accessibility at DNA repair sites on sex chromosomes, indicating a role in DNA factor localization for silencing sex genes. IN80 regulates chromatin at DSB regions during zyema-to-pachema transition and sex chromosome accessibility during meiotic progression. Chromatin accessibility is crucial for DNA repair and transcription. IN80 also regulates autosomal gene silencing in spermatocytes by promoting H3me3 modification. However, IN80 silencing sex genes in meiotic spermatocytes is independent of direct transcriptional regulation by DNA factor recruitment. The study demonstrates IN80 unique role in silencing sex genes pach spermatocytes by regulating chromatin at DSB regions. This is independent of histone variant H2. IN80 interacts with DNA repair factors ATR and MDC, facilitating MDC recruitment sex chromosomes during pachema. IN80 also interacts with ATR and M1 meiotic spermatocytes. γ2 X at DSB zema remained IN80KO spermatocytes.
Researchers studied the process of axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of roundworm, and found that a protein called SV-1 plays a crucial role in this process. SV-1 has two functions: it acts like a growth factor to promote axon regeneration and as a protease to regulate development. To understand how SV-1 changes from a protease to growth factor, they focused on a gene called CDD-2, which is a cytidine deaminase. They found that C-2 is necessary for axon regeneration by changing SV-1's function from protease to growth factor. A specific change in the SV-1 protein, from His to Tyr at position 755, and a hairpin structure around this site in SV-1's mRNA, are important for axon regeneration. This suggests C-2 promotes regeneration by modifying SV-1's mRNA to change its function from protease to growth. The researchers also found that C-2 is part of the JNK signaling pathway, which regulates axon regeneration, and is required for axon regeneration after injury.
Researchers used zebraf fish to study the impact of genetic modifications on collective behavior and physical state. They created a model to represent the fish as self-propelling agents with parameters similar to physical systems. By modifying the col11a gene in zraf, which causes osteoarthritis, they observed changes in vertebral properties, swimming, and orientation. Surprisingly, a group of mutant fish exhibited more orderly motion than wildtype. A simple active matter model captured the behavior of both types, with mutant fish modeled as agents with higher orientational noise. This demonstrates the possibility of tuning a biological system by changing its constituents. 

The study used the zraf system to explore bottom-up changes in colloids and proteins. The behavior can be compared to established matter models of fish properties, interactions, and environment. They investigated homozygous deleterious col2 mutation in zraf, showing defects in vertebral, swimming, and reorientation. Modelling as active matter revealed physiological behaviors underpinned by skeleton changes. This approach relates genetic traits to physiological changes within the body.
Researchers have developed a computational model to simulate the formation of capillary networks in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. The model combines mechanical and chemical cues to understand how vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) influences capillary development. The model uses the Cellular Potts model to predict cell migration and morphology, and continuum mechanics to quantify biog deformation and VEG transport. Results show that capillary networks form when mechanical and chemical cues work together, with morphology driven by soluble and bound forms of VEG. Soluble VEG induces morphological changes, while bound VEG on the biog surface provides orientational signals for network formation. Adequate biog deformation, sufficient bound VEG, and VEG gradient are necessary for network development. The model agrees with experimental results in certain conditions, but has limitations, such as omitting bound VEG necessity and not fully reproducing biog experiments. A hybrid model combining mechanical and chemical cues is necessary for capillary development.
Researchers have studied the Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) family, a group of secreted proteins that play key roles in cell, tissue, and organism homeostasis, including wound repair and immunity. In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, there are five TGFβ ligands, allowing for the study of ligand interactions in fewer combinations than in vertebrates. The Tβ ligands can be divided into bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) and Tβ/Activin subfamilies, signaling through discrete pathways. In C elegans, the BMP-like ligand DB-1 has been studied for its role in the immune response. This study shows all five Tβ ligands play a role in survival against bacterial pathogens, and multiple Tβ ligands act redundantly in this response. The BMP-like ligands DB-1 and T-2 function independently, while T-2/B and T/Activ-like T-3 function together. Structural analysis suggests T-2 and T-3 can form heteromers. T- and T- lack a conserved cysteine for disulfide linking dimers. Canonical DB-1/B receptor and Smad transducers function in response to pathogens, while T/Activ components do not play a major role. This demonstrates potential for BMP and T/Activ subfamilies to interact, providing a mechanism for distinguishing developmental and homeostatic functions from acute responses like the immune to pathogens.
Researchers have identified a new player in the cellular process that protects the genome from damage, called the DNA damage response (DDR). This process involves changes to the structure of chromatin, the material that makes up chromosomes, which is orchestrated by enzymes called epigenetic modifiers. One of these modifiers, N-terminal acetylase 4 (Nat), has been found to play a role in the DDR in yeast cells. Without Nat, cells are more sensitive to DNA damage and accumulate more breaks than normal cells. When DNA is damaged, Nat expression is increased and the enzyme is recruited to the site of breaks. Further investigation showed that Nat-deleted cells have lower levels of a specific modification on histone H2 and reduced binding of a protein that controls the response to breaks. This is due to impaired recruitment of another enzyme, Mec1, which is critical for the modification and retention. As a result, activation of the response is reduced. Importantly, the effects of Nat are mediated by its activity on histone H. This study reveals a new link between Nat and the DDR, highlighting a new activity in maintaining genome integrity.
Researchers have developed a new algorithm called Orchard to reconstruct the evolutionary history of cancer cells within a tumor, known as a phylogeny, using DNA mutations from multiple samples. Current methods can only accurately reconstruct phylogenies with up to 30 mutations, but Orchard can handle up to 1000 mutations. It works by approximating the distribution of possible phylogenies and optimizing each step to build a larger tree. Evaluations show Orchard outperforms existing methods in reconstructing phylogen for 90 cancers and 14 types of blood cancer. It also accurately reconstructs large phylogen with up to 1000 mutations. Large phylogen can identify patterns of genetic variations among cancer subpopulations. Cancer studies generate large amounts of sequencing data with hundreds of mutations and samples, making it possible to understand cancer progression. Until now, algorithms could not reliably reconstruct trees with more than 30 mutations. Orchard alleviates the need to pre-cluster mutations and solves problems with up to 100 mutations and samples. Benchmarking against other methods on 14 types of blood cancer and 90 cancers, Orchard matches or beats expert-derived baselines on reconstruction up to 300 mutations and 100 samples. It can recover larger trees on simulated data and reconstruct 100-node trees in 26 hours.
Researchers have developed a new model called Immugen to predict the immunogenicity of CD8+ epitopes, which is crucial for developing personalized cancer treatments. Immunogenicity is the ability of a protein to trigger an immune response, and predicting it is challenging due to limited data and low reactivity rates. Immugen is a modular language model that achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting immunogenicity and can integrate T cell receptor (TCR) information. It consists of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) module, TCR module, and immunogenic prediction head. The MHC module is trained on three MHC prediction tasks, and the TCR module is optional. Immugen outperforms other models in immunogenic prediction with a 7% increase in precision and improved performance with TCR integration. The model's performance is analyzed for interpretability, highlighting weaknesses and biases in existing models and datasets. Immugen is a framework for immunogenic prediction using a protein language model, achieving state-the level performance on CD8 reactivity data.
Researchers conducted a genome-wide association study and gene-based analysis on 230 fast-growing feathered chickens to identify genes related to meat lightness and redness, a primary indicators of meat quality. They found a 6.24 kb QTL (quantitative trait locus) region on chromosome 15 associated with meat color, specifically the protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PPP1) gene. Mendelian randomization analysis confirmed a causal relationship between PPP1 expression and meat lightness. Skeletal muscle-specific PPP knockout mice showed increased lightness and decreased myoglobin in muscles, with a shift from slow-twitch to fast-twitch myofibers. Transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed decreased slow-twitch myofiber and myof-type genes and enhanced glycolysis. A SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) rs520 in PPP intron regulated gene activity. Differences in meat phenotypes, myoglobin, rs520 variant, and fastwitch marker genes were detected between fast-growing and local chickens. PPP1 was identified as the causative gene for color and a novel target for meat improvement.
Researchers have developed a new technique called superresolved tomographic reconstruction (STR) to study the structure of retinal ganglion cells in the retina. These cells receive signals from bipolar cells, which form functional subunits within the ganglion's receptive field. By identifying these subunits, scientists can gain insight into the retina's architecture. The new method combines super-resolution microscopy and computed tomography to efficiently locate subunits. Simulations show it can identify subunits across various variations, and experiments on primate ganglion cells validate its feasibility. STR can reveal sub layouts in a few minutes, making it suitable for real-time investigations.

The technique, STR, uses the center-surround structure of Ricker stripes to sharpen subunit responses and tomographically reconstruct subunits. It combines stimulated emission microscopy and computed tomography principles. The authors tested STR on a realistic ganglion model and electrophysiological recordings from primate retinal ganglion cells. Rapid sub identification leaves time for in-depth studies of retinal circuitry. Knowing sub locations, stimuli can be tailored to characterize spatiotemporal properties, nonlinearities, and synaptic weights of each sub, and evaluate across sub within gang cell field.
Researchers have developed a new method called CRISPR-DR to identify genes that interact with chemicals, such as antibiotics, in bacteria. This method uses CRISPR (CRISPR interference) technology to find genes that are affected by exposure to drugs, which can reveal how the drugs work and how bacteria become resistant. The goal is to find CRPR mutants that are more or less common in the presence of a drug when the target protein is depleted, showing a synergistic effect. Different sgRNAs for a target can cause various protein and growth rate effects. The strength of sgRNA can be predicted by sequence features, but actual growth depends on cell sensitivity to protein depletion. For essential genes, sgRNA efficiency is measured by growth rate. Most efficient sgRNAs are not always best for detecting synergies with drugs. sgRNA interacts non-linearly with drug, producing an effect where concentration is maximized for intermediate sgRNAs and less for those causing too much or little target depletion. To capture this, CRPRDR incorporates sgRNA and drug concentrations in a dose-response equation. CRPRDR analyzed data from a Mycobacterium tuberculosis to identify interacting genes with antibiotics. This approach can be applied to non-CGI datasets, shown with a CRPR dataset for E. coli on different carbon sources. CRPRDR performance is competitive with related methods, but noisier datasets generate more interactions, likely false positives, while CRDR maintains precision in empirical and simulated data.
Researchers have developed a new method to identify communities in gene-expression networks without assuming they are organized in modules, or groups of genes that are more associated with each other than with genes in other groups. This approach, called the weighted corrected stochastic block model (SBM), uses all information in the co-expression network to separate genes into hierarchically organized blocks. Using RNA expression data from Drosophila melanogaster, the SBM found ten times more groups than competing methods, and several of these groups were not modular. The functional enrichment of non-modular groups was as strong as modular communities. This suggests the transcriptome is structured more complex than thought, and modularity may not be the main driver of gene-expression structuring. Non-modular blocks are widespread in gene networks and have strong functional relevance, highlighting the need to incorporate beyond assortativity when exploring networks. Methods like graphical LASSO have been used in this context and may provide better estimates of gene-gene connections. Combining community detection with network inference can inform each other. To address alternative organizations, a measure of similarity was used to find meaningful non-assortative groups with biological interpretation. The SBM has shown promising results in similar applications.
Researchers studied the role of cytoplasmic poly (A)-binding protein 1 (PABP1) in yeast, which is involved in post-transcriptional control, including translation initiation, termination, and mRNA decay. They used mass spectrometry, RNA-Seq, and RiboSeq to analyze the effects of deleting the PP1 gene in yeast cells. The results showed drastic changes in the proteome and transcriptome, and defects in translation initiation and termination. The defects in translation and mRNA stabilization in PP1-deleted cells were partly due to reduced levels of initiation factors, decapping activators, and deadenylation complex components, and the loss of PP's direct role in these processes. Cells without PP also had a nonsense readthrough phenotype, indicating a defect in termination. The study found that PP's loss is pleiotropic and disrupts multiple post-transcription regulation aspects, unlike simpler regulatory proteins.
Researchers have found that slow brain rhythms, such as those seen during sleep or seizures, can be caused by changes in the concentration of potassium outside brain cells. These slow rhythms happen at a lower frequency than the normal firing of brain cells and are thought to be caused by how cells interact with each other and how long it takes for signals to travel between them. A new study suggests an alternative explanation for how this happens in all types of brain cells. It's based on how quickly cells fire and how potassium levels outside the cells change, controlled by an enzyme called Na+/K+-P. The researchers used mathematical analysis to show that this can create a loop where the brain cells can be in two different states. Depending on how strong the NaK+-P is, cells can either fire in bursts or not fire at all. This can be caused by problems with how potassium levels are controlled, such as when brain cells around them don't work properly or there's not enough oxygen. The study shows how the sodium-potassium pump contributes to brain rhythms and can help understand diseases like epilepsy and suggest ways to treat them.
Researchers developed the COPS package to evaluate and compare multi-omics clustering methods for disease subtyping, focusing on stability and prognostic relevance. Current frameworks lack comparison between data-driven and pathway clustering, highlighting a gap in methodology. COPS features advanced methods, including similarity networks, kernel approaches, dimensionality reduction, and pathway integration, some not accessible in R and new approaches. The framework was applied to multiomics data across seven cancer types, including breast, prostate, and lung, using mRNA, CNV, miRNA, and methylation data. Unlike previous studies, COPS contrasts data and knowledge-driven multi-view methods and incorporates cross-validation for robustness. Clustering outcomes were assessed using ARI, survival analysis via Cox models including covariates, and stability of results. Survival and standard metrics vary across methods and datasets, necessitating multi-criteria evaluation from stability to prognostic relevance. The Pareto concept was applied to gauge equilibrium metrics in each case study. Affinity Fusion, Integrative Non-Matrix Factor, and Multiple Kernel-Mans with linear Pathway Kernels were most stable and effective in discerning groups with different outcomes in several studies.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the SoxC transcription factor SEM-2 plays a crucial role in embryonic development and specifying the sex myoblast (SM) fate in the postembry mesoderm lineage. A novel loss-of-function SEM-2 allele with a proline to serine change in the C-terminal of the conserved DNA-binding domain was identified, revealing new functions of SEM-2 in the lineage. SEM-2 antagonizes LET-381, the C. elegans Fox/Forkhead transcription factor, to regulate dorsoventral patterning of the lineage, and is essential for the proliferation and diversification of SM. SEM-2 also directly regulates the expression of hl-8, a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor critical for patterning the lineage. This study adds to the understanding of the conserved relationship between SoxC and Twist proteins and the regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembry development. SEM-2 regulates hl-8 expression, possibly directly in SM, and is essential for the proliferation and diversification of SM. Interactions in the regulatory network underlying C. elegans postembry development were uncovered, some of which are conserved in other species, adding to the understanding of functions and structure of SoxC proteins.
