Researchers have discovered that the Notch signaling pathway plays a crucial role in reprogramming germ cells into somatic cells in Caenorhabditis elegans. This is surprising, as the Notch pathway is known for maintaining undifferentiated germ stem cells. The study found that Notch promotes reprogramming by activating genes silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and identified the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a Notch target facilitating reprogramming. This finding has implications for development and diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.

In C. elegans, the Notch pathway is essential for maintaining a pool of undifferentiated stem cells. However, the researchers found an unexpected role of Notch in promoting cell reprogramming. To understand this, they combined genetics and tissue-specific profiling. They identified genes activated by increased Notch signaling and found an antagonistic relationship between Notch and PR2. The C. elegans PR2 consists of MES-2, -3, and -6, and levels of corresponding transcripts were not altered by Notch signaling.

Analyzing genes with higher baseline germline values, the proportion of Not-activated genes was striking. In C. elegans, genes are largely silenced by PR2. Researchers identified regulated by Notch, including genes maintaining germ stem cells. Additionally, they found genes activated by Not were repressed by the fate-stabilizing chromatin regulator PR2. They show Not and PR have antagonistic effect on cell-fate decisions and co-regulate common, ut-1.
Researchers have found that the adaptor protein SK2 (SK2) plays a crucial role in protecting against Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) infections in the lungs. Mice lacking SK2 (Sk2/-) had a 100-fold higher bacterial burden compared to wild-type mice, indicating that SK2 is essential for controlling the infection. SK2/- neutrophils and monocytes were present in the lungs and neutrophils degranulated normally in response to K. pneumonia infection, but K pneumonia-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was abolished in vitro. K pneumonia-induced neutil ROS required the activity of Src family kinases (SFK), Syk, Btk, PLC2, and PK. The loss of SK2 significantly hindered K pneumonia-induced phosphorylation of FK, Sy, and Py2, suggesting SK2 is proximal to their activation in pathogen signaling pathways. SK2 signaling in neutils is essential for K pneumonia-activated ROS production and promoting bacterial clearance during infection.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how the "hypnoite" stage of the Plasmodium vivax parasite contributes to the spread of the disease. The hypnoite stage is a latent form of the parasite that can reactivate in the liver and cause new infections weeks or months after the initial infection. The model shows that the hypite reservoir is widespread, with many people having few or no hypites and some having heavily infected livers. Individuals with more hypites are more likely to experience relapse and contribute to the spread of the disease. The model predicts that incorporating hypite-killing drugs, such as primaquine, into treatment can reduce transmission by targeting those with the most hypites. Relapses from hypites in the liver are a significant part of malaria transmission dynamics, in addition to reservoirs in blood and mosquitoes. Without effective diagnostics for liver-stage parasites, models are crucial for predicting effectiveness of interventions targeting hypites. Most malaria models do not account for liver reservoir, but some P viv models include hypite as a state to denote infection. A within-host model of hypites in hepatocytes was developed to explain epidemiological patterns of relapse, assuming constant activation and death rate. This model was integrated into Ross-Mac models to account for P viv relapses.
Amazonian forests are disturbed by selective logging, releasing over 90 grams of carbon (C) into the atmosphere each year. However, this carbon is balanced by the forest's regrowth. Researchers used a network of 133 forest plots across Amazonia to study regional differences in climate, soil, and initial biomass to predict post-logging carbon recovery. They found that above-ground carbon recovery over 10 years is higher in the Guiana Shield and west (21 Mg/ha) than in the south (12 Mg/ha) where environmental stress is high (low rainfall, high seasonality). The study highlights the role of survivors in forest regrowth and creates a comprehensive map of post-disturbance recovery in Amazonia.

The researchers analyzed data from 13 long-term (8-30 year) experimental sites in Amazon and Guiana, focusing on selective logging, a common human disturbance in tropical forests. They found that post-disturbance carbon gain comes from growth and recruitment of trees (20cm DBH) and loss from mortality of survivors and recruited trees. The main drivers of recovery in forests by selective logging across Amazon are identified. The study up-scales results to Amazonia using maps of climate, conditions, soil, and bulk density, predicting potential changes over 10 years under 40% loss, a common intensity after logging.

Selective logging causes 2.1 Pg/yr of carbon loss in tropical forests, with ongoing climate change focusing on human impacts on carbon cycles, particularly 2.1 Pg/yr loss from various disturbances.
Researchers have identified two distinct types of stem cells in the adult mouse brain's lateral ventricle-subventricular zone (SVZ): neuro-initiating cells (NICs) and neural stem cells (NSCs). They used flow cytometry to isolate NICs as GlastEGhighPlexBhighCD24/lowO/PS-AM/Ter/CD- cells, which are highly mitotic and short-lived in vivo. In contrast, pre-NSCs are quiescent, express higher Glast, and lower EGFR and PlexB. Pre-NS cannot form neurospheres but express stem markers Slc1-CERT, GF-CERT, Sox2ERT, and GliERT and are long-lived in vivo. GEOTs are ablated by temozomide, while pre-NS survive and repopulate the SV. Conditional deletion of Bmi-1 polyprotein depletes pre- and GEOT cells, with pre-NS more dependent on B-1 for Cnka(p16ink4) repression. The study distinguishes quies NS from NICs and allows studying their properties in vivo.
Researchers have studied the function of Piezo1, a mechanically activated ion channel that senses forces in various cell types and tissues. Using cryo-electron microscopy, they found that Pie1 has a bowl-shaped structure that can induce membrane curvature, suggesting that Pie1 channels may influence each other's distribution and function. The study used cell-attached patch-clamp electrophysiology and pressure-clamp to examine membrane patches from cells expressing Pie1 at low levels and overexpressing Pie1 at high levels. Data, along with simulations of Pie1 distributions, showed that at endogenous (1-2 channels/μm2) and non-physiological (10-100/μm) densities caused substantial overlap. Pie1 density had no effect on pressure sensitivity or open probability in the absence of membrane tension. The results suggest Pie channels, at physiologically relevant, behave as independent mechanotrans. This property enables cells to transduce forces homogeneously across the entire membrane.

The study found that Pie1 channels, at physiologically relevant, function as independent mechanotrans. This allows cells to transduce forces with spatial homogeneity across the entire membrane. This is important as Pie channels have no intrinsic tendency to spatially and functionally modulate each other's mechanical sensitivity, ideal for cells to transduce forces homogeneously.

Cells are exposed to mechanical forces and have evolved mechanisms to detect them. Rapid force sensing occurs in milliseconds through force-gated channels converting mechanical into electrochemical signals. Pie1 is a mechanically gated cation channel sensing membrane tension with high sensitivity. The study aimed to quantify Pie spatial and functional interactions across channel orders of densities. Electrophys and large measurements quantified channel number, function, single current, probability, and sensitivity.

The study characterized Pie's ability to spatially localize and modulate each function. Cell-attached-clamp electrophys was used, with limitations. Spatial resolution is limited by pipette size.
Researchers investigated how the effect of volatility, or variability, in the evidence used to make decisions on decision speed, accuracy, and confidence in perception. They introduced a novel manipulation that mimics the addition of noise to specific areas of the visual cortex in the brain and verified it with recordings from macaque monkeys. The results showed that increasing volatility led to faster decisions and higher confidence, but minimal impact on accuracy. This was in line with predictions of a model that explains decision-making as accumulation of evidence to a threshold. The study used a well-studied motion task and recorded from neurons in the visual cortex of macaques to test the effect of the manipulation and showed that a framework based on evidence accumulation can account for the joint effect of volatility on decision speed and confidence. 

The researchers tested the influence of volatility on decision-making by changing the statistical properties of a stimulus to mimic the addition of noise. They verified the manipulation by recording from direction-selective neurons in the middle and superior temporal areas of the macaque cortex, which are known to represent momentary evidence in similar tasks. The study used a reaction-time version of the random-dot discrimination task to examine the relationship between volatility and decision speed. Three humans completed 663 trials and one macaque 1,137. Each trial started with fixating a central spot for 0.5s, then two targets appeared and disappeared after 0.5s. The researchers used the manipulation to test the influence on three observables of behavior - accuracy, reaction time, and confidence - in monkeys and humans.
Researchers studied how the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of worm, is regulated by the protein DAF-16, a transcription factor similar to mammalian FOXO. They found that two proteins, UNC-43 and TAX-6B-1, regulate DAF-16 by adding or removing a phosphate group to it. UNC-43 activates D-16, allowing it to enter the nucleus, while TAX-6-1 removes the phosphate, inactivating it. This process is opposite to insulin signaling, which inactivates D-16 by adding a phosphate. Insulin signaling dominates when UNC-43 and TAX-6-1 have opposing effects on D-16. The researchers also found that UNC-43 and TAX-6-1 regulate lifespan through D-16 in response to stress, such as starvation or heat, and work together with insulin signaling to regulate lifespan. Mammalian FOX3, similar to D-16, is also regulated by CAMII and calcineurin, similar to UNC-43 and TAX-6-1.
Researchers studied how fruit flies groom their bodies using a series of movements, known as motor programs. They found that these programs are organized in a hierarchy, with earlier movements suppressing later ones, allowing the sequence to progress. By activating specific neural subsets, they controlled individual cleaning programs and showed that they are organized in a suppression order. This means that cleaning one part of the body reduces the drive for the next, allowing the sequence to move down the hierarchy. A model of independently evoked movements, activated in parallel but selected serially through suppression, replicated the grooming sequence. This is the first example of an innate sequence implemented by a model for generating human actions.

 The study found that dust on the body elicits different cleaning programs for five parts that progress in series. By targeting neural subsets, they gained control over each program and demonstrated they are organized in a hierarchy. A computational model derived from experiments shows how suppression mediates the selection of cleaning programs. The ability to select among behaviors through hierarchical suppression may have provided the infrastructure for actions in sequence. Activation and parallel models describe mechanisms for generating behavior, but also enable experiments to probe organization through control of individual actions.

 The researchers studied the principles of neural control in an innate behavior common to many animals, grooming. Different motor programs have mechanisms for selecting the most favorable and suppressing others. A significant finding is that hierarchical among behaviors leads to emergence of a sequence. They anticipate identifying circuit for each module and how they interact will reveal the organization of behavior in the system through suppression.
Researchers have identified a protein called Shugoshin 2 (Sol) that plays a crucial role in ensuring accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis I in mammalian oocytes. Meiosis is a complex process where cells divide to produce reproductive cells, and accurate segregation of chromosomes is essential. Sol works with cohesin, a protein that holds sister chromatids together, and turns off the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a mechanism that prevents errors. Sol also promotes congression and bi-orientation of bivalents on meiosis spind, formation of kinetochore-microtubules (K-fib), and limits bivalent stretching. Its ability to protect cohes depends on interaction with PP2, while silencing SAC is mediated by binding to Mad2. Sol's effect on bivalent and Kiber formation is independent of PP2 and mediated by recruitment of MCA and inhibition of Aurora kinase activity.

 Sol helps turn off SAC by binding PP2 and Mad2, moderates chromosome stretching by recruiting kinesinase MCA, and promotes Kiber formation by downregulating Aurora/B activity at kineto. Meiotic segregation is dependent on multiple biochemical processes. Depletion of Sol in oocytes has pleotropic consequences, including inefficient SAC silencing, increased bivalent stretching, and alterations in kinetochore-microtule attachments. Sol silences SAC by binding Mad using a motif common to Mad's partners Cdc20 and Mad1. Bi-orientation of bival on meiosis spind, increased bivalent, and Aurora/C activity at kineto, accompanied by increase in lateral and decrease in kinetochore-microub attachments. Sol deficiency delayed APC/CC20 activation, required to shut SAC.

A single protein regulates chromatid cohesion, chromosome, spindle checkpoint, and Aurora/Cases. Different mutations alter regulation but not processes, proving pleiotropy in SolΔ oocytes not due to secondary effects. Sol defective PP2 binding fails to protect centrom cohes, found in yeast. Sol deficiency causes changes chromosome and microtule dynamics.
Research has shown that changes in brain connections between neurons, or synapses, can be influenced by the creation of new proteins through a process called local translation, which occurs at the site of the synapse. This process is crucial for learning and memory, as it allows the synapse to adapt and change in response to experience. A new study investigated whether local translation is accompanied by the transport of RNA, or genetic material, from the cell's nucleus to the synapse. Using imaging techniques, researchers found that RNA was present throughout the neuron's arbor, but translation occurred only at sites of synaptic contact and stimulation. They discovered that a signaling pathway, involving netrin-1 and its receptor DCC, was responsible for local translation at synapses.

The study also found that RNA, along with proteins and factors necessary for translation, were delivered to both synaptic and non-synaptic sites, but translation was enriched at sites of contact and stimulation. This suggests that regulation of gene expression in neurons is primarily at the level of translation, rather than delivery of RNA from the nucleus. In contrast, all measures of translation showed enrichment at synapses and stimulated synapses. The findings indicate that release of netrin from the neuron or during synapse formation and plasticity triggers translation at synaptic but not non-synaptic sites. Researchers tested this by incubating neurons with recombinant netrin-1 and found it regulated synthesis of localized transcripts.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how cells interact and organize into complex patterns in multicellular structures using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC). Current methods to model these events lack control over cell type emergence and cannot selectively perturb specific subpopulations. The study used CRISPR interference to knockdown molecular regulators of cell adhesion (CDH1) and cortical tension (ROCK1) in iSC colonies. Knockdown of ROCK or CDH resulted in patterning within iSC due to self-organization, retaining epithelial pluripotency. Knockdown stimulated a wave of differential gene expression within populations stabilized with self-organization. Mosaic patterning enables interrogation of emergent multicellular properties, facilitating understanding of symmetry-breaking pathways during morphogenesis.

The study employed inducible CRPR system in iSC to silence proteins regulating adhesion and tension. Genetically controlled symmetry events within i populations by creating mixed iSC with and without CRPR, then induced knockdown (KD). Knockdown of ROCK or CDH parallels pattering via adhesion (Figure 1). This explored mechanical manipulation of iSC subpopulations results in controllable self-organization into repeat patterns. However, methods cannot selectively discriminate cells or address emergence of heterotyp interactions multic. Silencing target genes CRPR within subpopulations provides avenues to control emergence of asymmetric phenotypes and multicellular patterns. Mosaic KD interrogated creation of physical asymmetries in homogeneous populations leads multic organization and pattern formation. Induction of KD ROCK or CD1 results in cell-driven formation iSC while preserving pluripency.

This study identifies strategy to direct heteric populations control multic organization plurotent cells, creating robust models morphogenesis for mechanistic study human patterning formation.
Researchers have proposed a new theory to explain why the accuracy of human visual working memory decreases as the number of items to be remembered increases. They suggest that the brain aims to minimize a combination of two costs: the cost of making mistakes and the cost of processing information. A model based on this theory predicts the decrease in accuracy as the number of items increases, which aligns with previous findings. The model also accounts for how accuracy is affected by the likelihood of being asked to recall a specific item, as well as the number of items, in experiments where participants are asked to recall items after a delay. Furthermore, the theory suggests that the amount of effort invested in remembering items does not always increase with the number of items. In some cases, it's optimal to remember only some or none of the items in a task. This raises the possibility that limitations in memory arise from trying to balance costs rather than physical constraints. 

The theory may apply to other areas of cognition, such as attention, where it's been suggested that focus arises from balancing performance against the cost of processing. It provides a framework to test this idea and explain size effects in attention tasks. The model was tested on data from experiments where participants were asked to recall items after a delay and found it accounts for effects of both number and likelihood of being asked, with few parameters. It also explains a non-linear relationship between number of items and effort invested in remembering. At the neural level, this suggests a non-linear relationship between brain activity and number of items. This prediction can be tested with neuroimaging experiments. The study focused on effects of number and likelihood on accuracy, but the theory also makes predictions about effects of incentives on accuracy, as they affect the cost function.
Researchers have discovered that a protein from the Irish potato pathogen Phytophthora infestans, called Pex54, interferes with the plant's autophagy process to help the pathogen infect the plant. Autophagy is a natural defense mechanism used by plants to get rid of damaged or infected cells. P54 binds to a protein called AT8 and stimulates the formation of autagosomes, which are packages of cellular waste. P54 also removes another protein called J2 from AT8 complexes, which helps the plant defend against the pathogen. This means the pathogen has evolved a way to counteract the plant's defense by interfering with autagy.

 Studies have shown that pathogen effectors, like P54, can bind to host proteins to alter various processes, including autagy. Unlike other effectors, P54 activates autagy to eliminate defense-related compounds and recycle cellular resources. Researchers found that P54 binds to AT8 and stimulates autosome formation, and depletes J2 from AT8 complexes to counter host defenses. The study shows pathogens can activate autagy for their benefit, not just disrupt it.

The mechanism of defense-related autagy and its selectivity is poorly understood, and how pathogens manipulate autagy for nutrient uptake is unknown. This study investigated how a pathogen interferes with and co-opts plant autagy pathway. Future studies will consider pathogen modulation of autagy spatio-temporal dynamics and cellular trafficking during infection. Other pathogens may also secrete effectors with AT8 motif or target autagy differently, serving as tools to dissect mechanisms of defense-related autagy.
Researchers have developed a laboratory model to study how human cardiac fibroblasts, a type of cell involved in tissue repair and inflammation, respond to changes in their environment. They used a device that applies both mechanical strain and oxygen changes to mimic conditions seen in heart disease, such as ischemia. The study found that different combinations of these stimuli trigger various responses in cardiac fibroblasts, including proliferation, inflammation, and collagen production. Notably, a combination of low oxygen and reduced contractility led to increased release of inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases. This model recreates a pathological environment to understand cardiac fibroblast responses during injury, providing insights into adaptive mechanisms. Cardiac fibroblasts have been studied under individual stimuli such as mechanical stress, oxygen deprivation, and pro-fibrotic cytokines, but not together. This study controlled mechanical and oxygen regimes to model early changes in cardiac injury, revealing individual and synergistic contributions of signals in activation of fibroblast responses relevant to fibrotic disease. After heart injury, oxygen levels drop to 5-6% and proliferation and phenotypic switch to fibroblast occur. To understand how stimuli modulate proliferation, researchers examined mitotic cells under mechanical and oxygen changes. The combination of hypoxia and reduced contractility elicited inflammatory and fibrot responses, while individual stimuli regulated proliferative and collagen. This has implications for myocardial remodeling and the model provides a tool for understanding pathological mechanisms and reparative strategies.
Researchers have identified two isoforms of the DOM nucleosome remodeling complex, DOM-A and DOM-B, in Drosophila, which are necessary for transcriptional regulation through different mechanisms. DOM-B incorporates H2.V, the fly ortholog of H2.Z, genome-wide in an ATP-dependent manner like the yeast SWR complex, while DOM-A functions as an ATP-independent histone acetylase complex similar to yeast Nu4, targeting lysine 12 of histone H4. This work shows how different evolutionary strategies can lead to similar functional separation, as seen in yeast and humans where nucleosome and histone acetylase complexes originate from gene duplication and paralog specification. Dophila generates diversity by alternative splicing of a single gene. The DOM complex illustrates how evolution can take different routes to achieve functional specification. In yeast, SW1 and Nu4 are separate entities, while in humans, genomes underwent duplication, paralog SRC and EP protein organize different complexes that serve distinct conserved functions. The two DOM isoforms were explored on transcription by RNAseq, including knockdowns of H2.V and T60. Knockdown of either DOM, DOM, T60, or H2 showed similar effects on transcription. DOM-A has similar domains but separated by ATPase domain, raising if it might serve as central subunit of Nu4 complex in Doph. Data suggest ATP activity of-A is dispensable for H12 acylation by-A, a principle conserved across metazoa.
Researchers investigated the role of beta-catenin (Ctnb1) in muscle cells in the formation of neuromuscular junctions, the connection between motor neurons and muscle cells. They found that tn1 is crucial for motor neuron differentiation, but little is known about the signal sent back to the neuron. The study used a genetic approach to identify which functions of tn1 are important. They found that tn without the ability to activate genes was unable to rescue neuromus junction problems caused by tn mutation, indicating that controlling gene expression is important. On the other hand, the ability to stick to other cells is not necessary. They looked for proteins that tn sends a signal to neurons and found Slit, which repels or collapses axons. Overexpressing Sl in muscle improved neuus junctions in tn mutation mice and Sl on beads induced synapse formation in spinal cord explants. This suggests Sl is a signal from tn in muscle to neurons for neuus formation.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how forces are transmitted between cells in clusters of epithelial cells, which are a type of cell that make up many tissues in the body. They found that forces between cells are not constant, but change over time and depend on the position of the cell within the cluster. The forces are also affected by how cells attach to each other and to the surrounding tissue. The study used a technique to measure forces at the level of individual cell-cell junctions and found that the protein E-cadher, which is important for cell-cell adhesion, is affected by the forces. They also found that forces can be transmitted through the cell by changing how it attaches to the surrounding tissue and through actin, a protein that helps cells move. The study shows how forces are controlled in epithelial tissues and provides a new tool to study how forces are transmitted between cells. 

The researchers used a new method to measure forces between cells in clusters of epithelial cells, which are a type of cell that make up many tissues in the body.

The forces are affected by how cells attach to each other and the surrounding tissue. They used a technique to measure forces at the level of cell-cell junctions and found the protein Ead, important for cell adhesion, is affected by forces. They found forces can be transmitted through cell by changing how it attaches to surrounding and actin, protein that helps cells move.
Researchers have investigated the structure and function of the huntingtin protein, which is affected by a polyglutamine expansion that causes Huntington's disease. They used various biophysical experiments, including circular dichroism, single-particle microscopy, and mass spectrometry to study the protein. The results show that huntingtin is composed of five distinct domains and has a spherical α-helical soloid structure with the amino and carbox-terminal regions forming a central cavity. The polyglut expansion increases the α-hical properties of hunting and affects intramolecular interactions among domains. The study provides a solution to the puzzle of how the amino-terminal polyut tract confers a property on hunting causing the disease. 

The researchers used biophysical and biochemical analyses of purified recombinant huntingins with varied polyut tracts to understand the impact of the polyut on hunting's basic features. They found that hunting may undergo conformation change upon interaction with partners. Single-particle microscopy of recominant huntingins with polyut lengths of 23-78 residues showed that hunting's shape may enable structural impact of the amino polyut tract. The study provides a solution to the mystery of how the polyut may modulate hunting structure and function.
Ferritinophagy, the process by which cells break down and recycle ferritin, a protein that stores iron, is crucial for regulating intracellular iron levels. However, how ferritinagy is controlled and the role of NCO4, a protein involved in this process, was not well understood. Researchers studied the interaction between N4 and ferritin and found that a specific interaction between N4 and ferritin is necessary for ferritin to be delivered to lysosomes, where it is broken down. N4 levels are controlled by two systems, autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteome. When iron is high, N4 is broken down by the ubiquitin-proteome, reducing N levels and allowing ferritin to store more iron. When iron is low, N levels increase, promoting ferragy. In zebraf and cultured cells, N plays a role in red blood cell formation. The study reveals how N and ferritin interact and how iron affects N-mediated ferragy in cells.
Researchers have long understood that the lateral prefrontal cortex (LP) plays a crucial role in higher-level cognition, but the organization of this brain region has remained unclear. A theory suggests that the LP is organized hierarchically, with progressively rostral areas processing more abstract information for efficient and flexible cognition. However, evidence for this theory has been limited. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, researchers found gradients of abstraction in the LP from rostral to caudal. Dynamic modeling revealed asymmetrical interactions between LP regions indicative of hierarchical processing. Contrary to assumptions, the strength of efferent versus afferent connections positioned the middle LP as the apex of the hierarchy. Furthermore, cognitive demands modulated connectivity towards LP consistent with a role in integrating information for control. The strengths of these dynamics were related to higher-level cognitive ability. These results suggest the LP is hierarchically organized with the middle LP synthesizing abstract and concrete to control behavior.

The study confirmed the rostral-caud axis of LP operates according to abstraction principles by examining gradients of stimulus specificity and control. Interactions among LP sub-regions examined how cognitive demands elicit asymmetrical influences of hierarchical processing. The orientation of the middle LP in connectivity and top-down influences from rostral to LP during control were related to higher-level ability. The organization of LP is tied to cognitive capacity. Debate exists whether processing in LP is hierarchical. Data suggest top control within LP determines higher function. Stronger hierarchical projections from LP to other regions were related to higher ability, suggesting a beneficial effect of organization with LP at the apex.

Interactions within LP were examined by varying demands on domain and control. Collectively, demands engaged LP for a comprehensive account of function. Progressively rostral areas processed abstract levels of control with Feature, Contextual, and Temporal eliciting rostral activations. Dynamic modeling revealed asymmetries strongest in LP. Demands elicited top-down from rostral to LP and bottom-up from caud LP. Analyses connectivity and modulations suggest LP forms where information converges influence.
Researchers have identified a gene called TBCD1, which is specific to humans and their closest relatives, that plays a crucial role in the development of the brain's outer layer. This layer, called the cortex, which is linked to intelligence and brain expansion. They found that expressing this gene in mice led to the creation of a type of cell called outer radial glia, which is abundant in humans and great apes. This cell type of cell has a high proliferative ability, meaning it can divide and multiply. When this gene was down-regulated, or turned off, in human brain slices, it reduced the creation of these cells. When TBC1 was expressed in specific areas of the brain, it led to the formation of folds in the cortex, which is a characteristic of the human brain. 

The study suggests that this gene, which appeared early in human evolution, controls other genes involved in brain expansion and folding. Another gene, ARHG11, was previously found to promote basal cells and folding in the brain, but T1 appeared before it in evolution. This study provides evidence that brain development can be regulated by genes duplicated during human evolution. The researchers found that expressing T1 in mice led to the formation of folds in the cortex, which became more pronounced over time. They also found that T1 reduced the expression of a signaling pathway in stem cells, which is required for cell division.
Researchers have investigated the role of ubiquitination in the activity of the plant immune activator NPR1, a protein that plays a crucial role in activating systemic acquired resistance in plants. They found that ubiquitination of NPR1 is a progressive process, with initial modification by a Cullin-RING E3 ligase (CRL) promoting its association with chromatin and expression of target genes. However, further ubiquitination by the E4 ligase UBE leads to its degradation by the proteasome. Conversely, ubiquitin ligase activities by UBP/7, proteasome-associated deubitinases, enhance NPR1 longevity. The study shows that initial ubiquination by CRL is required for NPR to attain full transcriptional activity, while stepwise formation of ubiquitin chains by UBE inactivates NPR and promotes its degradation. The findings indicate that ubiquination boosts NPR transcriptional coactivator activity by enhancing promoter occupancy and potentially genomic mobility of NPR.
Researchers have identified the precursors of 24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24 siRNAs) that guide DNA methylation and silencing of transposons and a subset of genes in Arabidopsis thalian. These precursors, called Pol IV and R2-dependent RNAs (P2 RNAs), are generated by RNA polymerase IV (Pol) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2 (R2) and are diced into 24 siRNAs by the enzyme Dicer-like 3 (D3) in vitro. P2 RNAs are mostly 26-45 nucleotides long and initiate with a purine adjacent to pyrimidine, characteristics shared by Pol transcripts generated in vitro. R2 terminal transferase activity, demonstrated in vitro, may account for occasional non-templated nucleotides at P2 RNA 3 termini. The 24 siRNAs primarily correspond to the 5 or 3 ends of P2 RNAs, suggesting a model whereby siRN are generated from end of P2 duplexes by single dicing events. 

In Arabidopsis, Pol and R2 are essential for the biogenesis of 24 siRNAs and physically associate. Dozens of P2 RNAs can overlap a given locus, but individual P RN represent individual Pol-R2 transcription units. Data indicate short-stranded P RN that accumulate in mutants are immediate precursors siRN, based on ability to cut prec into 24 RN vitro. Results consistent with those of Nagano et al. P RN are dependent on both Pol and R2, as shown by views of 24 si loci that abundant P RN accumulate mutants also in wild-type plants but not mutants. 23 and 24 siRNA reduced ribonuclease1, yet unaffected ribonuc, suggesting much si pool exists double-stranded. P RN that accumulate mutants substrates D3, incubated with FLAG-tagged D3 affinity-purified transgenic anti-resin.
Researchers investigated the development of neural networks in the brain from birth to early childhood to understand how they mature and become capable of complex computations. They used high-resolution measurements of brain activity in mice and found that mature networks emerge after a brief period of quietness at the beginning of the second week after birth. This quiet period is characterized by a decrease in activity, followed by precise and organized activity. A similar pattern was observed in humans, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism. The researchers hypothesize that this quiet period is necessary for the emergence of coordinated networks.

The study found that the transition from immature to mature networks was marked by a decrease in activity at the start of the second week, after which was followed by precise synchronization and oscillation in space and time. Multiple functions develop rapidly during early development, with networks enabling precise coordination of activity in brain functions. However, how networks develop into their mature form for complex computations is poorly understood.

The maturation of networks is preceded by a discrete, evolutionarily conserved period during early development. During this period, oscillations and spiking display a shift from local, loosely correlated, sensory patterns to organized, spatially distributed and temporally activity. The emergence of advanced network properties may be heralded by disappearance of immature patterns. Cortical circuits undergo changes in anatomical and functional connectivity, initiated through increase in synapses in superficial layers. Neural spiking is recruited to oscillatory with strong phase-locking and higher precision, characteristic of adult networks in information processing.
Researchers have developed a new model to understand how the Plasmodium falcum parasite, which causes malaria, evolves and adapts to evade the human immune system. The parasite has multiple copies of a gene called var, which creates different versions of a protein on its surface, allowing it to hide from the immune system. The model shows that even when the parasite recombines with other strains, a subset of dominant versions of var genes remain, with some overlap in how they look to the immune system. This is due to competition among versions of var for space in the host, mediated by the immune system. 

The parasite's complexity makes it hard to control malaria, but also provides a chance to test existing theories. The new model considers how immune selection affects populations with multi-copy genes that recombine. It tracks all possible versions of var in a pool of genetic variants and explores if competition among versions for space in host, mediated by immune, leads to structured populations. 

Studies have shown that immune can lead to discrete, non-overlapping versions even with multiple genes recombine. The "strain" model suggests reducing transmission won't drastically reduce gene diversity because a reservoir of diverse genomes with non-overlapping versions remain. The new model extends theory to immune acting on multi-copy genes, using the var gene of P. falcum as basis. Var encodes P. falc erythrocyte membrane 1, the parasite's surface protein that binds to host cells to sequester in tissues.
A bacterial effector protein from Shigella flexner, called OI, deaminates a glutamine residue in the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC, converting it to glutamate (Q100). This modification disrupts the interaction between UBC and the RING ubiquitin ligase TRAF6, silencing the NF-κ inflammatory response. The study reveals that deamination inhibits the interaction between UBC and TR6 by three mechanisms: creating an intramolecular saltbridge in U13 that competes with a critical intermolecular bridge at the native interface, perturbing transient interactions necessary for complex formation, and repulsion between the negatively charged E100 and negatively charged surface of TR6 reducing transient interactions. This highlights a mechanism where post-translational modification perturbs conformation and stability to inhibit protein-protein association.
Researchers investigated the effects of activating and inactivating two types of cortical interneurons, somatostatin-positive (S+) and parvalbum-positive (Pb), in the auditory cortex of awake mice. They used optogenetic manipulations to activate or inactivate these neurons while recording responses to tones and found that inactivating S+ interneurons increased response gain, while inactivating Pb interneurons weakened tuning and decreased information transfer. However, activating S+ and Pb interneurons showed no differences. This challenges the assumption that activation and inactivation would produce consistent insights into interneurons' computational roles. A simple network model showed that small changes in parameters, such as spontaneous activity or light strength, determined whether activation or inactivation would produce consistent or paradoxical conclusions about interne functions. 

The study found that inactivating S+ interneurons increased response, while inactivating Pb interneurons weakened and decreased information, implying these neurons support separate functions in the cortex. However, activating S and Pb interneurons showed no differences. The researchers tested this assumption by manipulating two main interneuron families, S+ and Pb, while recording responses to tones in the auditory cortex of mice. To evaluate interne suppression of auditory responses, they applied a framework to 59 units from Ch2/S and 57 from Ch/Pb mice whose responses were tuned and suppressed by interne activation. Units suppressed by more than 80% were excluded to avoid floor effects, including narrow-spiking and broad-spiking units. Stimulus preferences of interne themselves are important for output. For example, in cortex, Pb cells are rapidly activated by broad tones, while S interne respond slowly to narrower tones. In optogen manipulating interne, comparing FTC in light-on versus light conditions would reveal change in neuron fit model, and transformation multiplicative, additive, or combination.
Researchers used transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to externally modulate oscillatory activity in the right frontopari network, which supports working memory (WM). They found that externally induced synchronization improved performance when cognitive demands were high. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data revealed that ACS effects depended on the relative phase of stimulation and internal processing. Specifically, synchronous ACS during WM increased parietal activity, which correlated with performance. Functional connectivity results showed that the phase of frontopetal stimulation influenced information flow within WM. The study demonstrates a link between performance in a demanding WM task and large-scale brain synchronization.

The researchers aimed to provide evidence for the role of oscillatory synchronization in WM and investigate underlying mechanisms of frontopetal phase influence on WM. They conducted two experiments using tACS to entrain endogenous rhythms. Findings indicate a direct link between performance in WM and large brain synchronization across a frontop network activated by the task. Manipulations ofACS modulated underlying activity and influenced long-range connectivity in phase and state-dependent manner.

The study tested four hypotheses: 1) WM performance is enhanced by entraining activity in a frontop network activated by demands; 2 regional activity is modulated in phase-dependent; 3 changes BOLD by phase-dependent stimulation correlate with performance; 4 connectivity across regions modulated phase-dependent. Front interactions increased with synchronous stimulation, whereas posterior with desynchronous, suggesting information flow can be differentially affected by phase. The study demonstrates the role of phase in WM processes and neural correlates.

Results showed synchronous stimulation improved performance and increased frontop activity when demands were high. These show external manipulations can shape activity and connectivity, and are detectable using fMRI.
Researchers have long known that the polarity of an embryo in in invertebrates and amphibians and fish is determined by maternal factors present in the egg, which dictate the fate of cells early in development. However, in amni vertebrates, such as mammals, embryos remain plastic and can form multiple individuals until gastrulation. The question is, how polarity is determined in these embryos? In chick embryos, the earliest known factor is cV1, a homolog to mammalian growth factor 1, expressed posteriorly before gastrulation. A molecular screen to find upstream regulators of c1 in normal and manipulated embryos to form twins uncovered the transcription factor Pit2 as a candidate. The study shows Pit2 is essential for axis formation and acts as a direct regulator of c1 by binding to enhancers within neighboring genes. Pit2, V1, and Nodal are also key in left-right asymmetry, suggesting the same polarity mechanism has been co-opted to different functions during evolution.

A molecular screen was designed to find new genes involved in earliest stages of specifying embryo polarity. Bioinformatics and embryological experiments identified transcription factor Pit2 as a direct and essential regulator of c1 during normal development and induced twinning. In invertebrates and amni vertebrates, embryonic polarity is established by localization of maternal determinants in cytoplasm or cortex of fertilized egg. This generates differences between blastomeres that form by division from egg, specifying orientation of embryonic axes. Higher vertebrates retain regulative development until late, suggesting localization of maternal determinants not essential for specifying polarity.

The study implicates Pit2 as earliest gene to regulate embryonic axis and twinning. Results implicate Pit2 as upstream of c1: it is transcription factor, expressed same as c in embryos and bisected marginal zone, before c. Time-course expression of Pit2 in whole and isolated halves compared to c.
Researchers studied how fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) use their sense of smell to navigate their environment. They exposed flies to different concentrations of odors that changed over time and recorded the activity of sensory neurons (OS) and projection neurons (PN) in their antennal lobes. They found that PNs signaled the rate of change in odor concentration, not just the concentration itself. A simple model showed that PNs' activity depends on the rate of change of OS input, not just its rate. This allows flies to detect and respond to odors before they move away from them. The study suggests that PNs in the antennal lobe signal the acceleration of odor concentrations to the brain, enabling early detection of odor onsets. 

PNs relay olfactory information to higher brain centers like the mushroom body and lateral horn. Previous studies showed OS encode not only concentration but also rate of change of odor over time. This study built on that to see how PNs contribute to internal representations of dynamic environments. They tested first and second-order neurons with varying odor concentrations and created a 2D model for processing olfactory information. The model's shape and low error support that PNs depend on rate of change of OS input. It's crucial for flies to detect odors before drifting away. The study shows Dophila's olfactory system signals acceleration to brain, allowing early detection of onsets. 

Several studies investigated dynamic stimuli in early olfactory systems, observing temporal processing (Bawat et al, 2007; Geffen et al,2009; Kim et al,201; Nag and Wilson,201; Martelli,2013). This study hypothesizes acceleration in antennal lobe allows higher centers to respond to onsets of rising stimuli.
In flowering plants, seed development begins with the fusion of the egg and sperm cells, resulting in the formation of the embryo and endosperm, respectively. The fertilized products are surrounded by the maternal seed coat, whose development is regulated by Polycomb Group (Pc) proteins before fertilization. Research shows that fertilization triggers auxin production in the endosperm, which is likely exported to the maternal tissues, driving seed coat development by removing Pc function. A study of the MADS transcription factor AGL62 reveals impaired auxin transport from endperm to integuments, leading to seed abortion. It is proposed that AGL regulates auxin transport from endperm to integuments, removing Pc block on seed development.

 Data suggests auxin production in developing endperm triggers seed development. To test this hypothesis, plants with MADS transcription factor A62 were investigated. A62 seeds abort after fertilization around 3-4 days after pollination, correlating with endperm cellularization and failure to develop a coat. A dual role for post-fertilization auxin is proposed, driving endperm and seed development. A62 has defects in coat development in fertilized ovules and endperm in autonomous seeds, suggesting A62 and aux mediate both endperm and seed pathways.

Multiple evidence supports this hypothesis: aux accumulates in integuments after fertilization, impaired biosynthesis but not signaling in endperm causes coat defects, ovules producing aux ectopically in central initiate coat without fertilization, and failure in A62 correlates with coat development. Seed initiation is generated in fertilized central/endperm. Coat development requires aux production in fertilized endperm and likely transport to ovules in A62-dependent manner. Fertilization results in aux production exported to integ, lifting P2 block on development, allowing elongation and differentiation. This is dependent on A62 activity, as A62 seeds fail to export aux from endperm, leading to accumulation and coat failure.
Researchers have mapped the functional landscape of the receptor domain of a bacteriophage T7, a virus that infects bacteria, to understand how it interacts with its host. The bacteriophage's receptor protein (RBP) plays a crucial role in determining the phage's activity and host range, but the molecular rules governing its function were unclear. To address this, the researchers developed a high-throughput method, locus-specific phage engineering technique called ORACLE (Optimized Recombination, Accumulation, and Library) to create a large library of phage variants at a targeted gene. They comprehensively mutated the tip domain by making single amino acid substitutions at every site (166 variants) and quantified the functional role of each on multiple hosts.

The study revealed high-resolution maps of regions with function-enhancing substitutions and host-specific patterns, many previously unknown. They discovered T variants with greater virulence than the wild-type T7, showing even natural phages adapted to a host can be engineered for higher efficacy. This indicates ORACLE can generate ph variants superior to wild-type that could be starting points for therapeutic ph engineering. Experiments will assess the in vivo efficacy of T7 variants. Most phages target a narrow range but can't infect closely related hosts, suggesting directionality in ph-bacterial interactions and orientational bias of the domain with respect to bacterial surface.
Individuals with congenital amusia have a lifelong history of unreliable pitch processing, which leads them to down-weighting pitch cues during speech perception and instead relying on other dimensions such as duration. Researchers investigated the neural basis of this strategy using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 15 individuals with amus and 15 controls. Participants read sentences where a comma indicated a grammatical boundary, then heard two spoken sentences that differed in pitch and/or duration and selected the best match for the written sentence. Prominent reductions in functional connectivity were detected in the amia group between left frontal language-related regions and right pitch-related regions, reflecting between-group differences in cue weights. These differences were not present during a control task.

The study found that individuals with amia, who rely less on pitch than controls to process language, exhibited decreased connectivity between left frontal and right pitch regions. In the task, participants matched sentences with visually presented based on pitch, duration, or both acoustic dimensions. The study suggests that the reliability of perceptual dimensions is linked to connectivity between frontal and percept regions, indicating a compensatory mechanism.

The results are consistent with an account that right auditory areas are abnormally connected to frontal as during tonal tasks but less integrated with left regions when processing speech and language. No differences in activation during processing are consistent with reports that amics and controls do not differ in pitch within sensory regions. The extent of pitch-responsive regions within cortex is similar in amia and controls. Brain encoding of pitch in speech and musical stimuli is unimpaired in individuals with amia.

The study suggests that amics neglect pitch because they have learned their memory is unreliable, and this down-weight is reflected in decreased connectivity between auditory and task-relevant areas which integrate information from percept.
Researchers have discovered a new contagious cancer, Devil Tum 2 (D2), in the Tasman devil, a species that already harbors a widespread cancer, Devilum 1 (D1). Unlike D1, D2 cells express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, showing that loss of MHC is not necessary for the emergence of a contagious cancer. However, the highly expressed MHC I alleles in D2 cells are common among devils and non-polymorphic, reducing immunogenicity in a population sharing alleles. In parallel, MHC I loss emerges in vivo, D2 may mimic the trajectory of D1. The study proposes that contagious cancers exploit histocompatibility between tumour and host, but loss allogenic antigens facilitate transmission D2.

D2 cells can pass between individuals without host immune response protection, and conditions for emergence of contagious in species are unknown. D2 cells express M class I in vitro and vivo, contrasting D1, which lost M I (Siddle et al, 2013). D2 express non-polym, non-class M I (SahaUK) reducing tumour immunogenicity. Classical M I allele highest in D2 is shared with devils. M I varies among D2 tumours vivo, suggesting M I subclones emerge as D transmits. Results show D2 express M I, contrasting D1 and contagious in dogs, CTV.

Further analysis is needed to define host response D2 and tumour evolution. D1 cells in population are M I negative, possible D1 regulated I after transmissible and transmission among individuals shared I alleles. M similarity I between D2 and devils reflects shared range and genotype founder (Stnitz et al,201). Frequency among population may impact D2 spread. Heterogenic M I in D biops suggests I not fixed and lost D2.
Researchers have investigated the neural circuits in the granular retrosplenial cortex (RSG), a region of the brain involved in both spatial and non-spatial behaviors, to understand how it processes information. They used optogenetic mapping in mice to reveal that parallel circuits in the superficial layer of RSG process different types of information. The thalamus and subiculum, sources of spatial information, selectively recruit low-rhease (LR) pyramidal cells in R, while neighboring regular-spiking (RS) cells are controlled by clastral and cingulate inputs, sources of non-spatial information. This is due to precise subaminar and dendritic arbor within R layer 1, which allows parallel processing. Thalamocortical synaptic dynamics enable LR neurons to compute speed of rotation, despite receiving direction inputs that don't explicitly encode speed.

The study highlights a superficial retrosial circuit enabled by precise subamin organization of principal subtypes and axonal afferents. LR receive directional and spatial inputs from thalam and subulum. Synaptic dynamics of thamic inputs to cells give rise to rate coding of angular speed in LR. Determining how these parallel streams are integrated in downstream neurons is key to understanding retrosial computations. Thalam and subulum preferentially control LR, while clastr and culate control RS. Synaptic dynamics of thamic allow robust encoding of angular by LR models, though inputs only contain direction, not speed.

The granular retrosial cortex layer 3 contains two types of pyramidal neurons: low-rase (LR) and regular-sp (RS) neurons. Distinct morphology and properties of LR make them suited to integrate direction from thalam and spatial from hippocamp via subulum. Integration of types of directional and distance is key function of retrosial as whole.
Researchers investigated the link between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the development of tauopathies, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). They found that seizures play a key role in the spread of tau pathology after TBI. To study this, they created a zebraf model expressing a fluorescent biosensor that reports accumulation of human tau when seeded intraventricularly. Zebraf larvae subjected to a novel TBI paradigm exhibited TBI features, including cell death, post-traumatic seizures, and tau inclusions. Application of dynamin inhibitors or anticonvulsant drugs rescued T-induced tauopathy and cell death. Data suggest a role for seizure activity in prion seeding and spreading of tauopathy following T.
Researchers investigated how the relationship between the spatial arrangement of brain regions and measures of brain connectivity. They found that the shape and location of brain regions strongly interact with measures of brain connectivity and that spatial arrangement of regions is predictive of non-imaging measures of behavior and lifestyle. The study suggests that variations in the configuration of brain regions are often interpreted as changes in connectivity. Understanding these effects is important when interpreting brain imaging data and cognitive traits.

The study focused on two aspects of brain: interactions between neural populations (coupling) and spatial organisation of regions (topography). They aimed to identify how these aspects influence measures of brain connectivity and relate to trait variability in behavior and lifestyle across individuals. Spatial organisation of brain is a significant confound for studies, so it's essential to disambiguate the influence of topography to estimate measures that reflect strength between neural populations.

Previous studies have investigated large-scale brain networks using resting functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fluctuations in brain regions measured with fMRI show correlations, revealing patterns of connectivity (Biswal et al, 1995;Fon 1994,201). The study used partial correlation analysis to show that network matrices contain unique subject-level information not reflected in spatial organisation of regions. The conceptualisation of brain organisation is relevant to interpretation of findings.

The implication is that subject information in commonly 'connectivity' reflects variability in location of regions rather than coupling strength, at least for methods mapping group-level to individual data.
Researchers investigated the role of TBP and TBP2 in the activation of MyoD target genes in skeletal muscle cells. They found that TBP, not TBP2, is essential for muscle gene expression in differentiated muscles. TBP is expressed in myotubes from C2C12 myoblast and primary mouse MuSC, while T2 is not. TBP deficient mice have intact regeneration potential and MuSC from T deficient muscles differentiate into myubes as efficiently as wild type MuSC. The study compared RNA profile of Tbp and Tbp2 genes in MuSC from skeletal muscles and C2 myogenic cell line. T expression was detected in Mu-derived myubes and C2 myubes. The absence of T2 in adult muscles did not affect skeletal regeneration, and MuSC isolated from T deficient muscles differentiated into myubes as efficiently as wild type Mu. TFI subunits and T are downregulated during myob differentiation, but form a complex detectable on muscle promoters essential for expression.
Researchers used a technique called optogenetics to stimulate the brains of non-human primates, specifically macaques, to study how it affects the excitability of neural circuits and neuroplasticity. They used a large-scale optogen interface to simultaneously stimulate excitatory neurons and record electrocortic activity across the primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M) cortex. Two measures of network connectivity were tracked: the response to focal stimulation and baseline between pairs of electrodes, which were strongly correlated before stimulation. Within minutes, stimulation in S or M significantly strengthened functional connectivity between these areas. At a finer scale, stimulation led to heterogeneous changes across the network, reflecting correlations introduced by stimulation-evoked activity, consistent with Hebbian plasticity models. This work extends Hebb plasticity models to large circuits, with implications for stimulation-based neurorehabilitation.

The study found a robust relationship between stimulus-evoked correlations and changes in baseline connectivity across the network, explained by a Hebb model of large-scale stimulation plasticity. They investigated how stimulation impacts connectivity between and within areas, testing whether stimulation-ev activity drives large network plasticity in a Hebb manner. The goal was to investigate large functional reorganization following stimulation, informing future neurorehab strategies. A large optogen interface enabled simultaneous stimulation of populations while recording large μ-ECo activity across S and M. First, two measures of functional connectivity were established, providing complementary views of plasticity. Hebb rules were used to explain synaptic plasticity, exploring if large stimulation changes are consistent with Hebb. The strongest test of Hebb is comparing correlations induced by stimulation with changes in network observed. Artifact-free signals allowed this test. Both support a key role for Hebb in sensorimotor plasticity, but a deeper understanding requires intermediate timeframes and cortical mapping.
Researchers studied a rare case of a rhesus macaque monkey born without primary visual cortex (V1) to understand the neural consequences of damage to this area. The monkey's behavior was unremarkable, but visual task performance was impaired. Magnetic resonance imaging showed that structures outside the lesion were normal. Visual stimulation with checkerboards activated the lateral geniculate nucleus, while full-field dots activated pulvin. Cortical activation was sparse but included patches consistently across the lesion and control monkeys. Functional analysis revealed an intact network of bilateral dorsal visual areas correlated with V/MT activation, even without V. Despite subcortical responses to stimulation, there was little evidence for subortical input to V/MT supporting residual function or blindsight phenomena.

Visual structures, both cortical and subort, outside the lesion remained intact in the monkey with little atrophy, suggesting a role in residual function consistent with an intact network of extrastate visual areas comparable to controls. Connectivity between subort regions and V/MT was weak but microstructure intact. Enlarged ventricles within the lesion may have differentially affected anesthesia in the monkey. Figure showed no V/MT activation to checkerboard or moving stimuli, so connectivity analysis was performed. Weakened tract between VMT and subort nuclei indicated little evidence strengthening underlies residual vision in monkey. Residual vision can manifest in several ways, including face information from patient (Bur et al, 2013), suggested surviving loss V1. For motion, monkey showed activation in VMT dorsal ST hemispheres, possibly subthreshold difficult detect BOLD. Without strong VMT responses, a network of cortical areas showed similar B response to VMT (Goodale,201). Retinal may reach dorsal areas via LG and pular, but lack activation due anesthesia makes question difficult.
The innate immune system's ability to recognize foreign double-stranded (ds) DNA in the intracellular environment is crucial for defense against pathogens. However, the mechanism to distinguish between foreign and host DNA in the nucleus is not understood. Researchers used biochemical and single-molecule techniques to study the innate sensor IF16 and found that it one-dimensionally scans long stretches of exposed dsDNA to assemble into supramolecular platforms. Nucleosomes prevent IF16 from targeting host DNA by interfering with this one-dimensional movement. This mechanism allows IF16 to distinguish and assemble on foreign DNA efficiently. 

 IF16 is a key immune sensor that detects dsDNA and assembles signaling platforms in the nucleus and cytoplasm. It plays a role in defense against pathogens such as herpes virus. Researchers observed a unifying mechanism explaining IF16's foreign-dsensing pathways. They found IF16 assembles faster on longer dsDNA and propose one-dimensional assembly regulates overall IF16 responses. Chromatin is thought to allow IF16 to distinguish host from DNA in the nucleus.
Researchers have developed a new technique called spatially targeted microproteomics (ST) that allows for the analysis of specific regions of interest in mammalian tissue without the need for genetic manipulation. The method involves staining specimens with fluorescent dyes or antibodies, soaking them in a solution containing a photo-tag, and using confocal imaging with two-photon excitation to covalently couple the photo-tag to proteins within the region of interest at a resolution of 0.67 µm in the xy-plane and 1.48 µm axially. After solubilization, the photo-tagged proteins are isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. The technique was tested on amyloid plaques in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model and post-mortem case, confirming known constituents and discovering new ones. ST can be applied to various samples including cell lines, primary cultures, ex vivo specimens, biopsy, and post-mort tissue.

The photo-tagged proteins were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, showing a different pattern compared to specimens where amyloid plaques were specifically targeted for ST analysis. The volume of tissue needed for photo-tagging depends on sensitivity, fixation method, sample complexity, and other factors. A semi-automated technique was developed combining two-ph laser microscopy with photochemical labeling and mass spectrom. Two-ph excitation has been used for microscopic 3D-resolved photochemistry. The predominant photo-tagged protein in ST was Aβ, not visible in non-plaque due to low abundance. The technique offers clues to neurodegenerative disease etiology and advances cell biology by analyzing small features not amenable to purification.
Researchers studied the role of the Frizz3 gene in controlling axonal development in cranial and spinal motor neurons. They found that disrupting Frizz (F3) leads to defects in axonal growth in the seventh and twelfth cranial nerves, the phrenic nerve, and dorsal nerves in the fore and hind limbs. In Frizz−/− limbs, axons stall at a specific location in the plexus, unlike other axon-pathfinding mutants, Frizz/− axons do not reroute to other trajectories. Affected motor neurons die 2 days before the normal developmental cell death, coinciding with innervation of muscle targets, providing evidence that developing neurons with long axons are programmed to die unless they arrive at targets on schedule.

In the limb, absence of Frizz leads to specific stalling among LM axons distinct from other axon guidance mutants. Cranial and spinal motor neurons die after axons stall, providing evidence that axons receive survival signals from targets. Researchers asked if motor deficiency in Fr− mice is due to (1) motor differentiation, (2) excessive death, or (3) growth/guidance. Since most Fr− axons do not follow erroneous trajectories, aberrant pathfinding is unlikely. Ax growth is active and independent of target at 5.13.5. A model for precocious motor death in Fr− embryos is survival factors produced by targets along ax's trajectory, suggested by co-culture with spinal cord and floor tissue. A wave of precocious death is not observed in Fr+ controls. In Fr− embryos, a subset exhibits ax growth and death at 11.5-12.5. Controlling growth may be only function of Fr in motor neurons. Fr− and−, Cr− brains have identical ax defects, and Fr−, Cr−, V2/Lp spinal cords commural sensory exhibit rostral defect.
Researchers studied the role of transposable elements (TEs) in regulating gene expression in mouse embryonic and trophlast stem cells. Transposable elements are thought to have helped establish gene networks in early development, but little evidence shows they play significant roles in regulation. The study tested a set of long repeat families as enhancers in mouse embryonic and trophlast stem cells. Epigen and transcript data suggested many TEs help establish tissue-specific gene programs. Genetic editing of T confirmed a subset regulatory relationships. However, a wider survey via CRISPR of RL13 elements in embryonic cells revealed only a minority play significant roles in regulation. Results suggest a subset T are important in early development and highlight importance of functional experiments evaluating regulatory T roles.

The study found some T play minor or no role in regulation, despite strong evidence at chromatin composition and conformation. To test regulatory roles of multiple enhancers in ESCs, CRIS interference was performed at RL13 elements. Data align with chrom accessibility suggest T may support lineage expression of subset genes in development. However, correlations may emerge without causal links T and expression. To test functional role of enhancers in regulation, CRPR genetic excision of T was performed. To validate small effect of enhancers on expression, genetic experiments were done. Two RL13 elements displayed 2-fold H3ac levels upon CR, but little effect neighbouring expression.

The study tested regulatory of specific families in ESCs and TSC using genetic and epetic approaches and compared with predictions from analyses epomic and transcript data. Identified T that drive expression lineage genes. Extensive work necessary evaluate proportion act redundant with other elements.
Researchers have studied how the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, a complex trait that has developed independently in at least 60 plant lineages from the ancestral C3 pathway. They found that its appearance is associated with diverse and flexible evolutionary paths that group into four major trajectories. A meta-analysis of 18 lineages containing species using C3, C, or intermediate C-C forms of photosynthesis was conducted to parameterize a 16-dimensional phenotypic landscape. A novel Bayesian approach based on a hidden Markov model was developed and experimentally verified to predict the C phenotype's evolution. The evolutionary histories underlying C4 photosynthesis were determined by ancestral and initial phenotypic alterations unrelated to photosynthesis. The order of C trait acquisition is flexible and driven by non-photosynthetic drivers. This flexibility facilitated the convergent evolution of the complex trait.

A predictive Bayesian model was developed to infer evolutionary trajectories from sparsely sampled, highly stochastic data. This model provided insights into the evolution of one of the most complex traits to have arisen in lineages: C photosynthesis. The emergence of the C phenotype cannot be comprehensively explored experimentally, making photosynthesis an ideal for mathematical modeling of trait transitions on an underlying landscape. Distinct sub-types evolved as a consequence of alternative histories in response to nonphotosynthetic pressures. Early events determined downstream phenotypes of C sub-types by restricting lineages to independent pathways across space.

Mechanistic diversity underlies multiple pathways generating photos and may facilitate convergent evolution of complex traits. This may benefit efforts to recapitulate photos through genetic of species. Cellular alterations acquired early in evolution (Hyl et al, 198; McK and,2007; Maid,201; Sage,201b). Including these traits in analysis did not alter predicted order or conclusions, suggesting they are robust.
Researchers studied the protein SpoIVA, a bacterial protein that breaks down ATP to form polymers during the sporulation process in Bacillus subtilis. SpoIVA is thought to have evolved from a GTPase, but the reason for this change in nucleotide specificity is unclear. To understand this, the researchers reengineered the nucleotide pocket of Spo to mimic its ancestral GTP activity and found that it functioned as a GTPase but failed to polymerize because it didn't form an NDP intermediate required for polymerization. They also found that incubating Spo with ATP did not promote polymerization, revealing that the nucleotide base, not just energy from hydrolysis, is crucial for function. The study suggests that high levels of ATP relative to GTP at the end of sporulation may have driven the change in nucleotide preference in SpoIVA.

The researchers tested SpoAGTP, a functional in vivo, and found it could use either ATP or GTP to induce conformation change after hydrolysis, but only polymerized in the presence of ATP, indicating a specific requirement for the nucle base, not just energy from hydrolysis. They found that physiological levels of intracellular ATP, not GTP, facilitated conformation changes in Spo and SpoAGTP. Both Spo and SpoTP failed to undergo hydroly-mediated changes in presence of 0.06 GTP but did so in presence 1.5 ATP. However, examining polymerization at different ATP concentrations showed neither Spo nor SpoTP polymerized in presence 0.
A study investigated the long-term consequences of the absence of leptin signaling in early life by restoring leptin signaling at the fourth or tenth week of age in mice lacking the leptin receptor (LepR) gene. The results showed that some defects previously considered irreversible due to neonatal deficiency of leptin signaling, including poor development of arcuate nucleus projections, were recovered by Lep reactivation in adulthood. However, Lep deficiency in early life led to irreversible obesity via suppression of energy expenditure. Lep reactivation in adulthood also led to reduction in hypothalamic Pomc, Cart, and Prlh expression and defects in reproductive and growth systems. The study revealed that early defects in leptin signaling cause permanent metabolic, neuroendocrine, and developmental problems.
Arabidopsis heterotrimer G proteins play a crucial role in regulating immunity by directly coupling to the FLS receptor. The FLS receptor perceives the bacterial flagellin epitope flg22 to activate defenses through the cytoplasmic kinase B1. The heterotrimer proteins composed of the non-canonical G protein XL2, the G protein A1, and the G proteins AG1 and AG2 are required for FLS-mediated responses through an unknown mechanism. This study shows that in the pre-activation state, XL2 directly interacts with FLS and B1, and functions with A1 and AG1/2 to attenuate proteasome-mediated degradation of B1, allowing immune activation. Following activation by fl22, XL dissociates from A1 and is phosphorylated by B in the terminus. The phosphorylated XL enhances production of reactive species likely by modulating the NAD oxidase Rh. The study demonstrates the proteins are directly coupled to the F2 receptor and regulate signaling through pre- and post-activation mechanisms.

In this study, XL2, A1, and AG/2 modulate fl22-triggered immunity by coupling the FLS-B1 receptor. Prior to activation by fl, the proteins attenuate proteome degradation of B, ensuring signaling competence. After fl stimulation, XL dissociates from A, indicating ligand-induced dissociation of from. Importantly, introduction of a transgenic B1 restored fl22 responses and resistance in x2 and mutants, demonstrating a major function of the heterimer protein to maintain signaling in the pre-state. In addition to lig-induced dissociation XL from A, fl induces phosphorylation in the termin. The results show proteins interact the F-B receptor during F signaling and are consistent with defects in responses and Rh phosphorylation in mutants.
Researchers have studied the internal biological clock of the plant Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant, to understand how it regulates its daily rhythms over a 24-hour cycle. They observed the activity of individual cells across the plant over several days under constant conditions and found that each cell has its own rhythm, but they are not synchronized. Two waves of activity, one going down and one up, were observed, particularly in the root area of the plant. The study also found that cells communicate with each other, especially in the root tip. A simple model suggests that differences in cell periods and communication can generate the observed waves of gene expression. The research reveals the structure of the plant's clock and suggests it has multiple coordination points, unlike the centralized mammalian clock.

The study used a reporter gene to track the clock's dynamics across the whole plant at single cell level over days. The data showed coherent waves of gene expression suggesting the plant's signal could be coupled. The researchers estimated coupling strength between cells, especially in the root, using a technique developed for mammalian circadian cells. Results show damping at the plant level is mainly due to desynchronized cells with different periods, not noise in gene expression or individual oscillations. Two waves of gene expression, up and down, were observed in the root, with variable periods at each position causing desynchronization.
Researchers investigated why some adults with normal hearing struggle to understand speech in noisy environments, despite having normal hearing tests. They analyzed over 100,000 patients and found that speech intelligibility varied widely among those with normal hearing, but could be predicted by neural responses to frequency modulation (FM) cues measured through ear recordings. Combining temporal processing, listening effort, and FM accounted for 78% of variability in speech intelligibility. The study identified bottom-up and top-down markers of poor speech perception could inform new clinical tests for hearing disorders.

A battery of behavioral and physiological tests was developed to account for nearly 80% of variability in multi-talker speech intelligibility without linguistic cues. Individuals with clinically normal hearing showed considerable variability in these measures, but neither had a meaningful relationship with speech thresholds. Those with steeper pupil functions had difficulty in multialker tasks, leading to a correlation between pupil change and intelligibility. The study aimed to develop objective markers for complaints of poor communication in normal hearing individuals. Data suggest a strong association between FM detection and speech-noise intelligibility due to early auditory encoding. A correlation between low FM and intelligibility might reflect fast processing fidelity and intelligibility.
Researchers have developed a new method to non-invasively image and measure single-cell blood flow in the smallest to largest vessels in the living retina, a part of the central nervous system. The mammalian eye's transparency allows for a non-invasive view of microvess, but imperfections in the optics blur microscopic retinal capillaries and blood cells. To overcome this, they used 15 kHz adaptive optics imaging to measure blood flow in C57/BL6 mice without surgery or contrast. Measured flow ranged four orders of magnitude (0.0001-1.55µL/min) across vessel diameters 3.2-45.8µm. They developed an ultrafast imaging pipeline and automated analysis to measure millions of cell speeds.

The study is the first to achieve non-invasive measurement of single-cell velocity in full vessel sizes of mammalian retinal circulation. Automation was needed to perform measurements in larger vessels with hundreds of cells per second. They paired adaptive optics with ultrafast camera to image cells nonvas without contrast. This enabled high-throughput measurement of hundreds of cells per second. Quantification of blood flow will be applicable to clinical approaches using same instrumentation.

The study innovated imaging and algorithms to image cells nonvas in smallest to largest vessels (diameters 3.2-45.8µ) without contrast. They showed label-free adaptive imaging improved contrast single cells in retina compared to dye techniques, especially high flow. The method may supplement understanding microcirculation in CNS and systemic health. Combined imaging enabled resolution cells flowed in tight and spars formations. All cells were imaged nonvas near backscatter without dye. This enabled sub-mic precision measuring diameters. 123 vessels in 19 mice were studied.
Researchers have identified a receptor-like kinase called Symbiosis Receptor Kin (SYK) that plays a crucial role in the development of two types of symbiotic relationships between plants and microorganisms: phosphate-acquiring arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) and nitrogen-fixing root nodule symbiosis. However, the mechanisms that distinguish between these two symbiotic fates have been unclear. The study found that ectopic expression of three receptor-like genes, Nod Factor Receptor 1 (N1), N5, and SYK, initiated nodule organogenesis and nodule-related gene expression in the absence of rhizobia. Overexpression of N1 or N5 associated with endogenous SYK in the legume Lotus japonicus revealed that dominant SYK initiates signaling independently of N1 or N5 and a set of genes required for generation of calcium-spiking in both symbiosis. Only SYK but not N overexpression triggered expression of AM-related genes, indicating SYK plays a key role in decision between AM or root nodule symbiosis development.

The study used overexpression constructs of N, N5, or unrelated EF receptor kinase (EF) for co-immunoprecipitation experiments. EF did not interfere with nodulation in wild-type plants. Endogenous full-length SYK coimmunprecipitated with N and N, but not EF, demonstrating SYK association with Ns. SYK-mediated signaling specificity may be explained by complex formation of SYK with N and N, and Lys-kinases that mediate recognition signals from the fungus, resulting in release of negative regulatory mechanisms or unbalanced stoichiometry of SY and putative negative regulators of AM and nodule symb signaling. A subset of genes required for both AM and nodule symbiosis encodes the RL Symbiosis Receptor Kin (SY; Strack et al, 2002). In Lotus japon, this group encodes the RL Symbiosis Receptor Kin (SY. Interestingly, under conditions, SYK-N association was detected in absence of nodulation. Mammalian tyrosine kinases as well as plant RLs, ligand receptor dimerization is critical in signal initiation.
Researchers have developed a new software called DeepKit, a toolkit for estimating animal posture using deep learning methods. This software addresses the limitations of current methods in speed and robustness by using an efficient multi-scale deep model called StackedNet and a fast GPU-based peak-detection algorithm for keypoint locations with sub-pixel precision. DeepKit improves processing speed by more than two times with no loss in accuracy compared to existing methods. The toolkit is demonstrated with challenging animal estimation tasks in laboratory and field settings, including groups of interacting individuals. It reduces barriers to using advanced tools for measuring behavior and has broad applicability across the sciences.

The software is built on state-of-the-art individual estimation using convolutional neural networks for fast inference without reducing accuracy or generalization. The new estimation model, StackedNet, offers improvements over existing models. The code, documentation, and examples are available at https://github.com/graving/deepkit under a permissive license. The goal is to achieve fast estimation by Pereira et al (2019) while maintaining predictive power of models like DeepCut Math et al. These advances could lead to larger, higher-resolution, reliable datasets revolutionizing understanding between behavior, brain, and environment.

Deep learning-based methods can achieve near-human accuracy in any scenario by annotating data and training a CNN to estimate locations directly from images. In contrast, conventional methods rely on parallel processing large batches or downsampling, increasing error. Stacked model can run at 30-110 Hz depending on resolution. Unlike computer vision, deep methods can achieve accuracy by annotating and training a CNN to estimate locations directly from images.
When immune cells, such as macrophages, are challenged by environmental stresses or pathogens, they trigger the formation of protein complexes called inflamomes that initiate inflammatory responses and a form of cell death called pyroptosis. Researchers have identified an intracellular trigger of NLR3-mediated signaling, IL-1 production, and pyptosis in murine bone-derived macrophages that is mediated by disruption of glycolytic flux. This results from a drop in NAD levels and induction of mitochondrial ROS, which can be rescued by addition of products that restore NAD production. This signal is also important for host response to intracellular pathogen Salmonella typhim, which disrupts host cell metabolism by glucose uptake.

Typhim infection impairs NAD production, resulting in mitochondrial ROS formation essential for NLR3 inflamome activation. Disruption of glycol flux is a biological trigger of NLR3 inflome activation mediated by mitochondrial changes, revealing a link between metabolism and inflammation initiation. Immune cells sense metabolite production and flux through glycol pathway, activating N3 to initiate responses. Inhibitors of flux-limiting enzymes and tyim effectively limit glycol through distinct mechanisms, resulting N3 inflamome and pyptosis.

NAD consumption increases upon pyruate treatment, indicating productive metabolism downstream glycol in infected BMDs. Data indicate glycol perturbation a mechanism immune sense homeostasis during tyim infection and induce pro-inflammatory via N3 inflome and pypt death. Functionally, immune cells sense metabolic perturbation as danger, inflamome, caspase activation, and cytokine secretion. Results using molecule and inhibitors suggest disrupting gly flux serves trigger inflammation and death in macroages. Disturbance gly flux by intracellular pathogen S.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the PALB2 protein in DNA binding and repair in cells. PAL2 is a tumor suppressor protein linked to various cancers, including breast cancer and Fanconi anemia. It coordinates BRCA1 and BRCA2 during homologous-directed repair (HDR) and interacts with chromatin proteins. PAL2 also binds DNA, but the function of this interaction was unclear. A major DNA-binding site of PAL2 was found, with mutations reducing RAD51 formation and HDR efficiency by 50%. The PAL2 N-terminal DNA-binding domain (NDB) stimulates RAD51 recombinase activity. Surprisingly, NDB has strand exchange activity without RAD51 and can use RNA as a substrate. The study reveals PAL2's versatile interaction with DNA and its critical role in chromosome repair.

 PAL2 is a scaffold protein that links BRCA1 and BR2 during HDR and interacts with other chromatin proteins. However, a PAL2 variant with preserved BR1 and BR2 binding but without the middle portion containing DB does not support BR2 and RAD recruitment to DSBs. Mutations in four amino acids reduced RAD51 formation and HDR efficiency in a cell model. PAL2-DB itself stimulates RAD strand reactions. PAL2DB also supports forward and inverse exchange without RAD51 and uses RNA as a substrate. The data highlight PAL2's novel activity and importance in DNA binding for repair.

 PAL2 interaction with DNA is critical for BR2 and RAD recruitment to DSB and efficient repair in cells. PAL2-DB stimulates RAD-mediated strand exchange in vitro. Breast cancer proteins BR1 and 2 regulate non-mutagenic chromosome repair and are guardians of chromosomal integrity. They initiate RAD51 homologous recombination (HR) and restart stalled replication. PAL2 truncation of 500 amino acids between BR1 and BR2 binding and DB does not support BR2 RAD51 formation during damage. Both BR1 and BR2 domains are retained, indicating DB's importance in PAL2 function.
Researchers have discovered that the bacterial protein Mre, a prokaryotic actin homologue, forms antiparallel double filaments in vitro and in vivo. Unlike other actin filaments, which are made up of pairs of protofilaments in a parallel arrangement, Mre's protoaments are arranged antiparallel. This unique arrangement allows each subunit to interact with the membrane and membrane-bound components of the elongome. The antipar nature of Mre filaments also explains their assembly and disassembly kinetics at both ends. The mechanism of protofil formation of Mre is similar to that of other actin proteins, involving domain closure upon polymerization. 

 Crystal structures of Caulobacter M reveal conformation changes accompanying antipar filament formation and the binding of antimicrobial agents A22MP to the nucleotide ofre, preventing hydrolysis and destabilizing protoaments. The protein's membrane-binding ability constrains its filament architecture to straight or slightly bent, rather than helical pairs of protoaments. The straight antipar arrangement of Mre protoaments is unprecedented among actin proteins, whether eukotic or proary origin. It ensures the amphipathic helix of protoaments can bind to the membrane and both protoaments interact with bitopic proteins. Deleting the N-terminal amphathic helix and mutating residues in the hydroobic loop makes the protein less prone to aggregation. The structure of Caulob M reveals the typical act fold, two domains on either side a nucleotide cleft, separated into subdomains A and B.
Researchers studied the difference in petal number between two plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Cardamine hirsuta. Arabidopsis thalian has a consistent number of four petals, while Cardamine hirs has variable petal number. They found that a gene called APETALA1 (AP1) is responsible for this difference. AP1 in Arabidopsis thalian masks the effect of other genes that control petal number in Cardamine, making it consistent. However, Cardamine AP1 does not have this function, leading to variable petal number. The researchers also found that changes in the regulatory regions of AP1 contribute to this difference. They showed that petal number in Cardamine is maintained despite genetic variation in natural accessions that produce four-petaled flowers. This suggests that AP1 exposed hidden genetic variation in Cardamine that contributes to variable petal number. AP1 is a major regulator of Arabidopsis flower development, acting early to initiate and specify organs. The study identified AP as a gene of effect in the transition from robust petal in Arabidopsis to variable in Cardamine. However, AP polymorphisms do not contribute to within-species variation in Cardamine petal. Instead, the uniformity of petal in Arabid reflects robustness to genetic variation. Researchers changed Arabid petal to variable by complementing AP mutants with Card AP genomic locus. Flowers mimicked variable pet in Card, suggesting hidden variability in regulatory network controlling pet in Arabid. Petals with identity show variation in number if arise outside second whor, as predicted by ABC model. AP ectopically expressed in third whor petals of mutants in Card, associated with invariant number. Endogenous AP in whor two of Card floral meristem associated with variable.
Researchers have found that misfolding of proinsulin, a precursor to insulin, is an early event in the progression to type 2 diabetes. Insulin synthesis begins with the folding of proinsulin, including the formation of three conserved intramolecular disulfide bonds. In normal pancreatic islets, a subset of proins molecules have at least one free cysteine. However, in islets with perturbed endoplasmic reticulum environment, non proins enters intermolecular disulf-linked complexes. In obese mice with wild-type islets, disulf-linked proins are more abundant, and in leptin-deficient mice, such complexes increase with onset islet deficiency and diabetes. Proins-Cys 19 and Cys20 are necessary and sufficient for proins disulf-linked complexes; pro-Cys 19-Cys19 coval homimers resist reductive dissociation, highlighting structural basis aberrant proins formation. Increased proins misolding via disulf complexes is associated with prediabetes and wors β-cell dysfunction in type 2 diabetes.

 Studies show that proins misolding includes inability to complete internal disulf bonds, a fraction of proins in ER bearing unpaired cystine. Improperly folded proins enter aberr disulf partnerships with pro in ER, resulting misfold pro complexes first identified in human islets. In leptin-deficient mice, hyperphagic, glucose intolerant animals, islets demonstrate increased disulf proins complexes with 90 of pro in such complexes. Rodent islets also show aberr disulf proins complexes in states alter ER environment and T2 progression prior β-cell dedifferentiation or death. Proins in islet lysates of predi Lepdb mice contain large state pro with 90 molecules in disulf-linked dimers and higher complexes. In young normoglycemic Lepdb mice destined diabetes, proins disulf complexes increased and islet levels.
Researchers studied the role of Suvh39, a protein that adds methyl groups to histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9), in forming heterochromatin, a type of chromatin that silences genes. Suvh39 recognizes and binds to H3me3 via its chromodomain, but how it targets chromatin without pre-existing H3me3 is unclear. The study found that Suv39's chromomain (S39-CD) binds nucleic acids, including RNA and DNA, and this binding is important for its function in heterochatin assembly. S39-CD has higher affinity for RNA than DNA and can bind nucleic independently of H3me recognition. In vivo, S39 bound major satellite RNAs and knockdown of satellite RN lowered S39 retention on perentric heterochrom. Mutational studies showed that both nucleic-binding and Hme-binding of S-CD were crucial for perentric heterochatin assembly. These results suggest chrom-bound RN contribute to S39's specificity.

S39-CD's nucleic-binding integrates with Hme recognition to establish and maintain S39-mediated perentric heterochatin, including Hme formation, HP accumulation, and repressive status. S also bound major RNA in vivo dependent on nucleic activity and knockdown of satellite RN lowered S retention on perentricochatin. Data suggest chrom-bound RN contribute to targeting and retention of S at specific regions. In addition to establishing Hme, S-CD's RNA activity contributes to S's association with Hme-rich per regions. Knock of satellite transcripts further supports RNA binding of S contributes stability chrom. Intriguingly, S-YA interacted partially with major RN, not fitting model that S-CD and Hme activities cooperatively function in S's chrom targeting However, also found S-YA loosely bound chrom Considering, S-Y may interact RN without binding chrom Furthermore, found HP and chrom-binding of S's N-terminal contributed S-mediated perentric Hme formation Collectively results demonstrated different S other than lysine activity cooperatively regulate S-mediated perentricochatin
Researchers investigated how the entorhinal cortex, a region of the brain involved in spatial navigation, processes, responds to attention without physical movement. They trained monkeys to maintain central fixation while covertly attending to a moving stimulus in the periphery and found that 20.14% of entorhinal cells had spatially structured receptive fields. This contrasts with the hippocampus, where similar representations were not observed. The study suggests that entorinal cells do not rely on physical movement for activation. 

The researchers tested the hypothesis that grid cells in the entorinal cortex participate in cognitive functions beyond navigation by recording from units in monkeys performing a covert attention task. They found that activation of entor cells with spatially firing fields does not require physical movement. Previous studies showed grid cells can be activated by eye movements in stationary monkeys exploring scenes. 

To examine entor representations during covert attention, they recorded 141 neurons in two rhes macaque monkeys performing a covert tracking task. Monkeys maintained fixation while attending a small dot moving on a monitor. They performed the task at 70% accuracy, with most errors due to saccades outside the window. To evaluate entor spatial representations, the standard grid measure was used.
Researchers have developed a standardized task to measure decision-making in mice that produces reproducible results across multiple laboratories. The task, called perceptual value-based decision-making, was used to train 140 mice across seven laboratories in three countries, collecting 5 million choices into a publicly available database. Learning speed varied among mice, but once training was complete, behavior was comparable across laboratories. Mice in different laboratories relied similarly on visual stimuli, past successes, and failures, and estimates of stimulus probability to guide their choices. These results show complex behavior can be reproduced across laboratories, establishing a standard for reproducible rodent behavior and providing an unprecedented dataset and open tools to study decision-making in mice. This indicates a path toward achieving reproducibility in neuroscience through open-science approaches.

The researchers implemented identical equipment and protocols to study mouse behavior across laboratories. Mice learned the task in all laboratories and performed comparably after learning. They adopted a comparable reliance on visual stimuli, past, successes, and estimates of prior probability. To facilitate reproducibility, an open science approach was adopted, sharing hardware, software, and experimental protocols. Data and techniques should be made available to the community (Bdo et al, 2019; Charles et al). Results from a large cohort of mice demonstrate reproducible methods and results across laboratories. Most mice learned the task, often at different paces, but performed comparably, with no differences.

Physiological studies of decision are carried out in mice to access genetic, imaging, and physiological tools for brains (Carini and Church, 2013; Glick et al,2014; O'Connor et,2009). The International Laboratory aims to explore the neural basis of behavior in multiple laboratories. Results can be compared, knowing differences are unlikely due to behavior. These resources will catalyze new adaptations and variations, accelerating neural correlates of decision-making studies.
Researchers have created a detailed map of the gene expression of cells in the intestine of a planarian flatworm, Schmidtea mediterrane, which can regenerate its organs, including the gut. They used a technique called laser-capture microsection (LCM) and RNA sequencing to identify hundreds of genes that were not previously unknown to be expressed in the intestine. The study found that the planarian's digestive system is similar to that of other animals, including humans, including genes involved in metabolism, nutrient transport, immunity, and other functions. The researchers also discovered regionalized gene expression in the intestine along the medio-lateral axis, particularly in goblet cells, and identified two intestine-enrich transcription factors that regulate regeneration (gli-1) or maintenance (RE2) of goblet cells. These findings provide a resource for further investigation of mechanisms in gastrointestinal function and repair.

The study identified 22 intestine-enrich transcription factors, including those required for production and maintenance of goblet cells, setting the stage for further studies of this cell type. The planarian transcriptome is a resource for investigating aspects of regeneration and physiology. The researchers developed a method for laser-capture microsection of planarian tissue to define gene and cell types in the intestine. The intestine expresses genes involved in metabolism, storage, transport, immunity, and other roles, demonstrating functional homology with digestive systems of other animals, including humans.

Two transcription factors, gli-1 and RE2, were found to play distinct roles in goblet differentiation and maintenance. Depletion of gob cells reduced planarians' willingness to feed and viability, with negligible effects on regeneration of other cell types or non-intestinal tissues. Characterization of the planarian transcript provides a framework for next steps.
Researchers studied how weakly electric fish perceive their environment and communicate with each other through electric signals. They found that two types of sensory receptors in these fish respond differently to these signals. One type, called spiking receptors, detects variations in the timing of the signal, while the other, oscillating receptors, respond to the frequency of the signal. The oscillating receptors are more sensitive to signals from groups of fish, not individual fish, and this is linked to increased behavioral responses to these signals. This suggests that the two types of receptors are adapted for different social environments. The study discovered a new way that sensory information is coded through synchrony among receptors, where oscillating receptors reset their phase in response to stimuli, providing information about timing and location, but not waveform. This is the first evidence for sensory coding through oscillatory synchrony. 

The researchers investigated how differences in sensory perception relate to receptor physiology in weakly electric fish. These fish communicate through a species-specific electric discharge (EOD) with variable intervals between pulses. Oscillating receptors are tuned to lower frequencies than the peak frequencies of conspecific EODs and are sensitive to intervals that can only be produced by groups of fish. Spiking receptors detect signals from individuals, while oscillating detect signals from groups. Experiments showed a species with oscillating receptors responded strongly to millisecond intervals within the range of receptor sensitivity. This mechanism may be an adaptation for detecting signals from groups of fish. Oscillatory activity is common in neural networks. If oscill receptors detect group signals, species with oscillating should respond to millisecond intervals and species spiking should not. Behavioral experiments presented a fish with a train of conspecific E at constant intervals.
Researchers have determined the three-dimensional structure of the bacteriophage BPP-1 at 3.5 Å resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. BPP-1 is a virus that infects and kills Bordetella species, which cause whooping cough in humans and respiratory diseases in mammals. The virus has a T=7 icosahedral capsid with a diameter of approximately 670 Å. The structure reveals two major protein folds: jellyroll for the capsid protein (CP) and HK-like for the major capsid protein (MCP). Notably, the topology of MCP is non-circularly permuted from the Johnson fold previously seen in viral and cellular proteins. The new topology is likely the only feasible alternative to the old. Beta-sheet and electrostatic interactions contribute to the non-covalent chain in B-1, unlike coval interprotein linkages in HK97. The termini of both CP and MCP are positioned for D-based phage engineering.

The atomic description of B-1 will enhance bioengineering efforts, non-coval molecular interactions of bacteri capsid formation and clarify evolutionary B- MCP and CP with other viruses. The study reports three-dimensional of B- at ∼ 3.5 resolution by single-p cryoEM and atomic model. BPP has a HK-like capsid protein, unlike other viruses such as ϕ174, bacteriophage PR1 and adenovirus. The jelly motif in B- forms auxiliary to stabilize capsid proteins of another fold. B- and MCP adopt two major folds, jelly and HK/Johnson. The Johnson in B- is non-circular permuted compared to known topology. The fold has been observed in Siphiridae and Myiridae families, exemplified by gp of HK97.
Researchers studied how the deng virus (DENV) adapts to different environments by passing it through human and mosquito cells. They used a technique called ultra-deep sequencing to examine the effects of single-nucleotide variants in the virus populations. This allowed them to determine how beneficial and harmful mutations contribute to the virus's fitness. The study found that a large number of harmful mutations balance out the effect of rare beneficial mutations that help the virus adapt to its host. Beneficial mutations tend to occur in areas of the virus's proteome that are flexible and cluster in specific regions of the genome. These mutations may help the virus adapt to specific hosts. The study also found that constraints on the virus's evolution are similar to those seen in other deng and Zika strains. 

The study quantified the cost of harmful mutations across the deng genome and how negative selection shapes virus diversity. It will be interesting to understand how functional and structural features contribute to these patterns and overall fitness. The study showed ability to recapitulate and identify shifts in the dynamics of selection and adaptation on deng populations in cells and hosts. Clusters of mutations in specific regions of deng suggest elements targeted by selection in each host. The study found adaptation relies on host beneficial mutations in specific regions of deng and enriched in flexible regions of proteome. 

The researchers used CirSeq to characterize the fitness of deng adapting to human and mosquito cells by tracing allele trajectories of all single nucleotide variants. This revealed influence of positive and negative selection on the evolutionary paths of d in distinct environments. Many beneficial mutations were at specific locations in genome suggesting adaptation relies on hotspots of host selection. To analyze these hotspots, they mapped fitness on three-dimensional structure of deng protein, a well-studied transmembrane forming outer layer of envelope.
Researchers used a technique called single-particle tracking microscopy to study how a specific protein called KRas12, an active form of the Ras protein, moves and behaves on the cell membrane. They found that KRas12 is divided into three distinct areas on the membrane: an immobile, intermediate, and fast-moving. The imm area is about 70 nanometers in size, the intermediate about 200 nanometers, and the rest of the membrane is fast-moving. KR12 is constantly moved from the imm area to the fast and back, similar to a process called internalization and recycling. This process happens regardless of how much KR12 is present in the cell. The study shows how membrane organization affects KR12 movement and trafficking, providing insight into how Ras signaling is regulated. 

The researchers also found that KR12 stays in the three areas regardless of how much is present in the cell, showing that its movement and trafficking through these areas is a stable process. They used this information to create a model of KR12 movement on the membrane, which showed that the imm and intermediate areas are associated with specific membrane domains. The sizes of these domains are consistent with previous research on membrane organization. A new model was proposed to describe KR12 movement, where membrane domains dictate its diffusion and trafficking, affecting Ras multimer formation and signaling. This study sheds light on how membrane domains organize KR12 movement and offers guidance for future research on the molecular and structural identities of these domains and Ras signaling mechanisms.
Researchers have long sought to understand how Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling patterns the dorsal-ventral axis in vertebrates and invertebrates. In vertebrates, the prevailing view is that BMP gradient formation occurs through a counter-gradient of BMP antagonists and ligand shuttling to generate peak levels. To investigate this in zebraf, scientists quantified BMP activity in wild-type and mutant embryos and combined data with a mathematical model to test hypotheses for gradient formation. Analysis ruled out shuttling and transcriptionally-formed mechanisms, instead supporting a source-sink mechanism where a restricted antagonist acts as a sink driving BMP dorsally and gradient formation. Bmp2 diffusion supports this model, suggesting a new mechanism for shaping BMP gradients during development.

A quantitative method was established to measure BMP signaling in zraf embryos, integrated with a modeling approach to inform model selection. Modeling provided key parameters to identify the mechanism forming the BMP gradient. The hypothesis that BMP gradient largely reflects bmp expression was tested, but not supported. Quantification and modeling presented a new view of antagonists and ligand establishing BMP patterning the DV axis in zraf.

BMPs act as morphogens in development, including patterning embryonic axis, neural tube, and Drosila wing. BMP systems are established by extracellular regulators. In vertebrates, the BMP mechanism unclear. Several mechanisms proposed: 1) inverse antagonists shape BMP gradient, 2) antagonists generate peak signaling by shuttling ligand.
Researchers have identified a protein called MF1, a member of the major facilitator superfamily of transporters, which plays a crucial role in the breakdown and recycling of cellular waste in lysosomes. Lysosomes are compartments within cells where proteins and other cellular waste are broken down and recycled. MF1 is not previously uncharacterized and its function was unknown. The study found that MF1 is not glycosylated, meaning it does not have a sugar molecule attached to it, and has a specific sequence of amino acids that allows it to be transported to lysosomes. Mice without MF1 developed severe liver disease and spleen problems. Analysis of lysosomes from these mice revealed a protein called GL as essential for MF1 function. GL and MF1 physically interact and are necessary for each other's presence in lysosomes. Mice without GL developed similar problems to those without MF1. The study shows that MF1 and GL form a complex on the lysosomal membrane.
Researchers have gained insight into the process of how kines motors, powered by ATP hydrolysis, transport microtubules in eukaryotes by developing atomic models of nucleotide and ATP states of the moneric kines motor domain microtules from cry-EM reconstructions at 5-Å resolution. By comparing these models with X-ray structures of AD-bound kines, they inferred a mechanistic scheme where microtule attachment, mediated by a conserved 'chpin' residue kines (N255), triggers clam opening of the nucleotide cleft and release of AD. Binding of ATP closes the cleft in a manner tightly coupled to translocation of cargo via kines' neck element. These transitions are reminiscent of analogous nucle-exchange steps in myosin and F-ATase motors and inform how two heads of kines dimer gate each other to promote stepping along microtules. This mechanism allows microules to regulate kines affinities for AD and ATP by modulating conformation of switch, providing a structural basis for kines nucleotide behavior on microules.
Researchers have identified a quality control (QC) pathway for misfolded proteins at the outer membrane of mitochondria in yeast cells. This pathway involves the recognition and removal of misfolded proteins, which is essential for maintaining the function of mitochondria. Two temperature-sensitive (ts) peripheral outer membrane proteins, sam-2Hs and sen-1Hs, were found to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteome system. The ubiquination of sam-2Hs is mediated by the ubiquitin ligase Ubr1, while sam-2s is primarily ubiquinated by San1. Mitochondrial degradation (MAD) of both substrates requires the family of heat shock proteins Hsp70 and HspS1, providing the first evidence for chaperone involvement in MAD. Additionally, a role for the C48-N4-U1 AAA-ATase complex, Do1 and a mitochondrial pool of transmembrane C48 adaptor U2, are implicated in degradation. This study reveals a unique QC pathway of a combination of cytosolic and mitochondrial factors that distinguishes it from other cellular pathways.
Researchers have developed a way to visualize and study the activity of a key protein called extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in the skin of living mice using a special tool called a FRET biosensor. They found that under normal conditions, the skin shows bursts of ER activity that spread from cell to cell in a radial pattern. This spreading of ER activity, called SPREAD, is linked to the rate of skin cell division and growth. The researchers also found that a substance called 12-tetradecanoyphol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulates SP in a way that depends on growth factor receptors and their ligands. When the skin is wounded, ER activity spreads as a wave along the edge of the wound, suggesting it can be superimposed. By studying the cell cycle, they found that SPs are associated with the G2 phase of cell progression. This study provides new insights into how cell growth and ER activity are synchronized in a living tissue.

The researchers used transgenic mice expressing a FRET biosensor of ER to monitor ER activity in epidermal cells at single resolution. Long-term imaging of the epidermis revealed radial propagation of ER activity, where ER activation originates from a few cells and spreads to a radius of 50 micrometers over 30 minutes until disappearance. They named this phenomenon SP and investigated its mechanism and role in cell cycle. The study shows how growth signal is regulated in steady and wounded skin in a tissue by two types of ER activation patterns.
Researchers have studied the circadian clock of cyanobacteria, a type of bacteria, to understand how it responds to daily light and dark cycles. In nature, circadian clocks don't run freely but are influenced by daily cues that change with the seasons. The study found that the cyanobacterial circadian clock follows a simple pattern in light-dark cycles and tracks midday conditions with varying day lengths. The core of the clock, made up of proteins called Kai, behaves similarly when driven by pulses in vitro, indicating the dynamics are intrinsic to these proteins. A mathematical framework was developed to transform the clock by external cues, predicting behavior in many environments.

The circadian behavior can be captured quantitatively by a framework with few parameters, guiding experiments to probe molecular origins of key features. The defined nature of the cyanobacterial clock facilitates experiments, but the model is general, expected to be useful for other organisms. The core of the cyanobacterial circadian clock can be reconstituted in vitro from purified Kai proteins, leading to the question of whether it tracks midday in vivo is intrinsic or requires additional factors in the cell. Cyanobacteria allow elucidate molecular circadian mechanisms because the oscillator driving genome-wide transcription can be reconstituted using Kai proteins, extensively studied biochemically in conditions.

The Kai proteins were simulated with pulses of nucleotides on a 24 cycle, simulating in vivo conditions day and night. The in vitro system shows a linear scaling clock with simulated length, indicating mechanisms for adaptation are intrinsic to Kai. The reduction in model holds promise predicting behavior in many environments from minimal data, applicable to clocks in many. The biochemistry of the simplest clock is complex, analysis suggests entrained behavior is how the cycle is deformed by the environment.
Researchers have identified a gene called Meis as a risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), a leading cause of premature death in many people. They found that inactivating Meis in the neural crest, a group of cells that forms the heart and nervous system, leads to abnormal heart rhythm and conduction problems, increasing the risk of SCD. The study shows Meis is crucial for sympathetic neurons to connect to the heart, and Meis-deficient neurons die early in development. Meis also regulates key molecules for endosome transport, and without it, endosome traffic is severely impaired in Me-deficient neurons. This suggests Meis interacts with signaling pathways during neuron development.

Inactivating Meis in mice results in heart conduction defects, chronotropic incompetence, and increased SCD. Meis regulates genes for retrograde transport, endosome formation, and functioning. The study aimed to investigate Meis role in cardiac regulation by intervening in sympathetic neuron differentiation and how Meis mutations mediate unexplained S. Loss of Meis function in sympathetic neurons leads to imbalanced sympatho-vagal regulation in adults, increasing S. Inactivating Meis in neurons impairs Rab+ endosome traffic and target innervation.

Results complement a previous study showing Meis function in regulating cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction, but not in cardiomyocytes. Meis participates in cardiogenesis.
Researchers have studied the formation of biofilms, which are communities of bacteria attached to a surface, and found that mechanical instabilities such as wrinkling and delamination play a crucial role in shaping their morphology. Using Vibrio cholera as a model, they combined measurements, theory, simulation, image analysis, surface characterization, and mutagenesis to show that interfacial energy, or the energy at the surface, drives the creation and destruction of new and existing interfaces. This process, called mechanorphogenesis, is linked to the expansion of the biofilm and shapes its overall contour. The study suggests that mechanical forces drive morphogenesis, or the formation of shape, is an ancient process reused in bacteria and eukaryotes. Biofilms are a tractable model to investigate the role of mechanical forces in morphogenesis and provide a system for morph-engineering.
Researchers have investigated the role of the transcription factor NRS in the development of epilepsy, a condition characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They found that seizures increased levels of NRS in the hippocampus, a region of the brain involved in memory and emotion, but surprisingly only repressed a small subset of its target genes. These repressed genes were rescued when NRS binding to chromatin was blocked, suggesting they were dependent on NRS for regulation. The repressed genes had moderate binding to NRS, making them sensitive to fluctuations in NRS levels. They coded for ion channels, receptors, and molecules crucial for neuronal function, suggesting their repression may contribute to epilepsy. Hundreds of genes in the hippocampus contain NRS binding sites, but only a few are repressed by NRS in the context of seizures. The basis of selective regulation is their moderate binding to NRS, which increases after seizures. NRS-regulated genes in the hippocampus include ion channels, receptors, calcium molecules, and transcription factors that govern neuronal plasticity, suggesting their repression may contribute to epilepsy pathogenesis. The study used large-scale transcript arrays, PCR, chromatin immunoprecipitation, and gene enrichment analysis to examine NRS-dependent changes during epilepsy. A twofold increase in NRS led to repression of a subset of potentially regulated genes, rescued by blocking NRS function.
In the mammalian olfactory system, sensory information is processed through two parallel pathways formed by mitral (MC) and tuft (TC) cells. These cells receive input from olfactory sensory neurons (OS) and project to different parts of the brain. How these parallel pathways maintain or enhance specific features of the stimulus is not well understood. Researchers investigated the circuitry between MC and TC cells and found differences in activity-dependent inhibition between them. This is due to differences in activation of deep and superficial granule cells. Simulations showed that these circuit differences allow MC and TC to distinguish odors in separate concentration ranges, indicating that segregating information about intensity may be a function of these pathways.

 MC and TC receive input from OS and project to different parts of the brain. Similar to the visual system, feature selectivity in MC and TC emerges from connectivity to OS and tuft cells. In the retina, selectivity in ganglion cells is due to bipolar and amacrine cell connectivity. Similarly, differences in odor responses MC and TC are due to OS and tuft connectivity. The combination of activity-dependent inhibition at low and intermediate rates enables TC and MC to encode odors better than either alone, supporting computations unlikely with single neurons.
Researchers studied the molecular and supramolecular determinants of allosteric effects in the M2 muscarinic receptor, a prototypic model of allosteric GPCRs. They compared monomers and oligomers of the receptor to identify alloster properties gained in oligomers. Alloic interactions were monitored using a FRET sensor at the alloster site and pharmacological assays with mutants to exclude intramolecular effects. Electrostatic, steric, and conformational determinants of alloster at the atomic level were examined in molecular simulations. Alloic effects in monomers were negative, primarily due to intramolecular electrostatic repulsion between alloster and orthost ligands. Allo effects in oligomers were positive or negative, depending on alloster-orth pair, and arose from interactions between constituent protomers. The behavior of oligomers is characteristic of muscarinic receptors in myocardial preparations.

The M2 muscarinic receptor has been understood in terms of monomeric interactions, but this view disregards the tendency of GPC to form oligomers. Oligomeric nature of M receptor evident in multiphas effects alloic on dissociation of orthost antagonists and binding equilibrium. To understand how oligomer might account for allo behavior, positive and negative alloic modulators were compared for effects on oligomers and monomers of M musinic receptor. The M musinic has been a prototype for effects within broader GPC family. Studies of interaction alloic with allo have been based on modulation at orthost site, typically in native or detergent-solized receptors. Events may be measured directly, in binding radiol antagonist.

Researchers used molecular simulations at atomic level, starting from crystal monomeric M occupied by agonist ipxo. Lig and proteins were removed, conformations sampled within 30ns.
A study investigated the role of SET2, an enzyme that trims histone H3 lysine 36, in the DNA damage response to double-strand breaks (DSBs) in cells. Researchers found that SET2 is necessary for the activation of the ATM protein, a key player in the DNA damage response, and for homologous recombination repair of DSBs. Cells lacking SET2 showed impaired damage signaling and failed to activate p53, a protein that guards the genome, and had decreased survival after DNA damage. The study proposes that SET2 establishes a chromatin state that facilitates signaling and repair of DSBs. In clear cell carcinoma cells, loss of SET2 may inactivate the p53 checkpoint without additional mutations in TP53.

 The study used reporter assays to show that SET2 is required for the DNA damage response and that depletion of SET2 impairs ATM activation and delays 53BP1 recruitment to DSB. Data reveal that SET2 is necessary for RAD51 recruitment to resect DNA ends and SET2-depleted cells show reduced homology repair of DSB. SET2 mutations were found in clear cell carcinoma. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of SET2 impact on the DNA response. Unlike other histone modifications that promote the response, this study shows no increased H3me levels at damage sites or DDR-dependent SET2 recruitment to DSB.

 The study provides a link between altered chromatin states and genome integrity in clear carcinoma, a cancer with high genomic alterations and inactivating histone modifiers like SET2. The study investigates the role of SET2 on DNA response to DSB and identifies a novel role in rendering cells competent to repair DSB.
Researchers have identified a new genetic mutation in the Ras1 gene, called Ras1Ana, which leads to the production of autoantibodies and an accumulation of a specific type of T cell in the immune system called CD44 Helios+ PD-1+ CD4 T cells. This type of T cell is dependent on B cells and is not present in normal amounts in mice with this mutation. Despite reduced Ras1-Ras-ER activation in vitro, thymocyte development in Ras1Ana mice is mostly normal, but CD44 is overexpressed on naïve thymocytes and T cells in a T-autonomous manner. The researchers found that CD44 expression is a reporter of mTOR kinase signaling and that is elevated in RasAna naïve CD+ T cells. The ratio of CD44 CD+ T subset and autoib in serum returned to normal in RasAnaMtorchino double-mut mice, showing that increased m activity is essential for RasAna T dysregulation.

The mutation RasAna is distinct from other autoimmune mutations in Ras1, as it has no effect on thym development in mice with normal T repertoire, but results in accumulation of Hel+ PD+ T cells and autoantib. In contrast to Ras1 deletion, RasAna increases m signaling in naïve CD T cells. The study reveals a new role of Ras in intrinsic regulation of CD T cells by analyzing a missense in the Ras hand, dissociating this function from its known role in thic selection. Biochemical and genetic studies show overactive m signaling in naïve T as key for RasAna abnormalities: (1) constitutive increase in CD44 naïve T and (2) accumulation of peripheral Helios CD44 CD cells and autoib.

Genetic reduction of function in RasAna mice normalizes CD expression naïve T and abolishes accumulation of effector cells and autoib, demonstrating central role of increased activity in immune dysregulation RasAna.
Researchers studied the role of Arida, a component of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, in the development of pancreatic cancer. They found that loss of Arida in adult cells with oncogenic Kras mutations led to rapid and irreversible reprogramming of acinar cells into mucinous pancreatic cancer precursor lesions. However, when Arida was silenced during embryogenesis with Kras activation, acinar cell fate was retained. This suggests that Arida is a critical modulator of Kras-dependent changes in acinar cell identity and that timing and genetic context influence the effects of SWI/S complex alterations in epithelial tumorigenesis.

In adult acinar cells with oncogenic Kras, suppressing Arida accelerated acinar to ductal specification and mucinous cancer precursor lesions that could not be reversed by restoring endogenous Arida expression. This indicates that Arida provides a barrier to K-driven acinar duct metaplas and early pancreatic neoplas. Alcian blue staining confirmed retention of mucinous lesions in Ar1-restored mice. Arida loss enables non-reversible reprogramming of cell fate dependent on cellular and genetic context.

The researchers sought to understand how Arida regulates pancreas cell identity. Disrupting the SW/S chromatin-remodel complex impacts expression of SW/S target genes. This implies genomic areas accessible by Arida involved in preventing ac to duct transdifferentiation in mutant K, a critical step in K driven neoplas. Transcription and chrom profiling data show Arida disruption with oncogenic K reduces chromatin accessibility of TFs to enhancers needed sustain ac cell. While Arida stabilizes ac identity as a barrier to cancer, other factors promote Pan-to-DAC transition. Data suggest Arida depletion in pre-existing K rapidly perturbs identity and function ac cells, enhancing sensitivity metlastic Pan-inducing from oncogenic K.

A mouse model enabled inducible and reversible disruption showed Arida can modulate early neop in context-specific manner on timing Ar inactivation and presence oncogenic K.
Researchers investigated how social isolation affects the brain's response to stress in mice. They found that social isolation has different effects on the brain cells that respond to stress in males and females. Specifically, isolating female mice from their littermates for 24 hours changed the properties of these cells, making them less responsive to stress. In contrast, isolating males did not have this effect. However, when both males and females were subjected to physical stress, such as swimming, their brain cells responded similarly. The study suggests that social isolation, not physical stress, has sex-specific effects on brain cells that respond to stress.
Researchers have studied the protein hemoglobin (H) in mammals to understand how it adapts to different body sizes and oxygen needs. Hemoglobin is crucial for delivering oxygen to tissues, but its affinity and cooperativity (how it binds to oxygen) were thought to be the key adaptations. However, this study suggests that both factors work together to optimize oxygen delivery. By analyzing the relationship between cooperativity and affinity, the researchers found that mammalian hemoglobin values reside on a "landscape" that allows for fine-tuning oxygen delivery to meet distinct tissue needs. This reveals the mechanism behind body-size adaptation of hemoglobin in mammals. 

The study found that hemoglobin's maximum cooperativity and affinity are adjusted to meet the needs of different tissues for oxygen. Smaller animals with high metabolic rates have lower hemoglobin affinity, while larger animals have higher affinity. This shows that hemoglobin adapts to oxygen delivery to meet tissue needs. The study also found that human hemoglobin's cooperativity increases with metabolic rate and decreases affinity, supporting the idea that hemoglobin adapts to oxygen needs.
Researchers studied how Plasmodium sporozoites, the parasites that cause malaria, move and interact with blood vessels in the skin after being injected by an Anopheles mosquitoes. They used a microscope to observe sporites in mice and found that they have two types of movement. Far from blood vessels, they move quickly and freely, but near vessels, their movement is slower and more controlled. The study also found that the shape of the sporite's movement helps it to touch dermal capillaries, small blood vessels in the skin. By looking at mutant sporites with missing key proteins, they showed that the parasite's speed and ability to change its stickiness are important for exiting the injection site.

The researchers measured the speed of sporites at 5 micrometers per second, which is very fast. In this study, they looked at how sporites move over time and how they interact with blood vessels in the skin. They found changes in sporite movement over the first two hours after injection and identified a new type of movement near blood vessels. They made fluorescent sporites to study the function of two proteins, CSN and TRAP, in movement and blood recognition. CS sporites spent more time with vessels but couldn't enter blood. TR sporites moved slower and explored less area, making it harder to find vessels.

Sporite movement is crucial for infectivity. Previous studies observed sporite movement in skin but not over time. This study showed changes in the first 120 minutes after injection. Data suggest sporites change movement in response to signals and have two types: 'vascular' movement, fast and free, and 'vascular, slow near vessels. This study clarifies how sporites navigate out of skin. Mutant sporites with changed movement or speed had less blood invasion and infectivity. This shows exiting the injection site is a barrier for sporites and a good time to intervene.
Researchers studied how cells adapt to the loss of a crucial component that helps them maintain their shape and function. They removed the gene BEM1 from yeast cells and let them evolve for 100 generations. Initially, the cells without BEM1 did better than their ancestors with B1, but eventually reached 90% of their fitness. The team sequenced their genomes and found a common evolutionary path of mutations that improved polarization by inactivating proteins. This shows that cells can recover from disruptions and adapt by inactivating genes, leading to divergence in cell functions.

The study focused on how yeast cells adapt to the loss of a module that polarizes them. Cells followed a reproducible evolutionary path due to interactions between mutated genes, recovering speed and accuracy of polarization. Yeast lost 88 genes from an ancestor 100 million years ago and gained new functions by adapting existing and creating new genes. The experiment created a set of rapid polarization mechanisms. BEM1 cells had multiple polarity sites, suggesting positive feedback for a single site is weaker. Three mutations re-established efficient polarization.

B1 was deleted because it's a relatively young component in polarity and had a different role in ancestors. Deleting it revealed alternative, more ancient modules. B1 is an important polarity gene. The results show multiple regulation allows cells to polarize rapidly and adapt to disruptions. Under pressure, larger mutations inactivating proteins favor evolutionary trajectories over those altering properties.
Researchers studied how people make economic decisions by choosing between options with lasting consequences, such as investing in a house or choosing a partner. They found that the brain's rostral medial prefrontal cortex (rmFC) encodes value when accepting or rejecting a prospect into the future, suggesting it plays a role in integrating value over time. In contrast, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) encodes value when rejecting or accepting a prospect. ACC signals reflected two biases: deferring to later and weighing losses more than gains, paradoxically maximizing reward in the task. These findings provide new insights into pressures shaping economic decisions and value in the medial prefrontal cortex.

Previous studies examined neural mechanisms of economic behavior by offering independent choices or gambles. This study devised a task with decisions involving commitment to an asset with financial consequences. The aim was to understand mechanisms of economic commitments in humans and their neural implementation in medial prefrontal cortex. Commitments follow deliberation, with items considered and acceptance or rejection deferred to later. However, it's unknown whether value coding depends on accepted or rejected stimuli when choosing between options. It's also unknown how encoding in medialfrontal cortex depends on economic or non-economic decisions.

This study investigated neural mechanisms of commitment, acceptance, rejection, and deferral using a multi-altern choice task with financial ramifications. Participants chose between accepting or deferring a prospect in half of blocks. The dorsal cing cortex (ACC) encoded value when prospect excluded, while rmFC encoded during deferral. Joint consideration of data and ACC allowed pinpointing two pressures shaping decisions: deferring later and weighing unfavourable options more.
Researchers studied the role of paraspeck bodies in controlling gene expression in pituitary cells. Parasck are nuclear bodies that form around long non-coding RNA and RNA-binding proteins, and their function is not fully understood, but believed to control gene expression at post-transcription by retaining mRNA in 3-UTR inverted repeats of Alu (IRu) sequences. The study found that parasck components, including major proteins and Neat, displayed a circadian pattern in pituit cells. Inserting IRu at 3-UT of EGFP DNA led to rhythmic nuclear retention of egfp mRNA, lost when parasck were disrupted, while inserting antisense Al had weak effect. Real-time microscopy showed IRu drove circadian EGFP expression. This suggests parasck control circadian expression postcription by retaining mRNAs in nucleus.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called Munc13 plays a crucial role in controlling the function of presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) at the nerve terminals of neurons. These channels are essential for converting electrical signals into chemical signals that allow neurons to communicate with each other. The study found that M13 interacts with VGCC through a specific site on its C2 domain and this interaction affects the channels' behavior during various forms of activity. When M13 is removed or replaced with a mutated version that cannot interact with VGCC, the channels' response to high-frequency bursts of signals and calcium influx from single action potentials are altered. This suggests a new mechanism of synaptic modulation where M13 controls both vesicle priming and exocytosis, the process of releasing chemical signals.

The study shows that M13 has a significant influence on VG function and identifies a new way to control synaptic efficacy. The dependence of exocyt on calcium influx and control of VG on fast timescales implies that synaptic can be controlled by VG-active protein interactions. Many presynaptic proteins interact with VGs, but this study provides evidence that M13 interacts with VG in a way that controls calcium use on millisecond to second scales at terminals. A critical site on M13's C2 domain was pinpointed as the interaction point of contact with VG.

M13 enhances calcium influx and modulates kinetic properties of VG across stimulation conditions. This has implications for understanding how transmission is controlled. Data suggests modulation is mediated by direct VG-M13 interaction, but cannot rule out interaction with other proteins in situ that influence VG. To test significance of M13-VG interaction, the impact of removing M13 on action-driven calcium influx was examined. Expression of shRNA targeting M13 led to 94% depletion and block of exyt. VG failed to reactivate in 1.2mM Ca cells but not in M13R rescue, suggesting increase exyt during 2 ISI pulses in M13R is direct effect of lack M-VG interaction. Therefore, this site in M13 C domain mediates VG reactivation in terminals.
Researchers have studied the shape of plant cells in the epidermis, the outermost layer of plant tissue, and found that puzzle-shaped cells are a common in many plant species. These cells have a complex shape with lobes and indentations, but the purpose of this shape has been unclear. The researchers propose that this shape helps reduce mechanical stress in the cell wall of the epidermis when the tissue grows isotropically, meaning it grows in all directions equally. They tested this idea by looking at data from various plant organs and species, including Arabidopsis thaliana, and found a relationship between the shape of the cells and the growth direction of the tissue. They also used computer simulations to show that a mechanism that regulates stress in the cell can reproduce the shape of the epidermal cells. The results suggest that mechanical stress is a key driver of cell shape development.

The researchers focused on the epidermis of leaves and cotyled, which grow isotropically, and found that cells with a large surface area experience high stress. They propose that the puzzle shape of cells with lobes and indentations solves this problem, allowing cells to grow without excessive stress. They tested this by analyzing stress in a model of the cotyled epidermis of Arabidopsis thalian and found that puzzle-shaped cells are more common in isotropic organs like leaves and cotyled than in elongated organs like stems and roots. The model predicts that cells regulate their shape to prevent stress from becoming too large.

Plant cells are like balloons with turg pressure, up to 10 bar in Arabidopsis leaf cells and up to 50 in specialized cells like stomata. The researchers propose the puzzle shape is an adaptation to the mechanical forces acting on cells in the epider.
Scientists have studied how the process of splicing in human genes, which involves cutting out non-coding regions (introns) and connecting the coding regions (exons) to form a mature RNA molecule. Most genes have multiple introns, making this process complex. They investigated how introns and exons interact to form a splicing complex called the spliceosome. They used a technique to tag individual components of the spliceosome with fluorescent markers and observed how they interact with a single RNA molecule in a cell extract. They found that two components, U1 and U, bound to the start of an intron and next to the start of the next intron, work together to recruit another component, U, to the end of the intron. This interaction is important for efficient splicing of genes with multiple introns. 

 The study suggests a step-by-step process for spliceosome assembly, where U binds first, then U, in the presence of energy, binds. This is different from yeast, which has a branched pathway. In genes with multiple introns, exons can be upstream or downstream of the start of an intron, both can bind U and recruit U to the end of the intr. U can act independently or together. The researchers developed a method to observe spliceosome dynamics on individual RNA in a cell extract and found U binding to the start of an intr is not affected by U binding downstream or upstream. Spliceosomes can form in two ways: directly through intron-intron interactions or exon-exon interactions where exons are defined first, then intron-intron interactions lead to spliceosome assembly. A model suggests once a functional spliceosome forms, interactions with U downstream do not affect U binding or subsequent steps. However, the mechanism was unclear. The study used tagged proteins in human cells and found a major contributor to accurate splicing is collaboration between exons at the start of introns, increasing U recruitment to the spliceosome.
Researchers have discovered a new way that proteins are folded in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum (ER) receive help from enzymes called chaperones. They found that the Wnt signaling coreceptor LRP6 is folded with the help of ubiquitination, a process where a molecule called ubiquitin is attached to a specific part of the protein. This helps LRP6 avoid being destroyed and allows it to exit the ER. The ubiquitin is then removed by another enzyme called USP19, a process similar to how proteins are folded in the ER's lumen. If LRP6 is successfully folded, it is palmitoylated and exported, but if not, it is polyubiquinated and targeted for destruction. This system also helps other proteins like CF and anthrax receptor 2, which are involved in human diseases.
Researchers investigated sex differences in learning and decision-making processes in mice using a classic value-based decision task, the restless two-armed bandit. Male and female mice had similar accuracy, but achieved this performance through different patterns of exploration. Males made more exploratory choices overall, getting stuck in exploration once started, while females explored less but learned more quickly. These results suggest sex influences decision-making during learning and exploration, not stable choices. Exploration is altered in people with addictions, depression, and neurodevelopmental disabilities, pinpointing exploration as a translational avenue for sex-modulated vulnerability to psychiatric diagnoses.

A study examined sex differences in exploration, training mice on an explore/exploit task, a restless-armed band. Males showed higher exploration than females throughout. Computational tools characterized sex differences in latent variables underlying behavior, a key process regulating reward-guided behaviors: exploration and exploitation. In an uncertain world, balance rewarding options and exploring alternatives. Results of HMM and RL models revealed sex differences exploration, paralleled by learning rates. How explore-exploit, reward, and outcomes interact to influence choices is unclear.

A combination of modeling characterized sex differences in explore/exploit task. Males and females had similar performance, but used different strategies to learn the environment. Post-hoc win-lose analyses found females displayed more win-st behaviors, repeating behaviors that produced reward on previous trial.
Researchers have investigated how proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and degraded by the proteasome. They found that a protein called Doa10 acts as a membrane retrolocase, helping to extract proteins from the membrane. Do10 interacts with the protein's transmembrane segment and moves it into the aqueous phase. The protein's luminal segments then cross the membrane in an unfolded state and are unfolded on the luminal side by the cytoplasmic C48. This shows how Do10 cooperates with C48 in extracting proteins with folded luminal domains.
In Drosophila, the Hedgehog (H) protein induces transcriptional changes in target cells by inhibiting the proteolytic processing of full-length Ci or Gli proteins to nuclear repressors and activating full Ci or Gli proteins. Researchers investigated the contributions of these mechanisms to dose-dependent H signaling in Drosila wing imaginal discs using Ci variants expressed at physiological levels. Results showed that Ci variants that cannot be processed supported a normal pattern of graded gene activation and development of adults with normal morphology when supplemented with constitutive Ci repressor, indicating H can signal normally in the absence of regulated processing. Processing-resistant Ci variants were also activated in the absence of H by elimination of Cos2, likely through binding the CORD of Ci or PK, revealing inhibitory roles of these components in addition to their established roles in promoting processing.

Hedgehog (H) signaling guides development and maintains tissue homeostasis in invertebrates and vertebrates. Abnormal H production, distribution, and responses cause developmental defects and cancer, including holoprosencephaly, limb abnormalities, medulloblastoma, and basal carcinoma. Processing-resistant Ci variants also supported development adults with normal wing patterning, provided constitutive Ci repressor suppressed ectopic dpp in anterior cells. Ci mediates normal H morph action in discs absence regulated processing.

In third instar Drosila wing discs, H is expressed posterior cells and Ci anterior, H signals band anterior-posterior (AP) border declining posterior-anterior. Results show wing pattering H not require regulation repressor or full Ci processing. Animals lacking Fu and Su develop normal, although late instar discs lack En induction.
Researchers have identified a specific type of neuron in the spinal cord called calretinin (CR) positive interneurons that play a crucial role in transmitting pain signals. These neurons form a network that can amplify pain signals and relay them to other neurons in the spinal cord called lamina I projection neurons. When activated, these CR interneurons cause pain behavior in animals, which can be blocked by morphine, and are associated with a place aversion and enhanced by nerve injury. Inhibiting these neurons increases sensory thresholds, suggesting they are important for pain generation and amplification. The study used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate CR interneurons in the spinal cord and found they are interconnected, forming a network that can initiate and sustain excitatory signaling. This network is positioned to alter sensory information before it reaches the brain. The results confirm CRneurons contribute to pain signaling and amplify signals in the absence of peripheral input. Future work is needed to determine how these circuits respond to peripheral sensory processing.
Researchers studied the role of Ras-associated protein 23 (RAB23) in bone development, particularly in the formation of the skull. Mutations in the AB gene cause Carpenter syndrome, characterized by abnormal bone and skull development, including polydactyly (extra fingers and toes) and craniosynostosis (premature fusion of skull bones). To understand how AB regulates bone development, the researchers created mice lacking AB that survived long enough to study bone development. These mice had polyactly and premature fusion of skull bones due to abnormal bone cell growth and excessive bone formation. The researchers found that signaling pathways, driven by growth factor 10 (FGF10) and its receptor 1 (FGFR1) were elevated in AB-deficient mice, leading to an imbalance in other signaling pathways, including hedgehog (H) and RUN2. Inhibiting FR1 signaling normalized bone cell growth and reduced bone gene expression, preventing craniosynosis. The study suggests AB as a negative regulator of FR and H signaling, and non-canonical regulation of GL1 through FR1. 

The researchers generated AB-deficient mice that survived to embryonic day 18.5 to investigate AB's role in bone formation. Similar to Carpenter syndrome, these mice had polyactly and craniosynosis. Disruption of AB led to upregulation of Pit2, F10, and FRb, decreased p38 and enhanced FR1-RUN2 signaling with increased bone cell growth. AB regulates the stem cell marker GL1, represses H, and inhibits cell expansion. AB also repress F10-driven FR1 signaling, affecting cell development and RUN2 differentiation and repressing GL1. AB coordinates bone formation by regulating FR1-R2 activity and GL1 activation. AB controls bone and patency through three mechanisms: F10-FR1 signaling, repression of H through canonical pathway, and repression GL1 by FR1. GL contributes to regulation of stem cell niche F10-FR1 and H-GL1 signaling regulate cell proliferation.
Researchers investigated how the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) maintains epigenetic repression of genes in plants and animals by modifying chromatin at its targets. They monitored the expression of two copies of the Arabidopsis Polycomb target FLOW LOCUS C (FLC) in the same plants and found that one copy can be repressed while the other is active, and this mixed state is inherited through cell divisions as plants develop. This demonstrates that epigen memory of FL expression is stored in cis, not trans, meaning it is stored in the chrom environment of the gene itself, not in diffusible factors.

The study used the epigenetic process of vernalization in Arabidopsis, which is the acceleration of flowering following prolonged cold exposure, mediated by cold-induced epigen repression of the Poly target and floral repressor FLC. Vernal has been observed in imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation. Imprinting involves DNA methylation and X-chromosome inactivation involves changes in chromatin structure and nuclear positioning. The question remained whether Poly-repressed chromatin at a gene can store epigen memory.

The researchers developed an assay to visualize mitotic heritability of FL expression at single-cell level and crossed F-merry to F-Venus to generate hybrids carrying single copy each. In trans memory, only heritable states are ON/ON and OFF/OFF because epigen information is stored as diffus signal. F repression requires PR2 but is independent DNA methylation, making a system for studying cis-memory capability of Poly at single. Vernal plants FL is bistable, with number cells repressed increasing with duration prior exposure.
Researchers studied the structure and function of BiP, a type of chaperone that helps maintain protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They found that BiP forms oligomers, which are groups of two or more Bi molecules that interact with each other. These oligomers have a different structure and function compared to single Bi molecules. The researchers used techniques such as site-specific proteolysis and cross-linking to study the architecture of Bi oligomers and found that they consist of adjacent protomers engaging the interdomain linker of one molecule in the substrate site of another, which attenuates the chaper function of Bi. This means that oligomers are relatively inactive compared to single Bi.

 Native gel electrophoresis revealed a rapid modulation between the burden of unfolded proteins and Bi oligomers and slower equilibration between oligomers and inactive, covalently-modified Bi. Lumen ER depletion caused rapid oligization of mammalian Bi and coincidental diminution in substrate, pointing the relative inertness of oligomers. This suggests that equil between inactive oligomers and active monomeric Bi is poised to buffer fluctuations ER protein load on a rapid timescale neither by interversion of active covalently-modified Bi nor the unfolded response.

Bi oligization is tuned to the physiological state of the cell, and oligization inactivates Bi protomers. The olig form is a relatively inactive storage of chaper that is accessible on short scale. The findings are consistent with a model where competition between oligization and binding buffers ER against fluctuations in protein in both directions. The affinity of Hsp proteins for substrates is governed by protein driven-equilibrium mechanisms, which could account for Bi favoring itself as client over others as Ca2 ER declines.
Researchers have determined the near-atomic structure of a filamentous plant virus, Pepino mosaic virus (PepMV), at 3.9 Å resolution using cryo-electron microscopy. This virus is a representative of the Potexvirus family, which includes economically important plant pathogens. The study reveals the structure of its coat protein (CP) and its interactions with viral RNA. The overall fold of PepMV CP is similar to that of nucleoproteins (NPs) from the Phlebovirus family, a group of enveloped ssRNA viruses. The main difference between Potv CP and Phlev NP lies in their C-terminal extensions, which determine distinct multimer assembly characteristics. Surprisingly, a structural homology was found between flexuous viruses and Phle NP, a group of enveloped ssRNA viruses. NPs are associated with viral genome in ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) inside an envelope, constructed by glycoproteicosahedral shell. Flexible viruses are plant pathogens with significant impact on agriculture. Their particles are non-enveloped, rod-shaped virions with hundreds of CP in helical arrangement protecting +ssRNA. High-resolution structures of flexuous plant viruses correspond to Potvirus family, including current and previous structures of PapMV and BaMV. The study suggests gene transfer between eukaryotic and ssRNA viruses.
Researchers have developed a new method, called Site, to accurately locate the binding sites of antibodies on the surface of cells with nanometer precision. This is important for understanding how the immune system works and developing therapeutic antibodies and vaccines. Current methods are time-consuming and not suitable for high-throughput analysis. The new method uses topological averaging of high-resolution images to determine the distance between a bound antibody and a reference point on the cell surface, achieving nan-scale resolution in one dimension. It can be applied to other molecular estimations as well. The method was tested on antibody binding to a protein on bacteria and agreed with previous results. It can be used on non-spherical cells due to their varying morphology.
Researchers have investigated how the body adapts to low oxygen levels of oxygen, a condition known as hypoxia, and the role of peripheral tissues, such as the skin, in this response. They found that the skin plays a crucial role in regulating blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature in response to low oxygen levels. This is the first time a peripheral tissue has been shown to directly influence the body's cardiovascular response to low oxygen.

The study focused on the skin, a tissue with a large blood supply, and how it responds to low oxygen levels. They found that a key protein, HIF-1, in skin cells is essential for the body's response to low oxygen. Mice without this protein had lower skin temperature and blood pressure compared to those with it. The researchers used a 10% oxygen challenge, a moderate level of low oxygen, and found that mice without H-1 had changes in blood pressure and temperature compared to those with it.

The study showed that H-1 and another protein, H-2, in skin cells affect the body's immediate and long-term response to low oxygen. Low oxygen increases blood flow to the skin by widening blood vessels and then reduces it by narrowing them. The researchers proposed a model of how the body responds to low oxygen, involving these proteins and nitric oxide in the skin.
Researchers have developed a new method to map the connections between individual neurons in the brain with high precision. They used a technique called optogenetics, which involves using light to activate specific neurons. This is done by using a protein called channelrhodinodopsin (ChR) that responds to light and triggers electrical signals in neurons. The team improved this method by focusing the light on the cell body of the neuron, called the soma, and its closest branches, called dendrites, rather than the entire area around it. This allowed them to reliably activate individual neurons and measure the connections between them using a technique called patch-clamp electrophysiology.

The previous optogen methods had limitations, such as activating nearby fibers or branches of the neuron, which responded to the light. This made it hard to target single neurons specifically. The new method overcomes this by restricting ChR expression to the soma and proximal dendrites, making it more precise. This is important for understanding how neurons connect and communicate, which is key to understanding brain function and behavior.
Researchers have re-examined how two transcription factors, Sox2 and Oct4, interact with DNA in living cells. Previous studies suggested they assembled on DNA in a specific order, but a new analysis shows this is not the case. Instead, the two factors exhibit "negative reciprocity", meaning Sox2 increases Oct's binding to DNA but decreases Oct's binding to Sox2. This is unexpected and suggests complexity in how transcription factors interact with DNA. Single-molecule methods, like those used by Chen et al, provide new capabilities to study these interactions.

The study found that Sox and Oct sometimes help and hinder each other across the genome, contradicting previous findings by Chen et al. This highlights the need to know more about how transcription factors interact across the genome to interpret single-molecule data. The analysis reveals the possibility of energy expenditure in Sox and Oct's action on DNA, a new concept not previously found in living cells. Single-molecule methods offer exciting capabilities to unravel such mechanisms.

The variation in cooperativity across the genome has significant implications. It shows single-molecule data, combined with Chen's strategy, provides more information than expected. A single number, -0.22, indicates Sox and Oct exhibit both positive and negative cooperativity across loci in vivo. The genomic-divers model suggests either energy expenditure or mixed cooperativity, with Sox and Oct helping each other at some loci and hindering at others.
Researchers have discovered that fruit flies can detect and avoid bacterial toxins called lipopolysaccharides (LPS) before they cause infection. These toxins are important signals for the immune system to recognize infection, but it's unclear if animals can sense them before infection. The study found that fruit flies display strong aversive responses to L and that gustatory neurons expressing Gr66 bitter receptors mediate avoidance of L in feeding and egg-laying assays. The expression of the chemosensory channel TRPA1 in these cells is necessary and sufficient for L avoidance. L stimulates flies' neurons in a TR1-dependent manner and activates exogenous TR1 channels in human cells. This demonstrates that flies detect bacterial toxins via a gustatory pathway through TR1 activation, a conserved mechanism.

The study shows that L is avoided during feeding and oviposition and TR1 expression in bitter-sensing neurons is necessary for L avoidance. Data indicate a TR1 mechanism of L avoidance may prevent infection with Gram-negative bacteria. Flies that lack TR1 preferred laying eggs on uncontaminated food over contaminated with E. coli. The channel TR1 mediates acute responses to L in mice and avoidance of bitter compounds in flies. Researchers tested if TR1 mediates gustatory L avoidance in flies. Blocking transmission in neurons by tetanus toxin abolished L avoidance, indicating flies detect L through gustatory. Data demonstrate flies possess a gustatory mechanism for L detection and avoidance. Avoiding L-contaminated food during feeding and oviposition may prevent Gram bacterial infections, compensating for lack of immunity in animals. The sensory mechanism exploits TR1 suggests a principle where channels play a role in L detection by neurons in flies and mammals, regardless of modality.
Researchers have identified a zinc finger protein called Zfp335 as essential for the formation of naïve T cells, a type of immune cell crucial for immune function. Mice with a hypomorphic mutation in Zfp exhibit a deficiency in naïve T cells due to a developmental defect starting in the thymus and continuing in the periphery, affecting cells that have recently left the thymus. The effects of Zfp are widespread and cannot be attributed to altered thym selection, proliferation, or Bcl-dependent survival. Zfp binds to promoter regions with a specific motif and targets genes related to metabolism, mitochondrial function, and transcription regulation. Restoring one target, An2, partially rescues cell maturation. These findings identify Zfp as a transcription factor and regulator of late-stage intrathym and post-thym cell maturation.

A study analyzed mice with a hypomorphic missense mutation in a2 zinc finger of Zfp, revealing a selective defect in accumulation of naïve cells from maturation in thymocytes and recent thymigrants. Zfp regulates transcription by binding to promoters of target genes. A set of Zfp targets in thym and evidence decreased Zfp occupancy alters expression in mutant thym. Together, findings show Zfp functions as a factor and regulator of transcription required for cell maturation.

A target of Zfp is An2, and its dysregulation by Z335 contributes to mat defect in bl/bl T cells. An2 transcript levels in thym and naïve cell populations from bl/+ and bl/bl mice were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. Western blot for An2 protein in wild-type and mutant thym with actin as control. An2 is a target of Zfp and its dysregulation by Z335 contributes to mat defect in bl/bl T cells.
Researchers have found a new way to control protein levels in bacteria and archaea by avoiding interactions between messenger RNA (mRNA) and non-coding RNA (ncRNA). This is important because mRNA and protein levels are not always perfectly correlated, and some of the discrepancy can be explained by mRNA features such as codon usage and secondary structure. The new factor, called mRNAnc avoidance, increases translational efficiency and is selected for across prokaryotes, and has a greater impact on protein abundance than mRNA structure or cod usage. By creating variant green fluorescent protein (GFP) mRNAs with different potential for mRNAnc interactions, researchers found that GFP levels correlate with avoidance. This means that taking mRNAnc interactions into account enables precise modulation of protein levels.

 Studies showed that 97% of species have reduced interactions between mRNAs compared to controls. Variant GFP mRNAs with different interaction potential were used to demonstrate that expression can be predicted and controlled. Results show strong selection for avoidance of mRNAnc interactions across proaryotes. A property called "intrinsic avoidance" of mRNAnc interactions was measured, but may fail to identify genuine cases with extreme G content differences between RNAs. Measuring intrinsic using shuffled mRN as controls, found mRNAnc interactions are underrepresented in 73% of proary phyla (p<0.05). Results establish selection acts to minimize mRNAnc interactions. However, with thousands of interacting RNAs in simple proary systems, complete avoidance is combinatorially unlikely, suggesting a trade-off between avoidance and expression.

Avoidance is as good an explanation of protein variation as cod usage and mRNA structure. Results indicate cstalk between mRN and ncRN impact protein levels. Taking cstalk into account enables design of constructs where protein levels can be controlled. Meta-analysis of proteomics and transcriptomics data showed correlation between mRNA and nc avoidance. mRNAs with low avoidance produce fewer proteins per transcript than those with high avoidance.
Researchers studied the progression of motor unit (MU) loss in a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using in vivo imaging of single axons and neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) over a three-month period. They found that motor units are dismantled asynchronously in SOD1G37 mice, with weeks prior to axonal degeneration, the dismantling of axonal branches is accompanied by contemporaneous axonal sprouting resulting in synapse formation onto NMJs. Denervation events tend to propagate from the first NMJ, consistent with a contribution of neuromuscular factors extrinsic to motor neurons, with distal branches being more susceptible. These results show that NM denervation in ALS is a complex process of continuous denervation and innervation rather than a manifestation of global motor degeneration.

The study reveals a previously unsuspected dynamism at the NM in an animal model of ALS, highlighting a temporal window between branch-specific dismantling and motor ax degeneration that could be therapeutically exploited. However, rescue of neuronal loss in S1 mice does not necessarily improve NM denervation, suggesting local-specific events may play a role in NM denervation. Local alterations of synaptic and molecular function occur early at NM in ALS. The researchers used longitudinal in vivo imaging of motor axonal arbors and NM to assess the course and dynamics of changes during progression, predicting a MU-dependent mechanism would result in synchronous degeneration of the MU, while local neuromus changes result in asynchronous loss of NM within a MU.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by upper and lower motor neuron loss. Loss of neuromus junctions is a key event in ALS patients and animal models. Den of NM is observed prior symptom onset.
Researchers studied the effects of tamoxifen, a medication used to treat breast cancer, on mice to understand why it causes side effects such as hot flashes, changes in bone density, and fatigue in patients. They found that mice treated with tamifen experienced changes in temperature, bone density, and movement. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed tamifen induced gene changes in the hypothalamus and preoptic area (hypothalamus-PO) of the brain. These changes were dependent on estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), as knocking out ER in the hypothalam-PO blocked or reversed tamifen gene expression. ER-deficient mice did not exhibit tamifen changes in temperature, bone, or movement. The study provides insight into tamifen effects on the hypothalam-PO and that ER mediates several physiological effects of tamifen in mice. 

Tamifen expression in hypoth-PO is necessary for tamifen changes in gene expression in hypoth- and effects on thermoregulation, bone, movement. Findings suggest tam treatment modulates ER signaling in the nervous system to alter fundamental aspects of health. ER mediates many aspects of physiology, and ER knockout transcript effects of tamifen, researchers asked if loss ER would affect physiological responses to tamifen in mice. Body temperature, movement, and density were measured in ER1KO mice and wild-type animals. ER primarily regulates physical activity in mice. Tamifen may act as ER antagonist in estrogen-sensitive regions to suppress activity in mice. Tamifen has profound effects on bone remodeling. The study defines cell and mechanisms of undesirable effects of tam therapy. Tam administration in mice increases dissipation, decreases movement, increases density. Studies reveal effects of tam treatment on hypothalam- and implicate ER signaling as major mediator of effects on thermg, movement, homeasis.
Researchers have discovered that a protein called IS15 plays a crucial role in fighting off Listeria monocytogenes infection. IS15 is a type of protein that is produced in response to viral infections, but its role in bacterial infections was not well understood. The study found that IS15 is produced in non-aggressive cells when they are infected with Lister, and this production is not dependent on a specific type of protein called interferon. Instead, it is triggered by the cell's surveillance system that senses bacterial DNA signals. This system involves proteins called STING, TBK, IRF, and IR7. Importantly, the study showed that IS15 restricts Lister infection in lab and animal tests. To understand how IS works, researchers used a method called stable isotope labeling in culture to identify proteins that are modified by IS. Surprisingly, they found that IS modifies proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, which leads to increased secretion of cytokines that counteract infection. Overall, the study reveals a new function of IS15 in fighting Lister infection and highlights its importance in the immune response.

The study found that IS is produced in non-ag cells when infected with Lister, and this production is not dependent on interferon. Instead, it is triggered by the cell's surveillance system that senses bacterial signals. This system involves proteins STING, TBK, IRF, and IR7. The study showed that IS restricts Lister in lab and animal tests. Researchers used a method to identify proteins modified by IS and found that modify endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi, leading to increased cytokines that counteract infection.
Researchers have developed a new software called DeepRET, an automated tool for analyzing single-molecule Förster Resonance energy transfer (smRET) data using deep learning. smRET is a method for studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules. However, the growth of high-throughput and commercial instrumentation has outpaced the development of standardized and automated methods to analyze the large amounts of data produced. DeepRET is an open-source, standalone solution based on deep learning that requires minimal human intervention from raw images to histograms of biomolecule behavior. It integrates features of smRET analysis and outputs common kinetic metrics. The accuracy on ground truth data reached 95%, outperforming human operators and commonly used threshold, requiring ~1% of time. Its rapid operation on real data demonstrates DeepRET's capacity to quantify biomolecular dynamics and contribute to benchmarking smRET for structural biology.

DeepRET uses a pre-trained neural network to analyze smRET data. The software operates with minimal human intervention and requires a threshold on data quality as an initial step to output quantification of dynamic from images. It comes as a free executable for Windows and Mac users with limited programming skills to operate. Deep-based analysis has advantages over other approaches: recognizes patterns and learns features from raw data, allowing routines without extensive preprocessing or empirically rules, and reproducible evaluation single-molecule; faster than human for large-datasets; comes close.

The classification was achieved without preprocessing or post-inspection data, illustrating DeepRET's power to operate without interventions and potential benchmark reproducibility smRET methods multiple laboratories. A confusion matrix quantified the discord between truth and classified by DeepRET (Figure 3). The software is expected to enable fully automated methodologies biomolecular recognition, protein folding, and resolution, increasing the breadth of single-molecule studies in structural biology.
Researchers have identified a protein called SCML2 that plays a crucial role in regulating gene expression by working with a complex called Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1). SC2 is a mammalian version of a protein found in fruit flies called SCM, which is part of the Polycomb group that associates with PR1. The study found that SC2A, an isoform of SC2 tightly associated with chromatin, contributes to PR1 localization and repression of certain Polycomb target genes. SC2 binds to PR1 through its S domain and interacts with non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) through a novel-binding region called R. Targeting SC2 to chromatin involves the action of MB domains, RNA binding, and interaction with PR1 through S domain. Deletion of R reduces SC2 occupancy at target genes and overexpression of mutant SC2 lacking R causes PR recruitment defects.

 SC2 appears to enforce repression at a subset of genes independent of PR1 via mechanisms to be elucidated. The identification of SC2 as a Polycomb protein that binds and contributes to repression of Poly targets sheds light on interplay between ncRN and epigenetic regulation and combinator factors that drive specificity of Poly complexes in different contexts. Results show RNA also plays role in SC2 function as required for localization to chrom. In flies, interaction of SCM and PR relies on C-terminal S domain, and results show similar mechanism conserved in humans.

Data support a model where R contributes localization of SC2 to chrom, where interacts PR and creates chrom environment refractory to transcription. SCM is Poly protein binds at least Poly target in flies. A novel R in SC2 contributes chrom localization with recognition methylated lysines by MB domain, RNA activity R required to recruit or stabilize SC on chrom. SC2 retained target genes through interaction PR and contributes stabilizing PR. Experiments conclude SC2 recruited subset through process requires RNA activity and presence mutant SC2R not chrom-bound causes release BMI and presumably PR from chrom.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of ribosome stalling by SecM, a protein that regulates the Sec-dependent secretion pathway in E. coli. coli. They used cryo-EM structures of Sec-stalled ribosomes at 3.3-3.7 Å resolution to reveal two distinct stalling mechanisms at different elongation steps of the translation cycle. One mechanism is the inactivation of the ribosomal peptid-transfer center, which inhibits peptide formation with incoming proly-tRNA. The other is prolonged pept-RNA residence at the A site, inhibiting full tRNA translocation. These findings demonstrate control of translation by regulatory peptides through dynamic reshaping of the ribosomal center.

To understand Sec-dependent stalling, researchers purified Sec-stalled ribosome nascent complexes using in vitro translation from E. coli and analyzed using single cryoEM. Their analysis of rib-Sec interactions at atomic level revealed two mechanisms of stalling and details of Sec nas peptide modulation in steps. Previous studies showed ribosomes stalled through different ways, including antibiotics.

Structural analysis of SecM within the ribosomal tunnel shows interactions promote conformation rearrangements of 23 rRNA nucleotides U5, U6, and A2, locking the PTC in inactive state. Two forms of stalled ribosomes, post-state and rotated, indicate interactions between Sec and tunnel induce conformation changes P, leading to translation arrest at elongation steps, including peptide-bond and tRNA trans. The tRNAas peptide of Sec-tRNA is similar to active rib with PTC. Comparison with states capable or incapable peptide-b formation provides alternative Sec-induced st in Sec-G-R.
Researchers used an advanced imaging technique called Adaptive Optics Scanning Ophthalmoscopy to examine the cone cells in the fovea, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp vision, in 28 eyes of 16 people. They found that the density of cone cells in the fove increases with eye length, but not in proportion to the length of the eye. This means that myopic eyes, which are shorter than average, have a higher density of cone cells in the fove compared to emmetropic eyes, which are average length. This could lead to better visual acuity in myopes. However, previous studies suggested that myopic vision deficits were due to increased spacing between cone cells caused by stretching of the retina during myopia. The study found that this is not the case, as myopes have a higher angular density of cone in the fove compared to emmetropes.

The study aimed to investigate how the length of the eye affects cone density at the fove center. Two types of densities were discussed: angular and linear. Previous studies found that myopes have higher fove photoreceptor sampling, leading to better performance on visual tasks compared to emropes. The simplest explanation for visual deficits in myopes was increased cone separation caused by retinal stretching. However, this was ruled out by the study.

Adaptive optics offers high-quality images of the fove photore mosaic in vivo. Despite advances, previous studies investigating packing and length did not make measurements at the fove center, the most important for vision but difficult to image due to small size. If the retinal image enlargement matched the cone stretching, eyes of different lengths would sample the field similarly. However, myopes generally attain good acuity with correction.
Researchers have identified the genetic factors that contribute to the duration of pneumocococcal carriage in the nasopharynx, a prerequisite for invasive disease in infants, particularly in low-income settings. They developed a model to calculate carriage duration from longitudinal swab data and combined it with whole genome sequence data, finding that pneumoccal genomic variation accounted for 63% of the variation, while host traits like age and previous carriage accounted for less than 5%. The heritability was partitioned into lineage and locus effects, with serotype (17%), drug-resistance (9%), and other locus (7%) being the largest sources of variation. A genome-wide association study identified prophage sequences associated with decreased carriage, independent of serotype, potentially disrupting the competence mechanism. This supports theoretical models of pneumoccal competition and resistance. 

The study found that genetic factors other than serotype affect carriage, consistent with previous work, and identified candidates for loci fulfilling this role. Variants in the pneumoccal genome alter carriage, linked to antibiotic resistance. Despite host factors like age affecting duration, sequence variation explains most variability. Serotypes and erythromycin resistance cause some effect, as well as prophage presence/absence in the genome. Prophage has a significant effect on carriage, with implications for pneumoc genome diversification through frequent loss during carriage. The genetics of S pneumonia is a factor in determining duration in this population.
Researchers have investigated the stoichiometry of the slow rectifier (IK) channel, a crucial for cardiac repolarization, composed of the tetrameric voltage-gated channel KCQ1 and its β-subunit KC1. Studies have reported either a strict 2:4 or variable up to 4:4 stoichiometry. To clarify this, the researchers created fusion proteins linking KC1 to one, two, or four KC1 subunits to reproduce 4:4, 2:4, or 1:4 stoichiometries. Whole-cell and single-channel recordings showed that two or four KC1 subunits had hyperpolarized activation, reduced conductance, and shorter latency compared to one, abolished by KC1 addition. Using unnatural amino acid crosslinking, they found that two and four KC1 crosslink rates were slowed compared to KC1, demonstrating no intrinsic limit to four β-subunit association within the IK complex. This suggests flexibility in KC1 association allows modulation of repolarization in the heart through changes in expression.
Researchers have studied the process of tissue regeneration in zebraf fish, specifically focusing on the role of interleukin-1 beta (Ilb) in fin regeneration. They found that Ilb is produced by myoid cells, but also by epithelial cells in response to injury, initiating an inflammatory response. Macrophages are necessary for survival of regenerative cells and resolution of inflammation. Ilb regulates expression of regeneration-induced genes. The study shows Ilb and inflammation act as a double-edged sword, required for regeneration but impairing it in excess. Macrophages attenuate Ilb expression and inflammation during tissue regeneration. The researchers demonstrated Ilb is provided by epidermal cells in response to injury and that apoptosis occurs if Ilb action is prolonged. Macroph are responsible for attenuation of Ilb expression and resolution of inflammation. Data suggest normal Ilb and inflammatory response are necessary for tissue regeneration to activate regeneration genes. The study highlights Ilb and inflammatory response in tissue regeneration, with proper levels tuned by macroph necessary for progression.
Researchers studied how the movement of proteins in the cytoplasm of three types of bacteria: Escherichia coli, Lactoccus lactis, and Haloaxii volcanii. They found that the speed of protein movement depends on the charge and distribution of the protein, with positive proteins moving up to 100 times slower than negative ones in E coli. coli. This effect is weaker in L lactis and H. volcanii due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in mobility is caused by interaction of positive proteins with ribosomes, as shown in vivo measurements and confirmed in vitro with purified ribosomes. Ribosome properties may limit the composition of the cytoplasm proteome.

The study used surface-modified fluorescent proteins (FPs) to determine translational coefficients in the cytoplasm of the bacteria. In E. coli, the diffusion coefficient depends on the net charge and distribution of the protein, with positive proteins diffusing up to 100 times slower than negative ones. This effect is weaker in L. lact and H.ii due to electrostatic screening. The decrease in mobility is mainly caused by binding of positive proteins to ribosomes, with KD on the order of µM, showing non-selective interactions are not weak. Ribosome properties may limit the composition of the cytoplasm proteome.

In L. lact and H.ii, the slowdown in diffusion with increasing surface charge is less than E. coli due to electrostatic. The decrease in coefficient is caused by binding of proteins to ribosomes, with KD on the order of µ, showing non-selective interactions are not weak. Ribosome properties may limit the composition of cytopl proteome.

The researchers also found that diffusion of proteins in the cytopl of E. coli depends on net and distribution of charge over protein, with positive moving up 100 times slower. Diffusion becomes slower when cells exposed to osmotic shift. L. lact and H. proteins not only diffuse slowly but binding to ribosomes also inhibit synthesis, affecting assembly or activity of ribosomes. There are 18 ribosomal in E. coli with net charge more than. If findings on GFP are transferable to ribosomal, rib experience drop in diffusion more than 5.

The study analyzed proteomes of E. L. L. H. and four endosymbiotic bacteria to determine how protein will diffuse in light composition proteome, knowing net and abundances all components, and how ribosomes affect diffusion constituents, knowing net proteins. Many biological processes depend on interactions macromolecules and ability find each other translational, especially in proary absence active cytoplasm transport.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the ability of certain animals, such as planarians, to regenerate lost body parts, but the mechanisms behind this process remain unclear. Planarians can regenerate entire bodies and respond differently to wounds depending on the extent of tissue loss. A key question is how these distinct responses are triggered. Researchers identified a protein, S-follatin, required for planarian regeneration. Sollatin blocks responses to missing tissue but not normal tissue turnover. Two activin proteins, S-activ-1 and Sactiv-2, are needed for Soll phenotype. Soll is wound-induced and expressed at higher levels following injuries causing tissue loss. These findings suggest Soll inhibits activin proteins to trigger regeneration after injuries involving missing tissue and identify a mechanism for initiation across the kingdom.

A study found Soll required for molecular and cellular responses to missing tissue during regeneration. Follatin inhibition of activin signaling is necessary for regeneration to occur, with Soll expression controlled by extent of tissue following injury. A gene encoding a T-β inhibitor, follatin, is required for regeneration and regeneration-specific responses. Data suggest inhibition of activin by S is required for regenerative response following major injury. Soll is wound-induced, with levels persisting high following major injury.

Planarians have distinct programs for simple and missing tissue injuries. Despite differences, T-β plays a role in many regenerations. Uncovering missing signals in planarians, how interact with activin, and factors regulated by these will inform regenerative mechanisms. All animals face injury and require regenerative mechanisms. Planarians exceptional regenerative potential. Distinct cellular and molecular for simple vs missing exist. In substantial injuries, animals unique mitotic and apoptotic and wound gene expression. Wound-induced fst allows regenerative as consequence of tissue. Fst is first required regeneration-specific in planarians. Not missing responses abolished following inhibition. Neoblast migration amputation occurred normally fst RNA, despite absence proliferative response.
Researchers have identified a unique genetic signature in tumors that are deficient in mismatch repair (MMR), a process that corrects DNA errors during replication. This signature is distinct from other tumors and surprisingly similar to normal human genetic variation, indicating that many genetic changes occur due to errors in MMR. The study also found a set of repeated mutations that can detect microsatellite instability (MSI), a hallmark of MMR-deficient tumors. Using endometrial tumors with proven MMR deficiency, a new marker was developed that detects MSI with greater specificity and sensitivity than standard tests. Additionally, the study found that MMR-deficient tumors have reduced ability to repair double-strand breaks, making them sensitive to treatments that induce these breaks.

Whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing was used to analyze 28 tumor-normal pairs, 22 of which were MMR-deficient. The study found 201 somatic mutations in M-deficient tumors, 52-fold more than M-proficient. Validation of indels was 87% and 86% for substitutions. Focusing on clinical relevance of indel patterns to diagnose MSI, it was found that indels affected homopolymer stretches, relevant to the Bethesda panel of microsat and hommer markers. Ex-sequencing tumor and germ DNA at average coverage 44 revealed each M-def tumor contained 5 somatic events 39 for M-prof.
Researchers have developed a new tool called "Magnets" that allows for precise and non-invasive control of biological processes in cells. Magnets are small modules engineered from a protein called Vivid, which can be activated by light. They consist of two components, nMag and pMag, that are well-tolerated as fusion partners and require simultaneous photoactivation to interact, enabling spatiemporal confinement of dimer with a single wavelength. However, Magn require concatization for efficient responses and preincation at 28°C to be functional. The researchers overcame these limitations by engineering an optimized Magn pair, called eags, that require neither concatization nor preinc.

The eags were validated by using them to rapidly and reversibly recruit proteins to subcellular organelles, induce organel contacts, and reconstitute OS-VAP-ERgi tether implicated in phosphatidyositol-4-phosphate transport metabolism. eags represent an effective tool to optogen manipulate physiological processes over cells or small subcell volumes. The eags have greater thermal stability and dimer efficiency as well as faster association and dissociation kinetics compared to the original Magn. They were effective in a variety of applications including protein recruitment to different organel, generation of organel sites, and rapid reconstitution of V-dependent organel teth that have regulatory functions in transport.

The eags were engineered by introducing complementary charges to the Viv dimer interface, using the structure of lightactivated dimer as a guide, and mitochondrial as a testbed. They offer advantages over other systems in different assays. e have rapid and dissociation kinetics and require both monomers undergo light activation to dimer. These properties make background of e low, making them suited optogen modulation small and subcell organel.
Researchers have investigated the effects of ribosome stalling, a process where translation is halted during protein synthesis, on neurons. They used mice with a genetic mutation that causes ribosomes to stall at specific codons, leading to neurodegeneration. The study found increased phosphorylation of eIFα, a key protein involved in translation, and activation of ATF, a transcription factor in the integrated stress response pathway. This pathway was triggered by GC2, an e2 kinase, in a tRNA-independent manner. Activation of this pathway reduced neurodegeneration in the mice, highlighting the importance of cellular context in the outcome. The study shows a link between translation elongation and initiation in regulating neuron survival during stress.

 Ribosome stalling activates GC2, a previously unknown mechanism linking elongation and initiation of translation. In neurons, failure to resolve stalled complexes leads to degeneration, but the pathways triggered by these complexes were unknown. The study found GC2 activates the integrated stress response in mice with stalled ribosomes, demonstrating a feedback between elongation defects and initiation. In mice without GC2, degeneration of specific neurons was observed, suggesting the e2/ATF pathway is vital for survival during stalling. Activation also occurred in mice with no tRNA production, raising the possibility stalling contributes to GC2 activation in other conditions, such as amino acid deprivation. The mechanism of GC2 activation by stalling remains unclear.
Over the past century, adult height has changed unevenly across the world's countries, with no indication of convergence. The height differential between the tallest and shortest populations was approximately 19 cm for men and 20 cm for women a century ago, and remained the same for women and increased for men later despite changes in country rankings. The largest gains in height occurred in South Korean women and Iranian men, who became 20.2 cm (17.5-22.7) and 16.5 (13.3-19.7) taller, respectively. In contrast, there was little change in adult height in some sub-Saharan countries and Asian countries over the century. The tallest men were born in the Netherlands in the last quarter of the 20th century, averaging 182.5 cm, while the shortest were born in Guatemala in 1896, 140.3 (135.8-144.8). The tallest women were in Norway, Iceland, USA, and American Samoa, averaging 158.2 cm, while the shortest were in El Salvador, Peru, Bangladesh, Korea, and Japan. The populations in Central and Northern Europe, North America, and Pacific islands were the tallest a century ago. Men in Sweden, Norway, and USA surpassed 171 cm, 18 cm taller than in Laos. Women in Sweden and USA averaged 160.3 (158.2-162.4). Men born in 199 surpassed 181 in Netherlands, Belgium, Estonia, Latvia, and Denmark, with Dutch men at 182.5 (180.6-184.5), the tallest on the planet. The gap with the shortest countries Timor, Yemen, and Laos, men only 160 tall is 22, an increase 4 on the global in 189 birth.
Opioid-induced respiratory depression is a major contributor to the opioid overdose epidemic in the United States, with rates quadrupling between 1999 and 2017, resulting in 130 deaths per day. To address this crisis, researchers investigated the brain areas and cells responsible for opioid-induced respiratory depression. They found two key sites in the brainstem that mediate this effect: the pre-Bötzinger Complex, where breathing originates, and a subset of glutamateric neurons within this region. These neurons are responsible for sensitivity to opioids, with just 70-140 required for the effect. Characterizing these neurons may lead to therapies that prevent respiratory depression while sparing analgesia.

 Studies showed that Opr1 glutamateric preötz neurons mediate this effect, with half of these neurons sufficient to rescue opioid depression of the preötz rhythm. Given the importance of Db1 neurons in rhythm generation, it's hypothesized that opioids silence presynaptic release, removing these neurons from the network. Alternatively, a subset of preötz excitatory neurons may generate inspiratory rhythm, with Opr1 enriched in this subgroup. Opr1 is expressed in central and peripheral nervous systems, including sites that modulate breathing, such as the cortex, brainstem control, motor, solitary nucleus, and sensing afferents.

Research found one dominant site driven by 140 neurons in vitro, not required for opioid-induced analgesia, a target for safer strategies. Deleting µpi receptor from both sites eliminates opioid-induced respiratory depression, even at high doses of fentanyl. Targeting these sites rescues respiratory depression, with remaining effect due to incomplete transduction or minor sites.
Researchers have identified sodium taurochotransport polypeptide (NTCP) as a functional receptor for both human hepatitis B virus (HBV) and its satellite virus (HDV). HBV and HDV infections are major public health concerns, and individuals co-infected with HDV have more severe disease. The entry of both viruses into cells is mediated by HBV envelope proteins, specifically the pre-S domain of the large protein. However, the identity of the receptor was unknown. Using near-distance photo-crosslinking and affinity purification, the researchers found that pre-S specifically interacts with NT, a transmembrane transporter predominantly expressed in the liver. Silencing NT inhibited HBV and HDV infection, while exogenous NT expression made nonsusceptible hepatarcinoma cells susceptible to viral infections. Replacing amino acids 157-165 of nonfunctional monkey NT with human counterpart conferred ability to support both viral infections. The study demonstrates NT is a receptor for HBV and HDV.
Sepsis leads to lasting changes in the phenotype and function of memory CD8 T cells, a type of immune cell that plays a crucial role in fighting off infections and diseases. When individuals experience sepsis, their immune system goes into overdrive, producing a massive amount of cytokines, which can be life-saving but also leads to a state of immunoparalysis, characterized by lymphopenia and functional deficits in surviving cells. Memory CD8 cells, which provide rapid cytolysis and cytokine production upon re-encounter with cognate antigen, are crucial for long-term immunity. However, seps can impair CD8 cells, predisposing individuals to re-infection. This study investigated the impact of seps on pre-existing memory CD8 cells and their recovery. Researchers found that central memory CD8 cells from septic patients proliferate more than those from healthy individuals. Using a mouse model of seps, they demonstrated that this proliferation is associated with recovery of pathogen-specific memory CD8 cells following seps-induced lymphopenia. This leads to changes in the composition of memory8 cell compartment and altered localization. Memory8 cells from seps survivors have an altered transcription profile and chromatin accessibility, indicating lasting cell changes. Seps changes the composition of memory8 pool and transcription landscape, resulting in altered cell function and reduced capacity to control Listeria monocytogen infection. Seps leads to long-term alterations in memory8 phenotype, function, and localization, potentially changing the host's capacity to respond to re-infection.
Researchers have been studying how human cells regulate the activity of LINE-1 (L1), a type of retrotransposon that can cause mutations in the genome. One strategy is through the APOB3 (3) family of enzymes, which deaminate cytosine to uracil in single-strand DNA. APO3A3 is the most potent inhibitor of L1 in cultured cells, but its mechanism of action was unclear. The study used in vitro and in vivo assays to show that A3 inhibits L1 by deaminating transiently exposed single-strand DNA during integration. This explains how A3 cytosine deaminase protein inhibits L1. 

In cultured cells co-expressing A3 and uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (UGI), L retroposition events contained strand-specific A3-mediated C-to-U deamination. Data indicate A3 inhibits L by deaming transient exposed single-strand during L integration. Previous studies showed over-expression of wild-type A3 inhibited L in human cells, but deamination was not detected in L events with A3. The mechanism of WT3 inhibition remained unknown. An in vitro assay, L Element Amplification Protocol (LEAP), recreated the first cDNA step of L integration to elucidate A3 inhibition. Degradation of deaminated retrointermediates reduced L levels in cells and could eliminate A-mediated events in resultant L sequences, explaining undetectable deamination in previous studies.
Researchers investigated the role of the protein Rem2 in shaping neural circuits in response to sensory experience. They found that mice lacking Rem2 fail to exhibit normal ocular dominance plasticity during a critical period. At the cellular level, Rem2 regulates the excitability of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons before changes in synaptic function. This is consistent with in vitro and in vivo recordings showing increased firing rates in the absence of Rem2. The study suggests Rem2 is a key regulator of neuronal excitability and circuit function in the context of changing sensory experience. 

Rem2 functions at the nexus of a signaling network that senses and responds to changes in activity to preserve circuit function in the face of changing experience. It may play a role in regulating the responsiveness of the cortex to visual stimulation through regulation of excitability or synaptic scaling. The findings provide a step in connecting molecular regulators of neuronal morphology with broader circuit function. Rem expression is regulated by visual experience, so the researchers investigated its role in activity-dependent processes in the cortex following sensory deprivation by ocular dominance plasticity. 

Rem is a candidate to link neural activity with plasticity. It is a member of the Rad/Rem/Gem/K family, a subfamily of Gases regulated by activity in response to calcium influx through voltage-gated channels.
Researchers have investigated the effects of magnetic fields on biological molecules and cells, prompted by recent reports of magnetism in biological systems. Studies have identified a protein that acts like a compass to guide magnetic orientation in animals, and magnetic control of membrane conductance by attaching ferritin to an ion protein and tugging it with a magnetic field. However, the author argues that these claims conflict with basic laws of physics, with discrepancies of 5-10 orders of magnitude. If the phenomena occur, they must have different causes from proposed by authors. The paramagnetic nature of protein limits their utility for magnetically sensitive cells.

The forces or torques and temperatures produced are too small to affect molecular orientation or membrane channels. If the phenomena occurred, they rely on a different mechanism. Proposed magnetogen routes, based on pulling or heating ferritin complex with fields, have no chance of success. A molecular system was designed to couple magnetic fields to ionic current across the membrane, consisting of a mechano-sensitive channel fused to ferritin subunits. Results suggest neural activity can be modulated by static fields, but evidence is scant. Ferritin is a large complex with 24 subunits forming a shell 12 nm diameter.

Interest in magnetic effects on cells has renewed, with magnetosensation and magnetogen. Magnetosensation relies on magnetite, coupling a crystal to membrane, or magnetic on single molecules in biochemical reactions. Magnetogen aims to make cells responsive to fields for controlling activity.
Researchers have studied how stem cells, specifically Drosophila neural progenitor cells, switch between self-renewal, differentiation, and quiescence. They found that when these cells enter quies, a protein called Prosper is temporarily present in the nucleus, followed by a unique molecular profile lacking progenitor and differentiation markers. A low level of Prosper precedes entry into quies, even when timing is advanced or delayed by changing factors. Loss of Prosper prevents quies, while a pulse of low Prosper drives proliferating neuroblasts into quies. The study proposes that Prosper levels distinguish progenitor states: absent self-renew, low quies, and high differentiation.

The researchers used Dophila neuroblasts as a model to study conserved pathways regulating stem cell proliferation and quies. They found that nearly all quiesent neurobl at 12 hours after induction reactivated and expressed progenitor markers. A low level of Prosper advanced the timing of quies. Transient low Prosper is sufficient to induce neuroblast quies.

The study showed a strong correlation between Prosper and neuroblast entry quies timing. They asked if Prosper is required for entry and loss can delay quies. Quantifying Ed+ neurobl in prosper mutants, they found a pulse of Prosper matched quies timing: earlier in pd mutants and later in cas. This suggests a functional relationship between low Prosper and quies.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the disassembly of the HIV-1 capsid, a crucial step for the virus to release its genetic material into the host cell. They used single-molecule microscopy to observe the process in real-time and found that the first defect in the lattice is the rate-limiting step, followed by rapid collapse. The capsid inhibitor PF74 accelerates opening but stabilizes the remaining lattice, while binding to a conserved arginine cluster in the lattice delays initiation but not prevents disassembly. This suggests different stages of disassembly can be controlled by the interplay between capsid regulators, determining overall disassembly kinetics.

The researchers measured single-particle disassembly of authentic HIVids after removing the viral membrane barrier, observing effects of caps-binding on discrete steps in disassembly. Traditional ensemble measurements would have obscured these events due to averaging. Capsid molecules exhibit differential effects on initiation and continuation of disassembly. HIVid is structurally heterogeneous, yielding conical, tubular shapes with defects like gaps in the lattice.

A single-molecule imaging allowed following disassembly of hundreds of HIVids in one experiment, resolving intermediates in the pathway averaged in traditional assays. Observing properties of individualids classified them according to disassembly behaviors. Key characteristics of HIV-1 disassembly and interactions with capsid molecules found: (1) capsid integrity is heterogeneous, majority contain defects/uncoat after membrane removal (2) in absence binders, dis is all-or process after first defect created, half-life is long enough to use permeabilized particles quantify binding labeled proteins to viralids at single level.

To demonstrate, CA labeled with Alexa 568 added to flow and followed fluorescence of GFP packaged vir and AF-C using dual microscopy.
Researchers have investigated the role of the JUN-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway in breast cancer development. The JNK pathway is known to promote cell proliferation by activating the AP-1 transcription factor, but its association with tumor development is unexpected. Analysis of breast cancer genomic data shows frequent loss-of-function mutations in J components of the J pathway. The study examined the effect of J deficiency in murine breast epithelium and found loss of J signaling caused genomic instability and cancer development. Moreover, J deficiency caused widespread neoplas and rapid tumor formation in a murine model of breast cancer. The tumor suppressive function was not mediated by J's role in growth of established tumors but by its requirement to prevent initiation. These data identify J pathway defects as driver mutations that promote instability and initiation.

Loss of J signaling in mammary epithelial cells caused breast cancer and accelerated tumor formation in a murine model. Effects of J deficiency to promote development were associated with presence of neoplas and genomic instability. J plays a key role in initiation of tumor development. The significance of J pathway inactivation in cancer is unclear, but this study demonstrates loss promotes murine breast development and accelerates tumor in a model. Frequent J loss-function mutations in human cancer may represent driver that promote development. J plays a role at early stages of cancer by promoting gland neoplas. This accounts for effect of mutational inactivation to promote development.

The J pathway may be suppressed in many cancers. Association of cancer with reduced signaling is a correlation. The purpose was to test role J in development. J causes AP transcription activation, anticipated to promote growth.
Researchers have identified a key enzyme called peptidylglyc α-amating monxygenase (PAM) that plays a crucial role in the formation of cilia in different types of cells. Cilia are hair-like structures on the surface of cells that help with movement, sensing, and signaling. In Chlamdomonas, a single-celled organism, and planaria, a type of flatworm, and mice, P is necessary for the assembly of motile cilia, which are cilia that can move. Without P, these cells failed to form cilia beyond a certain point, had abnormal Golgi structures, and altered levels of cilia components. In planaria, reduced P led to fewer cilia on the ventral surface and abnormal axonemes without cilia. In mice, P-deficient embryos had abnormal primary cilia on neuroepithelial cells. The study suggests P's activity and post-Gol trafficking contribute to c defects and a conserved link between amidation and cilium assembly. P is conserved in multiple cell types, including C reinii, planaria, and mammals, indicating a novel signaling function in eukotic cilia. It may be that P was included in the set of proteins trafficked to ciliary from Golgi in ancestral eukote. The results suggest amid and membrane roles of P contribute to cogenesis.
Myosin III (My3) and actin bundling protein Espin play crucial roles in the development and maintenance of stereocilia in vertebrate hair cells, and defects in these proteins cause hereditary hearing impairments. My3 interacts with Espin through its tail homology motif (TH), but it is unclear how My3 specifically acts through Espin to regulate actin assembly and stabilization. Researchers discovered that My3 TH contains a pair of sequences capable of independently binding Espin's ankyrin repeats, revealing an unexpected My3-mediated crossing mechanism of Espin. The structures of My3 complex with Espin elucidate the binding mechanism and reveal My3-induced Espin autoinhibition release. My3 crossing also promotes Espin's actin bundling activity.

My3 binding releases Esp's autoinhibition and increases Esp-promoted actin bundle diameter, as previously proposed (Zheng et al, 2014). Mya and Myb co-localize with Espin at stereocilia tips (Merritt et al,201; Sal et al,2009; Schneider et,2006). Co-expression of My3 and Espin stimulates stereilia elongation in cultured Corti hair cells (Sal et al,200). My3/Espin interaction likely promotes thicker actin bundle formation in cellular structures like stereilia.

The TH mediates My3 binding to Espin, allowing My to transport Esp to actin-based structures like filopodia and stereilia. Once localized, Esp WH domain promotes actin elongation (Merr et,201; Sal et,200). However, the molecular basis of My3 and Espin interaction is unclear. The motor domain of My binds actin filaments (ose et,200; Kam et,200), the full My/Espin complex may have higher actin bundling activity than My-AB/Espin studied. This study reveals a direct My binding regulation mechanism of actin crosser protein.

My3 and Myb contain similar sequences in TH, each capable of binding Espin with high affinity. These findings point to Esp's critical roles in stereilia development and maintenance, promoting parallel actin bundles (Bart,200; et,200).
Voltage-gated calcium channels play a crucial role in the functioning of excitable cells, such as neurons and heart and skeletal muscles, by translating membrane depolarization into calcium influx. These channels contribute to cellular excitability and couple electrical activity to fundamental functions like muscle contraction, neurotransmitter secretion, and gene regulation. They form a structurally related channel superfamily with voltage-gated sodium channels, having a fourfold symmetry.

To understand the molecular mechanisms governing voltage sensing, researchers combined modeling, mutagenesis, and electrophysiology to analyze the structures, energy, and kinetics of the activated and resting states of two functionally distinct voltage sensing domains (VSD) of the eukotic calcium channel Ca1.1. Both VSD displayed features of the sliding helix model, but differed in ion-pair formation of outer charges. Stabilization of the activated state enhanced voltage dependence, while stabilization of resting slowed kinetics. This provides a mechanistic model explaining how ionair formation in VSD can realize characteristic properties of voltageated cation channels.

Researchers used advanced models of activated and resting states of Ca1.1 VSD to fill a gap in understanding voltage sensing in eukotic voltageated cation. Tested interactions suggested by the model showed predicted effects on channel when experimentally tested by mutagen and electrophys analysis. Alterations of kinetic properties recognized experimentally were reproduced and explained by computer. Structures of lowest energy states Ca1 V display basic features of sliding helix model.
Researchers investigated the role of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in adult brain plasticity, specifically in the visual cortex of healthy and stroke-affected brains. They found that optimal levels of MMP activity are crucial for visual plasticity to occur in both healthy and stroke-affected brains. In healthy animals, a 7-day application of MMP-inhibitor prevented plasticity, but treatment with MMP-inhib once after stroke rescued plasticity normally lost under these conditions. The study suggests that precise regulation of MMPactivity is essential for plasticity in the adult brain and offers new opportunities for treatment and recovery after stroke. A single treatment after stroke rescued plastic in both paradigms, whereas treatment with inhibitor twice diminished plastic-promoting effect. The data reveal a crucial role of MMPs in adult plasticity and that MMPactivity must be within a narrow window for plastic to occur.
Researchers have used a technique called cryo-electron microscopy to study the structure of AMPA receptors, a type of glutamate-gated ion channel found at excitatory synapses in vertebrates. These receptors are made up of four subunits that assemble as dimers. The study found that these dimers can move laterally during activation, opening the extracellular layer along the twofold symmetry axis. To understand how this movement, researchers used bifunctional methaniosulfate cross-linkers to calibrate the conformations of AMP receptors with and without the auxiliary subunit Stargin. They found that the extracellular layer of AMP receptors can get trapped in stable, opened conformations when exposed to glutamate, but Stargin limits this flexibility. This suggests that under synaptic conditions where glutamate is present and auxiliary proteins, the extracellular domains of AMP receptors likely stay compact during gating.

The study indicates that the extracellular domains of synaptic AMP receptors do not undergo large rearrangements during transmission and instead work in a compact conformation, unless exposed to glutamate in pathological conditions. The presence of auxiliary subunits, such as Stargin, affects the conformation flexibility of AMP receptors. Cryo-EM structures of AMP receptors with auxiliary subunits have been acquired in resting, active, and desensitized states. However, the dynamics of rapid signaling are unclear. AMP receptors are tetrameric lig-gated ion channels, consisting of three layers from distinct domains. Two extracellular layers are formed from amino-terminal and lig-binding domains, AT and Ls, which adopt dimer pairs in resting and active receptors.

The study suggests that AMP receptors at synapses exposed to brief glut and complex with auxiliary units are unlikely to undergo conformation changes. The researchers used bifunction methanulf crossers to calibrate conformations of AMP with and without Starg, finding that the extracellular can get trapped in opened when exposed to glut. In contrast, Starg limits this flexibility.
Researchers have developed a new method to isolate and analyze individual immune cells from the intestines of mice infected with a type of parasitic worm called helmin. This was challenging due to the strong immune response triggered by the parasite, which causes mucus production, tissue remodeling, and immune cell infiltration. The team optimized a digestion protocol to isolate millions of immune cells from the infected duodenum, a part of the small intestine. They used a high-dimensional flow cytometry to analyze the cells and confirmed their findings with confocal microscopy. This allowed them to identify hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the course of helmin infection and has potential for single-cell discoveries of local helmin immune responses previously unfeasible.

To validate the protocol, they used a 23-color flow cytometry panel to characterize cells with surface and intracellular markers associated with helmin infections. The isolation and analysis revealed hallmarks of innate and adaptive anti-parite responses throughout helmin infection. Confocal microscopy validated changes and observed differences between naive and infected samples reported by both approaches. Importantly, many changes were local, highlighting the need for good cell techniques to investigate helmin responses directly.

The team quantified B220, Sig F, CD, CD, CD, and CD cells using confocal and compared to flow data. Difficulties with digestion during helmin infection are associated with anti-parite type 2 response driving mucus production, epithelium alteration, immune infiltration, and tissue remodeling.
Researchers have developed a new model to understand how the proteasome, a key enzyme responsible for breaking down proteins, works. The proteome is dynamic and its activity changes over time due to interactions with substrates and products and regulatory sites. The model predicts the locations and interactions of these sites and is supported by experiments. The study found that the rate-limiting step of hydrolysis is the transport of substrates into the proteome, which varies between standard and immuno-proteomes affecting total degradation and cleavage usage.

The researchers used a combination of experimental and computational analysis to advance understanding of proteome structure and function. They created a comprehensive model describing regulatory components of 20 proteomes and interactions between substrate transport and hydrolysis over time for representative peptides. The study used carefully designed assays and modelling to shed light on mechanisms. There is a lack of mechanistic analysis of proteome functions and complexity of peptide hydrolysis has precluded detailed analysis.

The study observed proteome dynamics over time using purified 20 proteome and homogenates where 20 proteomes are surrounded by regulatory molecules. The model describes core proteome features that reflect proteome dynamics in complex scenarios like cellular environment. Polyubiquitin tagging and peptide hydrolysis regulate protein half-life affecting majority of cellular processes. Despite biochemical and structural efforts, mechanisms of proteomal action and differences in substrate proteysis between proteome isoforms are incompletely understood.

The 20 proteome is dynamic and catalytic activity varies over time influenced by substrates and regulatory sites. Kinetics change over longer scales described by Oulski et al (2009) and are influenced by interactions with proteoly and regulatory sites.
In Drosophila, the recycling of neurotransmitters is essential for sustained synaptic transmission, and histamine is required for visual transmission. Histamine is taken up by laminar glia, converted to carcinine, and delivered to photoreceptors, where it's hydrolyzed to histamine and β-alanine. However, it's unclear how β-alanine is returned to laminar glial cells. A new βanine transporter, Bala, was identified, and null mutants showed lower β-al levels and less β-al accumulation in the retina. Bala is expressed in retinal pigment cells, required for visual transmission and photaxis. This suggests retinal cells play a role in neurotransmission and a Bala-dependent βanine pathway is required for histamine homeostasis and transmission.

A novel βanine transporter, Bala, functions in retinal cells to recycle βanine. Disrupting histamine and carcinine abolishes photoreceptor transmission. Transporting β-al is less important, as it's present in higher concentrations in Dophila. βanine is essential for histamine homeostasis and photore transmission, and maintaining a βanine pool sustains synaptic transmission. Pigment granules, reducing light intensity, are formed in retinal cells of Doph compound eye. High βanine levels in retinal cells suggest cells transport and store βanine in this system.

Mutations in Bala disrupted βanine transport and storage in retina, resulting in reduced photoreceptor activity and behavior. This suggests conserved βanine trafficking in mammals and Doph. Our work, with previous reports, provides a complete histamine pathway for sustaining photore transmission. In this pathway, carcin is synthesized epithelial in optic lamina, transported to photore via synaptic cleft.
Researchers have investigated the role of oxidants in the aging process of yeast cells. They found that as yeast cells age, they experience a sudden collapse in their ability to maintain a balance of oxidants and antioxidants, leading to the oxidation of nearly 80% of their proteins. This collapse is not due to an increase in oxidants as previously thought, but rather a decrease in NAD, a molecule that provides electrons for cellular balance. This decrease in NAD occurs early in the aging process and triggers a cascade that downregulates cellular processes. Caloric restriction, a known to extend lifespan, increases NAD and delays the cascade. The study reveals a timeline of events leading to the oxidation of the proteome before cell death.
Researchers have discovered the mechanism behind a crucial process called proofreading during translation of the genetic code, which ensures that only the correct amino acids are used to build proteins. This process is essential for cell survival as it prevents incorrect amino acids from being incorporated into proteins. The study focused on a specific enzyme called D-aminoacyl-tRNA deacyase (DTD) from Plasmodium falcum, which removes mischarged amino acids from tRNAs. The crystal structure of DTD with a substrate-mim analog revealed how it captures the chiral center of D-aminoacy-tRNA using an invariant cross-unit Gly-Pro dipeptide. No protein residues are directly involved in catalysis, but the unique side-chain recognition explains DTD's ability to act on multiple amino acids. This strict chiral specificity prevents the enriched pool of L-amacy-tRNAs from escaping this proof step. The study provides insights into a fundamental enantio process and elucidates a chiral mechanism crucial in preventing amino acid infiltration during translation.

 The mechanism involves a side-chain recognition, allowing DTD to deal with D-tRNA, and weak hydrogen bonds play a role in chirality selection. If L-amino acid binds, it would have to do so in one of three possible conformations. The study corrects earlier models based on docking approaches or structures with non-cognate ligands. DTD removes mischarged amino acids from tRN to prevent incorporation into proteins. It acts as a free-standing module, likely operating by recapturing amino-tRNAs from EFu. The amino site captures all atoms attached to the chiral C and cross-unit interactions, particularly Gly-Pro motif, play a central role in recognition. The amino moiety interacts with residues from both monomers.
Researchers have investigated the mechanism of how the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel opens and closes. CFTR is a chloride channel that is mutated in cystic fibrosis patients and is regulated by the binding of ATP to its two cytosolic nucleotide binding domains (NBDs). When ATP binds, the NBDs dimerize and the pore opens, and when ATP is hydrolyzed, the pore closes. In wild-type CFTR, spontaneous openings without ATP are rare, but in certain mutants, this is the only mechanism, stimulated by ivacaftor, a clinically approved CF potentiator. The study found that spontaneous openings are strictly coupled to NBD dimerization, which can occur without ATP. This means that coordinated NBD and pore movements are intrinsic to CFTR, and ATP alters the stability, not the structure of open and closed conformations. This explains the effects of phosphorylation, mutations, and drugs on ATP and spontaneous activity, providing insights for understanding CF and drug mechanisms.

The study used single CF channels to correlate energetic coupling residues across the dimer interface with spontaneous opening and closure. They found that the pore is likely closed in a high-energy transition state for spontaneous openings. The presence of bound ATP does not alter the arrangement of conformations, but acts as a molecular glue to stabilize the transition and open state. CFTR is a chloride channel in the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily and is gated by cytos ATP after phosphorylation. The strict coupling between N and pore movements constrains mechanistic models of ATP-dependent gating and driving forces, conserved among ABC proteins, and explains modulatory effects of mutations or regulators.

In CF, the ligand site is occluded in open channels, so open-state binding cannot be defined. Disruption of hydrolysis forces CF to gate at equilibrium, following a linear sequence, not subject to balance. Low-probability ATP-independent openings of a construct lacking NBD can be linked to N dimer, but results argue that upon opening remaining N-T machinery undergoes similar movements to dimer when truncated.
Researchers have discovered a new force that drives the assembly of transmembrane proteins in lipid bilayers, which they call the "orderobic effect". This force arises from the transition between ordered and disordered phases in the membrane. Using large-scale simulations, they found that a protein with a hydrophobic thickness equal to that of the disordered phase embedded in an ordered bilayer stabilizes a microscopic order-disorder interface. The stiffness of this interface is finite. When two such proteins approach each other, assembly reduces the interfacial energy. This phenomenon is analogous to the hydrophobic effect, but mediated by proximity to the order-disorder transition and hydrophobic mismatch of the protein. The strength and range of forces from this effect are significantly larger than those from membrane elasticity.

The orderobic effect depends on the ability of the protein to induce a disordered layer in its vicinity, which depends on proximity to the membrane's transition and protein's hydroobic mismatch. For example, a protein with hydroobic thickness of 2.6nm favors the disordered phase, while a larger one can melt the ordered phase and form an order-dis interface. This phenomenon may be tested by single molecule tracking techniques. Biological membranes and transmem proteins are more complex, with multiple components allowing multiple order-dis transitions, and a dual orderobic effect where a protein in the dis phase can nucleate an ordered region.

The orderobic force arises from the difference in hydroobic thickness between ordered and dis phases. The ordered phase has a larger hydroobic thickness and smaller area per lipid than the dis phase. This leads to a first-order transition in the lipid bilayer, with an order-dis phase diagram in the tension-temperature plane.
Researchers investigated the relationship between action potentials (APs) and fluorescence signals in genetically encoded calcium indicators, specifically GCaMP6 and GCa6, in layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the primary visual cortex of mice. They used simultaneous imaging and cell-attached recordings to analyze the AP-fluorescence transfer function. Under optimal conditions, most APs were detected, but under typical population imaging conditions, only a minority of 1 and 2 AP events were detected (<10% and ~20, respectively). This highlights the limits of detection under realistic imaging conditions.

To construct AP-calc fluorescence curves, isolated events were separated by 100-500ms for GCa6 and 300ms for GC6. Only a minority of APs were used to construct curves, with APs summed over 250ms. The study provides insight into the relationship between spiking activity and fluorescence, aiding interpretation of existing and future imaging studies using transgenic lines, such as the Allen's Brain Observatory dataset. Previous studies showed most APs can be detected with GC6 under near-optimal conditions.

The performance of several spike models was tested, detecting AP under optimal and less optimal conditions. Results provide insight into the relationship between spiking in vivo and fluorescence, aiding interpretation of existing and future imaging datasets. Genetically encoded indicators are used with two-photon microscopy to report activity within populations in vivo, enabling simultaneous measurement of hundreds of neurons at single resolution over sessions.
Researchers have discovered a unique biological valve in the female genitalia of a cave-dwelling insect, Neotla, that allows it to receive multiple seminal packages from males. This valve is composed of two sclerites, a closure element, and in- and out canals. Females have a penis-like intromitt organ to anchor males and obtain voluminous semen, which is packed in a capsule formed by seminal injection. The capsule is not only used for fertilization but also consumed by the female as nutrition. The valve has two slots for insemination, enabling Neotla to mate while one slot is occupied. In conjunction with the penis, this valve is a morphological novelty enabling females to compete for seminal in nutrient-poor cave habitats through long copulation and multiple injections.

 Studies show that females of Neotla use a mechanism to control the direction of seminal flow. The biological valve allows to receive two packages (nutrition) from the same or different males within a short span. In particular, the valve receives a seminal while the first is consumed. With the valve, Neotla can use one of two slots for insemination, leaving the other empty. This enables females to receive an additional package from the same or males using the empty slot. The presence of spermathe plate with valve to control flow may refine understanding of causes and consequences of reversed selection in genus. Female-female competition for males (sex reversal) to receive substances is considered most factor driving evolution of female penis.
Researchers have studied the process of synaptic vesicle exocytosis, which is the release of neurotransmitters from neurons, and the role of a protein called Munc-1 in this process. They used a technique called optical tweez to observe the assembly of a protein complex called SNARE, which is crucial for exocytosis. They found four stages of SN assembly: N-terminal, middle, C-terminal, and linker domains (NTD, MD, CTD, and LD). Mutations in these domains affected SN assembly and exyt differently. NTD and CTD are responsible for vesicle docking and fusion, while MD regulates SN assembly and fusion. M-1 initiates SN assembly and stabilizes the half-zipped SN complex. Without M-1, SN reassembly was not observed due to dissociation of SNAP-25. In presence of M-1, 45% of unfolded SN complexes reassembled. M-1 held SNAP-25 together with tethered syntaxin and VAMP as SN unfolded, facilitating de novo assembly. Three M-1 activities were observed: enhancing de novo assembly, stabilizing half-zipped SN, and regulating interactions between SN and membranes. M- regulates every stage of SN assembly. A model was proposed for M- roles in SN zippering and membrane fusion.
Researchers investigated how integrin adhesomes, which are protein complexes that facilitate cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix, assemble rapidly and correctly at cell adhesion sites. They used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and recovery after photobleaching to study the cytosolic state of integrin adh components and their exchange between adhesion sites and cytos. The results showed that integrin adh is preassembled in the cytos as multi-protein building blocks for adhesion sites, and stationary adhes release the same types of protein complexes they recruit, keeping the cyolic pool of building blocks uniform. This suggests a model where multi-protein blocks enable rapid and modular assembly of adhesion and exchange of blocks preserves specifications and the assembly logic of the system.

Integrin adh is extensively preassembled in the cytos, forming multi-protein blocks that facilitate rapid assembly of adhesion. Associations between adhesion components are spatially uniform around stationary adhes, indicating they exchange blocks with cytos without altering. In the cytos, blocks cannot form bigger structures due to protein interactions. The plasma membrane system can switch to self-assemble adhesion by inducing additional interactions in integrh. The integrh is preassembled in cytos, forming multi-pro blocks for cell-matrix adhesion. Results show blocks are confined and correspond to functional layers of adhesion anchoring, regulation, transduction, and actin. Symmetric exchange between adhesion and cytos ensures blocks enter and exit sites unaltered.
Researchers have identified a new electrophysiological marker that can track states of reduced arousal in humans, including sleep and anesthesia. This marker, known as the 1/f slope of the electrophys power spectrum, reflects the non-oscillatory, scale component of neural activity and can distinguish wakefulness from propof anesthesia, non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, and rapid eye (REM) sleep. Unlike REM sleep, which has a desynchronized 'wake' electroencephalogram (EEG), NREM and propof anesthesia are associated with synchronized oscillations in the EEG. The 1/f slope was found to be more negative, or steeper, in sleep and anesthesia compared to wakefulness, and was able to discriminate wake from NREM and REM sleep solely based on the electrophysiological brain state. This marker was observed in four independent datasets, including intracran and scalp recordings. The 1/f slope was also found to track changes in excitability over the course of slow waves, providing a mechanistic link between the slope and synchrony during oscillations. Additionally, the non-oscill, aperiod part of power, devoid of low-frequency components, approximated by 1 decay of power from 30-45 Hz, reliably differentiated wake from three states of reduced arousal: REM, N sleep, and propof anesthesia.
Researchers have discovered that tiny extensions of chloroplasts called stromules play a crucial role in plant immunity by connecting with the nucleus and guiding chloroplast movement. They found that microtubules (MTs) and actin filaments (AFs) are involved in this process. MTs help stabilize stromules and increase their length, while AFs provide anchor points for them. Interestingly, the direction of stromules from chloroplasts correlates with the direction of chloroplast movement. This movement occurs even without immune induction, suggesting it's a general function in plant cells. The study shows that MTs and AFs facilitate clustering of chloroplasts near the nucleus during an immune response. The researchers propose a model where stromules extend along MTs, attach to AF points, and guide chloroplasts to the nucleus during immunity.

In an immune response, stromules extend along MTs and attach to AF points, guiding chloroplasts to the nucleus. The role of AFs and MTs in strom dynamics is not well understood, so the researchers analyzed strom extension and movement in green tissue. Results show MTs are required for extension and depolymerization leads to retraction, while stabilization increases frequency. Future research will investigate molecular components and importance of peruclear clustering during immunity.

The cytoskeleton supports various functions in plant cells, including streaming, division, elongation, growth, trafficking, and positioning. This study shows stromules extend along MT and AFs stabilize chloroplast-nuclear connections during immunity. Results show MT extension and AF anchoring are complementary during formation and movement. The study provides insights into interactions with the cytoskeleton and stabilizing stromules. A new type of movement along MT is strom-directed, revealing a mechanism for peruclear clustering during immunity.
Researchers have developed a method to predict the interactions between amino acid residues across protein interfaces using evolutionary information. They found that pairs of residues that covary across protein-protein interfaces in 50 ribosomal and 28 bacterial complexes with known structures are almost always in contact, given a sufficient number of aligned sequences. This method was used to predict subunit contacts for 36 complexes with unknown structures, and models were presented for four complexes: tripart ATP-independent periplasm (TR) transporter, tripart efflux system, pyruvate lyase-activating enzyme, and methine ABC transporter.

The study used a pseudo-likelihood method to predict contacts across protein interfaces for evolutionarily conserved complexes with unknown structures and presented models for four complexes constrained by data. In a set of complexes with known structures, covarying pairs were almost always in 3D structures given sufficient sequences. Residue-residue covariance occurred frequently between interacting pairs but rarely between non-interacting, making it useful for predicting protein interactions.

This study examined residue-residue covari across protein interfaces using a pseudo-likelihood statistical method, unlike previous global models which were limited to histidine-kin/response regulator system. Predictions contributed to structures of biologically important complexes.
Researchers investigated how people categorize visual scenes by gathering information from multiple locations in the scene. They used a novel gaze-contingent paradigm in a categorization task and found that participants' eye movements follow an active strategy that incorporates prior knowledge of the scene's structure and statistical patterns. Categorization performance improved when locations were revealed by an optimal Bayesian sensor. A combination of Bayesian observer and sensor estimated that 70% of apparent optimality in fixations arise from biases, perceptual noise, and eye movement inaccuracies. The process of selecting locations is 70% efficient in the task. Results suggest eye movements aim to maximize information about categories by integrating information from multiple locations.

The study extends active sensing to tasks with non-spatial features, such as categories. It provides the first fixation-by-fixation analysis of information gathering under eye movements by matching observer to participants' performance. It dissociates eye movement process from perceptual and decision processes, identifies sources of suboptimality, and quantifies efficiency of each fixation throughout the scene. The approach is applicable to multiple perceptual tasks.

To study eye movements, efficiency was estimated on a fixation-fixation basis in a high-level task. A pattern categorization task differs from search, where a single location has all information, and movements are described by inhibition of return. Participants' movements were more efficient than heuristic strategies and 70% as efficient as the optimal sensor with participants' bias, noise, and saccadic inaccuracies. Inspired, an experiment was designed with controlled patterns and simple, ensuring foveal vision dominated by gaze-conting categorization.
Researchers have studied how large molecules, such as viruses, RNAs, and ribosomes, are transported into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC) in cells. These molecules are too big to pass through the pore on their own, so they need help from transport receptors called nuclear localization sequences (NLS) and nuclear transport receptors (NTR) to enter the nucleus. The study looked at 30 cargo models of different sizes, from 17 to 36 nanometers, with up to 240 NLS. They found that the amount of time it takes for these molecules to enter the nucleus depends on their size and the energy needed to transport them through the NPC. A simple two-parameter model can predict this process. The study shows that size and energy are key factors in transporting large molecules into the nucleus. This research can help understand how other large molecules, like ribosomal subunits and RNA complexes, are exported from the nucleus. The study assumes that the molecules don't interact with each other while passing through the pore. Molecules with one to five NLS have been studied before, but this research looks at a wider range of sizes and NLS. The transport process can be recreated in a lab by adding key components of the transport machinery, including Importβ, Importα, RanG, NTF, and GTP. The study used fluorescently labeled dextran and cargoes to validate the results.
Researchers investigated the role of the co-stimulatory molecule CD28 in helper T cells after they have been activated, or "primed", to respond to an infection. CD28 is known to be essential for the initial activation of helper T cells, but its function after activation was not well understood. To study this, a strain of mice was created where CD28 was removed from helper T cells after priming. The study found that continued CD28 expression is necessary for helper cells to expand and fight off infection. Specifically, CD28 is required for the expansion of a type of helper cell called Th1 and the differentiation and maintenance of another type called follicular helper during viral infection. Additionally, CD28 is necessary for clearing the bacteria Citrobacterium from the gastrointestinal tract. This shows that CD28 plays a role in helper cell polarization after priming, a new function distinct from its role in initial activation.
Helicobacter pylori, a type of bacteria that causes stomach infections, has a unique helical shape that allows it to efficiently colonize the stomach. However, the mechanisms behind this shape formation are not well understood. Researchers investigated how Helicobacter pylori maintains its diameter while keeping a curved shape. They used special probes to track the growth of its cell wall and found that growth occurs at both at the curved and straight parts of the cell. Two proteins, Mre and C, were found to be involved in this process. M is more abundant at the curved parts of the cell, while C is more at the straight parts. Experiments with altered versions of these proteins showed that they are necessary for the helical shape. The researchers propose a model where M and C promote growth at curved and straight parts of the cell, respectively. This patterning is essential for maintaining the helical shape.

To understand how Helobacter pyl maintains its curved shape, researchers used high-resolution microscopy and 3D analysis to track growth. They found growth is enhanced at curved and straight parts of the cell. They also looked at the localization of proteins M and C. They suggest M promotes growth at curved parts due to its preference for this shape in Helob pyl and its role in other organisms. To maintain curved shape in presence of M-driven straight growth, Helob pyl uses C to promote growth at major area independent of M.

Helob pyl also uses protein C to promote growth at straight parts of the cell. This supplements M-enhanced growth at curved parts. In straight-shaped E. coli, M is at curved, while C is at parts with growth. Researchers propose both M and C help growth and patterning is fundamental to helical shape. They also investigated if wall growth during growth remains at major axis. Computational tools showed Hel pyl achieves broader curved than curved-rod bacteria and uses distinct mechanisms.
Researchers have identified a new function of the protein Cdc48 in regulating mitochondrial dynamics, specifically in the process of mitochondrial fusion. C48 is a ubiquitin-selective chaperone that orchestrates the activities of E3 ligases and deubiquilases (DUBs). The study found that C48 integrates the activities of two Ds, Ubp and U2, which have opposing effects on mitochondrial fusion and cleave different ubiquitin chains on mitofus F1. C48 promotes the proteolysis of U12, stabilizing pro-fusion ubiqulation on F1, while loss of U stabilizes U2 and facilitates removal of ubiquitin on F, inhibiting fusion. This cascade ensures a tight control of F1 ubiqulation levels, allowing mitochondrial fusion while preventing unnecessary ubiqulation that targets F for proteasomal turnover. The study reveals a new cascade of ubiqulation events comprising C48 and Ds fine-tuning the fusogenic activity of F1.
Researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study how the ventral occipito-temporal cortex (VOT) responds to sounds in sighted and congenitally blind individuals. They found that the OT encodes sound categories in both groups using a similar representational structure and connectivity to the one found in vision. However, sound categories were more reliably encoded in the blind group using a representational format closer to the one in vision. Crucially, OT in the blind represents categorical membership of sounds rather than their acoustic features. This suggests that sounds trigger categorical responses in OT of congenally blind and sighted people that match the topography and functional profile of the response, despite nuances in categorical organization between modalities.

The study demonstrates that categorical organization similar to vision can emerge in OT in absence of experience and is enhanced in congenally blind. Previous studies showed that occipital cortex enhances non-visual processing in absence of vision. By using representational analysis, it was found that membership predicts represent structure of sounds in OT in blind rather than lower-level acoustic attributes. The study shows OT encodes categorical membership of sounds from different categories in sight and blind using topography, represent format, and connectivity similar to observed in vision. However, auditory representation in OT of both groups exhibits nuances compared to visual organization in sighted.

It is possible that overlap between groups comes from OT representing visual attributes in sight and acoustic in blind due to crossmodal plasticity. Congenitally blind studies have shown occital representing acoustic features, such as frequencies.
Researchers have discovered a fungal pathogen, Entomophthora muscae, that manipulates the behavior of Drosophila melanogaster, a type of fruit fly, in the laboratory. The fungus infects the fly and causes it to exhibit moribund behaviors, such as climbing upward, extending its proboscis, and raising its wings, allowing the fungus to launch spores from its abdomen. The fungus invades the fly's nervous system, suggesting a direct means by which it induces behavioral changes. The researchers believe this system will enable rapid progress in understanding how the fungus manipulates host behavior. 

To study the fungus and its impact on the fly, the researchers isolated and characterized the Entom mus strain and infected D melanaster in the lab. They found that the fungus invades the nervous system, granting direct access to host neurons, which may be mechanistically important for behavioral manipulation. However, they caution against jumping to conclusions and consider all possible ways the fungus alters behavior. Four mechanisms by which the fungus achieves manipulation are proposed. 

To test if the fungus can infect outside Drosidae, researchers exposed flies to infected melanaster using a modified protocol. They observed flies died and sporulated, indicating they were killed by the fungus. To understand how the fungus progresses in melan at the molecular level, researchers measured transcription changes in host and fungus over 5 days. However, early infected flies are phenotypically indistinguishable from uninfected, complicating the study. The work has elucidated the molecular basis of manipulation, but progress is limited by lack of genetic tools in fungus or host and neurobiological tools in host. Similar behaviors are induced in dipterans by distantly related Zygomete fungi within Entom mus species.
Researchers have mapped the locations of 30 RNA degradation factors in yeast cells to understand how RNA is broken down and regulated. They found that different factors bind to different types of RNA, such as messenger RNA (mRNA) and small nuclear RNA (snoRNA), and that some factors preferentially bind to RNA with non-optimal codons, which are sequences that do not code for amino acids. This suggests that these RNAs are degraded quickly because they are not translated efficiently. The study also found that the nuclear surveillance machinery, including complexes Nrd1/N3 and TR4, targets aberrant RNAs and snoRNAs, which are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression.

The researchers used a technique called PAR-CL (photoactivatable ribonucleotide-enhanced cross-linking immunoprecipitation) to map the locations of 30 RNA factors involved in mRNA deadenylation, decapping, exosome degradation, and RNA surveillance, including nuclear and cytoplasmic nonsense decay (NMD). They analyzed the data to see how factors bind to different classes of RNAs and their locations on transcripts. They compared the profiles to other RNA-binding factors and found clusters of factors that co-occupy or co-localize on RNAs.

The study found that most factors bind intact mRNAs, while decapping factors are only recruited for degradation, suggesting decapping is a rate-limiting step. They also found that decapping factors preferentially bind mRNAs with non-opt codons, consistent with degradation of inefficiently translated mRN. The nuclear machinery targets aberrant RNAs and snoRNAs, which are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. The study provides a resource for future studies on eukotic RNA pathways and mechanisms and integration of mRNA metabolism.
Researchers have discovered a new type of chromatin, called "kairostat," that plays a crucial role in the rapid induction of camalexin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis plants in response to pathogen signals. Camalexin is a potent defense compound that can be induced by bacterial and fungal infections. The study found that camin biosynthesis genes are marked with two epigenetic modifications, trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3me3) and acetylation of lysine 18 of histone 3 (H3ac), which have opposite effects on gene expression. H3me represses gene expression while Hac activates it. Mutants with reduced H3me or Hac showed that both modifications are required for the timing of gene expression and metabolite accumulation at an early stage of stress response. The study suggests that Hme-Hac bivalent chromatin, kstat, controls the timely induction of gene expression upon stress in plants.
Researchers investigated the role of the histone methyltransferase EZ2 (EZH2) in astrocytes that serve as neural stem cells in the adult subventricular zone (SV) of the mouse brain. They found that E2 is required for neurogenesis, independent of its role in SV cell proliferation, as Ink4/Ar-deficiency in E2-deleted SVCs rescues cell proliferation but not neurogenesis. Olig2 is a direct target of EZ, and repression of this bHL transcription factor is critical for neuronal differentiation. E2 also prevents activation of genes associated with non-SV neuronal subtypes. In the human brain, SV cells including astrocytes express EZ, correlating with postnatal neurogenesis. E2 is an epigenetic regulator that distinguishes neurogenic SV astrocytes, orchestrating distinct aspects of adult stem cell biology, with implications for regenerative and oncogenesis.

The study found that E2 expression is a feature of neurogenic astrocytes in the adult brain, and is required for distinct functions regulating cell proliferation and neuronal specification. E directly repressed the Ink4/Ar locus to enable SVC self-renewal. The results establish E2 as a feature of astrocytes in the postnatal SV of the mouse and human brain, and identify separable roles in producing neurons from a multipotent cell. This provides insights into the role of the Poly repressive factor in development and gliagenesis.

In the human, E was expressed in astrocytes and neuronal precursors of the infant SV, suggesting a key role in postnatal neurogenesis. The data indicate E is a critical epigen determinant for maintaining multipotent astrocytes, enabling proliferation and cell specification of a stem population. The results show E has a role in SV neurogenesis distinct from its function in Ink/Ar repression, and rescuing only proliferation not differentiation enabled investigation of additional roles in the neuro capacity of astrocytes.
Researchers studied the relationship between viruses and a type of bacteria called SUP05 in a marine environment with low oxygen levels, known as an oxygen minimum zone (OM). They used a technique called single-cell genomics to analyze 127 individual bacteria and found that about one-third of them were infected with viruses. The viruses were from two types: double-stranded DNA (ds) and single-stranded DNA (ss). The team found that the viruses were more common in areas with lower oxygen levels. They also discovered that some viruses could infect both types of bacteria at the same time, suggesting a new way of working together. By analyzing the DNA of both bacteria and viruses, they found that the viruses stayed in the area for years but were not found in other parts of the ocean. The viruses had genes that allowed them to change the bacteria's way of making energy, which is important for the ocean's chemistry. This shows that viruses and SUP bacteria have a close relationship and can affect the ocean's chemistry in areas with low oxygen.
Researchers have studied the role of TTC26/DY13, a protein involved in the intraflagellar transport (IFT) process, which assembles and maintains cilia/flagella in cells. IFT is a conserved mechanism involving over 20 proteins, but the functions of individual proteins are unclear. Using live imaging and biochemical approaches, they found TTC26/DY13 is an IFT complex protein in mammalian and Chlamdomonas reinhardtii cells. Knocking down TTC26Y13 in zebraf embryos or mutating TTC26Y13 in C reinhardt resulted in short cilia with motility defects. Surprisingly, IFT assembly and speed were normal in dy13 mutant flagella, unlike other IFT complex mutants. Proteomic and biochemical analysis showed specific proteins involved in motility were depleted in dy13 mutant. This suggests different IFT proteins transport different subsets of cargo, explaining IFT complexity.

TTC26/DY13 is not required for ciliogenesis or IFT particle movement, but transports specific motility proteins into cilia. Unlike other IFT proteins, dy13 mutants have flagella, but motility defects. IFT56, conserved in most ciliated organisms, has a conserved role in IFT, but TTC26Y13 has a specialized function. Knocking down I56 in zraf embryos and reinhardt dy13 cells showed motility defects. Comparative proteomics of flagellar proteins in dy13 supports TTC26Y13 transports motility proteins.
Researchers have found that interactions between melanoma cells and lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) in the tumor microenvironment can promote the spread of melanoma to distant organs, leading to poor clinical outcomes. They discovered that expansively growing melanoma cells, but not single invasive cells, interact with LEC in 3D culture to facilitate distant metastasis in mice. To understand the underlying mechanisms, they co-cultured LEC with melanoma cells from primary tumors or metastases. Notably, expansively growing metastatic melanoma cells adopted an invasive sprouting phenotype in 3D matrix dependent on matrix-metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14), Notch, and β-integrin. Unexpectedly, MP14 was necessary for LEC-induced Notch induction and β-integr activation. Moreover, MP and Not were required for L-mediated metastasis zebraf xenograft. This study reveals a unique mechanism by which LEC promotes melanoma metastasis by inducing a reversible switch from 3D growth to invasive sprouting cell phenotype.

The interaction of melanoma cells with LEC induced MP14-dependent Not and β-int activation in expans growing metastatic melanoma cells, leading to invasive sprouting in 3 matrices. Importantly, interaction with LEC increased melanoma xenograft metastasis in vivo, dependent on MP and Not. Researchers used 2D and 3 LEC-melan co-culture models in mouse model, transcript profiling, in vitro studies, and zraf metastasis assay. Xenog mouse dissemination of metastatic WM852 line to organs was increased by L priming. They investigated how Ls in tumor microenvironment affect metastatic melanoma phenotype using 2D and 3 co-culture models to analyze molecular cstalk between cells and lymphatic endothium. Notch receptors 1 and 3 are activated in melan with pro-torigenic functions, but mutations have not been identified in melan. Identified MP-dependent Not upregulation may be important in metastatic melan progression. Results revealed L contact β-integr activation in metast WM and WM cells required for 3Douting WM. Not upulation upon L prim provides support that L-m interaction can reveal clinically relevant molecules for dissemination and has potential for previously pathways contributing lymphatic melan.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for microRNA-9 (miR-9) in the development of dendrites and synaptic transmission in the brain. mi-9 is one of the most abundant microRNAs in the brain, but its function in dendritic and synaptic development was not well understood. To study mi-9 in vivo, scientists created a transgenic mouse line that allowed for conditional inactivation of mi-9 in a spatio-temporally controlled manner. They found that mi-9 controls dendritic growth and synaptic transmission in vivo and that mi-9-mediated downregulation of transcription repressor REST is essential for proper dendritic growth. 

A new reporter mouse line was developed to characterize mi-9 activity in different cell types in the brain. Analysis of the mi-9-SNest-C mouse showed inhibition of mi- results in aberrant dendritic growth in vivo and concomitant impairment in synaptic transmission. A conditional transgenic mouse model was created to study mi- function in vivo. Two strains were derived: a reporter line to monitor mi- activity at single-cell resolution and a line for mi- loss-of-function. The latter revealed a developmental role of mi- in postmit differentiation of neurons as a regulator of dendritic and synaptic in vivo. 

mi-9 was studied in postmit stages of neuronal differentiation and found a critical role in control of dend development in vivo. Other microRN have shown influence dend growth (Wayman et al, 2008; Fi et al 2009; Parrish et 2009; Mag 2010; Pathania 2012; Liu 2013b). The expression of genes orchestrating this process is under post transcriptional regulation. mi-9/REST regulation might play non-developmental roles in mature neurons. A transgenic line was created for conditional inactivation of an mi family spatio-temporally. Analysis of mi-S-C mouse reveals a role in postmit neuronal as regulator of dend through REST expression.
Researchers have found that children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulties with social engagement, which can be measured using eye-tracking methods. However, it is unclear how these difficulties are linked to brain organization in early in life. A study using resting brain scans in a large group of children with and without ASD found that children with ASD have less connection between brain areas involved in social thinking and visual processing. A subgroup of children with ASD, identified by eye-tracking as having pronounced social difficulties, had less connection between brain areas involved in social thinking and visual processing. Less connection between these areas was linked to more severe social and communication difficulties, but only in this subgroup. Early disconnection between social and visual brain areas is a key feature of this subgroup and may be important for future social development and treatment targets for early intervention.

A simple eye-tracking test can identify this subgroup with high precision in early development. Early disconnection between social and visual brain areas is a key feature of this subgroup and may be critical for future social development. Social difficulties are early features of ASD with clinical relevance, but the brain basis is not well understood. The study found that in early life, the brain areas involved in social thinking are disconnected from visual and attention areas in children with ASD. This is important for why social difficulties are a symptom in early ASD and shared across children. The study suggests that heterogeneity in social engagement is important for some, but not all differences in brain connection in children with ASD. This supports that in toddlerhood, ASD is characterized by disconnection between brain areas in social thinking, visual, and attention.

The study aimed to identify how brain connection between areas, measured by resting brain scans, is affected in ASD and if heterogeneity in social engagement is a factor in differences. The study found that children with ASD have less connection between areas involved in social and visual processing. The subgroup with pronounced social difficulties had less connection between areas in social and visual processing. Less connection was linked to more social and communication difficulties, but only in this subgroup. Early disconnection social and visual areas is a feature of this subgroup and may be for future development and treatment.
In Drosophila melanogaster, a type of fruit fly, has a unique hematopoietic system that produces two types of blood cells: plasmatocytes and crystal cells. Unlike vertebrates, where macrophages are the most plastic cells and their specialization depends on the local environment, in Dophila, plmatocytes can differentiate into crystal cells through a process called transdifferentiation. This process occurs in clusters of cells called hemocytes, which are essential for blood homeostasis, the balance between proliferation and differentiation of blood cells. The study of these clusters and their function is crucial to understand how mature blood cells arise and their numbers are controlled.

The research aimed to explain the increase of crystal cells in circulation during larval development, a paradox since mature cells have not been seen dividing during this stage and cells in the lymph gland do not enter circulation under homeostatic conditions. It was found that new crystal cells in third instar larvae originate from plmatocytes through a Notch-dependent process, a cell-to-cell mechanism. The existence of this hematopoiet tissue, relying on structure and signaling to promote homeostasis, creates a new paradigm for understanding Doph hematopoies and parallels with vertebrate systems.

In vertebrates, macrophage specialization depends on the microenvironment they colonize, similarly in Doph, the microenvironment provided by hemocytes induces crystal differentiation from plmatocytes. The study of hematopoiet organs and function is essential to understand how blood cells arise and their numbers are controlled. Doph embryonic hematopois produces two types of mature hemocytes: plmat and crystal, with plmat being phagocytic like vertebrate macrophages.
Researchers have investigated how cells cope with the negative effects of aneuploidy, a condition where a cell has an abnormal number of chromosomes, until new beneficial phenotypes evolve. They found that aneupidy is common in wild yeast isolates, which surprisingly show lower-than-expected expression in many amplified genes. To study this, they created diploid strains with two, three, or four copies of the affected chromosomes and found that gene dosage compensation functions at 10-30% of amplified genes. Genes subject to dosage compensation are under higher constraint in wild populations but show elevated rates of amplification, suggesting copy number variation is buffered at these genes. Aneupidy provides a clear advantage to strain YPS9 by amplifying a gene that escapes compensation. The study presents a model where compensation buffers amplification through aneidy to provide a natural, likely transient route to rapid evolution.
Researchers have discovered a new type of light-sensitive protein called xenops in a type of flatworm called Marig crozier. This protein is different from other light-sensitive proteins called opsins and challenges our understanding of how light-sensing evolved in animals. Initially, xenops was thought to be part of a group called G-coupled opsins, but it actually diverged from this group a long time ago. The study found xenops in two types of cells in the flatworm: ciliary cells in its eyes and extraocular cells around its brain. These extra cells have hundreds of tiny hair-like structures called cilia inside them. Experiments showed that xenops works by coupling to a protein called G in human cells, similar to how other light-sensitive proteins work. This discovery reveals a new type of light-sensing cell that, like those in jawed vertebrates, keeps its cilia inside its own membrane.

Further study of xenops in adult flatworms showed that these extraocular cells have a unique structure, similar to light-sensing cells in jawed vertebrates, with cilia inside their own membrane. Researchers tested xenops in human cells to see if it can form a light-sensitive pigment and which protein it couples with. They found that xenops activates a signal cascade in human cells and localizes with G in a light-sensing cell in the flatworm. They also found xenops in cilia of eye cells, suggesting a motif helps transport xen to cilia.

The discovery of xenops in flatworm eyes challenges our understanding of light-sensing evolution, as it deviates from invertebrate trend of extraocular lightensing and ocular photoreceptors. Xenops is both ocular and extra, found in larva and adult. Findings show similarities between xenops and ops and provide first molecular and functional evidence of ciliary lightensing in flatworms. Xenops ability to drive lightensing in human cells and expression in ciliary cells add evidence for ciliary lightensing in flatworm. Metazoan lightensing is diverse, especially in outer segment where cilia increase surface area through stacking or numbers.
Researchers studied how the development of neurons in fruit flies (Drosophila) to understand how spatial and temporal cues are integrated to create different types of neurons. They focused on neuroblasts, individual cells that can become different types of neurons. The team used a technique called Targeted Dam to see where the protein Hunch binds in two neuroblasts, NB-6 and NB-4, which make different types of neurons. They found that Hunch targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the idea that spatial and temporal cues act independently. Instead, each neuroblast had unique open chromatin, which allowed H to bind to different locations. The team also found that a spatial factor, Gsbax, expressed in NB-6 but not NB-4, had binding sites that matched open chromatin in NB-6 but not NB-4. This suggests that early spatial factors create open chromatin, allowing temporal factors to bind and produce different neurons in each lineage.

The study identified over 100 locations where Hunch binds differently in NB-6 or NB-4, which could be important for neuronal specification. This research builds on previous findings from 20 years ago on spatial and temporal patterning in Dophila neural cells. Doph is a good model to study how spatial and temporal are integrated during neurogenesis due to understanding of neural progenitor lineages and mechanisms. The team tested two models: independent and sequential. In the independent model, temporal factors bind all neuroblasts, while in sequential, factors bind different loci in each neuroblast. They found H targets in NB-6 and NB-4 to discriminate between models.

Spatial and temporal cues create diversity in neurons, in Doph and mammalian lineages. However, how they are integrated is unknown. The team proposed two mechanisms: independent and sequential. In the independent model, temporal factors bind all neuroblasts, while sequential, factors bind loci in each neuro. They found H targets in NB- and- to test models.
Researchers have used a new technique called "photo-switch tweezers" to study how a type of ion channel called the P2 receptor works. This receptor opens a pore in the cell membrane in response to a molecule called ATP. Previous studies had shown how the outer part of the receptor changes when ATP binds, but the mechanism of opening the pore was unclear. The researchers used photo-switch tweez to measure distances between parts of the inner and outer parts of the receptor during activation. They combined these measurements with computer simulations to create detailed models of the open and closed states of the receptor. They found that the pore expands less than expected and that the inner and outer parts move closer together through a "hinge" motion. This provides new insight into how P2 receptors work and a method to study other membrane proteins.
Cell division, or cytokinesis, is the process by which one cell splits into two, is powered by the constriction of an actomyosin contractile ring. It has been assumed that all cells divide by a similar mechanism, but evidence suggests that cytokinesis regulation in individual cells has more variation than realized. In the four-cell Caenorhabditis elegans embryo, each blastomere has a distinct fate, specified by conserved pathways. Using fast-acting temperature-sensitive mutants and acute treatment, we identified cell-type variation in cytokinesis requirement for forminK-1-dependent filament-actin (F-act) cytoskeleton in one cell (P), this cytokinesis is cell-intrinsically regulated, whereas in another (EMS) variation is cell-exinsically regulated, dependent on Src-1 signaling and contact with neighbor cell P. Thus, both cell-intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms control cytokinesis in individual types and protect against division when contractile ring weakened.

In the four-cell C. elegans embryo, cell-type differences were found in functional and temporal window formin-1 activity, not myosin-I activity during cytokinesis. Formin-1 (ts) embryos showed cell variation in temporal requirement among blastomeres. In previous one-cell analysis, cytokinesis failed 100% with formin-1 inactivation by thermal shift at any time before mid-constriction. Fast-acting temperature-sensitive alleles inactivated two proteins for contractile constriction in one embryo: myosin-II and diaphan formin. Cell-specific variation found in four embryos formin-1, not myos-II. Our data show both-intrinsic extrinsic mechanisms contribute to cytokinesis and promote when contractile weakened in specific within four C. elegans embryo. Each cell has unique identity and scored constriction during cytokinesis.
Researchers have discovered a new role for the flagellar sheath, a membranous structure surrounding the flagella of some bacteria, in the release of a potent immunogenic molecule called lipopolysaccharide. This molecule is found in the flagellar sheath of the bacteria Vibrio fischer, a mutualist of the Hawaiian bobtail squid, and Vibrio cholera, a human pathogen. The study used the squid-vibrio symbiosis model to investigate the function of the enigmatic flagellar sheath and found that rotation of the sheathed flagella promotes the release of lipyscharide. This challenges the previous hypothesis that the sheath allows bacteria to evade host immune responses by concealing the flagellin subunit. Instead, the sheath triggers immune responses in the host. This finding has implications for understanding bacterial pathogens with sheathed flagella and raises questions about the function of sheathed flagellum.

The researchers used the squid-vrio model to study the effect of flagellar sheath on host recognition and found that rotation of sheathed flagella mediates the release of immunogenic LPS in V. fischer and its pathogenic con V. cholera. The flagellar sheath has been difficult to study due to lack of mutations that result in loss of sheath in sheathed flagella. The role of sheath, even in relation to motility, is poorly characterized. This new observation furthers understanding of the enigmatic sheath and its contribution to virulence.

Further work will build on these discoveries and clarify mechanisms of signaling during squid-vrio symbiosis. This includes characterizing composition of LPS released by V. fischer during flag rotation, identifying squid receptors that recognize V. fischer LPS, and determining role of flagin in host responses. Previous reports of flag-mediated immunity have been limited to responses to protein flagin. Flagin monomers are prevalent in secretome of V. cholera and V.
Researchers have discovered a process called chromosomal restructuring during genome elimination in plants, which occurs when two plants with different centromere histone H3 genes are hybridized. This results in shattered chromosomes being formed from the genome of the haploid inducer, consistent with genomic catastrophes affecting a single lagg chromosome compartmentalized within a micronucle. Analysis of breakpoint junctions implicates breaks followed by non-homous end joining (NHE) or stalled repair. Furthermore, mutation of NHE factor Ligase 4 results in enhanced haploid recovery. The heritability and stability of rearranged chromosome suggest a potential for enduring genomic novelty. This study provides a tractable system for investigating causes and mechanisms of genomic rearrangements similar to those associated with human disorders.
Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a virus that causes several types of cancer in humans. EBV has proteins that help cells grow and stop them from dying, which can lead to uncontrolled growth. One of these proteins, LMP, is important for survival of EB-immortalized cells. However, during early infection, EB causes rapid cell growth with low levels of LMP and little death. Researchers wanted to understand how cells survive without LMP/NF early on. They used a method to study regulation of apoptosis and found a change from uninfected cells to infected and immortal cells. This change is unique to virus-infected cells and relies on regulation of M-1 and B-1 by the EB3 protein. This study shows a new role for EB3 in suppressing death with implications for EB lymphoma.

 EB3 regulated the profile of EB-infected cells and suppressed by promoting M-1 localization and increasing B-1 transcription. B-1 is regulated by EB factor EB2 and LMP-induced NF. The study found human blood cells depend on for survival while EB suppressed apoptosis by upregulating M-1, followed by B-1. Mechanistically, a new role for viral protein EB3 in resistance during early and late EB-induced cell proliferation was identified. Human blood cells depend on for survival and EB upregulates additional proteins to suppress induced by antagonism. Experiments predicted EB-inf cells are primed due to combined effects of M-1 and-2 during proliferation with protection by-1 in immortal cells.
Researchers studied the genetic and environmental factors that influence the production of specialized metabolites in Arabidopsis thaliana, a plant species that produces diverse chemicals to cope with environmental challenges. They analyzed 797 natural Arabidopsis accessions from Europe and found that geography, environment, demography, and genetics all contribute to the variation in specialized metabolites and their distribution. The study suggests that genetic loci controlling metabolism have independently generated alleles, leading to within-species convergence, providing new insights into the forces shaping and distribution of allelic variation for local adaptation.

The study focused on the glucosinolate (GSL) pathway, a known biosynthetic pathway in Arabidopsis, with major loci for natural variation. The high allelic diversity at these loci raises questions how pathways with this level of diversity and variation pass through speciation boundaries. Brassica species have similar genetic variation at GS-long and GS-OP creating same chemotyp variation in Arabid. Understanding genetic, demographic, and environmental factors shaping a trait in a population is key to evolution.

The researchers used a family of specialized metabolites, aliphatic GSL, and measured in Arabid seeds to query genetics, geography, environment, and demography intersecting to shape chemotyp variation across Europe. The intersection of environmental, demography, and genomic complexity gives rise to metabolic variation across a species. To understand genomic, demography, and pressure shaping metabolism within a species, the Arabid glucosolate (GSL) pathway was used as a model.
Apoptotic caspases, previously thought to be tumor suppressors, can promote tumor growth and proliferation under certain conditions. In Drosila, a well-studied neoplastic model, oncogenic mutations in the proto-oncogene Ras (RasV12) maintain cells in an 'und-like condition and convert caspases from suppressors to promotors. Instead of killing cells, casases generate intra- and extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which recruit and activate macrophage-like cells that signal back to tumorous epithelial cells to activate oncogenic JNK signaling. JNK amplifies casase activity, constituting a feedback loop. Interfering with the loop reduces neoplastic behavior and improves organism survival. Casases initiate a feedback loop involving tumorous epithelial cells and macroage-like cells necessary for uncontrolled growth and invasive behavior.
Researchers investigated how people perceive the duration of social interactions and found that it is influenced by oxytocin, a hormone involved in social behavior. They showed that people perceive social interactions as shorter than non-social ones, and this effect is stronger in those with lower autistic tendencies. Intranasal oxytocin administration restored this effect in less socially proficient individuals, while oxytoc antagonist diminished it in more proficient ones. This suggests time is subjective and tied to personality, and oxyin plays a role in social cognition. Autistic traits are linked to lower oxyin levels, which can be improved with oxy administration. The study also found that socially proficient individuals are more susceptible to the effect than less proficient ones. To test if oxyin is involved, they gave oxy antagonist to proficient individuals and found it reduced the effect. They then gave oxy to less proficient and found it increased the effect, indicating oxy plays a role in social interaction perception.
Researchers studied how mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 virus's Spike protein, specifically the receptor-binding domain (RBD), affect its ability to bind to the ACE2 protein on human cells. This interaction is crucial for the virus to infect cells. They analyzed five common RBD mutations (K417N, K417, N501, E484, and S477) and two ACE mutations (S19 and K26) on the R/ACE interaction. Most of these mutations increased the binding affinity, except for K417, which decreased it. The study suggests that N501 and S477 mutations enhance transmission by increasing binding, K417 facilitates immune evasion, and E484 enhances both binding and immune evasion. 

The researchers also looked at combinations of these mutations in SARS-CoV Alpha, Beta, and Gamma variants. They found that most increased the R/ACE interaction, except for K417. The study suggests that carriers of ACE variants with these mutations may be at higher risk of infection and severe disease. In contrast to R mutations, ACE variants' effects are more relevant to carriers of these mutations. The study also examined ACE binding of combinations of R mutations, including those in VOC-202-02, a subset of Alpha with E484 mutation, and Beta and Gamma variants. 

The SARS-Co-2 virus enters cells through Spike protein interaction with ACE on cell surfaces. The RBD binds to ACE's membrane portion. The study aimed to assess how R mutations enhance ACE binding or facilitate immune evasion. They undertook a detailed analysis of R and ACE at 37°C, avoiding common pitfalls.
Researchers have created a detailed map of how genes interact with each other in a type of cell, called a metazoan cell, to understand how they affect development and disease. They used a method called combinatorial RNA interference and single-cell imaging to study 21 features of Drosophila cells. The map includes 136 genes involved in processes such as signaling, chromatin, and cell cycle regulation. The study found that the Ras pathway interacts with the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex, a relationship also found in human cancer cells. This research provides a way to reconstruct regulatory networks and understand the effects of genetic changes.

The researchers used a combination of RNA interference, high-throughput imaging, and modeling to study gene interactions in Dophila cells. They selected 136 genes involved in key processes, including signaling, chromatin, cell cycle, and protein control. The map is the largest of its kind in metazo cells to date. They found an interaction between Ras/MAP signaling and SW/SWI regulators of chromatin remodelling, confirmed in vivo. The study shows interactions can be mapped at a large scale and used with other data to identify relationships.

The approach revealed a detailed diagram of regulatory and causal relationships during the cell cycle. It highlighted an unexpected link between chromatin remodelling and Ras signaling. The researchers found interactions between the SWI/S complex and the SWI-associated chromatin remeller.
Researchers have identified a gene called CYP73450 in the plant species Primula that determines the length of the style, a part of the reproductive organ in flowers. This gene is part of a supergene, a group of tightly linked genes that control heterosty, a widespread adaptation that promotes outbreeding in plants. Hetery is controlled by the Slocus super, which determines the arrangement of reproductive organs and incompatibility between two morphs, but the identities of the component genes were unknown. CYP50 is only present in the short-styled morph and is expressed in short styles, its loss leads to long styles. The gene arose by duplication in the Primaceae lineage and shows accelerated molecular evolution. The study provides a mechanistic explanation for Prim style dimorphism and sheds light on the evolution of Sloc as a model for complex supergene.
Researchers have investigated the role of kisspept neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (KissARH) in regulating gonadotrop-releasing hormone (GnRH) release. These neurons co-express kisspein, neurokinin B (NKB), dynorphin, and glutamate, and are thought to provide an episodic excitatory drive to GRH neurons. Using optogenetics, whole-cell electrophysiology, molecular biology, and single-cell RT-PCR in mice, they found that high-frequency stimulation of kissAR neurons evoked the release of excitatory NKB and inhibitory dynorph neuropeptides, synchronizing kissAR neuronal activity. This synchronized activity caused robust excitation of GRH neurons through a mechanism involving glutamateric input to preoptic kiss neurons from kissAR neurons. The researchers propose that kissAR neurons play a dual role in driving episodic GRH secretion through differential release of peptide and amino neurotransmitters to coordinate reproductive function.

 Studies have shown that fibers expressing kisspe or co-expressing kisspe are localized in the median eminence of mice and rats, and activation of kissAR neurons with optogen stimulation generates LH release in vivo, thought to be kisspein-mediated depolarization of GRH terminals. High-frequency activation of kissAR induced N-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), modulated by co-releasedorphin, and synchronization of kiss neurons. Activation of kiss neurons coleased glutamate that excited rostral kiss neurons. Combination of synchronization and excitation of rostral neurons resulted in robust excitation GRH.

KissAR neurons communicate with rostral neurons via glutamate, stimulating burst-firing of rostral neurons. Activation of rostral releases kisspein to excite GRH via GPR signaling, stimulating release at preovulatory surge. Kisspein, GPR, N, Tac3, and GRH are required for normal fertility.
Researchers have found that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) plays a crucial role in maintaining the state of pluripotency, which is the ability of cells to become any cell type, and favors mesodermal differentiation over neural differentiation. However, the mechanisms behind this process are not well understood. They discovered that BMP suppresses differentiation by downregulating Cdh, a protein that is involved in early stages of neural and mesermal differentiation. Loss of Cdh is necessary for differentiation of plurotent cells, and suppressing Cdh activity rescues the BMP-imposed block to differentiation. BMP acts before and independently of Cdh to prime plurotent cells for mesod differentiation, reinforcing the block to neural. This suggests that differentiation depends not only on external cues but also on morphetic events that control receptivity to those cues, and explains how a key plurot signal, BMP, feeds into this mechanism.

BMP maintains pluripotency by keeping Cdh, which interferes with neural and mesermal differentiation. High levels of BMP impose posterior identity on cells, priming them for meserm and incompatible with neural fate. These findings explain why BMP can protect plurotency and promote meserm at the same time. The study identified loss of Cdh as a limiting event in early neural differentiation and proposes BMP controls by maintaining Cdh. A strategy of changing cell adhesion to transcription controls fate is used in development to coordinate morphogenesis. BMP target Id imposes proximal identity on undifferentiated cells, priming them for meserm. Id blocks neural differentiation by shifting plurotent positional identity, not by inhibiting neural transcription or activating meserm.

BMP protects plurotency and suppresses neural specification, but mechanisms unclear. It is required for meserm in vivo, but how it favors mesermal over neural fates is unclear. The study found that BMP maintains plurot by keeping Cdh, which interferes with neural and mesermal differentiation. High levels of BMP impose posterior identity on cells, priming them for mes and incompatible with neural.
Researchers have identified a protein called C120 that plays a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of centrioles, which are essential components of the centrosome in quies cells. Centrioles are inherently asymmetric and differ in morphology and function, but how this asymmetry is established and maintained during quiescence was unknown. The study found that depleting C120 in mouse and human cells leads to accumulation of pericentri material, including pericentr, C5ap2, ninein, and C170, resulting in increased microtubule-nucleation at the centome. This causes loss of C120 leads to aberrant dyin-dependent trafficking of centomal proteins, dispersal of centolar satellites, and defective ciliary assembly and signaling. The results indicate C120 helps maintain centome homeostasis by inhibiting untely maturation of the centole and defines a new molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of ciliopathies such as Jeune Thoracic Dystrophy and Jert syndrome.
In the developing retina, neurons and glial cells called Müller cells (MCs) play a crucial role in maturing neural circuits, but little is known about how they communicate. Researchers investigated neuron-glia in the retina and found that retinal waves induce calcium transients in MCs. During cholinergic waves, MC transients were blocked by muscarinic acetylcholine antagonists, while glutamaterg waves were blocked by ionotropic glutamate antagonists, indicating MCs respond to the neurotransmitter used in retinal waves. Using a glutamate sensor, the decline in MC transients was caused by reduced glutamate reaching MCs. These studies show neurons and MCs interact during retinal maturation, enabled by neurotransmitter spillo from retinal synapses.

 Whole-cell recordings of retinal ganglion cells and two-photon imaging of glutamate sensors in MC showed neurotransmitters released during retinal waves induce MC transients. The study found retinal waves correlated with trans in a large proportion of MCs, demonstrating activity in both neuronal and glial networks at this age. The mechanism between neurons and MC observed during cholin ret waves is similar to previous findings in cortex and hippocampus, where cholin stimulation leads to astrocyte trans via musinic acetylch receptors and IP3. Whether activity guides MC development is unclear. Physiological results indicate MCs express multiple receptors, allowing control activity to be sustained as synchronization shifts from cholin to glutamg signaling. The proportion of MC responding to waves decreased from P9 to P11, despite retinal waves. MCs express various receptors, including glutam and cholin, trans at different ages could be evoked by neurotrans released retinal. Researchers explored which transmitters modulate neuron-MC at different ages.
Researchers have developed a new method to estimate the time of death, known as postmortem interval (PM), using microbes found on a decomposing bodies. Current methods, such as forensic entomology, can be inaccurate by several days or even months. The study used a mouse model to test the idea that microbes change in a predictable way over time, allowing for an estimate of PM within 3-48 days. The research provides insight into the bacterial and fungal ecology of a decomposing bodies and suggests that microbial data can be used as a tool for estimating PM.

The study tested hypotheses about the role of microbes in decomposition and whether changes in communities are predictable over time, which is crucial for using microbes as a "clock" to estimate PM. The data not only helps understand the microbial ecology of decomposition but also the feasibility of using microbes as evidence. The researchers rigorously tested if microbial change is measurable and directional during decomposition to allow accurate estimates of past events like PM.

A previous study by Pech et al. (2013) showed skin and mouth bacterial communities changed consistently over 5 days in swine corpses. This study expands on that by characterizing microbial change in three external and one internal sites in 40 mouse corpses over 48 days. The approach is different from prior work which models were evaluated by explaining all data points, being fit to all points (Pech et al, 2013). The study demonstrates that microbial ecology of decomposing has potential to be a forensic tool for estimation of PM.

A laboratory experiment was conducted to characterize microbial changes in mice as they decomposed on soil for 48 days. Bacteria, archaea, and fungi were analyzed using DNA sequencing for each sample.
Researchers have investigated the origins of the Hox gene family, which plays a crucial role in patterning the anterior-posterior axis in bilaterian animals. They found that Hox proteins interact with TALE transcription factors, which are also present in some non-bilater phyla, raising the question of how this interaction evolved to provide positional information. By studying unicellular and multicellular lineages, they discovered that Hox-TALE networks emerged from an ancestral motif present in Hox and other protein families. These networks experienced additional innovations that differentiated Hox functions along body plans.

Hox genes are expressed along the anteroposterior axis of bilian animals, providing positional information during embryogenesis. Their pattering roles contributed to morphological diversification of bilian organisms during evolution. Although networks rely on molecular properties, they originated from an ancestral mode kept in home gene families. The study describes the molecular underlying H-TA patter system in Bilateria established stepwise during eukote evolution.

H genes display dissimilar patterns or are absent in nonilater lineages, showing embryonic development mechanisms are not universal. Cnidaria is the only nonilater phylum with a H repertoire, while others lack H genes. This raises how H acquired axial functions during metazo evolution. Bil H patter relies on P and Me proteins, present in nonilater phyla.
Researchers used super-resolution microscopy to study the behavior of AMPA receptors (AMPAR) in synapses, which are crucial for transmitting signals between neurons. They found that most AMPs labeled with small fluorescent dyes or quantum dots (QDs) were confined to nanodomains within post-synaptic densities (PSDs) for 15 minutes or longer, while less than 10% were extrasynaptic and highly mobile. In contrast, AMPs labeled with larger QDs were mostly extrasynaptic. Contrary to the hypothesis that AMP entry is limited by PSD slots, findings suggest that AMPs rapidly enter stable nanodomains in PSDs with lifetimes over 15 minutes and don't accumulate extrasyn membranes. Using QDs, they observed dynamics of nanodom AMPs in synapses for periods up to 60 minutes, observing 126 synapses. Findings were similar to those using spars labeled QDs and organic dyes on live neurons. AMP localization is predominantly at synaptic regions, with typically one nanomain per synapse. Factors influencing diffusion of surface-expressed AMPs include size and linker length. Labeling with QDs is problematic due to size. Using QDs, no accumulation of extrasynaptic receptors was found, instead motion is constrained in PSD nanodom.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism by which neurons respond to a lack of oxygen, or hypoxia, in the brain. They found that a pathway called SUMylation, which adds a small molecule called SUMO to sodium channels, increases the flow of sodium ions into the cell. This happens quickly, within 40 seconds, and is necessary for the cell to respond to hypox. The SUMylation of sodium channels changes how they work, making them more likely to open and let in more sodium ions. This is important because sodium flow is crucial for brain function and damage from lack of oxygen is a major cause of brain problems. The researchers suggest that this pathway and the sodium channels could be targets for treatments to prevent brain damage from lack of oxygen.
Researchers have developed a mathematical model to understand how temperature affects the spread of Ross River virus, a mosquito-borne disease found in Australia and potentially emerging worldwide. The model shows that the virus transmission peaks at moderate temperatures around 26.4°C and declines at temperatures below 17.0 and above 31.5°C. This means the disease is likely to be present year-round in tropical areas but seasonal in temperate regions, leading to a peak in human cases during certain times of the year. Climate change is expected to increase transmission in temperate areas where most people live but decrease in tropical areas where temperatures are already near the optimal.

The study highlights the importance of understanding temperature's impact on mosquito-borne diseases as new pathogens emerge and spread. Current models assume transmission increases with temperature, but this is not always the case, leading to inaccurate predictions of disease patterns and climate change effects. Thermal responses vary among diseases and vectors, yet few models exist for many diseases. The researchers created a temperature-dependent model for Ross River virus using data from two mosquito species and found a general pattern of optimal transmission at intermediate temperatures, driven by mosquito lifespan, but uncertain upper and lower limits.

The study found the strongest temperature effect on disease in temperate regions where temperatures vary rapidly around the optimal temperature. In areas with temperatures above and below the optimal, temperature's effect may be masked in linear models. Upper limits of mosquito-borne transmission, a concern for climate change, are determined by vector traits like fecundity and survival rather than rate-based traits like biting or pathogen development.
Researchers investigated the relationship between beta oscillations in the motor cortex and movement onset in macaques. They recorded neural activity from the motor cortex while the animals performed a neurofeedback task, bringing their beta power to an instructed state and then executing an arm reach. Results showed that a reduction in beta power preceded faster movement onset, while an increase in power preceded slower onset. Further, population activity shifted from a movement state during beta oscillations, whether induced by neurofeedback or naturally occurring during tasks. This establishes a neural basis for slowed onset periods of beta activity. 

The shift in population was also seen in natural oscillations during reaching, suggesting beta reflects common spiking patterns across tasks. The study ties together behavioral correlates of beta with how the cortex encodes movement through population activity. Increasing and decreasing motor beta with neurofeedback precedes slower and faster onset times, supporting a hypothesis that oscillations slow movement onset (Gilbertson et al, 2005). Results add to findings of elevated power prior and after trained movements (Donoghue et al,199; Mur and Fetz,199; Sanes Donue,199). Behavioral from neuro-induced beta matches a movement-slow role (Gilbertson et,200), but individual unit responses were different across tasks. Cortical population shifts from a threshold when subjects produce beta in task or naturally produce in. Mechanistic generators used to reconcile discrepancies in beta correlates. Units exhibited different activity during neurofeedback beta and natural oscillations, but population analyses show beta promotes a movement-slow state in both tasks, matching behavior.
Researchers studied the role of TRAF2, a component of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathway, in regulating cell survival and inflammation in the skin. TR2 deficient mice die at birth, so its role in adult tissues is not well understood. TR2 RING, a part of TR2, has been disputed as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, but requires sphingosine-1-phosphate, generated by sphingosine kinase 1, to function. Keratinocyte-specific deletion of TR2, but not sph1 deficiency, disrupted TN mediated NFκ and MAP signaling, causing epidermal hyperplasia and psoriatic skin inflammation. This inflammation was driven by TN, cell death, non-canonical NFκ, and adaptive immune system, representing a model of psoriasis. TR2 has tissue-specific functions not overlapping with sph1.

TR2 absence delayed TN-induced NF and MAP activation, and increased sensitivity to killing by TN in cells. TR2 deficient keratinocytes in vivo resulted in ps-like epidermal hyperasia and inflammation. Unlike TN-dependent skin conditions, such as IK2 epider knock (Pasakis et al, 2002) and cp mutant (Gerach et, we reversed this phenotype by deleting TN and NF2 genes. Our results highlight TR role in protecting keratinocytes from death and downregulating responses, supporting intrinsic defects in keratin initiate psoriasis skin.

TR2 deficient keratinocytes do not need bacteria to produce TN, TN-induced sets a cycle of inflammation. Concurrent deletion of TN in TR2 deficient keratinocytes breaks cycle and prevents apoptosis keratin and onset psoriasis phenotype. Keratinocytes from wild-type, TR2KO, and sph1- mice were tested, TN signaling delayed in TR2 deficient, not sph1 deficient. TR2, but not sph1, keratin were sensitive to TN-induced death, associated with reduction in FLIP and caspase cleavage. In absence TN, TR2 keratin still produce inflammatory via non-canonical NF pathway generating ps-like phenotype but slower. These cytokines recruit immune cells, including neutrophils and IF cells.
Researchers have studied how synaptic vesicles (SVs) are recycled after being released at synapses. They found that SVs are quickly taken back in by the cell through a process called endocytosis, forming large endytic vacuoles called bulkosomes. These bulkosomes then disappear and new SVs reappear. To understand this process, they looked at synapses without dynamin 1 and 3, which are proteins that help with endocyt, and clathrin, another protein involved in endocyt. They found that bulkosomes formed normally, but didn't convert into new SVs without dyn 1 and 3. Clath was also not needed for this conversion. This suggests a new pathway for SV formation that doesn't need dyn 1 and 3 or clath, and happens during intense activity.

Synaptic vesicles store and release neurotransmitters at synapses. After release, their membranes are taken back in and recycled to make new SVs. Clath-mediated endocyt is thought to play a role in this process. However, a recent study suggested dyn 1 and 3 are needed for endyt and clath is involved in SV budding from bulkosomes. To explore this, researchers looked at clath's role in SV formation from bulkosomes after stimulation. Synapses had no clath before stimulation, including those without dyn 1 and 3. This shows dyn and 3 aren't needed for endyt and their absence delays, but doesn't stop, SV formation from membranes.
Researchers conducted a study to identify biomarkers of glucocorticoid (GC) action in humans. Glucocorticoids are commonly prescribed drugs, but there is no existing biomarker to quantify their effects. The study involved 10 patients with primary adrenal insufficiency and no other endocrinopathies, who were admitted to an in-patient clinic for physiological GC exposure and withdrawal. A randomized, single-blind, crossover design was used. No serious adverse events were observed besides mild fatigue and salt craving. The study analyzed transcriptomes of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipose tissue, plasma miRNA, and serum metabolomics using multi-omics. A transcript profile from two tissues and multiomic cluster was identified, predictive of GC exposure. MicroRNA (mi-122p) correlated with genes and metabolites regulated by GC exposure was identified (p=0.009) and replicated in independent studies with varying GC exposure (0.01≤p≤0.05). Results provide basis for biomarker discovery to measure GC effects, allowing individualize and optimize therapy, and shed light on disease related to unphysiological GC, such as cardiovascular and obesity.
Researchers studied how a protein complex called mTOR1 responds to amino acids in cells. They found that amino acids activate mTOR1 by causing it to move to a part of the cell called lysosomes. This movement happens within 2 minutes of adding amino and peaks at 5 minutes. This process is linked to the presence of amino in lysosomes and is sustained over time. Two proteins, Sestr2 and vacu, are negative regulators of mTOR activity in this system. Phosphorylation of m1 targets is delayed compared to its movement to lysosomes, suggesting m1 moves from lys surface to target other parts of the cell.

 To understand this process, researchers created a fluorescent version of amino leucine to track m1 movement in cells. Leucine is a key activator of m1 and has been shown to accumulate in lysosomes and activate m on its own. They tested other leuc analogues and found lysosomes are crucial for m activation but the process is more complex than thought. They expressed m1 subunits with green fluorescent tags to track movement in live cells. A leuc methyl ester with a fluorescent tag caused sustained movement of the complex due to its accumulation in lysosomes. This provided a dynamic view of m response to amino acids.

 Results support that amino activate m in the cell interior and multiple types may be involved. Leuc is sensed by Sestr proteins, while arginine entering lysosomes via SLC9 is also important for m activation.
Researchers have found that modifying a protein antigen, Ovalbumin (OVA), with a specific sugar molecule called Lewis X (Le) changes how it is processed by the immune system's dendritic cells, leading to a stronger and different type of immune response. Dendritic cells take in antigens and direct them to specific compartments within the cell using C-type lectin receptors that recognize sugar structures. By adding Le to OVA, it directs it to the receptor M1 (M1) lectin. This modification favors the development of a specific type of helper T cell (Th1) and enhances the activation of another type of T cell (CD8). In contrast, presenting the unmodified OVA requires a high amount of antigen and a signal from the Toll-like receptor (TLR), but Le modification reduces the amount needed by 100 times and eliminates the need for TLR signaling. The enhanced activation of CD8 T cells by LeOVA is dependent on M1 as shown by reduced frequencies in M1 deficient mice. Moreover, M1 presentation of LeVA does not require transporters or Cathepsin and is observed after prolonged storage in Rab+AMP+ compartments. The study shows that controlled modification of antigens can significantly influence their processing and the strength of the immune response and should be considered for optimizing vaccination strategies.
Researchers studied the bacterium Burkholderia thailandensis, which uses a signaling system called quorum sensing (QS) to regulate hundreds of genes. They found that QS activates a type VI secretion system (TSS), a system that produces toxins that kill other bacteria. The researchers showed that TSS is necessary to control the growth of QS mutants, which don't produce the QS signal, in mixed cultures of the two types of B. thailandensis. However, the QS mutants outcompete the normal bacteria in liquid cultures because they don't need to be in close to each other, and there's a cost to producing the QS signal. The normal bacteria's growth advantage over the mutants on a surface depends on the TSS system. QS activates TSS to stop the growth of QS mutants, serving as a kind of "police" to control them. This is a new role for TSS in controlling QS mutants within the same species. 

The researchers found that normal B. thensis can police QS mutants by controlling TSS-mediated toxicity and immunity. In liquid cultures where TSS doesn't work due to lack of contact, QS mutants have an advantage over normal bacteria because of the cost of QS. They describe how normal bacteria can mitigate the cost of QS by regulating T-dependent proteins that hinder growth of mutants. This is a form of "policing" where QS-competent bacteria outcompete signal non-operators in absence of T-contact growth system. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Myxococcus xanthus have been policed by QS deviants before. This study shows a new way to limit QS growth in groups. T. thensis TSS kills other Proteobacteria, but not B.ensis, and is important for interspecies competition. The study shows TSS doesn't kill in liquid cultures. Results are from at least three replicates.
Researchers studied how the connection between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex develops in neonatal mice to understand how it affects cognitive performance. They found that the hippocampus, specifically the intermediate and ventral part, drives the prefrontal cortex's oscillations through direct axonal projections. Optogenetic manipulation of glutamatergic neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus showed that activation of pyramidal neurons in the intermediate and ventral part, but not dorsal, increased prefrontal oscillations. This suggests that the hippocampus, particularly the intermediate and ventral part, drives the prefrontal cortex's oscillations early in life. The study provides evidence that the hippocampus, specifically the intermediate ventral part, is the origin of long-range coupling in the developing brain.
RNA polymerase II (RNAPI) is a crucial for transcription in mammalian cells, and its activity is regulated by post-translational modifications. The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNAPI is composed of heptapeptide repeats with a consensus sequence Y-S-P-T-S-P-S-P-S. Serine phosphorylation at positions 5 and 7 mark transcription initiation, while phosphorylation at position 2 is associated with elongation. In vertebrates, the CTD has non-canonical substitutions of serine to lysine at position 7, which can be acetylated. This study found mono- and di-methylation of lysine 7 residues (Kme1 and K2) in the CTD, which occur early in transcription and precede or accompany serine and serine phosphorylation. In contrast, acetylation of lysine 7 is associated with elongation, serine phosphorylation, and mRNA expression. An unexpected balance between RNAPI methylation and acetylation at promoters fine-tunes gene expression levels.

RNAPI binds to promoters in a hypophosphorylated state, before the CTD becomes phosphorylated at serine 5 and 7, marking early stages of transcription. Productive elongation is characterized by increase phosphorylation of serine 2 throughout gene bodies, with highest levels around transcription end sites. The study produced antibodies to C-Kme and C-K2 show these modifications precede or accompany phosphorylation of 5 and 7, upstream of 2 phosphorylation. Biochemical and genome-wide approaches show C-K methylation present at promoters of productively transcribed genes, but earliest stages of transcription. Mutation of C-K residues is compatible with viability of mouse fibroblasts, and ser phosphorylation and RNAPI localization independent of presence or absence K residues. Acetylation C-K residues associated with inducible expression. Detection of K1 and K2 increased with number K residues in mammalian C cell lines, flanked different amino acids. Mono and diethylation C-K residues detected in hypophosphorylated forms RNAPI, suggesting methylation associated early stages. Results suggest productive transcription active genes with RNAPI recruitment promoters modulated level C-K modifications, methylation less transcription, acylation highest expressed.
Skeletal muscle satellite cells play a crucial role in muscle repair and regeneration by exiting quiescence to proliferate and self-renew. To understand how they maintain quiescence, researchers studied gene expression changes in satellite cells after injury. They found transcripts encoding RNA-binding proteins, including Tristetrolin, were significantly changed. Tristrol promotes decay of MyD mRNA, which regulates myogenic commitment, by binding to its 3' untranslated region. Upon activation, p38/β MAPK phosphorylates and inactivates Tristrol, stabilizing MyD mRNA. Satellite cell knockdown of Tristrol prematurely activates cells, enabling MyD accumulation and fusion into myofibers. Regulation by Tristrol is a critical post-transcriptional mechanism controlling satellite homeostasis.

MyD upregulates its own transcription, triggering a rapid feed-forward loop driving commitment to myoblasts. Researchers propose Trist may also downregulate MyD and other transcripts in myoblasts, forming a quiescent population or re-entering quies after injury. Muscle injury activates p/β MAP, phosphorylating Tr, initiating a feed circuit committing cells to myogenic lineage. Regeneration requires cells to exit quies but also renew quies upon completion. Tr suppresses transcripts for activation as a mechanism exiting quies.

Trist is present in quies cells, rapidly inhibited by pβ MAP within minutes of activation, and reduces MyD half-life. Loss from muscle preciously activates cells, promoting MyD and aberrant cycle entry. pβ MAP-dependent phosphorylation of Tr suggests Tr maintains quies. Tr inactivating MyD is consistent with suppressing proogenic targets.
Mice lacking the interleukin-10 (IL-10) receptor develop severe inflammatory bowel disease early in life, but the role of IL-10 in regulating intestinal macrophage function during development and whether macrophage-intrinsic IL-10 signaling prevents colitis in infancy is unclear. Researchers studied IL-10 deficient mice and their littermate controls from birth to 14 weeks of age, examining histology, inflammatory gene expression, cellular composition of the lamina propria, and luminal bacterial communities. They found no signs of colitis in the first two weeks, but inflammation and macrophage dysfunction in the third week, concurrent with weaning and intestinal microbiota diversification. IL-10 did not directly regulate microbiota development. Macrophage depletion inhibited colitis development, while absence of IL-10 on macrophages sensitized mice to colitis. This indicates IL-10 mediated macrophage regulation in early postnatal period is crucial for preventing murine colitis.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabitis elegans, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) play a crucial role in regulating transposons and germline genes. The process of siRNA production is mediated by the mutator complex, which synthesizes high levels of siRNAs through an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. However, the steps between siRNA recognition by the pi pathway and si amplification by the mut complex are unknown. Researchers have identified the Tudor domain protein SIM-1 as acting downstream of pi production and upstream of mutator-dependent siRNA biogenesis. SIM-1 localizes to distinct cytoplasmic foci adjacent to P granules and Mutator foci, two separate condensates that are sites of pi-dependent mRNA recognition and mut complex si amplification, respectively. This suggests a role for perinuclear condens in organizing the pi pathway and promoting regulation by the mut complex.

 SIM-1 is required at the step between the pi pathway and mut complex, bridging the gap between primary and secondary phases of the C elegans silencing pathway. It localizes to cytoplasmic foci near P granules, gran, and Mut foci, implicating distinct peruclear condens in regulation by the pi pathway and mut complex. This identifies SIM-1 as a factor downstream PR-1 mediating production of siRNAs by the mut complex and suggests a role for peruclear condens promoting regulation by pi and mut.

In C elegans, a RNA amplification dependent on mut includes an RNA-dependent polymer synthesizing secondary siRN from pi-targeted mRN to trigger heritable silencing. Several proteins localize or near P gran, including GL-2-3-4, D-19, L-14, and VB1. One of these could serve function similar to DE-12, shuttling pi-target mRN into SIM- and Mut foci.
Researchers studied the behavior of Purkin neurons in zebraf larvae, which are crucial for cerebellar function, to determine if they exhibit bistability in awake animals. They recorded intracellularly from Purkin neurons in unanhetized larval zraf and found bistability, with tonic firing at depolarized and bursting at hyperpolar membrane potentials. Purkin neurons could switch between states spontaneously or with current injection. Activation of AMP receptors by climbing fibers was sufficient to trigger bursts, while GABA and NMDA receptors were not required. Recording Purkin membrane potential and motor spikes showed initiation correlated with increased EPs and depolarization. Developmentally, bistability was observed after Purkin specification and persisted until late larval stages.

In zraf, two types of glutamateric excitation were observed: strong from climbing fibers and weak from parallel fibers, mediated by AMP receptors. Bistability in Purkin neurons has been reported in vitro in mammals and in vivo under anesthesia, but not in awake animals. Researchers recorded Purkin neurons from larval zraf from 4 to 19 days post-fertilization to study intracellular dynamics in the context of fictive motor output. Bist may be a property of developing network and not present in adult cerebellum.

The study found zraf Purkin exhibit bist in vivo dependent on AMP-mediated inputs. Based on cerebell conservation, bist may be conserved from fish to mammals. Purkin can be in tonic or bursting mode and toggle between states. Intracellular recordings confirmed spikes were sodium-dependent, broad were calcium-mediated, and large events were EPs.
Researchers have discovered that the actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a type of cellular process where cells take in substances from outside the cell membrane. They found that a branched actin network is sufficient to internalize endytic pits against membrane tension, and that around 200 Arp/3 complexes are required for robust internalization. Using a new counting method, they determined that around 200 Arp/3 complexes assemble at clath-mediated endocyt sites in human cells. Simulations showed that actin self-organizes into a branched array with ends towards the base of the pit, with filaments bending between the coat and base of the pit. The energy stored in bent filaments contributes to endocytic internalization. Elevated membrane tension directs filaments towards the base, increasing actin nucleation and bending for force production. This allows the actin network to adapt to varying physical constraints during endocytosis.
Researchers have studied the process of macropocytosis, a mechanism by which cells take up extracellular liquid into large vesicles, and found that it depends on the formation of a ring of protrusive actin beneath the plasma membrane, which develops into the macinocytic cup. They discovered that in Dictyostelium, macinocytic cups are organized around intense patches of P3, active and active Ras, and these patches are associated with a ring of active SCAR at their periphery. This structure is based on P3 patches, including phagocytic cups and basal waves. The formation of patches does not depend on F-actin ring and becomes enlarged when RasGAP1 is mutated, showing that Ras plays an instructive role. Macinocytic cups predominantly form by splitting from existing ones. The researchers propose that cup-shaped plasma structures form from self-organizing patches of active Ras/3, which recruit a ring of actinators to their periphery.

Using 3D light microscopy, they mapped the spatial and temporal control of actin regulators such as SC and WAS with respect to signalling molecules P3 and active. This led to a new hypothesis for the formation of cups from the plasma. Macinocytic cups form from projections of the plasma membrane, whose walls are driven by actin polymerization. They contain a patch of activated Ras and P3 throughout their life and in Dictyostel, this is associated with a ring of active SC at the edge. The ring of SC is proposed to be recruited by signalling and drives a ring F-act to extend the walls of the macinocytic cup.
Researchers have discovered the structure of a protein called S4 that plays a crucial role in holding sister chromatids together during cell division. This protein, called cohesin, is essential for proper cell division and any defects can lead to developmental problems in multicellular organisms. A complex called S2/S4 is responsible for loading cohes onto DNA and determining its location across the genome. The study found that S4 has a specific patch on its surface that recruits S2 to the centromere and pericentere, where cohes is loaded. This is separate from its role in establishing sisterid cohesion across the genome. The structure of S4 bound to a fragment of S2 was determined, revealing how S4 targets cohes to a specific location. Experiments in yeast showed that a conserved patch on S4 is necessary for centrom localization of S2 and association of cohes subunit S1 with centere and pericere, but not chromosome arms. This suggests S4-dependent cohes targeting is a general feature of cohes loading.
A study on garden dormice (Eliomys quinus) found that being born late in the active season has significant effects on growth, fattening, winter survival, and fecundity. Late-born (LB) juveniles grew and fattened twice as fast as early-born (EB) individuals. During growth, torpor use was low, but increased during pre-hibernation fattening. LB juveniles showed higher tor use, reached similar body sizes but lower fat content than EB before hibernation. LB individuals showed similar hibernation patterns, but higher breeding proportion the following year than EB dormice. These results suggest tor is incompatible with growth but promotes preibern fattening and consolidates preibern fat deposits.

The study hypothesized that LB dormice grow and fatten at higher rates due to higher tor use, reach preibern levels of body but lower fat, leading to differences hibern patterns and losses overwinter compared to EB individuals. Food availability (ad libitum vs. intermittently fast) affected growth and preibern fatt, use of energy strategies daily tor, body and fat prior hibern, subsequent hibern patterns and losses, and fecundity following juvenile dormice. This aligns with findings on dormice from a population producing two litters per year, with no winter survival differences between EB and LB.

Preibern reserves of LB were sufficient to fuel shorter hibern duration due five-week delay start. Extensive tor use seemed incompatible with growth but supports preibern fattening and preservation of reserves prior hibern, especially EB with higher fat reserves. LB delayed hibern onset by five weeks. Garden dormice grow twice as fast EB, lower fat prior hibern (Stfel et al., 2017). One strategy to lower energy and minimize challenges is tor use during parts of day, daily tor (Ruf et al.,199).
Researchers have been studying the role of ADAR (adenosine deaminase) enzymes in Caenorhabditis elegans, a type of worm, to understand how they affect neuronal function. ADAR enzymes edit RNA by changing adenosine to inosine and bind to regulatory elements in RNAs. Loss of ADAR affects neuronal function in all animals studied to date. Caenorhabdis elegans lacking ADAR show reduced chemotaxis, the ability to move towards or away from a stimulus, but the responsible targets for this remain unknown. To identify critical ADAR targets in C elegans, researchers analyzed the effects of ADR-2, the only AD enzyme in Cans, on the neural transcriptome. They used software SAIL to identify 736 AD-to editing events across the neural transcript. Intersecting neural edit with ADR-2 gene changes revealed edited cle-41 mRNA, whose expression is dependent on deamination. Restoring cle-41 in ADR deficient cells rescued chemaxis, providing evidence that phenotypes of AD mutants can be caused by altered gene expression.
Influenza A virus (IAV) employs a strategy called host shutoff to repress cellular mRNA translation while allowing efficient translation of viral mRNAs. Researchers used RNA-sequencing and ribosome profiling to investigate the mechanisms behind IAV-induced shutoff. They found that viral mRNAs are preferentially translated, leading to a decline in cellular protein synthesis due to viral takeover of the mRNA pool. The study also revealed variability in levels of cellular transcript reduction, with short mRNAs being less affected by IAV. mRNAs refractory to IAV infection are enriched in maintenance processes such as oxidative phosphorylation, and continuous phosphorylation activity is crucial for viral propagation. The findings advance understanding of IAV-induced shutoff and suggest a mechanism facilitating translation of genes with housekeeping functions.

The analysis showed viral translation efficiencies within the range of host translation, indicating viral mRN are preferentially translated during IAV, and co-opting of translation does not play a dominant role in gene shutoff. Instead, sh stems from viral dominance over mRNA. At 8 hours post-infection, viral mRNAs take over 53% of the translation activity, while 57% of mRNAs in cells are viral. The results are consistent with NS not required for sh of host protein production. To access host machinery, viruses use sh mechanisms eliminating competition from transcripts. Sh can be achieved by two mechanisms: coing of machinery forcing translation viralRN compared to host. Poliovirus employs this strategy, with 8 hours viral mRN take 53% of activity, 57% mRN cells.
Researchers have long known that gradients of signaling proteins, such as fibroblast growth factor (FGF), play a crucial role in shaping tissues during development. However, how these gradients are formed has been unclear. A new study in fruit flies (Drosophila) has shed light on this mystery by examining the distribution of FGF and its receptor (FGFR) in the larval wing imaginal disc. FGF is produced in the air sac-primord (ASP) and moves to the wing disc through FG-containing cyton, which are like tiny tubes that extend from the ASP to the disc. The number of FG-receiving cyton decreases with distance from the source, creating a specific F gradient. F acts as a morphogen in the ASP, activating gene expression at higher and lower levels. Two transcription factors, Pointed-P and Cut, regulate FG-containing cyton, creating regions with higher or lower numbers of FG-receiving cyton. This study reveals a mechanism where morphogens self-generate precise tissue-specific contours through feedback of cyton-mediated dispersion. 

In Drosila, F, Branchless (B) is the primary signal guiding branching of tracheal epithelial tubes. Traditionally, paracrine signals like F are thought to diffuse and form a gradient by passive extracellular dispersion. However, this study found that Dila B forms a gradient through cyton-mediated cell-to-cell communication. The shape of the B gradient adapts to tissue morphologies by regulating cyton-dependent signaling. The study focused on the Dila larval ASP due to its unique features, where the wing disc-source is separated from the recipient epithelium. The findings show an example of morphogenesis where cyton-dependent signaling provides precision and adaptability in long-range gradients and tissue architectures in space and time.
Researchers have discovered a new type of protein structure called the α/β coiled coil, which is formed by inserting two or six residues into the heptad repeat of a parallel trimer coiled coil. This insertion strains the coil to the point of breaking, causing the formation of short β strands that move 120 degrees around the trimer axis. The result is a novel structure that retains only one backbone bond per unit from the parent coiled coil. This new structure is possible within the allowed regions of Ramachand space with minor mutations to known folds.

α-hel coiled coils are the most understood protein fold, with a backbone that can be described by parametric equations. They are found in various structural and functional contexts and were the first described in atomic detail. They are also the only fold whose structure can be computed with parametric equations, making them a focus of design efforts.

Insertions of 2 and 6 residues cause the greatest strain on α-hical geometry. Researchers found that they break α-hices to form β strands, which associate into a superstructure called β-layer. This structure can be reduced by removing α-hical residues and the single backbone bond from the parent. A minimal α/β coiled would have hexads with three in β and three in the Ramand plot.

β-layers are repetitive in coiled, forming fibers with α and β-structure, a fold not previously described. The first β-layer is a 6-residue element and occurs after the hept position, biased towards c. With alternating α and β-layers, the αβ coiled is a new fiber based on superstructure.
Researchers studied the role of a protein called epsin in a process called endocytosis, which is how cells take in substances from outside their environment. Epsin is a protein that helps with this process, but its exact function was unclear. To understand its role, they created mice without eps and studied cells from them. These cells had trouble dividing and had problems with endocyt. Specifically, they had trouble with clath, a protein that helps cells take in substances, and its pits were not forming correctly. This was linked to a problem with clath and actin, a part of the cell's skeleton. This was confirmed in a test outside of cells. The study found that eps helps generate force for clath pits to form and break off from the cell. This is important for endyt to work correctly. Eps also interacts with other proteins to help this happen. Other proteins, like clath, help with endyt too, but eps is key at a different step. A previous study showed eps helps with actin, which is part of the cell's skeleton. This study found eps interacts with another protein, synaptobin, which helps vesicles fuse with membranes. However, eps is important earlier in endyt process, not later. Cells without eps had shallow pits that didn't form correctly. Eps is key at transition from shallow to deep pits.
Researchers conducted a case-control study in Uganda to investigate the risk factors for asthma among schoolchildren aged 5-17 years in urban areas. The study included 555 cases and 111 controls, with asthma diagnosed by clinicians. The main risk factors for asthma were:

* Tertiary education for fathers (adjusted OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.71-3.16) and mothers (1.85, 1.38-2.48)
* Area of residence at birth, with children born in small towns or cities having increased risk compared to those born in rural areas (2.16,1.60-2.92) and (2.79,1.79-4.35) respectively
* Father and mother's history of asthma
* Children's allergic conditions and atopy
* Cooking with gas/electricity

Asthma was associated with a strong rural-city risk gradient, higher socio-economic status, and urbanicity. The study found that children born in towns and cities had a higher risk of asthma compared to those born in rural areas. This risk increased with other risk factors such as parental history of allergic disease, children's atopy, and higher socio-economic status and urbanicity. Children born in towns had a 2.16 (1.60-2.92) and 2.79 (1.79-4.35) increased risk of asthma compared to those born in rural areas. The study provides a basis for future investigations into environmental and lifestyle factors increasing asthma risk in urban areas of low-middle income countries.
Research on zebraf fish (Danio rerio) has revealed that gap junctions composed of connexins 41.8 and 39.4 are essential for color pattern formation. Three types of pigment cells, melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores, interact to form the striped pattern, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Mutations in the leopard (leo) gene, encoding connex 41.8 (Cx.8), a gap junction subunit, cause a series of spotted patterns. A new allele, leot3, leads to a complete loss of pattern, suggesting a dominant negative impact on another component of gap junctions. A genetic screen identified this component as Cx.39.4 (luchs). Loss-of-function alleles demonstrate that luchs is required for stripe formation in zebraf, but fins are not affected. Double mutants and chimeras show that leo and luchs are required in melanoph and xanthores but not iridoph, suggesting both connins form heteromeric gap junctions. Phenotypes indicate these promote homotypic interactions between melanoph and xanthores, and instruct patterning of iridoph.

Fish homozygous for leot3 (D) or trans-hetergous for leot3 le1 show identical phenotype of completely dissolved pattern. Melanophores cluster together are present, mostly associated with iridoph. Connexin 41.8 is depicted with positions of leo mutations. Gap junctions are two hemi-channels in adjacent cells, each hemi made of connex subunits, can be identical (hom) or different (heteric). Heterom/heteric junction is schematically shown. Alignment amino sequence zraf Cx.8 with human ortholog G5 is shown, transmembrane shaded grey. Newly identified mutations Connex 41.8 are highlighted: leNR:66, le:79, leO22:85, le3:152.

Homozyg leK phenotype stronger than, indicating mutant Cx.8 present leK cells has dominant effect some component involved pattern. Simple model factor could another connex involved formation heterom junction with C8, notion previously suggested leq (Watan et al, 2006). The mutant phenotype wild-type zraf show pattern dark and light on body and tail fins. At magnification, melanoph regions and xanth light regions discernible. Mutants homozyg le1 and heterg le3, stripes dissolved. Clusters melanores still visible. This indicates expansion iridoph associated phenotypes indirect, possibly xanth covering irid. Data suggest Cx8 and C4 interact heterom gap and channels responsible interactions among chromat while pattern established.
Researchers studied the evolution of insect olfactory receptors, which are responsible for detecting behaviorally relevant odor molecules, in various animal phyla, including insects. Insects use olfactory receptors (OR) or ionotropic receptors (IR) and gustatory receptors (GR) to detect volatile molecules. While IR are found in olfactory organs across Protostomia, OR are thought to be an adaptation to a terrestrial lifestyle. The study investigated the olfactory system of three insects: the wingless bristail Lepachilis signata (Archaeognatha), the firebrat Thermobia domestica (Zygentoma), and the neopter leaf Phyllium sifium (phasoda). OR and the olfactory coreceptor (Or) were found to be lacking in Lepachilis, Thermobia had three Orco candidates, and Phium had a fully developed OR/Or-based system. The study suggests OR did not arise as an adaptation to terrestrial lifestyle but evolved later in insect evolution, with Or being present before OR.

The research focused on neopter insects, as they are evolutionarily closer to other insects. The identity of receptors involved in olfaction in ancient insects (Archaeogn, Zyoma and paleoptera) is unknown. Data suggests the evolution of Orco after the brail split from its common ancestor with remaining insects. However, an olfactory system relying on OR and Or evolved after emergence of wings. Insects have heteromeric receptors composed of at least one ligand OR and Orco.

The study selected insects at crucial phylogenetic positions with olfactory adapted to terrestrial conditions and volatile detection. The species provide a model to study early evolution of insect olfactory. To address receptors involved odor in insects and basal, researchers applied different approaches. Neopter insects (Polyoptera, Paroptera, Holometola) most stimuli recognized by OR family. OR are multitransmem proteins unrelated vertebrate olfactory, displaying distinct topology.
Researchers conducted a study in Myanmar to investigate the effectiveness of mass antimal drug administration (MDA) in reducing malaria cases of Plasmodium falciparum. The study took place in four villages along the Myanmar-Thailand border, where MDA was implemented to control the spread of the disease. The study found that areas with low adherence to MDA had 2.85 times the odds of malaria episodes post-M compared to areas with high adherence, suggesting a herd effect. High mosquito rates, living with someone with malaria, or having asymptomatic infection were also predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence to M, even in villages with high participation, may hinder elimination efforts.

The study aimed to examine the herd effect and impact of non-adherence to M on P. falcipar malaria. There was a group effect from M adherence, providing protection evident from three lines of evidence. Clinical episodes decreased among all groups for longer than the prophylactic effect of administered antimalials. The study consisted of four villages in Kayin State, Myanmar, selected based on P. falcipar prevalence using ultrasensitive PCR. The villages were part of a M pilot study. falc episode, adjusting for M adherence and other predictors, having a clinical episode. This is the first documentation of a herd effect by M for P. falc malaria. The increase in P. falc episodes post-M corresponded to increase in HBR.

The study found that individuals from neighborhoods with low M adherence had 2.85 times the odds of having a malaria episode post-M compared to those with high adherence, regardless of individual participation. High mosquito rates, living with someone with malaria, or asymptomatic infection were also predictors of clinical episodes. Spatial clustering of non-adherence, even in villages with high participation, may frustrate elimination efforts.
Researchers studied the binding specificities of 242 transcription factors (TFs) in fruit flies and compared them to humans and mice. They found that the binding specificities of TFs are highly conserved between the two species, and for orthologous TFs, the similarity extends to the level of subtle dinucleotide preferences. This suggests that the evolution of TF specificities contributes to the emergence of novel types of differentiated cells. A striking level of conservation of TF specificity was observed, with flies having almost as complex a repertoire of TF motifs as humans. Conservation extended to secondary modes of binding and subtle dinucle preferences, indicating that TF specificities are not subject to substantial evolutionary drift. 

The researchers used HT-LEX to determine TF specificities in fruit flies and characterized the role of divergence and drift in TF binding in animal diversity. They found that TFs with divergent specificities in cell types are not found in flies, suggesting that evolution of specificities contributes to emergence of novel types of cells. TFs belong to the same family generally bind similar sites, e.g. Figure 2-figure 1 and Jma et al. flies have many genes orthologous to human genes with conserved DB protein sequences even though species diverged 600 million years ago. They show that orthologs have identical DNA profiles, flanking sequences, and secondary binding modes.
Researchers have developed a new method to study how the heart and lungs develop together in the human body during embryonic development. They used human-induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which can become any cell type of cell in the body, and directed them to become both heart and lung cells at the same time. This was done by controlling two important signaling pathways, WNT and Nodal, without adding any extra growth factors. In a 3D culture, the heart and lung cells separated from each other, and the lung cells started to form air sacs. When the WNT signal was stopped, the heart and lung cells separated completely and the heart started beating. This new model can be used to study how heart and lung develop together during embryonic development and how they interact with each other. 

In a 3D culture, the heart and lung cells separated into heart and lung cells, which was blocked by WNT. This study provides a way to study how heart and lung develop together in the body. The interaction between heart and lung during development has been studied in mice, but not in humans. When W was stopped, the heart and lung cells separated and the heart started beating. This model can be used to study how heart and lung develop and separate in humans.
Researchers have found that the rate at which an organism's DNA changes, or mutates, is not as fixed as previously thought. Instead, it can adapt and change in response to stressful conditions. They studied E. coli bacteria exposed to high levels of ethanol and found that the mutation rate increased when the bacteria were under stress, but decreased once they adapted to the environment. The team identified cell death, or mortality, as the main driver of this change in mutation rate. This discovery sheds new light on how organisms balance robustness and evolvability, the ability to change, and adapt, and explains why high mutation rates are seen in various situations, such as antibiotic resistance in microbes and cancer relapse during chemotherapy. 

The study used E. coli exposed to high ethanol as a model to understand dynamics of hypermutation under stress. Multiple mutations interact and lead to adaptation to high ethanol concentrations. In addition to increased mutation rate, researchers found that hypermut states are temporary and rates decrease once cells are adapted to stress. Current understanding of mechanisms behind changes in rate is limited. The team identified mortality as major modulator of population rate. They used a collection of mutators with distinct rates to identify optimal for growth under high stress and found an essential role for hypermutation in de novo adaptation to ethanol.
Researchers have identified a key regulator of the low-energy response in plants, a transcription factor called bZIP63, which is directly targeted by the SnRK kinase. Phosphorylation of bZIP by Sn1 changes its dimer preference, affecting gene expression and primary metabolism. A b63 knockout mutant exhibits starvation-related phenotypes, which can be complemented by wild-type b63 but not by a version with mutations in Sn1 target sites. The Sn1 kinase AK10 is responsible for starvation-induced phosphorylation of b63, making it the first TF acting target of Sn1 in transcriptional deprivation. b63 phosphorylation at Sn sites is crucial for its function, as shown by complementation of b63 with wild-type but not mutated b63 constructs. b63 is a metabolic regulator, especially under starvation conditions, and is phosphorylated in vivo in a sugar and energy-dependent manner. Sn1 is one of the kinases responsible for b63 phosphorylation, targeting conserved serine residues in N and C-terminus of b63. The phosphorylation of these sites is crucial for b63 dimerization and activity in planta, regulating metabolic reprogramming.
Researchers have identified a protein called Ring finger 10 (RNF10) that acts as a messenger between synapses, or connections between neurons, and the nucleus, the control center of a cell's genetic material. NF10 is activated by signals at the synapse, the point of connection between neurons, and triggers changes at the genetic level. It is found at excitatory synapses, where it associates with a subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) called Glu2. When Glu2-containing MDAs are activated and long-term potentiation (LTP) occurs, NF10 moves from the dendrites and dendritic spines to the nucleus. The study shows that NF is transported from the synapse to the nucleus through a process called importin-dependent transport. Silencing NF prevents the maintenance of LTP and structural changes in dendritic spines.

 NF dissociates from the MD complex in an activity-dependent manner and is transported to the nucleus through importin. The Glu2 subunit has sequences for signaling and scaffolding molecules. NF and CaM share the same Gl2 binding region. NF is a novel synapse-nuclear messenger for long-lasting changes in dendritic spines after specific stimuli and synaptic modifications for LTP induction. Impaired NF signaling and reduced NF levels are responsible for reduced dendritic density after silencing. The study suggests the MD complex is a source of messengers that can travel to the nucleus, encoding synaptic and extrasynaptic Gl2 MD signals to the nucleus. Activation of synaptic but not extrasynaptic MDs increases NF localization.
Researchers have studied the interaction between the protein Mot1 (modifier of transcription 1) and a complex of TATA-binding protein (TBP) and transcription cofactor 2 (NC) bound to DNA. Mot1 is a type of Swi/Snf ATPase, an enzyme that remodels chromatin to control gene expression, replication, and DNA repair. The study aimed to understand how Sw/Snf ATPases interact with DNA-protein complexes. The researchers found that Mot1 reduces the interaction between DNA and NC, and unwinds DNA compared to the TBP:NC state, suggesting Mot primes TBP:NC for ATP-independent displacement. Electron microscopy and cross-linking data show Mot's Sw/Snf domain associates with upstream DNA and histone of NC, similar to some nucleosome remodelers. The study provides a framework for how Sw/Snf ATP interacts with DNA-protein complex.

The researchers used X-ray crystallography to determine the structure of Mot1's N-terminal domain with TBP, NC, and DNA. They found a small interface between Mot and NC, but a contact between Mot's domain and NC could separate NC's main anchor from TBP and DNA. The study provides a pseudo-atomic view of Sw/S enzyme bound to protein-DNA and a framework for Mot's interaction with TBP:NC. Sw/S enzymes remodel protein-DNA by disrupting the interface between nucleic and protein partners. The researchers crystallized Mot1 with TBP, NC, and DNA, and present the structure at 3.8 resolution with biochemical and electron microscopy studies. The study provides the first view of Sw/S ATPase with DNA-protein complex.

Mot's association with TBP:NC results in conformation changes, which may explain ATP-dependent dissociation. Sw/S ATP hydrolysis may provide mechanical force, but if binding remodel induces conformation changes in target. Researchers found Mot's association with TBP:NC results in conformation changes, which may explain ATP-dependent dissociation.
Researchers have developed synthetic variants of a natural compound called ternatin, which is toxic to cancer cells, and found that they are up to 500 times more potent than the original compound. Ternatin is a natural product that was previously known to inhibit cell growth, but its mechanism of action was unknown. The new variants target a complex called elongation factor-1 ternary, which is essential for protein synthesis in cells. This complex is made up of three parts: elongation factor-1, GTP, and aminoacyl-tRNA. Mutations in one part of elong factor-1 prevent tern binding and make cells resistant to tern's toxic effects. The hydrophobic surface of elong-1 is a key area where tern binds. Tern and its variants inhibit protein synthesis, with one variant being the most potent. They identified elongation factor-1 ternary as a direct target of tern-related peptides. Tern inhibits protein synthesis that correlates with blocking cell growth and photo-tern identified elong-1 as a target. Surprisingly, photo-tern linked to purified elong-1 only in its complex with GTP and amino-tRNA. This is the first report of a small molecule binding to elong-1 tern complex. Two unrelated natural products, didnin and cyrien, compete with tern for binding to elong- tern.
Researchers have studied the role of a protein called OCRL in a process called clathrin-mediated endocytosis, which is how cells take in substances from outside their environment. OCRL is a protein that interacts with clrin, a key player in this process. Mutations in OCRL cause a disease called Lowe syndrome and Dent's disease. Previous studies thought defects in OCRL led to problems with sorting substances inside cells, but this study found that OCRL is also important for clrin endocyt. Without OCRL, cells have trouble taking in substances and have too many clrin-coated vesicles that don't lose their coat. This leads to accumulation of clrin-coated vesicles and increase in U-shaped clrin-coated pits. A protein called SN9, which helps late-stage clrin endytic pits, binds to OCRL and stays with clrin-coated vesicles. This suggests OCRL acts as an uncoating factor and defects in clrin endyt likely contribute to disease in patients with OC mutations.

In Lowe syndrome fibroblasts, OCRL absence impairs clrin endytic coat dynamics and results in endytic defect. Cells accumulate clrin-co vesicles that fail to lose coat. A model shows how lack of OC in Lowe patients affects clrin endyt. OC's 5-phosphat activity delays endyt by stalling late pits, impairs unating, and triggers nucleation of comets from clrin ves that retain PI 4,5P2 and fail to uncoat. Cells in Lowe syndrome have numerous intracellular actin comets. OC participates in unating and facilitates recycling of endytic factors, required for normal endyt progression. Defects in clrin endyt have not been reported in Lowe fibrobl, so researchers analyzed clrin pit dynamics in patient and control cells by time-lapse microscopy. Presence of actin com driven by clrin ves in Lowe cells supports link between endytic clrin coats and act, a topic of debate.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism by which contributes to the development of colorectal cancer, a disease where the Wnt/β-caten signaling pathway is abnormally activated. This pathway is crucial for cell growth and division, but its abnormal activation can lead to cancer. The study found that a protein called FAK/PYK phosphorylates GSKβ, a protein that regulates W/β-caten, leading to its accumulation and tumorigenesis. FAK and PY2 are overexpressed in adenomas in mice and human colorectal cancer tissues and promote W/βaten signaling by phosphorylating GSKβ. Inhibiting F/PYK suppressed adenoma formation in mice with reduced levels of phospho-GSKβ and βaten. The study reveals a novel F/PYK/GSKβ/βaten regulatory circuit in intestinal tumenesis. Loss of APC induces F and PY2 expression, which phosphorylates Gβ to stabilize βaten, initiating tumenesis.
Researchers investigated how the vestibular system's role in controlling balance during transitions between standing and walking. They found that the vestibular system's influence on balance is suspended before and during transitions, suggesting a change in motor control policy. Participants stood on a platform that could shift their weight between feet and were exposed to electrical vestibular stimuli (EV). The relationship between EV and ground reaction forces was measured using time-frequency analysis. Discontinuities in coherence were observed before movement initiation and during termination. These results show the vestibular balance mechanisms transition between motor states, as predicted by optimal theory.

The vestibular system encodes head motion in space and is crucial for maintaining balance during standing and walking. It influences muscle activation in posture control. To transition between motor states, balance responses are disrupted. Before transitions, vestibular influence on whole-body balance is suspended. Suspension of vestibular-evoked responses occurs at movement start while still standing upright, before onset. Suspension is not specific to one type of transition, suggesting a general process between standing and other motor states. Results show humans stop balancing before moving and moving before balancing again.

The suspension period of vestibular-evoked responses relates to different sensory gains for quiet and locomotor control. During standing, whole-body accelerations and oscillations are small. An adaptive controller is used. Vestibular balance during locomotor-posture transitions can be monitored by quantifying vestib-evoked responses over transition. A similar approach has been used to monitor engagement and disengagement of vestibular balance between self and externally-driven states.
In cyanobacteria, a type of photosynthetic bacteria, have a built-in biological clock that helps them adjust their metabolic processes to the day-night cycle. This clock is controlled by a protein called RPA, which regulates the expression of genes involved in energy production and storage. When RPA is missing, cells can't survive in environments with alternating light and dark periods, but not in constant light. Researchers investigated why and found that RPA-deficient cells can't accumulate energy stores during the day and can't use them at night. Providing an external energy source restored their viability. This study shows that the circadian pathway coordinates metabolism to prepare cells for energy limitations in the environment. The circadian output, mediated by RPA, is essential for anticipating energy storage during the day and switching to energy use at night. This adaptation allows cells to produce energy and survive periods of darkness.
Researchers have investigated the structure and function of P-4-type ATPases, a subclass of proteins that transport heavy metals across cell membranes, crucial for maintaining cellular balance and detoxification. Despite their importance, little is known about P-4-ATPases, which transport a wide range of ions including zinc, cobalt, nickel, copper, and calcium. The study focused on an archetypal P-4-ATPase, CoT from Sulfitobacter sp. NAS-1, and found it lacks classical heavy-metal binding domains, providing new insights into metal transport mechanisms. P-4-ATPases have a dual role, releasing heavy metals and acting as a counter ion for histidine, and their turnover is independent of potassium, unlike other P-type ATPases. Inhibitory compounds suggest potential for drug discovery, as P-4-ATPases are virulence factors in many pathogens.
Researchers have identified a unique chromatin signature that distinguishes genes with mitotically stable allelic expression (MA) in human cells. This signature is characterized by the simultaneous presence of active (H3K36me3) and silencing (H3me3) marks in the gene body. Approximately 20% of ubiquitously expressed genes and 30% of tissue-specific genes across cell types show this signature. Notably, it is enriched among developmental genes with bivalent chromatin structure in pluripotent cells. This approach opens a new way to study MA independent of polymorphisms and suggests MA is linked to cell differentiation.

Applying this approach to various cell types, up to 20% of ubiquitously expressed and more than one-third of tissue-specific genes showed the chromatin of MA. Detection of MA signature does not rely on SNPs or clonality, making it feasible for analysis in primary samples, including comparisons of normal and diseased tissue. Among widely expressed genes, about 20 have chromatin pattern for MA in at least one tissue. Genes with tissue-specific expression as group, estimate 39-48 have MA pattern. MA identified in clones is reflected by chrom in polycl sample.

To test chromatin as predictor of MA state, genes with MA pattern and assessed allelic in monoclonal lines. Calculated gene-body signal for H3me and H3me for autosomal Ref genes on ENCODE ChIP data GM78 lymphoblast cells. Surprisingly, a large of bivalent (>80) acquire MA chromatin in least differentiated types, higher compared to genes silent in ES. Upon activation, master genes preferentially resolve into state with characteristic MA chromatin.
Researchers have discovered a new mechanism of control for the AAA+ chaper Clp, a protein essential for bacterial virulence and stress resistance, which is widely distributed among Gram-positive bacteria. They found that coiled-coil domains in Clp control its activity by sequestering Clp molecules in an inactive state. This is the first time coiled-coil domains have been shown to regulate AAA+ protein activity. Clp has a coiled middle domain (MD) consisting of two wings, forming a repressing belt around the ring to reduce ATPase activity. Adjacent MDs bind each other by head-to-tail interactions, keeping regulatory domains in place. ATP repression is relieved by dissociation and binding to Hsp adaptors that prevent reassociation of MD with Clp/Hsp ring. This is similar to other AAA chaper systems, where adaptors select substrates and regulate ATPase activity and deliver substrates to ATPase activation. Control requires ATPase to be repressed in ground state, key to AAA chaper mode of action. Repression can be achieved by coiled domains inserted into AAA module. Clp MDs form intermolecular head-head contacts, docking two Clp layers in helical conformation. Formation involves ATP binding to AAA domains. This Cl assembly is inactive, restricting substrate binding, ClP and proteins, and ATP hydrolysis. Mutating key MD residue ClE causes cellular toxicity, suggesting repress mode operational in ClE and ClL, a general mechanism for bacterial AAAaper systems.
Researchers used the fruit fly Drosophila to study how adult muscle stem cells called muscle precursors (AMPs) remain dormant and are reactivated. They found that AMPs send out thin extensions called filopodia that make contact with neighboring muscles, suggesting muscles play a role in reactivation. Genetic analysis showed muscles send signals that turn on the insulin pathway in AMPs, leading to activation of Notch, which regulates AMP proliferation via dyc. The study reveals Doph AMPs interact with muscle niche and the insulin-Notch-dyc cascade plays a role in AMP reactivation.

In Doph, muscle cells called adult precursors (AMP) emerge during embryogenesis and express muscle markers. They lie dormant until activated, proliferating to provide myoblast for adult growth and regeneration. Myc promotes myoblast proliferation during development and regeneration. Researchers tested if dyc was involved in AMP reactivation in Doph. Data show dyc is required for AMP reactivation and proliferation. Genetic experiments show Not acts downstream insulin and dyc downstream Not.

The study suggests muscle behaves as AMP niche and drives AMP reactivation in larval life. The insulin-Not-dyc cascade governs AMP reactivation.
Researchers have been trying to understand how certain neurons in the brain called substantia nigra pars reticulata (SN) maintain their high rate of firing, which is crucial for their function in brain circuits. These SN neurons provide inhibition to other areas of the brain and a depolarizing leak current supports this pattern, but its molecular basis was unclear. To investigate, researchers used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual SN neurons and found that they express the sodium channel NAL. SN neurons lacking NAL had impaired firing. NAL is also involved in modulation of excitability by changes in glycolysis and activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. The study suggests disruption of NAL could impair basal ganglia circuit, which may underlie severe motor deficits in humans with NAL mutations.

Researchers identified the non-selective cation channel (NS) that supports firing of SN neurons and the molecular of glycolysis-sensitive NS. They used single-cell sequencing to determine gene profile of SN and relative levels of NS. Sodium channel NAL was highest in SN neurons. The molecular basis of current is important for detailed investigation of properties and regulation of SN inhibition of basal targets. To address, performed transcript sequencing of SN and detected expression of NS that could generate depolar current. Found SN express NAL, a prime candidate for carrying depolar current in cells. SN require NAL for tonic firing, suggesting NAL could contribute basal gang related disorders. Disruption of normal firing by G receptor agonists leads to muscle tension and dystonia. Hyperactivity of SN observed in Parkinsonian animals. NAL a candidate for depolar as had highest expression all NS and in top of ion channels. SN express Unc, Unc, and Fam, genes interacting with NAL.
Researchers have developed a new method to cultivate and identify bacteria that produce antibiotics, which could lead to the discovery of new medicines to combat antibiotic-resistant infections. Traditional methods of cultivating bacteria are limited and time-consuming, and many species remain unexplored. The new method uses tiny droplets of liquid, each containing a single cell, to grow bacteria in a controlled environment. This allows for a large number of bacteria to be tested at once, increasing the chances of finding new antibiotics. The droplets can be stored and incubated in bulk, allowing for controlled conditions to be maintained. A reporter bacteria is added to the droplets to test for antibiotic production. The method was tested on a soil sample and compared to traditional agar cultivation. One isolate showed antimicrobial activity, and its secreted metabolites were identified. The droplets provide a link between the bacteria's genetic makeup and what it produces, keeping compounds confined to the cell they originated from. 

The method was combined with a high-throughput screening to detect antibiotic-producing bacteria. This streamlines the process of finding new antibiotics. A microfluidic droplet platform was used to mimic environmental conditions, with a small volume of 200pL, allowing long-term growth of 2 million cells in 1.5mL. Reporter strains were added to detect antibiotic production. The method's relevance was increased by adding a step to detect and select droplets with antibiotic-producing cells. Although standard cultivation couldn't maintain new species isolated from droplets, cells were used for high-quality genome information.
Researchers conducted a Bayesian analysis to investigate the association between the leukotriene A hydrolase (LTAH) genotype and survival in tuberculous meningitis patients. They found that patients with the TT variant of the LTAH gene, which regulates inflammatory eicosoids, had increased survival and benefited from adjunctive anti-inflammatory corticosteroids. This benefit was consistent with corticosteroids benefiting individuals with hyper-inflammatory responses. However, a previous study in Indonesia did not find an LTAH genotype survival benefit. Using Bayesian methods, the researchers analyzed both studies and found that LTAH genotype conferred survival benefit that began early and continued long-term in both populations, but was nullified in severe cases with high mortality. They suggest that LH genotyping with disease assessment may target glucocortic therapy to patients most likely to benefit.

The study supported the model that mortality from TBM was due to distinct inflammatory states, and LTAH might be a determinant of inflammation and response to adjunct anti-inflammatory treatment. If true, personalized glucocoid treatment would be warranted, given to TT patients. A previously unrecognized form of dysregulated inflammation might be caused by genetic variants present in Indonesia, working through an inflammatory pathway less responsive to dexamethasone. The LH effect was thought limited to severe patients in both cohorts because Indonesia was skewed towards severe disease presentation, overriding the association with mortality. The beneficial of dethasone to LTT may not have had time to play in Grade Indonesia. A second possibility is that Grade patients presented dysregulated in a manner not revealed by standard metrics, making corticoids no longer beneficial.
Researchers have been trying to understand how axons, the long extensions of nerve cells that transmit signals, navigate their way through the brain and body in response to guidance cues. Specifically, they want to know how axons decide which direction to grow in response to local cues. A new study found that a protein called shootin plays a key role in this process. Mice without shoot showed abnormal growth of axons in the brain, similar to mice without a protein called netrin, which guides axons. The study found that netrin caused shoot to be phosphorylated, or modified, within axons, which increased its interaction with a molecule called L-CAM. This interaction generated forces that helped axons move. The researchers also found that shoot phosphorylation within axons was necessary for axons to turn in response to netrin gradients. The study shows how netrin signals are converted into mechanical forces that guide axons.
Scientists have long been fascinated by the unique humming sound made by hummingbirds as they fly, known as their "humming." To understand this phenomenon, researchers studied six freely hovering Anna's hummingbirds using a 217 microphone array to record their acoustic field and a new aerodynamic platform to measure the forces on their wings. They found that the humming's timbre, or tone, comes from the oscillating lift and drag forces on each wing. By comparing birds and insects, they discovered that the characteristic hum and radiated power of flapping wings comes from higher harmonics in aerodynamic forces supporting their body weight. Their analysis showed that larger birds are quieter and elongated flies are louder, clarifying complex bioacoustic behavior.

The researchers combined aerodynamic platform and microphone recordings in vivo to determine how flapping wings generate unsteady forces and acoustic signature. They developed a new aerodynamic platform to measure net 3D forces generated by freely hovering birds, integrating data into a new aeroacoustic model predicting sound due to oscillating forces. This model was corroborated by in vivo 3D force and kinematics and near acoustic holography, showing hummingbirds generate directional hum with broadband pressure opposing gravity. The directivity of harmonics depends on harmonic parity.

The idealized model assumes rigid wings, neglecting effects like wing flutter, feather, and vortex dynamics. Comparing predicted acoustic with recordings for six hummingbirds confirmed the model's power. These findings point to oscillating forces generating hum. Numerical simulation showed farfield of mosquito wings driven by aerodynamic fluctuation. Despite advances, vivo near-field measurements are lacking.
Researchers have investigated the roles of chance and necessity in the evolution of proteins by studying the B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) family, a group of proteins that interact with other proteins. They used a new technology to mutate and select proteins to acquire specific interactions that occurred during animal evolution. By replicating evolutionary paths from ancestral proteins, they found that over time, chance events erased necessity and became the primary cause of sequence variation. Trajectories from distant proteins yielded no common mutations, even under identical pressures. Chance arose from many mutations at any point, while contingency arose from historical substitutions.

The study suggests present-day B-2 proteins and others are unique products of their histories, reflecting accumulated events and necessity imposed by physics, chemistry, and selection. The possibility that contingency joins selection, drift, and mutation as primary factors in evolution has been obscured. Contingency generated sequence change over phylogen times plays a role in B-2 evolution under selection for new functions. Human and NOA fixed partners were used, but during evolution varied, introducing chance and contingency to affect outcomes.

Differences between design and biological B- evolution could have overestimated chance's role. Additional biological functions imposed constraints on evolution, reducing equivalent genotypes available to chance. Paths leading to specificities changed repeatedly during B- history, even when profiles did not evolve. For chance to influence evolution, multiple paths must be accessible with similar probabilities.
Researchers have used a genome-wide haplotype analysis to study the genetic diversity and gene flow among 48 sub-Saharan African populations. They found that coastal populations have received Eurasian haplotypes over the last 700 years, and Eastern and Southern Niger-Congo groups share ancestry with Central Africans due to recent expansions. Most sub-Saharan populations share ancestry with groups outside their region due to gene flow within the last 400 years. This study provides insight into haplotype sharing across ethno-linguistic groups and movement into new environments, relevant to genetic epidemiology.

African Genome Variation Project (AVP) studies described Euras and hunter-gather ancestry's influence on sub-Saharan population history and allele movement. However, the extent and timing of these events and their impact on contemporary populations remain unclear. This study reflects broad geographic patterns, but also reveals smaller, closely related groups consistent with self-reported ancestry. Gene flow between populations is related to historical movements into and within sub-Saharan Africa.

Admixture occurs when ancestral groups mix, a common in human populations globally. Genome analyses refine Africa's history and impact on diversity.
Researchers studied how the mitotic spindle adapts to changing cell size during early development in Xenopus lae embryos. They created an in vitro system using cytoplasm extracts from embryos that mimicked the spindle size differences between stage 3 (4 cells, 37µm) and stage 8 (∼400 cells,18m). They identified kinesin-13, kif2, as a driver of spindle scaling, whose microtubule-destabilizing activity is inhibited in stage 3 spindles by importin α, and activated in stage 8 when import α partitions to the membrane. Altering spindle size in embryos impaired spindle orientation during metaphase, but chromosome segregation remained robust. The spindle in Xenopus development is coupled to cell size through a rati mechanism controlling microtule destabilization.

The researchers reconstituted spindle formation in embryo extracts to elucidate a mechanism that coordinates spindle with size during X. lavis development through differential activation of kines-13 k2. They identified a physiological effector that operates to scale the spindle during embryogenesis. Taking advantage of this mechanism to modify spindle without perturbing the spindle, they uncovered an important role for spindle in maintaining orientation in large cells of Xenopus. This suggests the physical features of cell can drive intracellular scaling through biochemical redistribution and steady-state activities. This is consistent with changes in meiotic to mitotic morphology observed in early development and suggests physical changes in cells can impact biochemical reactions that alter spindle architecture.

The researchers found that import α phosphorylation liberates from membrane into cytoplasm, promoting its activity. Correcting nonspecific binding, they found k2 could retrieve ∼10 more import α from stage 3 extracts than stage 8. This suggests the amount of α partitioning to membrane is sufficient to alter interaction with k2. The identification of mechanism enabled testing its significance during development. Observations suggest changes in spindle pathways accompany size and influence spindle. To determine size during vertebrateogenesis, they created an embryo system assembling spind in cytoplasm at any stage X.
Researchers have discovered a type of RNA molecule called riboswitches that can act as a logic gate to control the production of a key molecule called purine in bacteria. These ribwitches can bind to two different signals, guanine and phosphoribos pyrophosphate (PR), either separately or together, to turn on or off the production of messenger RNA for purine synthesis. This is an example of a two-input Boolean logic gate, a complex system that can make decisions based on multiple inputs. The discovery supports the idea that ancient RNA-based life forms could have managed complex metabolism without proteins.

 Riboswitches are RNA molecules that can bind to specific molecules, in this case guanine and PR, to control the production of other molecules. In this case, they regulate the production of RNA for purine, a building block of DNA and RNA. The researchers found two types of ribwitches, one that bind guanine and one that bind PR, that can work together to make a logic gate. This is a new type of logic that has not been seen before, where two different molecules bind to the same platform to make a new function.

This discovery shows that RNA can make complex systems to sense and regulate molecules, like in ancient life forms. It is likely that more complex systems like this exist in modern cells. The researchers found these ribwitch by looking for RNA that bind to a molecule called PR, which is a building block of RNA. They had seen this type of RNA before, but thought it was similar to another type. The discovery shows that RNA can make complex devices without proteins.

The researchers tested the logic of the gate by making RNA in a lab and found it worked as expected. The output is a mix of many RNA molecules, not a single one.
Researchers have long known that the number of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles released into the synaptic cleft with each action potential affects the reliability of synaptic transmission, but the source of this variability is unclear. The prevailing view is that release of a single vesicle (unives release, UVR) or multiple vesicles (multives release, MVR) reflects variability in vesicle release probability, which is supported by the calcium dependence of release mode. However, a new study using mouse brain slices demonstrates that the number of vesicles released is regulated by the size of the readily releasable pool, upstream of vesicle probability.

The study found that protein kinase A and its vesicle-associated, synapsin, dynamically control release occupancy to dictate the number of vesicles without altering release probability. These findings define molecular mechanisms that control MVR and functional diversity of synaptic signaling. Diversity in calcium homeostasis and AC and PK may contribute to variability in PK and synapsin regulation across synapses. Recent models propose that vesicles transition between states from loose to tighter tethering with release followed by Ca+-triggered fusion, which may be akin to transitions from sites to docking prior fusion.

MVR is widespread in the rodent CNS and appears to be the dominant mode in human cortex. However, some synapses are limited to release of a single vesicle per zone, termed unives release, while others switch modes in activity-dependent manner. The number of vesicles from an active zone is the product of ves release probability and number available. The study suggests that the readily releasable pool is a measure of number of release-competent vesicles per zone, under control of synins, constraining number released.
HIV-1, the virus responsible for AIDS, packages its genetic material in a specific way that is not fully understood. Research has shown that the protein Gag, a key component of the virus, assembles on the cell membrane and selects the viral RNA over other cellular RNAs. To study this process, scientists created a simplified system with purified RNAs, recombinant G, and giant vesicles. They found that G selectively packages the 5' untranslated region of the HIV genome in the presence of excess RNA. Mutations in the CACT domain of G, which affect self-assembly, abrogate selectivity. They also discovered that tRNA suppresses G membrane binding when G has bound viral RNA. The ability of G to package RNA and self-assembly on membranes are interdependent.

The study proposes a model where viral RNA with high-affinity sites for G recruits G to the membrane, allowing it to dissociate from other RNAs. The NC domain of G is necessary but not sufficient for selective packaging. A previous study showed most membrane-prox genomic RNAs are moneric in absence of G, but coalesce to dimers in presence. The results highlight the importance of membrane-localized G assembly in genome selection and packaging. Existing data do not explain how cytosolic G assembles into particles that package dimer genomes 90% of the time. This study reconstitutes selective packaging in a system with GUVs, recomant G and purified RN. Lattice contacts for G multization on membranes are crucial for selective packaging. The 5'UTR is recruited by multized G without changes. Association with tRNA inhibits assembly. A model for selective packaging is proposed, where G on GUVs packages 5'UT at nanomolar in excess RNA. Mutations that affect clustering abolish selectivity.
