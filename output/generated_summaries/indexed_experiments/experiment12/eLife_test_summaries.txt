Researchers studied the structure of electrical synapses, a type of communication between neurons, in zebraf fish cells. Unlike chemical synapses, which have distinct pre and post-synaptic components, the structure of electrical synapses is not well understood. Electrical synapses are mediated by gap junctions, clusters of intercellular channels, but it's unclear if other structures contribute to transmission. The study used expansion microscopy to examine single contacts where gap junctions coexist with specializations for neurotransmitter release. Multiple gap junctions of varying size were identified by molecular components. Most of the synaptic surface was occupied by gap junction and adherens junction components, suggesting a close association. Glutamate receptors were confined to small areas, indicating most of the surface functions as an electrical synapse. The study revealed the organization of an electrical syn that operates with multiple gap junctions and adherens junction components. This will help establish boundaries of electrical synapses in animal connectomes and provide insight into diversity of electrical synapses.
Researchers studied the role of the pre-Böt complex (preBöt), a key generator of the inspiratory breathing rhythm, and its neurons that project to the facial nucleus 7 (n) to coordinate orofacial and nasofacial activity. They used optogenetic viral approaches to selectively inhibit these neurons and found that it affects facial activity with minimal impact on breathing. The effects varied with anesthetic and anesthetized states. The population of 7-projecting preöt neurons consisted of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons sending collaterals to brainstem nuclei regulating autonomic activity. Modulating subgroups of preöt neurons based on axonal projections is a strategy to understand mechanisms integrating breathing with motor and physiological behaviors. This is important as abnormal autonomic modulation and orof behaviors are linked to disease development and progression.

The study questioned whether preöt7 neurons are part of the preöt network or a distinct group. Data suggest facial projecting preöt neurons transmit rhythm rather than generate it. Photoinhibiting these on inspiratory activity is due to collaterals. Selective photoin of preöt projecting to nucleus 7 should modulate oracial with minimal respiratory impact. A combinatorial viral approach showed selective transduction and photoin pre facial motor affects activity minimally breathing. Non-selective photoin had small breathing effects, particularly under ketamine/medomidine and recovery. Selective transduced a smaller population with restricted location.

Photoin preöt produces apnea, reduces sympathetic activity, modulates BP, increases parasympathetic activity, and decreases HR and respiratory arrhythm. preöt neurons modulate oracial behaviors.
Recent studies suggest that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) represent aversive information and signal an alarm to the brain. If CGRP neurons serve as a general alarm, their activation would modulate both passive and active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude of the threat. However, most research has focused on the role of CGRP in passive responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active behaviors. This study examined the role of CGRP in active behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Electrophysiological results revealed CGRP encodes the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP during chasing elevated responses in both conditioning and retention, presumably amplifying the perception of threat as more dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP exhibited reduced responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand understanding of CGRP in PBN as a critical system, capable of regulating active behaviors by amplifying threat and ensuring adaptive responses to varying danger.

The study suggests CG activation amplifies perceived threat, promoting active behaviors. Optogenically inhibited CG in animals while being chased during conditioning showed less freezing and fleeing compared to control. CGRP, known for relaying US to forebrain and inducing freezing, were examined in active responses. Using naturalistic paradigm with robot and aversive stimuli varying levels, recorded activity found CG encode threat through variations in duration and amplitude. Results confirmed stimulating CG without aversive generates rapid unconditioned behavior in mice. Tested manipulating CG during fear with robot promotes fleeing or amplifies behavior. To enhance alarm, activation was applied at 30 Hz during chasing. Optogen stimulation in absence induced robust freezing, and activation conventional further conditioned, demonstrating primary in passive responses. However, heightened conditions, such as CG activation or robot speeds, also strengthened active behaviors amplifying threat.

A more ecologically relevant paradigm was employed using predator robot to chase animals, incorporating imminent threat. Hypothesized CG modulate behaviors depending severity or type. Recorded CG response aversive, including robot to determine encode stimuli differentially.
Researchers used data from over 30,000 participants in the UK Biob study to investigate the relationship between obesity and brain structure. They found that a higher waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was associated with differences in two distinct brain systems: the prefrontal/temporal/striatal system and medial/occipital/statal system. The prefrontal system was linked to isotropic volume fraction (ISO), a measure of water content, while the medial system was linked to intracellular fraction (IC), a measure of neurite density. The prefront system was also associated with genes related to immune functions, glial density, and opioid receptors, while the medial system was linked to G-protein receptors and decreased opioid receptors. The study suggests that obesity may be linked to differences in neurite density in the medial system and water content in the prefrontal system, possibly due to immune system activation. 

The researchers also found that the two systems were anatomically distinct and functionally different, with maps of ISO and IC negatively correlated. They tested each metric at each region for association with WHR and identified two distinct brain systems associated with obesity, using gene expression, composition, and neurotransmitter density to refine characterization. Genome-wide association statistics were used to estimate genetic correlations between MRI and WHR, testing the hypothesis that WH would have a tighter correlation with IC than ISO. The study also used data on neurotransmitter distribution to investigate the brain where obesity was associated with microstructure by ISO or IC. Cortical maps of 37 neurotransmitters were tested for co-location with ISO and IC maps, controlling for multiple comparisons. Both were significantly correlated with WH in systems. Obesity differences ISO and IC were coupled but anatomically, transcriptionally, and neurologically differentiated.
Researchers have investigated the role of cancer stem cells (CSCs) undergoing epithelial-mesymal transition (EMT) in driving metastatic dissemination in cancer models. They found that tumour cells undergoing EMT were not observed in human tumour specimens, leaving the relevance to cancer uncertain. However, they identified EpCAM and CD as CSC markers alongside mesenchymal Viment to identify EMT CSCs in oral cancer lines, allowing them to investigate these markers in human tumours. Examining 12,000 fields from 74 oral tumours, they found significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD, and Viment co-stained cells disseminating beyond tumour in metastatic specimens. Using an artificial neural network, they predicted metastasis with 87-89 accuracy. This study observed disseminating EMT CSCs in human cancer specimens, highly predictive of metastatic disease.

Staining Ep and CD alongside mesenchym Viment in 12,000 fields from human tumours stratified on metastatic status identified cells that undergone E and disseminated into stroma surrounding metastatic tumours. Image-based machine learning showed presence of EMTs in tumroma predictive of metastasis. Presence of disseminating cells strongly correlated with metastasis. Image-based approach predicted metast with high accuracy through EMT staining.

Using immunofluorescence for EMT retaining epithelial Ep and mesenchym Viment and CSC CD, single EMTs disseminating stroma oral tumours were identified, but epithelial keratins not retained. Ep retention not sufficient alongside Viment to mark disse EMT correlating metastasis. Study's strength was ability to observe single cell automated across thousands fields human tumours, enabling disseminating tum cells into tissue, identifying EMTs, and training ANN to predict metastasis.

Viment distinguished E from epithelial tum immunofluores protocols. Combining Ep tum lineage EMT marker, Viment mesenchal, and CD plastic EMT, aimed to identify cells undergone E and disseminated stromal region.
Researchers have studied how the process of apoptosis, or programmed cell death, and its clearance by a process called efferocytosis, contributes to tissue repair in wounds. They used single-cell RNA sequencing to map the dynamics of inflammation in mouse skin wounds and found that apoptotic and efferytosis pathways are elevated in fibroblasts and immune cells, including resident macrophages during inflammation. In diabetic wounds, human upregulation of mRNAs for efferyt pathway and altered eyt signaling through receptor Axl and its ligand Gas were detected. Early in mouse wounds, upregulation of Axl in dendritic cells and fibroblasts via TLR-independent mechanisms was observed. In vivo studies revealed that Axl signaling is required for wound repair but dispensable for eytosis. In contrast, inhibition of another eyt receptor, Tim4, in mouse wounds decreased eyt and abated repair. The study highlights distinct mechanisms of apoptotic cell detection for tissue repair and potential targets for chronic wounds in diabetic patients.
Researchers have developed a new method called Targeted Genetically-Encoded Multiplex (Ta-EM) that allows for the labeling and tracking of specific cell populations in the fruit fly Drosophila. This is done by inserting a unique DNA barcode upstream of the polyadenylation site in a Gal-inducible UASFP construct, which can be read during single-cell sequencing. This method enables the identification of cell types in cell atlases, multiplet droplets, and experimental conditions. The Ta-EM barcodes can also be read using next-generation sequencing for population-scale measurements. This approach has the potential to enable large-scale behavioral screens and improve single-cell transcriptomic experiments.
Researchers studied the evolution of defense mechanisms in poison dart frogs, specifically the Dendrobatidae family, which have developed the ability to acquire alkaloids from their diet for defense. However, previous studies focused on colorful species with alkaloids, neglecting inconspic ones assumed to be undefended. They found that undefended species have measurable amounts of alkaloids and confirmed they consume toxic arthropods, sources of alkaloids. This suggests diet is insufficient to explain the defended phenotype. They propose a new concept, "passive accumulation," differing from sequestration, where toxins are not stored or transported, resulting in low levels. Accumulation is an ancestral state in Dendidae and possibly related taxa, with selection on toxin resistance leading to accumulation and defense. The study incorporates pharmacokinetic ideas and data into an evolutionary model explaining acquired defenses in frogs and other animals.
Researchers have found that a key process called epithelial-to-mesymal transition (EMT) contributes to cancer cells becoming resistant to chemotherapy, making it harder to treat advanced breast cancer. The complexity of this process, involving multiple pathways and its reversal, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), has hindered the development of effective treatments. A study used a unique mouse model and single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze the EM status of tumor cells, revealing that ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) is elevated during both EMT and MET phases. Ribi and its subsequent protein synthesis by ER and mTOR signaling are essential for EMT completion. Inhibiting Ribi genetically or pharmacologically impaired EMT capability of tumor cells. Combining Ribi inhibition with chemotherapy reduced metastatic growth of epithelial and mesenchymal cells under treatment. The study suggests targeting Ribi a promising strategy for treating advanced breast cancer.

 Researchers employed an E-lineage tracing model to discover Ribi was transiently elevated during EMT and MET phases. Lower Ribi activity was observed in mesenchymal cells than epithelial ones. Consistent with the model, combining Ribi with chemotherapy significantly reduced metastatic tumor burden. Further analysis of human breast cancer cells found Ribi activity associated with E status. Targeting E for therapy has been challenging due to complexity and controversies of MET favoring progression. The model found upregulation of Ribi at E and MET phases. Activation of Ribi during E process has been reported. Results suggest upregulated Ribi needed for mesenchym cells to undergo MET during outgrowth in lungs. Rib biogenesis recognized crucial in cancer a century ago. Investigation of signaling responsible for R upregulation in E process found involvement of unwed Ribi during E and MET makes Ribi a target for overcoming chemoresistance and metastasis. Targeting Ribi by inhibitor impaired E transitioning of cells and synergized with chemotherapeutics.
Pearl millet, a drought-tolerant cereal crop, is a vital food source in the sub-Saharan region. Its early root system features a fast-growing primary root, which is hypothesized to be an adaptation to the Sahelian climate. Using modeling, we demonstrate that drought is a significant constraint in Sahelian agroecosystems where pearl millet was domesticated. We show that increased millet primary root growth is correlated with increased water tolerance in field conditions. A genome-wide study and quantitative trait loci (QTL) approaches identify genomic regions controlling this trait. Combining gene expression, resequencing, and reannotation of these regions, a glutaredin-encoding gene PgXC9 is identified as a candidate resilience root regulator. Functional characterization of its Arabidopsis homolog AtGR19 reveals a role in regulating cell elongation. Our study suggests a conserved function for GR genes in root elongation and resilience in pearl to Sahelian environment.

Drought was observed in 57% of years, confirming drought is a major constraint in Sahelian agroosystems affecting crops during vegetative stage. To test if fast primary root growth after germination is an adaptation to drought, we phenotyped a panel of pearl millet lines representative of genetic diversity. Seminal roots are present in pearl and lateral roots at 6 days after germination. We hypothesized fast-growing root is adaptation to Sahelian. We show drought after germination is a constraint in Sah and primary growth is correlated with tolerance under field conditions in pearl. Correlations between variables showed a strong relationship between primary growth and stay at veget, an indicator of drought tolerance (R=0.95, p<0.01). Field experiments support rapid root growth beneficial for millet to cope with drought episodes.

Differences in growth seem regulated by changes in elong. Genome-wide association and bulk segregant analysis identified a genomic region controlling trait. Combining RNA, resequencing, reannotation, a glutin-encoding Pg9 is a potential regulator. Effect of promoter polymorphisms on expression needs to be tested. To validate hypothesis, we studied its orth in Arabidopsis as functional studies not possible in pearl.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes and represents concrete and abstract concepts during real-world experiences, such as watching a movie. They found that concrete and abstract concepts encode different types of information in separate brain regions, but these differences decrease when considering multimodal context. When abstract words are processed in scenes related to their meaning, the response becomes more concrete-like. Conversely, when visual context is unrelated to the word, activation resembles abstract processing. This suggests that concepts encode experiences, but neurobiological organisation is dynamic and depends on context.

The brain integrates information across senses to form coherent concepts, essential for navigating real-world experiences. The study highlights the role of context in modulating neural representation of abstract and concrete words, similar effects may occur in other sensory contexts. The researchers tested if profiles change depending on objects in context. They predicted abstract concepts in related contexts (e.g. "love" while watching people kissing) engage regions processing concrete and visual information.

First, they examined where concrete and abstract concepts are processed across contexts and type of information they encode. Given that representations reflect context, they expected regions of typical experiences (e.g. learning) to activate across contexts. Conversely, when concepts displaced from context (e.g. "apple" while house interior), predicted to engage abstract regions processing internal/interceptive/affective information.

A second analysis aimed to understand change in concrete or abstract processing as a function of context. They found activation changes fundamentally as a function of visual context.
Researchers have been working to develop new treatments for cancer using the body's immune system to fight the disease, but a major obstacle is the limited number of targets on cancer cells that the immune system can recognize. A new pathway called nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) hides these targets by destroying the RNA from genes with mutations. Scientists conducted a high-throughput screen to identify mediators of N in human cells and found a potential disruptor, SM1, a kinase that phosphorylates UP1. This led to the creation of a new inhibitor, KVS1, which increases expression of proteins from genes with mutations in human and mouse cells. Importantly, K1 also increases presentation of immune-targetable antigens on cancer cells. This provides new opportunities to study N and diseases where it plays a role, including cancer and inherited diseases.

A new inhibitor, KVS1, blocked N pathway at low concentrations and increased expression of wild-type and mutant transcripts. Western blotting showed K1 decreased phosphorylated UP1, a target of SM1 activity, in different cell lines. Previous studies with non-specific N inhibitors increased antigens from tumor mutations when N is inhibited. Researchers tested K1 on cancer cells with truncating mutations and found it increased presentation of proteins on surface. A previous SM1 inhibitor, SMi11, had similar effects but was insoluble. The screen identified SM1 as ideal to inhibit N and developed K1 to improve its properties. K1 is soluble and can be administered to mice.
A study of 374,463 participants from the UK Biob found that age is the most significant risk factor for cancer, but aging rates vary across individuals. A new measure of biological age, PhenoAge, was used to predict site-specific and overall cancer risk. PhenoAge was calculated using chronological age and nine biomarkers, and PhenoAcc subtracted the effect of chronological age by regression, and incidence-weighted cancer polygenic risk score (CPRS) based on 20 site-specific polygenic risk scores (PRS). Compared to biologically younger participants, older individuals had a higher risk of overall cancer, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.22 (95% CI 1.18-1.27) in men and 1.26 (1.22-1.31) in women. A joint effect of genetic and PhenoAcc was observed on overall risk, with HR of 2.29 (2.10-2.51) for men and 1.94 (1.78-2.11) with high genetic and oldereno compared to low risk and youngereno. PhenoAcc was negatively associated with healthy lifestyle factors (Beta -0.01 in men, p<0.001; -0.98 women, p<0.001). Within genetic groups, oldereno was related to increased cancer risk, adjusting for chronological age, which could be retarded by a healthy lifestyle. This study was supported by the National Science Foundation of China and Jiangsu Province.
A new mobile app called Biome has been launched in Japan to gather species observations from the public using identification and gamification elements. Since its launch in 2019, the app has amassed over 6 million observations. However, community-sourced data may exhibit spatial and taxonomic biases. Researchers investigated the quality of Biome data and its impact on species distribution models (SDMs). They found that species identification accuracy exceeded 95% for birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, but was below 90% for plants, mollusks, and fishes. SDMs for 132 terrestrial plants and animals across Japan showed that incorporating Bi data into traditional data improved accuracy. For endangered species, traditional data required over 200 records for accurate models (Boyce ≥ 0.9), while blending the two sources reduced this to around 300. The coverage of urban-natural gradients by Bi data compared to traditional data biased towards natural areas may explain this improvement. Combining multiple sources better estimates species distributions, aiding protected area and ecosystem assessment. Establishing a platform accumulating community-sourced data contributes to conserving and monitoring ecosystems.

The researchers assessed the quality of Bi data by investigating non-wild and misidentified records. SDMs are statistical tools for assessing biodiversity, accounting for biases in survey efforts. They use occurrence and environmental conditions to estimate potential ranges and habitats (Booth et al, 2014; Box, 198; Elith et,201; Hutchinson,195; Phillips,200). The inclusion of Bi data improved SD accuracy, with most accurate predictions when 50-70 Bi data (Appendix). Both surveys and observations are necessary for comprehensive understanding distributions (Miller,201; Pacific,201; Robinson,202). SDMs were built on two data types: traditional and a mixture of traditional and Bi. They modelled distributions 132 animals and plants in Japan, covering subtropical to boreal areas.
Researchers investigated the role of bone morphogenetic protein receptor 1 (BMPR1)-mediated signaling in the lung mesenchyme during prenatal development and its contribution to the formation of congenital pulmonary cysts. Using mouse models, they found that abrogation of mesenchymal BR1 disrupted normal lung branching morphogenesis, leading to the formation of prenatal cystic lesions. Severe deficiency of airway smooth muscle cells and subepithelial fibers were found in cystic airways of mesym B1 knockout lungs. Ectopic mesenchym expression of BMP ligands and air epithelial perturbation of Sox-9 prox-dist axis were detected in mesym B1 knockout. Deletion of Smad/5, major BMP downstream effectors, from lungyme did not phenoc the cyst abnormalities in mesym B1. These findings reveal the first role of mesym BMP in lung development and a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying congenital cysts.

The study provides in vivo evidence that BR1-mediated signaling in mesym is indispensable for lung development. Lungym deletion of BR1 at early stage causes abnormal morph and severe cyst at gestation in mice. Congenital cysts are reported in human CP patients as result abnormal lung development. Aberrant epithelial growth also contributes air cyst formation, multiple models suggest loss Sox+ or expansion Sox+ in air epithelia associated altered differentiation, branching, and cyst pathology fetal lungs. Mesym BR1 is essential lung, particularly airway morphogenesis. BR1 expressed predominantly in mouse air epith at early gestation (E12.5 to 14.5), expression in lungyme also evident mid-estation. Here, deleted BR in lungym cells, resulted abnormal air development and cystic malformation.

The relationship BR deletion intracellular signaling and B4 expression in lungyme progenitor confirmed comparing B expression isolated lungyme with BR genotypes. Alterations other pathways, F, W, Sh not detected RNA-seq RT-PCR related genes. This phenotype resembles features pediatric diagnosed CP. Investigating lung caused lungyme BR knockout and underlying mechanisms significantly congen lung diseases.
Researchers investigated the role of anionic lipid molecules, specifically phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), in regulating the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF) activity in living cells. They used super-resolution single-molecule microscopy to visualize both EG and PI(4,5)2 nanodomains in the plasma membrane of HeLa cells. Before stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF), EG and PI(4,5)2 nanodomains aggregated through transient visits of EG to PI(4,5)2 nanodomains. The degree of coaggregation decreased after EG stimulation and depended on phospholipaseγ, EG effector hydrolyzing PI(4,5)2. Artificial reduction in PI(4,5)2 content of the plasma membrane reduced dimer and autophosphorylation of EG after stimulation with EG. Inhibition PI(4,5)2 hydrolysis after stimulation decreased phosphorylation of EG-Th654. Thus, EG kinase activity and PI(4,5)2 around EG molecules were found to be mutually regulated.

The researchers examined dynamics and roles of PI(4,5)2 as boundary and neighboring lipid of EG in activation of EG by EGF. Super microscopy revealed EG and PI(4,5 form nanodom that partially overlap before stimulation. The nanodom also form clusters and extent coagregation EG and PI(4)5 molecules in higher structure decreases after stimulation. They found PI(4)2 nanodom and EG nanocluster together before stimulation. After stimulation, degree cogregation decreases, depends on PLC but not phosphoinosit3-kinase PIK. Local PI(4)2 around EG stabilizes EG dimers to increase autosphorylation upon with EGF. Hydrolysis PI(4) by PLC plays role in deactivation EG. Results suggest autoremodeling lipid regulates EG activity.
Researchers have identified a unique carrier protein in the parasite Blastocystis that transports glycol intermediates, such as dihydroacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, across the mitochondrial membrane, linking the cytosolic and mitochondrial branches of glycolysis. This carrier is distinct from the human mitochondrial oxoglutar carrier SLC25A11 and dicarboxyl carrier SLC25, which transport different substrates malate and oxutar. Blastocyst lacks key components of oxidative phosphorylation for ATP generation, such as complexes III and IV, ATPase, and AD/ATP carriers. The presence of glycol in the matrix generates ATP for energy-requiring processes, such as macromolecular synthesis, and NAD used by complex I to generate a proton force for protein and molecule import. This carrier is a potential drug target for stramenile pathogens, which are economically important.
Researchers have proposed a new framework for genetic association studies, called the Haplotype Score (HFS), which calculates a functional activity score for each haplotype in an individual. This score replaces the traditional genotype in association studies. The FS framework was applied to 14 complex traits in the UK Biobank dataset, identifying 361 independent FS-trait associations with a significance of p < 5 × 10^(-8). Fine-mapping revealed 269 causal associations, a median of 63 per trait compared to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based analysis. The FS-based analysis uncovered 727 pathway-trait and 153-tissue associations with biological interpretability, including 'circadian-chronotype' and 'aridonic-intelligence'. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression integrated FS score with SNP-based polygenic scores, showing an improvement of 16.1-39.8% in cross-ancestry poly prediction. The study concludes that FS is a promising for understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.
Researchers investigated the impact of three different types of mental training modules on the structure and function of the hippocampus, a brain region involved in stress regulation, emotion, and behavior, in 332 healthy adults. The training modules focused on either attention-based mindfulness, socio-affective (compassion), or socio-cognitive skills. The study used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure changes in hippocampal subfield volume and functional connectivity after three months of training, and related these changes to diurnal and chronic cortisol levels. Results showed that the socioffective module increased bilateral cornu ammonis (CA-3) volume and functional connectivity compared to socio-cognitive and waitlist groups. Changes in CA-3 structure and function correlated with reduced cortisol output. A multivariate analysis found other subfields contributed to cortisol changes. The study found a link between socio-emotional intervention, hippocal structure and function, and reduced cortisol in healthy adults.
Researchers studied three species of sunflowers, Helianthus annu, Helthus argyll, and Helthus petolar, to understand how they adapt to their environments. These species have large inversions, which are areas of the genome where recombination is suppressed, and are often associated with adaptive traits. The study found that inversions facilitate adaptation, but some loci within them can still contribute to adaptation even without recombination suppression. Genome-wide association studies showed significant repeatability in phenotypes and environments, particularly in regions with inversions. This suggests that while inversions aid adaptation, some loci can still make substantial contributions without recombination. Many regions show adaptation, but strongest associations are species-specific, indicating redundancy for local adaptation in these species.

The study estimated the number of regions contributing to adaptation for each variable phenotype, related to genic redundancy. Results show adaptation in sunflowers involves repeatability at few genes, often with inversions, and redundancy across many loci. The study explored repeatability in three sunflower species, which have large recombination-suppressed regions, mostly inversions, and adaptive traits. Most inversions are over 1 million years old, predate current adaptation but not underlying genes shared among species.

Results suggest some genome contributes adaptation with low redundancy and repeility, enriched in regions with inversions, while the rest is driven by loci with redundancy and species-specific contributions. Repeatability with inv supports adaptation model for long-term persistence of inversions in sunflowers rather than dominance or meiotic mechanisms.
Researchers have found that aging affects cells in different ways, but at the level of organs and tissues, changes tend to be similar. The breast tissue is made of two types of cells: luminal epithelial and myoepithelial. Luminal epithelial cells change with age in a predictable way, which is concerning because these cells are thought to be the origin of breast cancer. The researchers hypothesized that aging affects on cell maintenance increase cancer risk. They analyzed gene expression in luminal and myepithelial cells from women under 30 and over 55. They found age-related changes and increased gene variation that led to loss of cell identity. Age-related responses were common in both types, but changes were mostly seen in luminal and involved regulation of chromatin and genome. Expression of gap protein G6 increased with age, and modulation of G6 in co-cultures showed it provided communication from myepith to lum cells. Age luminal transcriptomes showed a signal detectable in tissue aging and cancer. A machine classifier based on lum distinguished normal and cancer tissue and predicted cancer subtype. The researchers think luminal are the site of aging responses in tissue and their emergent phenotype makes them cancer cells and a sensor of cancer risk. 

Studies show how responses contribute to aging in breast tissue of older women. Variance in transcript profiles of epithelial lineages across individuals is a result of aging and key to understanding increased cancer with age. They demonstrate age and responses in epithelia explain changes to cancer. It is unclear how tissue changes reflect cell-intrinsic and micro states. Lineage analyses are needed. The breast is a bilayer of two distinct lineages-myepith and luminal cells. They show increased noise aging leads to variances between individuals and propose this underlies differences in cancer, particularly lum subtypes. Both models and changes led to decrease in expression in older cells. These show variances are drivers of loss in epithelia.
Researchers explored the possibility of using non-target reads from plant DNA sequencing as a proxy for phenotyping to understand the genetic basis of natural variation in plant resistance to pests. They analyzed data from whole-genome and epigen sequencing of 207 lines of the plant Thlaspi arse, grown in a common environment and colonized by aphids, mildew, and microbes. Results showed that the number of non-target reads to pest species differed between populations, had significant SNP heritability, and were associated with climate origin and glucosinolate content. Lines from cold and thermally fluctuating habitats, less favorable to aphids, had higher aphid load, indicating decreased resistance. Genome-wide analyses identified genetic variants in defense genes and novel regions associated with aphid and mildew load. Differentially methylated regions were found associated with pathogen loads, particularly transposons and hypomethylation in a gene involved in stomatal closure. The study provides insights into defense mechanisms of Thpi arse, a crop model species, and demonstrates non-target sequencing can estimate intensities of plant interactions.
Researchers are working to find new ways to combat malaria, a disease caused by Plasium falciparum parasite, as current treatments are becoming less effective due to resistance. One approach is using "collateral sensitivity", where resistance to one drug makes the parasite more sensitive to another. This study focused on Plasium dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), an enzyme targeted by drugs. They tested several mutant lines of DHH against various inhibitors and found one, TDC-125, active against all, including a line that arose from treatment with another drug, DSM. Most resistance to TDC-125 was due to extra copies of the dhod gene, but one mutation, DHH263, made it resistant to TDC-125 but not DSM. Selecting the resistant line with TDC-125 led to more changes in the dh gene, making it less sensitive to TDC-125 and resistant to DSM. Combining TDC-125 and DSM in treatment selected parasites with a mutation resistant to both, as fit as the original. This shows the enzyme's ability to adapt to mutations.
Researchers have found that the spread of antimal drug resistance varies greatly across different geographic regions, with most infections occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, but resistant strains emerging in low-transmission areas. Current models of resistance lack consensus on the relationship between transmission and resistance, possibly due to overlooking factors such as antigen diversity, host immunity, and selection. To address this, a novel compartment model was developed to track sensitive and resistant strains, as well as host dynamics of generalized and antigen-specific immunity. Results show a negative correlation between parasite prevalence and resistance, regardless of resistance or efficacy. Validation using chloroquine-resistant data supports this trend. Discontinuation of drugs, resistance remains high in low-diversity, low-transmission regions, while decreasing in high-divers, high-trans regions. The study highlights the critical role of malaria diversity in geographic patterns of resistance.

The diversity of Plasium falcum parasites among geographic zones drives differences in epidemiological features, yet has not been explicitly considered in models of drug resistance. The model shows that diversity and strain-specific immunity, tracked through parasite structure, can predict the complex relationship between transmission and resistance. This implies control protocols should vary by region, and there is no one-size-fits cure for malaria worldwide. The inclusion of diversity provides a mechanistic explanation for Southeast Asia's persisting resistance to antimal drugs, despite lower transmission than Africa. In regions with low diversity, parasites cannot reinfect hosts, and clinically immune hosts do not carry infections often.

The study presents a theoretical argument based on a mechanistic model, explaining geographic variation in antimal drug resistance invasion and maintenance. The Malaria Project did not predict prevalence before 200, while antimal drugs started early 200 in African countries. Comparisons were restricted to studies between 1990 and 200, using 200 as proxy. Studies with less than 20 were excluded.
Researchers investigated the impact of Δ-THC, the most abundant phytocannabinoid in cannabis, on early embryonic development using a stepwise in vitro system that captures the embryonic cascade. They found that Δ-TH increases proliferation of naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) but not their primed counterparts, and this effect is dependent on the CB receptor. However, this increased proliferation is associated with moderate transcriptomic changes. Instead, Δ-TH capitalizes ESCs' metabolic capabilities by increasing glycolytic and anabolic rates. This metabolic rewiring is retained throughout differentiation to Prim Germ-Like Cells in the absence of direct exposure and is associated with alteration of their transcription profile. The study reveals the first in-depth characterization of Δ-TH's impact on early stages of gerine development.
Researchers studied the immune system of the zebraf fish (Danio rerio), a species with hundreds of NLR genes, to understand the phenomenon of copy variation in large gene families. They sequenced 93 zebraf from multiple wild and laboratory populations, identifying 151 NLRs, more than the previously known 400. Approximately half of the NLRs were present in all wild populations, but only 4% were found in 80% or more of the fish. Wild zebraf had up to twice as many NLR per individual and up to four times as many NLR per population as laboratory strains. In contrast, nucleotide diversity in zeb NLR genes was low, with half being monomorphic and the rest having few polymorphisms, indicating purifying selection. This suggests the evolution of these genes is not neutral. The expression of NLR is often induced by pathogen exposure, but the function of most zeb NLR genes is unclear.

The study found a substantial reduction in single nucleotide variation in zeb laboratory strains compared to wild. The copy number and variation of NLR were also reduced, likely due to a recent population bottleneck in the establishment of laboratory strains. The diversity of NLR in zeb is staggering, with individuals having genes not present in others. This can be caused by diversity-generating mechanisms active now. The study lays groundwork for future research on the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms contributing to large vertebrate gene diversity.
Researchers have discovered a new species of ancient seed, Alenia tria gen. sp. nov., from the Famennian period of the Late Devonian era, approximately 372-359 million years ago. This seed, found in Xinhang, Anhui, China, has three integument wings that extend outwards and inwards along the abaxial side, enclosing the nucellus, and is borne on a smooth, dichotomous branch without a cupule. This finding suggests that the earliest ovules without a cup may have evolved for photosynthetic and wind dispersal functions, indicating that seeds with wings originated before other dispersal mechanisms such as plumes and papp. Mathematical analysis shows that three-winged seeds are more adapted to wind dispersal than seeds with one or four wings under the same conditions. 

The earliest Famenn ovules, lacking integument outgrowths, rarely played a role in wind dispersal. Nearly all Famenn ovules are cupulate, i.e., borne in a protecting and pollinating cup. The new Alenia ovule represents the second cupulate ovule in the Famenn. It terminates on leafless branches, bears wings and lacks cup, implying novel functions of integument. Alenia, Guia, and Waria suggest that evolution of wings as integ outgrowths and important for seed dispersal by wind appeared early in spermatophytes and manifested in younger lineages. Other dispersal mechanisms including plumes, papp, and parachutes of seeds appeared in Permo-Carbonous and Mesozoic respectively.
Researchers have identified a new mechanism in Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) leukemia, a type of blood cancer, where the protein RSY and BCR-ABL co-occur. RSY mediates the neddylation of B-ABL, making it more stable and resistant to degradation. This leads to increased B-ABL levels, promoting cancer progression. In contrast, depleting RSY expression or its ligase activity decreases B- stability, inhibiting tumor growth. The study found that RSY is highly expressed in Ph leukemia patients and promotes disease progression by stabilizing B- via nedlation. RSY's NED8 ligase activity enhances B- stability, promoting leukemogenesis. B- levels correlate with RSY levels, showing specificity of RSY-mediated nedlation. The study reveals RSY's role in hematology and potential as a therapeutic target for Ph leukemia.
Researchers have developed a new strategy to discover enzymes called peptoglycan hydrolases that can break down peptoglycan, a key component of bacterial cell walls, making them promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics. Traditional methods to find these enzymes are limited by the availability of bacterial genomes. The new approach uses antimicrobial peptides from bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, as a template to search for peoglycan hyrolases in bacterial proteomes. As a proof-of-concept, they found two potent peogcan hyrolases, PH10 and PH11, from the proteome of Acinetobacter baumannii. These enzymes showed bactericidal activity against multiple pathogens even after heat treatment at 100°C for 1 hour, while others were thermosensitive. The structures of PH8, PH10, and PH11 were solved, revealing that PH10 underwent a unique folding change due to a dimeromer transition, while PH8 formed a monomer. Mouse models of infection demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PH10. This method provides a new clue for discovering antimicrobial drugs.
Researchers analyzed data from 6.9 million patients in the Danish National Patient Registry from 1994 to 2018, finding 23,592 with pancreatic cancer, and 18,523 in the cancer registry. They used text mining to extract symptoms from clinical notes in electronic health records of 307 cancer patients and 30,780 controls to compare with registry codes. This showed text mining captured more symptoms before diagnosis, such as 'blood pressure without diagnosis', 'abnormal heartbeat', and 'intestinal obstruction', not found in registry analysis. Trajectories of symptoms identified two groups with lower survival, 'Cough→Jaice→intestinal' and 'pain→Jaice→normal function'. This study compared two types of pancreatic symptom trajectories, combining data to detect early risk factors for cancer. 

The study included text vocabulary of known pancreatic symptoms and compared trajectories using registry and EHR data to characterize symptom ordering across sources. It found significant symptoms before cancer that may be early risk factors for screening. Complementing cancer codes with text mining, symptoms were more abundant in EHRs than NPR. Future applications could use AI and mining to build trajectories for early cancer prediction in clinics, serving as a guide for screening and improving lives. The study showed phenotypic data in registry and EHR can detect patterns before diagnosis, and increased prevalence in EHR suggesting multi-modality trajectories from EHR and registry.
Researchers studied the relationship between two types of brain waves, slow oscillations and spindles, that occur during non-rapid eye sleep in children and adults. They found that in adults, slow oscillations and sples are synchronized, meaning they happen together at the same time, but this was not well understood in children. The study looked at children aged 5-6, 8, 11, and 14, and 18, and adults 20-26 years old. They found that in all age groups, slow oscillations and sples happened together, but were less precise in children. They also found that as children got older, their brain waves became more like those of adults, and this was linked to better synchronization between oscill and sples. The study suggests that ability to have adult-like brain waves is linked to better synchronization of oscill and sples from childhood to young adulthood.
Researchers have found that many genes studied in recent publications were already known before the completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003, despite advancements in high-throughput technologies that identify new genes associated with biological processes and diseases. The selection of genes as research targets may be biased, but the reasons are not well understood. This study suggests that understudied genes are abandoned in favor of better-stud genes between the completion of experiments and reporting results. Understud genes remain ignored in studies that cite these experiments. However, understud genes may receive more citations. Among 45 factors proposed to affect gene selection, 33 are associated with titles and abstracts of studies. A tool, Find My Understudied Genes (FM), was developed to investigate bias during selection. FM identified understud genes in vertebrate aging. FM is available for download as a MacOS/Windows app.

The study found that understud genes are abandoned between experiments and results, not later research. Abandonment may be due to concern that less-invest genes yield lower impact. Researchers must travel a pipeline from reality to results, extended by other scholars. Lack of publications is not explained by evidence. Understud genes found in high-through experiments are not investigated. FM combined insights to promote understud genes. Several tools aim to publicize understud genes. There may be no incentive to highlight understud in high-through studies. Factors proposed to limit understud genes range from evolutionary to chemical.
Researchers have investigated the potential health effects of artificially sweetened beverages containing non-caloric monosacides, which are often marketed as a healthier alternative to sugar-sweetened drinks. However, the impact of these sweeteners on blood vessel function is not well understood. A zebraf model was created to mimic the excessive blood vessel growth seen in diabetic retinopathy, a complication of diabetes. The study found that glucose and nonoric monacides caused excessive vessel formation, particularly in small, branched vessels. This was due to the activation of resting endothelial cells into proliferating cells. Single-cell analysis revealed an increase in proliferating endothelial cells and upregulated pro-angiogenic genes. Further research showed that fox1 mediated excessive vessel growth by upregulating marck1. This study provides new evidence of the negative effects of nonoric monacides on the vascular system and underlying mechanisms.
Researchers investigated how the brain processes and stores multiple sequences of information in working memory. They asked participants to memorize sequences of items with different colors and locations, and then reproduce the colors and locations in order. The researchers manipulated the consistency of the location and color trajectories. Results showed that sequences with consistent trajectories improved memory performance and a correlation between color and location sequences. Sequences with consistent trajectories showed neural reactivation of common trajectories and spontaneous replay of color sequences when recalling locations. This suggests a shared structure is used for storing multiple sequences through encoding and replay, facilitating efficient organization in working memory.

EEG recordings provided evidence of a compressive strategy, reactivation of shared trajectories during encoding and retention, and replay of color sequences during recall. Reactivation was related to working memory and behavior. Shared structure enables storage of multiple sequences through encoding and replay, facilitating information organization in working memory. When preparing to reproduce location, the task-relevant color showed spontaneous replay, highlighting the bond between color and sequences with common trajectory. With color-location correlation in behavior, findings suggest replay mechanisms in working memory mediate combinations based on common structures.

Behavioral and neural evidence converges for leveraging common structures to facilitate working memory. Sequences with color-location aligned (condition) showed enhanced precision and correlation between color and sequence trajectories. Replay has been posited to represent structure (Huang et al, 2018; Liu et al 2019), structure inference (Liu et al 202b), and generalization (Barry and Love 202). When preparing recall location, replay occurs for color but not sequences, supporting spontaneous replay since features not task-relevant.
Researchers have discovered that mutations in the PUR gene cause a neurodevelopmental disorder known as PUR syndrome. Unlike many other genetic disorders, almost all mutations in this nucleic acid-binding protein result in the disease. The study found that mutations in PUR impair its localization to processing bodies, either destroying its integrity, RNA binding, or dimerization. The researchers solved the structures of the N and C-terminal domains of PUR and combined them with molecular simulations and nuclear resonance measurements. They observed high dynamics and promiscuity in PUR, making it susceptible to mutations. This explains why even conservative mutations in PUR result in full penetrance of symptoms in patients with syndrome.

The study found that modest structural alterations in PUR must result in functional impairment, supported by experimental flexibility and folding promuity of domains. The structure of a variant with a solvent-exposed chain further supported these findings. Molecular simulations indicated high motions in the N-terminal domain. Unlike hotspots for disease-causing mutations in other disorders, variations in PUR are found along the entire sequence. The study assessed the structure and function of PUR and the impact of syndrome-causing mutations on its integrity.

Over 270 pathogenic variants in PUR have been identified in patients with syndrome. The aim was to understand how variations affect the protein's functional and structural integrity. This study provides the first experimental assessment of effects on folding, nucleic binding, unwinding, and subcell localization to granules. Some variants were predicted to have defects.
Researchers have found that the interaction between TRPV4 and anoctamin 1 (AN1) plays a crucial role in the efflux of water from exocrine glands, suggesting it may be involved in perspiration. In mouse foot pads, TR4 colocalized with cytokeratin 8, AN1, and aquapor-5 (AQP5). Sweat glands showed TR4-dependent cytosolic Ca2+ increases inhibited by menthol. Acetylcholine-stimulated sweating in foot was temperature-dependent in wild-type but not TR4-deficient mice and inhibited by menthol in wild and TRPMKO mice. Basal sweating without acetyl stimulation was inhibited by AN1 inhibitor. Sweating may be important for friction in mouse pads, supported by wild mice climbing a slippery slope more easily than TR4-deficient. TR4 expression was higher in controls and normidrotic skin with acquired generalized anhidrosis (A) compared anhidrotic skin with A. Collectively, TR4 is involved in temperature-dependent perspiration via interaction with AN1, and TR4 or TR4/AN1 complex may be targeted to regulate pers.

TR4, AN1, and A5 form a complex that promotes secretion in eccrine glands of mouse pads. TR-expressing secretory cells are involved in secretion of macromolecular components and water and ions. TR4 is expressed in human eccrine glands. Sweat glands are innervated by sympathetic neurons, acetylcholine (Ach) released from endings. The interaction of TR4 and AN is involved in temperature-dependent sweating and friction. TR expression in sweat glands mouse pads responded to TR agonist GSK and Ach. Temperature basal sweating without stimulation was observed in mice but not TRKO. Ment, a TR8 activator, inhibits AN function. Ability to inhibit both TR4 and AN suggests menthol inhibits sweating. Expression of TR, AN, and water channel A5 in ecc glands mouse pads was detected.
Researchers have developed a new way to describe the shape and size of the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain, across different species. They found that all cortices can be described as a series of folds of different sizes that merge together. When these folds merge, the cortices of 11 primate species and 70 other mammalian species follow a similar pattern. This suggests that all cortices are approximations of the same shape with a fractal dimension of 2.5. This new understanding allows for a more precise measurement of brain shape at different scales. To demonstrate its importance, the researchers showed that brain size changes with age, with a four times increase in size from two to eight standard deviations at a scale of 2mm. This new understanding may lead to better biomarkers for conditions in the future.

The researchers propose a new way to describe brain shape as a function of scale, not just a list of measurements or listing sulci and gyri. This new method can show how biological processes act on specific scales, leaving others untouched. It suggests a universal blueprint for mammalian brain shape and common mechanisms for folding. The new method can also differentiate subtle changes better than current metrics at a single scale.

The study found that primate and mammalian brains share key shape properties, including fractal dimension 2.5. The main result is a universal scaling equation for primate and mammalian cortices. Two aspects of this universality are that each cortex has same value for substructures smaller than a scale and fractal dimension 2.5. Fractal scaling has been postulated for cortical morphology, with recent studies using MRI data. Estimates of fractal dimension for whole cortex are close to 2.5.
Researchers investigated the role of the NF-κB transcription factor REL in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells, a type of pancreatic cancer. They used live-cell imaging to study REL dynamics in PDAC cells and found that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNα) induces rapid, sustained, non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of REL. Analysis of single-cell datasets revealed REL heterogeneity in PDAC cells is dependent on actin dynamics. RNA sequencing identified distinct REL-regulated gene expression in PD cells, including TNα-induced upregulation of actin regulators NU2 and ARHG31. Knockdown of ARHG31 and NU2 altered TNα-stimulated REL dynamics in PD cells, establishing a negative feedback loop regulating REL activation by TNα. The study also characterized the NF-κ pathway in PD cells, showing NF-κ/Iκ proteins interact with REL in the presence or absence of TNα. The results provide evidence of interdependence between the actin network and NF-κ pathway with REL translocation in PDAC. 

Using RNA sequencing, researchers identified genes with distinct expression patterns based on TNα and REL activation. Live imaging with knockdown of targets revealed mechanisms regulating REL dynamics in PD, including negative loops between REL and actin modulators NU2 and AR31, and between REL and non-canonical NFκ protein REL. The NFκ pathway was characterized in PD cells, and actin modulators ARHG/NU2 were found to be both REL targets and regulators of nuclear REL with TNα, mediating the relationship between act and REL. In contrast, NF1 and NF2 showed increased interaction with REL TNα, forming NF-κ heteromers with REL, NF1 and NF2 in PD cells. The effect of siRNA knockdown of TN-regulated genes on TN-stimulated REL was evaluated, suggesting Iκ plays a role in suppressing TN induction of REL in PD cells. REL was found to be modulated by NFκ/I proteins in the absence of stress or inflammatory cues.
A finely tuned balance between excitation and inhibition (E/I) is crucial for proper brain function. Disruptions in the GABA system, which alter this equilibrium, are common in various neurological disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Mutations in Phosphase Tens Hom (PTEN), the main regulator of the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate/Akt pathway, are associated with ASD. However, it is unclear if PTEN can differentially affect inhibitory and excitatory signaling. Using Caenorhabditis elegans neuromus system, both excitatory (cholinergic) and inhibitory (GABA) inputs regulate muscle activity, d-18/EN mutations impact GABA but not cholin development and function. This results in a deficiency in inhibitory signaling. Defects in the GABA system d-18EN mutants are due to reduced D-16 activity during development. Ketogenic diets (KDs) have proven effective for disorders with E imbalances. However, mechanisms remain elusive. A diet with the ketone body-hydrobutyrate during development induces D-16 activity, improving GABA development in d-EN mutants. This study links PT mutations and neurodevelopment defects and delves mechanisms underlying KD effects.
Researchers have found that the body's innate immune response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) plays a crucial role in the development of COVID-19. They discovered that certain factors, including pro-inflammatory cytokines, are essential for containing the virus. Using quantitative and qualitative models, they found that human monocytes secrete factors that inhibit SARSV-2-induced cell fusion in infected cells. Through cytokine screening, they identified interleukin-1 (IL-1) as a key mediator of inflammation that inhibits syncytia formation by various SARS-2 strains. Mechanistically, IL-1 activates the Rho/RO signaling pathway through a non-canonical IL receptor, driving actin enrichment at cell junctions, preventing syncytia. In vivo experiments in mice confirmed IL-1 restricted SARS-2 spread in lung epithelium. The study highlights the function and mechanism of IL-1 on SARS-2-induced cell fusion, revealing an antiviral role for cytokines during infection. 

The study demonstrated IL-1's function in inhibiting SARS-2 syncytia formation and innate factors against coronavirus transmission, providing potential targets for control. IL-1 inhibited various SARS-2 and betacoronaviruses-induced cell fusion. IL-1, a key inflammatory factor, inhibited SARS-2-induced syncytia in cells by activating R/RO to initiate actin formation between S-2-infected and neighboring cells. IL-1 significantly reduced S-2 transmission in lung epithelial mice in vivo. Fluorescence showed S-2-infected epithelial fused with cells promoting transmission, while IL- induced actin bundles restricting syncia and transmission. Mechanistically, IL- activates R to cell junction S-2-infected and neighboring via IL- to initiate actin, preventing fusion and spreading.
In Drosophila, insulin-producing cells (IPCs) play a crucial role in maintaining metabolic homeostasis by releasing insulin into the circulation, similar to mammalian pancreatic beta cells. Researchers investigated the dynamics of IPC activity in response to nutritional and internal state changes using electrophysiological recordings. They found that nutritional state strongly modulates IPC activity, with activity decreasing during starvation and increasing after feeding with glucose or fructose, but not with non-nutritive sugars. In contrast, glucose perfusion did not affect IPC activity, similar to the mammalian incretin effect where glucose ingestion drives insulin release more than intravenous application. Unlike IPC, Drosila hormone 44-expressing neurons in the pars intercerealis (DH44s) responded to glucose perfusion. Functional experiments showed DH44s do not affect IPC, while other DHNs inhibit them, indicating autonomous and systemic sugar-sensing neurons work in parallel to maintain homeostasis. Activating IPC had a satiety effect on food-search behavior and reduced starvation-induced hyperactivity, while activating DHNs increased hyperactivity. The study demonstrates IPC and DHNs are integral to a modulatory network orchestrating glucose homeasis and behavior response to metabolic shifts.
Researchers have developed a new tool to study proteins in living cells by tagging them with a fluorescent marker called mNeGreen. However, creating this marker in human cells is challenging due to low efficiency. A new protein called splitNeGreen was used to create a large library of tagged cells in HEK cells. This method can now be applied to human stem cells to study proteins in different cell types. A human stem cell line was engineered to express a part of the splitGreen protein (NG-10) and efficiently tagged proteins with the other part (NG). This allowed live imaging of cellular processes like cell division in stem cells. This is a step towards creating a library of tagged human stem cells to study proteins across cell types.

A human stem cell was imaged with high resolution to study cell division, a dynamic process. This work provides a basis for a library of tagged human stem cells to study proteins in different cell types. The splitGreen system was used for tagging in stem cells (Figure 1). A stem cell line was engineered to constantly express NG-10 and validated, named NG-P. As proof, multiple genes were tagged with NG and several stem lines isolated. This provides a foundation for a library of tagged stem cells and protocols to generate tags in stem.

The splitGreen protein is efficient and retains brightness of the original. This allows tagging in cells where NG-10 is expressed. A library of proteins in cells requires high-throughput. Split proteins can be used for large tagging (Feng et al, 2017; et al 2019; et al 2016; et 202; et 202).
Researchers have developed a new method for creating electrolytic lesions in the brain that allows for simultaneous electrophysiological recording of neuronal activity before and after the lesion. This technique uses a custom-built current source to deliver a stable current through the microelectrode, enabling repeatable and controlled lesions in awake animals. The performance of this method was validated through histology, in vivo testing, and voltage and spiking activity measurements. The electrolytic lesion method provides millimeter precision over the extent and submillimeter precision over the location of the injury, and permits electrophysiological recording of single-unit activity from the remaining population after lesion. This technique can be used in various areas of the cortex, in multiple species, and with any multielectrode probe. The low-cost device can be easily integrated into existing electrophysiology setups. This method is expected to enable causal investigations of the neuronal population's role in circuit function while providing insight into reorganization after neuron loss.

The researchers demonstrated the novel method using a microelectro array compatible with electrophys recording of activity pre- and post-lesion. A custom current source was built to ensure stable delivery throughout the lesion, for repeated lesions, and across different electrode types and animals. The design can be used for intracort electrodes optimized for electrophiology and electrolytic lesion. The technique was tested with a multact probe in vivo rabbit cortex, and there are no limitations preventing it from working with any multielect probe. The method enables small, permanent inactivation while maintaining neuroelectroph recordings. Selection of electrical pattern, amplitude, duration, and electrode shape offers combinations for investigations into causal cortical activity. The method was demonstrated across multielect probes in rabbits, pigs, sheep, and macaques, and can be used in smaller species like rats with multielect probes. The approach is limited to superficial structures due to accessibility.
Bees play a crucial role in pollinating agricultural crops, but their populations are at risk due to pesticide use. One of the main risks bees face is poisoning from pesticides in nectar and pollen. Studies on neonicotinoids have reported conflicting evidence on whether bees can detect these pesticides in sucrose solutions and avoid them. This study used an assay for detection of aversion combined with single-sens electrophysiology to test the mouthparts of the buffailed bumblebee (Bombus terrestr) for the presence of pesticides in a solution mimicking nectar of oilseed (Brassica nap). Bees did not avoid solutions containing concentrations of imaclopr, thiamox, clothin, or sulfox spanning six orders of magnitude, even at lethal doses. Only extremely high concentrations altered spiking in gustatory neurons through slight reduction or change in rate. This provides strong evidence that bumblees cannot detect or avoid field-relevant pesticides using mouthparts. As bees rarely contact nectar with other parts, they are at risk of unwittingly consuming pesticides in nectar of pesticide-treated crops.
Researchers investigated the prevalence of Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria parasite, in non-human primates (NHP) across Southeast Asia. They analyzed data from 632 NHP from 148 sites and found that prevalence varied across the region, with low overall and high estimates in Malaysian Borneo. Regions with higher NHP prevalence overlapped with human infection hotspots, and transmission linked to land conversion and fragmentation. Using remote sensing and statistical models, they identified relationships between P know in NHP and forest fragmentation, suggesting higher prevalence contingent on habitat complexity. This study addresses gaps in regional know epidemiology and indicates simian reservoirs may drive human spillo risk.

The study aimed to assemble a georeferenced dataset of P know in NHP, evaluate variation in N know prevalence by region, and assess environmental and spatial factors for know in NHP across Asia. Human P know infection in Sab has been associated with forest loss, agricultural activities, and fragmentation at local scales. Prevalence in hosts is a crucial factor in zoon spillo events. Researchers hypothesized know in primate species is spatially heterogeneous, driven by forest loss and fragmentation, contributing to land use and know risk.

This study is the first to assess know in NHP at regional scale, across habitats. Prediction intervals indicate heterogeneity within regions, consistent with variability across sites. Forest plots for prevalence can be found in Appendix 2. Covariate and know data were used to explore relationships between landscape and N malaria. Notwithstanding limitations, this study highlights heterogeneity and landscape driving know rates in N. The intersection of epidemiology and ecology requires considering dynamics within reservoirs in public interventions.
Researchers have reconstructed the evolutionary history of the beetle family Belidae, a group of plant-eating insects, by combining fossil and molecular data. The results show that Belidae originated around 138 million years ago in Gondwana, associated with conifer plants, specifically Pinops. The larvae likely fed on dead or decaying branches of these plants. As Gwana broke apart, Belidae tracked their host plants to distant landmasses, some shifting to angiosperms and cycads when conifers declined. They developed new interactions, including brood parasitism with cycads and associations with achlorophyllous angperms. Recent radiations of Bel in genera Rhin (Australian region) and Prohin (Hawaiian Islands) have relatively recent origins.

Belidae originated in Gwana, with two subfamilies Belinae and Oxycninae in Australian and Neotropical regions respectively. Ancestral plants were likely Pinops or angios. Belinae had Pinops as ancestral hosts. Bel originated in Jurassic with gymperms, colonizing angios as they diversified in Late Cret and Paleogene. Subfamilies Bel and Oxycn diverged during East and West Gana separation. Both lineages still use ancestral plants. East Gana clade Bel divergence between Agiot and Dordus was 44.7 Ma during PaleoceneE separation of America and Australia. Some Bel use plant organs opportunistically. Gana origin was 138 Ma when America and Australia connected via Antarctica.
Researchers have analyzed data from hundreds of samples of liver cancer tumors to understand how they grow and evolve over time. They found that cancer cells in these tumors tend to grow uniformly throughout the tumor, rather than just on the surface. The team also discovered how mutations and cell death contribute to tumor growth. This study sheds light on how tumors develop in the body and can be applied to high-resolution data in the field of spatial biology.

The researchers used data from liver cancer samples taken at high resolution to analyze early tumor growth in the body. They are the first to link tumor sampling with evolution on a larger scale, comparing primary and metastatic tumors to understand metastasis dynamics. Previous studies have formed basis for population-genetic approaches analyzing tumor data.

To compare different evolutionary dynamics, researchers used high-resolution data on mutation distribution in tumors. From distribution, it's possible to infer spatio-temporal tumor evolution: uniform growth across tumor or growth near the edge, and interplay between tissue and genetic dynamics. They used whole-genome data from liver cancer and previously published. From late-stage tumors, they inferred earlier growth. Developed metrics intra-tumor heterogeneity leveraging spatial samples' position.

This contrasts surface growth, dispersal mechanism postulated for observed distribution. Probed migration between regions, multi-sampling detectable mutations in limited samples.
Researchers have studied the seasonal polyphenism of the insect Copsa chinensis, which exhibits two distinct morphotypes: summer-form and winter-form. Previous studies have shown that low temperature and the receptor CTR regulate the transition from summer-form to winter, affecting cuticle content and thickness. However, the underlying neuroendocrine mechanism was unknown. This study reveals the novel function of Bicon, a hormone responsible for hardening and darkening the cuticle, and its receptor in the transition from summer to winter. Two subunits of Bicon, CBα and CBβ, were identified and regulated by low temperature and CTR. They formed a heterodimer that mediated the transition by influencing cuticle contents and thickness. The study also found that CB-R acts as the Bicon receptor and plays a role in the upstream signaling of the chitin biosynthesis pathway regulating the transition. Additionally, miR-2 targets CB-R, contributing to the regulation of Bicon signaling in the polyism of C. These findings provide insights into the neuroendocrine mechanism underlying polyism and the function of Bicon and its receptor.
Diffuse midline gliomas (DM) are aggressive and fatal tumors of the central nervous system that are highly resistant to treatment. A mutation of the lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3-K27M) is a driver in DM, reshaping the epigenetic landscape to promote tumorigenesis. H-K27 gliomas are characterized by deregulation of histone acetylation and methylation pathways, as well as the oncogenic MYC pathway. Researchers examined the therapeutic potential of dual targeting histone deacetylases (HD) and MY in these tumors. Treatment of H-K27-derived cells with Sop, an inhibitor of MY-driven tumors in vivo, in combination with the HD inhibitor Vorin, resulted in substantial decrease in viability. Transcriptome and epigen profiling revealed synergistic effect of this combination in downregulation of oncogenic pathways such as mTOR. In vivo studies of patient-derived orthopic xenograft showed significant tumor reduction in mice treated with the combination. These results highlight combined with HD and MY inhibitors as a promising approach for these aggressive tumors.

A novel strategy targeting epigen and transcriptional pathways in H-KMant DM is proposed. HD inhibition, with the MY inhibitor, inhibited oncogenic signatures and reduced growth in vivo. Findings emphasize ep dependencies of H-driven gliomas and the potential of treatments for this malignancy. Histone acylation is a potential target for this cancer, with pan-deacetyl inhibitors such as Vor and Panin found to inhibit growth and restore expression alterations in malignant H-K gliomas. H-K gliomas are characterized deregulation of ep pathways affecting post-transl modifications lysine methylation and acylation and lysine methylation on hist H Bender et al, Chan et al, Lewis et, et Kr et, et Harun et. High amplification of MY is recurrent in high-grade gliomas Bucowicz et al, Mackay et. H-K show high of MY and MY genes due ep alterations and variants, resulting viability on MY signaling Kr et, Paj et, Dubois et.

The PIN inhibitor Sop was shown to downregulate MY genes in vitro and block MY-driven tumors murine neurooma. To address an effective therapy for H-K DM, dual of histone and MY activation using Vor and Sop was tested.
The white-footed deerm (Peromys leucopus) is a long-lived rodent that serves as a reservoir for several zoonotic diseases in North America, including Lyme disease, babesiosis, anaplasis, and viral encephalitis. Despite being persistently infected with these pathogens, the deerm shows no apparent disability or diminished fitness. Researchers used lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a model for inflammation elicited by various pathogens, to compare genome-wide transcription in blood of P. leuc, Musculus, and Rattus norveicus, and adjusted for white cell concentrations. Deerm were distinguished from mice and rats by LPS profiles consistent with non-classical monocytes and alternatively-activated macrophages. L-treated P. leuc, in contrast to mice and rats, displayed little transcription of interferon-gamma and lower fold-changes in type 1 interfer-stimulated genes. These characteristics of P. leuc were also noted in Borrelia herms infection. The phenomenon was associated with reduced transcription of endogenous retroirus and cytoplasmic pattern receptors in deerm. Results reveal a mechanism for infection tolerance in this species and other animal reservoirs for human disease.

The de and M. mus had differentially expressed genes (DE) in blood, spleen, and liver. Inflammation of deerm was consistent with 'alternatively' or M-type macroage polarization instead of expected 'classical' or M-type polarization that observed M. mus. 'leocyte' and'migration' were down-regulated DE in M mus. Distinct GO for up-regulated genes mice deerm were 'to virus', 'to interfer-beta', 'to-gamma', 'to protoan', and II interfer signaling. Transcription restrained in de was also noted for M2 On the other hand, greater foldanges from baseline in P leopus than mus for M8, Sl, S1009, and Ilb, gene interleukin-1. Supplementary lists selected targets with means and intervals for normalized values controls and L-treated mus and L-treated leopus.

The de continues to thrive while sustaining infections as reservoir (Bar, 201). Diverse tick pathogens and diseases for humans include extracellular Borre burgdorferi (Lyme), intracellular Anap phagtophil (anlas), protoan Babes micro (babes), and Powan flav (encephal. le and LPS M mus had similar slopes, but y-intercept shifted towards higher ratio neutils to lymph for blood from L group de. Control mice and de and LPS had percentages ~5 monocytes blood; mean rose 10 in L de (p0.12). Eosin tended higher de at 3.4 (2-4) than mice 1
Researchers studied the caspase family of proteases, specifically caspase 3 and casp 7, which are involved in the cleavage and activation of gasdermin, the executor of pyroptosis. They found that human casp 3 and cas 7 recognize the same consensus motif DD, but human gasdermin is cleaved by cas 3 but not cas 7. To understand this observation, they identified pyroptic puffer gasmin that was cleaved by both puffer cas 3 and human cas 7. Domain swapping between puffer and human cas and gasmin showed that the gasmin C-terminus and cas 7 subunit determined cleavage of gasmin by cas. Cas 7 contains a key residue that governs cas substrate discrimination. This residue is conserved in vertebrate cas 3 and most vertebrate except mammalian cas 7. In mammals, the residue is conserved in non-primates but not primates. However, cas 7 cleaved human gasmin but not gasmin. These findings revealed the mechanism of cas 7 substrate discrimination and divergence of cas 7-mediated gasmin activation in vertebrate. The results also suggested mutation-mediated alteration of cas enabled divergence and specialization of cas members in regulation of cellular activities in mammals.
Researchers conducted a single-blind, placebo-controlled study to investigate the neural and behavioral effects of ketamine in 40 healthy participants. Participants received an initial ketamine bolus of 0.23mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion of 0.58mg/hr. The study aimed to quantify resting-state functional connectivity and relate it to ketamine-induced symptom variation and gene expression. Results showed that ketamine's effects are multi-dimensional, reflecting individual variability. The neural effects of ketamine matched somatostatin (SST) and parvalbum (PB) gene patterns in humans, while the mean did not. Behavioral-driven symptom variation mapped onto distinct ketamine gradients, resolvable at the single-subject level. These findings highlight the importance of considering individual variation in response to ketamine and have implications for precise pharmacological biomarkers in psychiatry.
Researchers have proposed the RNA world hypothesis, which suggests that the first self-replicating units of life existed in the form of RNA-like polymers. However, a problem arises with non-enzymatic replication, as the formation of hybridization between template and copy strands reduces replication speed, leading to parabolic growth kinetics. This study investigates the information-maint ability of parabolic growth in multispecies models under constant population and chemostat conditions. Results show that large population sizes and small replication rates favor the coexistence of most replicator species, alleviating the error problem of exponential amplification. Sequence properties and resource availability determine the number of coexisting variants, suggesting fluctuations favored cycles of exploration and exploitation. Stochastic parabolic growth may have played a role in preserving sequences generated by abiotic synthesis and providing genetic material to early evolution of ribozymes.

The study aims to quantify the information-maint potential of RNA-like replicators displaying parabolic growth modeled as stochastic dynamics. Replicators are represented individually, copying and energetic constraints are considered. A constant population model is used to investigate diversity-maint mechanisms in the par regime. Parabolic coexistence is resistant to mutation rates for enzyme-free replication, proposing a biochemical mechanism to relax the error threshold in RNA systems. A chemostat model is used to demonstrate Darwinian selection by exclusion, considering monomer resources. Increased competition can induce a switch from coexistence to survival of the fittest.

The diversity-maint mechanism of par populations can be used to investigate coevolution of naked and encapsulated replicators. Besides the RNA world hypothesis, other concepts exist, such as metabolism or autotrophic origins. Replicating populations displaying parabolic growth are prone to self-inhibition by duplex formation, promoting coexistence. Parabolic growth can sustain unlimited competing species in infinite size.
Researchers have discovered that the main protease of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, called Nsp, cleaves a human enzyme called TR1, which is necessary for modifying RNA in cells. When SARS-CoV infects human cells, TR1 levels decrease and RNA modifications are reduced, indicating that N cleavage of TR1 by Nsp. Nsp cleaves TR1 at a specific site matching the sequence of SARSV-2 polyprotein cleavage sites, and a mutation in this site inhibits Nsp-dependent cleavage of TR1. The cleaved TR1 fragments have altered RNA activity and cannot rescue RNA modification in TR1-deficient human cells. Compared to wild-type cells, TR1-deficient cells infected with SARSV-2 have reduced intracellular RNA levels. These findings show that Nsp cleavage of TR1 and perturbation of RNA patterns contribute to SARS-CoV pathogenesis. SARS-2 infection correlates with decreased TR1 levels and reduced m2G-modified RNAs, and TR1 is required for efficient SARS-2 replication in human cells. Studies reveal TR1 as a novel cleavage target of Nsp during SARS-2 infection and suggest mechanisms associated with perturbations in TR-catalyzed RNA.
Researchers investigated how certain microbes become disease-causing pathogens. They found that many microbes are not inherently pathogenic, but can take advantage of an opportunity to infect a host. A hypothesis suggests that selection in the environment can favor traits that lead to pathogenicity and virulence, or serve as adaptations for survival in a host. An example of such a trait is surface adherence. To test this idea, Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations were evolved to attach to a plastic for hundreds of generations. Along with adherence, multicellular phenotypes biofilm formation and flocculation increased; another phenotype pseudohyph growth responded to nutrient limitation. Experimental selection led to the evolution of highly-adherent, hypermultic strains. Wax larvae injected with hyperic strains were more likely to die than those with nonic strains. Results support the idea that selection for a beneficial trait in the environment can generate opportunistic, 'accidental' pathogens.

Yeast were artificially selected for adherence in one context to determine if it increased virulence in another. They were evolved to adhere to plastic and tested against wax larvae to estimate vir. Populations of two genetic backgrounds increased their ability to express multicellularity. To test the coincidental-acc vir hypothesis, changes were determined if evolved had effect vir, particularly hyperic clones. Virulence was measured using larvae of the wax moth, Galleria mellon, an invertebrate used to study pathogenesis and vir. In this research, selection was applied to a specific trait hypothesized dual-use yeast, Sacomy cerevisiae. Changes brought by adherence to plastic led to incidental increased vir.

Results demonstrate selection on yeast can generate correlated in traits, a feature of organism evolution. Favoring ability to adhere to plastic, common in industrial and medical settings, led a suite of aggregative phenotypes and vir.
Researchers have studied the impact of amino acid mutations on the stability of proteins containing prion-like domains (PLDs), which are known to form molecular condens and are prone to misregulation. They used a coarse-grained model, Mpipi, to simulate 140 mutants of six proteins (hnPA1, T43, F, US, WS1, RB14, and T1) and found scaling laws that quantify the change in critical temperature of PLDs as a function of the number and type of amino sequence mutations. These laws are consistent with physico properties of mutations and extend across the tested family, suggesting they can be used to predict changes in stability of PL condens. The study demonstrates that for hnPA, there are rules that explain changes in thermodynamic of condates in response to amino-acid mutations. The researchers investigated whether scaling laws can predict critical parameters of a broader PLDs in response to amino sequence mutations, finding that they are cumulative, meaning effects of successive mutations can be predicted by addition of laws as long as resulting mutation keeps PL composition and patterning. They employed a systematic approach varying amino sequence of PLDs to determine phase changes with amino compositional perturbations, analyzing three types of scaling for each mutation. Results show changes in critical temperatures of PL as function of number and type amino mutations can be quantified by scaling, conserved across investigated PLs.
Researchers in neuroscience aim to predict an individual's cognitive traits or clinical conditions by analyzing brain signals, typically using structural or time-averaged measures of brain activity. However, these approaches overlook the dynamic patterns of brain activity over time, which are complex and difficult to model. A new approach uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to describe functional and amplitude patterns, combined with a Fisher kernel, to predict traits. The Fisher kernel is mathematically constructed from the HMM, preserving its structure, making it suitable for generative and predictive models. This approach leverages time-vary and functional information for prediction, with applications in neuroscience and personalized medicine.

The study aimed to establish a method that captures brain activity patterns over time to predict traits, showing the H-Fisher approach accurately and reliably predicts traits from neuroimaging data. It preserves the underlying model structure, ideal for combining generative and predictive models. This is crucial for studies with small sample sizes and heterogeneous datasets. The approach was tested on an fMRI dataset and simulated data, focusing on within-session changes in functional amplitude and connectivity. The Hidden Markov Model (H) was used, a probabilistic model of time-vary and functional dynamics. Despite its importance, reliability is often ignored in predicting traits from neuroimaging features. The Fisher kernel preserves the H's structure, predicting traits accurately and reliably. It was compared to kernels ignoring brain dynamics and a previously used method based on Kull-Leibler divergence, and time-averaged connectivity methods.
Researchers have found that a protein called leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRK2) is involved in the development of Parkinson's disease (PD) and Crohn's disease by increasing the phosphorylation of its substrates. To understand how LR2 activity is regulated, they conducted a targeted RNA screen and identified Rab12 as a novel modulator of LR2-dependent phosphorylation of its substrate Rab10. Using imaging and immunopurification methods, they isolated lysosomes and found that Rab12 is recruited to damaged lysosomes, leading to an increase in LR2-dependent phosphorylation of Rab10. This suggests a conserved mechanism where Rab12, in response to damage or expression of PD-associated variants, facilitates the recruitment of LR2 and phosphorylation of its substrates at the lysosome.

LR2's recruitment to lysosomes may promote phosphorylation by increasing the local concentration of LR in proximity to its substrates. The researchers examined two PD-linked variants associated with increased LR2 activity, LR2 R1G and V35DN, and found increased levels of LR on lysosomes. They used endogenous conditions to demonstrate that Rab, but not Rab29, regulates LR-mediated phosphorylation of Rab and Rab regulates the localization and activation of LR on lysosomes upon lysosomal stress. The PD pathogenic LR variant R1, which lies outside LR's domain, and V35DN have been shown to increase LR activity in previous studies.

LR2 activity is observed in pathogenic PD variants and sporadic patients, but questions remain regarding its regulation and response to endosomal stress associated disease. The researchers identify Rab as a regulator of LR activation and demonstrate that Rab plays a critical role in mediating LR-dependent phosphorylation response to lysosomal damage. They show Rab promotes phosphorylation by recruiting LR to lysosomes following lysosomal rupture. Pathogenic variants including V35 and R1 result in levels of LR and pRab on lysosomes. The data delineate a conserved mechanism where LR activity is regulated and response to lysosomal and genetic variants with disease.
Researchers have developed a new method to study the cell cycle of non-adherent cells, which are cells that do not stick to surfaces, by combining a specialized sensor, automated image analysis, and machine learning. This approach allows for precise measurement of cell cycle durations in non-adherent cells. The method was tested on myeloid leukemia cell lines NB4 and Kasumi, which have unique cycle characteristics, and showed the impact of cycle-modulating drugs on NB cells. The system is also compatible with adherent cells and is fully automated, providing insights from hundreds of cells under various conditions. This presents a valuable tool for cancer research and drug development by enabling comprehensive cell analysis in both adherent and nonherent cells.

The method uses the Fluorescent Ubiquination Cell Indicator (FUCCI) technology to demarcate cell phases through color-coding. Time-lapse microscopy with fluorescent reporters has shown promise in detailing cell dynamics at single level. The work allows researchers to analyze thousands of non-adherent cells per condition using image data pipelines to perform processing, tracking, filtering, and cycle identification. Image and analysis rely on software Fiji and R, widely used by imaging community. Scripts are publicly available for customization. This streamlines cycle of cells expressing FUCCI indicator and makes it accessible to researchers with basic knowledge.

The method was validated in NB4 and Kasumi cells, which have different cycle progression. Original time-lapse images were composed of red and green channels detecting mCherry and mV markers of FUCCI indicator. The impact of CD inhibitors was qualitatively confirmed. Expected difference in cycle of NB vs Kasumi was evident. The system is compatible with adherent cells and fully automated, providing insights hundreds of cells under conditions.
Researchers studied the relationship between brain size and cognitive abilities in 16 primate species, focusing on the prefrontal brain regions involved in metacognition and working memory. They used brain imaging data to measure the size of the frontal pole (FP) and dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DFC) and examined their relation to socio-ecological variables such as body mass, daily distance traveled, and population density. The results showed that the size of these regions, as well as the whole brain, was best explained by body mass, daily distance, and population. This suggests that metacognition and working memory are critical for foraging skills in primates, with FP being more sensitive to social constraints than DFC. The study highlights the relative weight of social and ecological constraints on the evolution of prefrontal brain and associated cognitive operations in primates. 

The study aimed to evaluate the strength of relation between prefrontal regions and socio-ecological variables across species, observed in the wild, complementing laboratory studies and bridging neurosciences, ecology, and primate evolution. Metacognition and working are critical for foraging in primates, especially when traveling long distances and dealing with complex navigation. This is in line with the ecological hypothesis, but provides insight into specific neurocognitive associated foraging strategies. The size of DFC, used as proxy for working and planning, showed relation with daily distance and population, suggesting cognitive play in DFC.
Researchers investigated how muscle fibers grow in response to increased mechanical loading, such as during exercise, and found that the growth is largely due to an increase in the number of myofibrils, rather than their size. To study this, they developed a new method called fluorescence imaging of myofils with deconvolution (F-ID) that uses a standard microscope to visualize myofils with high resolution and contrast. They validated this method by comparing it to electron microscopy and found it was accurate. Using F-ID, they measured the size and number of myils in muscle fibers from mice and humans who had increased loading and found that growth was due to an increase in number of myils, not size. This study provides new insight into muscle growth and offers a time and cost-effective way to study it.
Researchers studied the role of SNAP25, a protein involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and its mutations that cause epileptic encephalopathy. Three mutations, V48, D166, and I67, in the synaptagmin-1 (Sy1) binding interface and I67, destabilize the SNARE complex. These mutations reduced Sy1-dependent vesicle docking to SN-carrying liposomes and Ca+-stimulated membrane fusion in vitro and in mouse hippocampal neurons. The V48 and D166 mutants, with D166 > V48, led to reduced readily releable pool (RP) size due to increased spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) release and decreased priming rates. These mutations lowered the energy for fusion and increased release probability, gain-of-function not found in Sy1 knockout (KO) neurons; mSC release rates were higher D166 >48 in Sy1 KO. These mutations D166 >48 increased association partner SNs, resulting unregulated fusion. In contrast, I67 decreased mSC frequency and evoked EP amplitudes due increased energy for fusion, RP size unaffected. This be partly compensated by lowering energy. Pathogenic SNAP mutations change the energy for priming and fusion.

The charge of evoked in V48 and reduction D166 suggest compensatory gain-function these mutations, impaired Sy1 interaction. Sy and Sy1:SN interactions in ves priming controversial discussed. RP assessed applying hypertonic solution, 0.5 sucrose (Rosen and Stevens, 1996; Sch et al,201). Miss mutation SN bundle I67 increased energy for fusion, disease display inefficient neuronal survival. SNAP encephal caused single-point mutations interdependent deficits, overcome treatment.

Researchers confirmed increase release and decrease V48 D166 previously (etal,202). in vitro find both lower Sy association SN-protein liposomes. These consequences understanding role primary SN:Syt in priming release clamping. demonstrate challenge mechanism treatments disorders multiple caused single mutations. Syt:SN might catalytic lowering energy transition path prim, affect rates (etal,201). transient binding Sy might SNAP assist SN complex, mutants prestructure bypass need
Researchers analyzed data from 30 countries and found a correlation between the proportion of women in a discipline and the quality and funding of research in that discipline. They discovered that a higher proportion of women in a field is associated with lower research quality evaluations and funding rates for both men and women. The study used datasets of thousands of researchers and looked at funding rates and quality scores separately. The findings are consistent with previous research that women's work is undervalued, regardless of who performs it.

The study found a strong correlation between researcher quality and gender balance of discipline. Both male and female researchers in female-dominated fields receive lower evaluations. This is robust across bibliometric differences. Funding rates also show a similar correlation, with male-dominated fields having higher success and quality than female-dominated. Accounting for researcher characteristics like age, institution, and publishing patterns, the results remain the same. Both men and women in male-dominated fields have higher success and quality than in female-dominated.

The findings do not suggest research in female-dominated fields is of lower quality. Instead, research from female fields is consistently evaluated as lower than male fields. This affects everyone, but more so women. Some found that as workforce becomes more female, salaries fall. To see if evaluation of research quality changes with feminization, longitudinal data is needed, which is not available. It's possible that research in female fields is evaluated lower due to feminization over time.
Researchers have developed a new strategy called "P editing" that enables the use of protein-protein interactions to activate the CRISPR-C9 system, a powerful tool for editing the genome. This system is a key component of synthetic biology, which aims to design molecular circuits that process information like electronic circuits within living cells. By linking protein-protein interactions to the formation of a functional CRPR-C9 guide, the researchers can modulate gene expression or record information to DNA. They engineered the crRNA:acrRNA interaction to demonstrate that various protein-protein interactions and chemical dimerization of domains can activate editing in human cells. Additionally, they explored how P can incorporate AD-based RNA sensors, allowing specific RNAs to induce genome edits in larger circuits. This strategy enhances the control of CRPR-based editing, making it suitable for synthetic circuits in living cells.

The researchers also tested whether P can be coupled with AD RNA sensors to control genome editing based on expression, expanding inputs that can drive specific editing in synthetic circuits. Molecular sensors can control cellular components of synthetic circuits, and outputting genome events may facilitate design such structures. They demonstrated P can control editing via specific protein interactions between tagged domains. To improve efficiency and specificity, they engineered the crRNA-MS/Box-pacrRNA design.

P is based on the CRPR-C9 system, replacing the cr:acr dimer with protein-binding RNA aptamers like MS and Box hairpins. This design mimics the native CR9 system, discovered as dual-RNA-guided. The researchers further developed a proximity sensor that drives genome editing.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), particularly omega-3 fatty acids, have been shown to have a protective effect on sudden cardiac death and are recommended to be consumed at least twice a week (Fernandez et al, 2021). PUFs have been found to increase the slow-rectifier current (IK) by shifting the voltage dependence of activation (Elinder and Li, 201). The IK current is mediated by the KCQ/KC1 channel complex, which is crucial for the repolarization of the ventricular action potential. Mutations in the KC/KC1 complex lead to long QT syndrome (LTS), a condition characterized by a prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram, increasing the risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.

The KCQ/K1 channel is a voltage-gated potassium channel that associates with the KC1 subunit, generating the IK current. This current is important for the repolarization of the ventricular action potential. Loss-of-function of the KC/KC complex is associated with TS, causing a reduction of the current and a prolongation of the ventricular waveform. In contrast to other Kv channels, such as Shaker K channels, which are inactivated in low K, the KC/K channel has a low open probability and single-channel conductance.

Polyunsaturated acids activate the KC channel by binding to two sites: one in the voltage sensor domain, shifting the voltage dependence to more negative, and the other in the pore, increasing the maximal conductance. However, the mechanism by which PUs increase the maximal conductance is poorly understood. Our results suggest that the selectivity filter in KC is unstable, contributing to the low probability, and the PU-induced increase in maximal conductance is caused by stabilization of the selectivity in the open-conductive state.

The KC channel has a tetrameric structure of four-subunits. Restoring the physiological duration of the interval could be achieved by increasing the activity of the KC/K complex.
Researchers have long known that a deficiency in vitamin B6, also known as pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PL), is linked to cognitive impairments in various brain disorders. However, the exact mechanisms behind this link and whether vitamin B supplementation improves cognition remain unclear. A key enzyme called pyridox 5-phosphatase (PDX) controls PL levels in the body, making it a potential target for therapeutic intervention. To test this concept, researchers sought pharmacological inhibitors of PDX. They discovered 7,8-dihydroflavone (7,8HF), a small molecule that directly inhibits PDX with low micromolar affinity and submicrom potency. In mouse hippocampal neurons, 7,8HF increased PL levels in a PDX-dependent manner, validating P as a druggable target. The study also found P expression is upregulated in hippocamp of middle-aged mice, suggesting vitamin B supplementation alone may not be enough to elevate intracellular levels where P is hyperactive. The discovery of 8HF as a P inhibitor indicates it may modulate vitamin-dependent processes and P could be explored as a pharmacological entry point for brain disorders.
In the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the development of the gonad requires the production of diverse cell types and their migration. However, the coordination of these processes during development remains poorly understood. The gonad in C. elegans exhibits a mirror-symmetric structure guided by the migration of distal tip (DTC) cells, which result from asymmetric divisions of somatic gonadal precursors (SGP) Z1 and Z4. Researchers found that the polarity of Z1 and Z4, which have mirror-symmetric orientation, is controlled by redundant functions of the LIN-17/Fizzled receptor and Wnt proteins (CWN-1, C-2, and EGL-20) with distinct functions. In LIN-17 mutants, C-2 promotes normal polarity in Z and Z, while C-1 promotes normal polarity in Z and Z, respectively. In contrast, EGL-20 inhibits polarization of Z and Z. In LIN- E-20-C-2 mutants, polarity of Z is reversed, resulting in frequent mis-migration of DTCs from Z to the posterior. Further analysis demonstrates that mis-position of Ds in the gon due to polarity of Z leads to mis-migration. Similar mis-migration was also observed in C-1 RNAi animals producing ectopic Ds. These results highlight the role of Wnt in coordinating production and migration of Ds to establish mirror-symmetric organ.
Researchers have been exploring the concept of multidrug therapies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance, where resistance to one drug results in sensitivity to another. However, questions remain about the reliability of tradeoffs, specifically whether mutants that provide resistance to a given drug suffer similar tradeoffs. To address this, experiments were conducted to capture a fuller spectrum of mutations that give yeast cells an advantage against fluconazole, a common antifungal drug. Fitness was quantified for 774 mutants across 12 environments, grouping them into classes with characteristic tradeoffs. Unique tradeoffs imply each group affects fitness through different mechanisms. Some groupings were surprising, such as mutants that resist single drugs but not combinations, and mutants of the same gene have different tradeoffs. These findings demonstrate difficulty in relying on consistent tradeoffs for multidrug treatments, but also empower multidrug strategies that leverage tradeoffs to combat resistance. By grouping mutants with similar tradeoffs, the number of drug-resistant mutants can be reduced from 774 to a manageable six for investigating molecular mechanisms.

A high-throughput evolutionary approach was used to enumerate classes of drug-resistant mutants and their tradeoffs. A collection of 774 yeast lineages showed at least 6 groups with fitness tradeoffs across 12 environments. The goal was to count types of adaptive mutations, each defined by unique trade, in a drug-resistant population. This exercise is difficult due to mutations providing strongest advantage dominating evolution. To enhance diversity, multiple evolutions were performed in range of FL concentrations and combinations. Lineages with no fitness in no drug conditions are underrepresented in experiments lacking FL. Mutations providing resistance are not beneficial in environments without drugs, shown for 100 lineages.
Researchers have long observed a phenomenon known as the "central bias" or "contraction" in working memory, where the magnitude of items held in memory appears to be biased towards the average of past observations. This is thought to be an optimal strategy of the brain's ability to learn the structure of sensory input. On the other hand, recency biases such as serial dependence are also observed and thought to reflect content of working memory. Recent results from an auditory comparison task in rats suggest both biases may be more related than previously thought. When the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) was silenced, both short and long-term biases were reduced. A model was proposed that may be involved in generating behavior, showing that working memory susceptible to shifting to past experience producing short sensory biases naturally leads to contraction. Errors occurring at individual trials are from the full distribution of stimuli and not due to gradual shift memory towards sensory mean. Results are consistent with behavioral findings and predictions across different distributions and timings, intervals, as well as dynamics in working areas. A set of psychophysics experiments validated the model in auditory parametric working memory task.
Researchers investigated the role of the PD-LIM-containing protein 2 (PIM2) in lung cancer and its potential as a target for therapy. PIM is a tumor suppressor protein that is often repressed in lung cancer, contributing to chemotherapy and immunotherapy resistance. The study used human samples and a mouse model to examine PIM genetic and epigenetic changes in lung cancer. They found that PIM repression in lung cancer is due to both genetic and epigenetic alterations. A nanoparticle-encapsulated PIM expression plasmids (nanoPIM) were tested for efficacy, mechanism, and safety in combination with PD-1 antibody and chemotherapeutic drugs. Results showed that nanoPIM had low toxicity, high tumor specificity, and antitumor activity, and improved efficacy of PD-1 and chemotherapeutic drugs, with complete remission in most mice and substantial reduction in remaining tumors by triple combination. Mechanistically, nanoIM increased major histocompatibility complex I (MHC) expression, multi-drug resistance 1 (MDR) induction, and survival and tumor-related gene expression in cells, and lymphocyte infiltration, turning tumors hot and sensitive to IC and chemotherapeutic and activated-infiltrating lymphocytes (IL) unleashed by IC. These studies established a clinically applicable PIM-based therapy for lung and possibly other cancers.
Researchers have identified a system in animals use to evaluate food quality and adjust their feeding behavior in challenging environments. This system, however, is not fully understood. They developed a low-quality food assay and found that heat-killed E. coli (HK-E. coli) and low-sugar food triggers an unfolded protein response (UPR) and immune response, encouraging animals to avoid low-quality food. This system depends on the UPR (IRE-1/XBP-1) innate (PM-38MAPK) axis, particularly in neurons, regulating feeding behaviors. Animals can adapt to low-quality food through sugar supplementation, inhibiting UPR-PM regulated response by increasing vitamin C synthesis. This study reveals the role of cellular stress pathway in food evaluation for nutritional deficiencies, enhancing survival in environments.

Using a low-quality assay, they elucidated the mechanism of cellular response as a physiological system. This assesses glucose deficiency in food and vitamin content through UPR innate (PM-38MAP) axis. Identified a physiological mechanism recognizing food quality through UPR (IRE-1/XBP) innate (PM-38) regulated response in neurons dictating avoidance behaviors. This system is an adaptation detecting deficiencies not by the quick nervous system. A limitation is the lack of explanation for HK-E coli activating UPR and immunity. Hypothesized that heat-killed HK may lack or contain metabolites activating or inhibiting UPR, triggering avoidance. The innate pathway, mediated by PM-38, plays a role in evaluating unfavorable sources, such as HK coli, staphylococcus, and pseudomonas, helping animals avoid. Investigated nutrients sensed by X-PM axis for quality evaluation. Animals may assess quality through UPR and innate pathways. Examined activation of UPR by HK dependent on UPR components, including IREBP, PER, and ATF.
Carbohydrates play a crucial role in various biological processes, but their interaction with specific drug targets, such as G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), is not well understood. Researchers studied the P2 purinoceptor 14 (P2Y14), a target for inflammation and immune responses, to uncover how carbohydrates activate GPCRs. Using molecular simulation and functional studies, they identified the uridine diphosphate (UDP)-sugar binding site on P2 and found that UDP-glucose activates the receptor by bridging transmembrane helices 2 and 7. A conserved bridging chain (K2.60-D.64-K.7.35-E.36KD) was identified to distinguish UDP-sugars, including UDP-glucose, UDPgalactose, UDPgluronic acid, and UDP-acetylglucamine. This chain is a conserved motif for sugar binding both P2 and P purinoceptor 12 (P2). Three sugar nucleotides were designed as agonists for P2, expanding understanding of purergic receptor activation and providing insights for carbohydrate drug development for GPC.

The ligand models of UDP-sugars were quantitatively characterized to identify the sugar site of P. Both P and P were employed to unveil a conserved sugar motif. Multiple carbohydrates were designed and validated as agonists targeting the conserved motif. P purinoceptor 14 (P) is a model for carbohydrate modulation of GPC, belonging to the purino subfamily responding to nucleotides, including adenosiphosphate (ADP) and UDP. Unlike other purceptors, P is potently activated by UDP and a class of carbohydrates, UDPug. The arrangements of UDPugar sites between P and sugarases might determine selectivity. A conserved carbohydrate motif was found in P and P, extending understanding how carbohydrates regulate GPC. Studies with other UDPug found interactions with TM7 determinant UDPug potencies.
Researchers investigated the role of glial cells in regulating the behavior of neural stem cells called neuroblasts (NB) in Drosophila. They found that glial cells produce ferritin, a protein that helps transport iron into NB for energy production, which is essential for self-renewal and proliferation. Knocking down glial ferritin genes caused energy shortage in NB, leading to low proliferation and premature differentiation. Ferritin is also a potential target for tumor suppression. The level of glial ferr production is affected by the status of NB, establishing a bicellular iron homeostasis. The study shows that glial cells are crucial for maintaining self-renew of NB, revealing a new role of the glial niche in brain development.

The researchers knocked down genes involved in iron transport, storage, and regulation in NB, neurons, and glial cells. Only glial knockdown of ferritin genes led to NB loss and defective brain development. Ferritin in glial cells is crucial for regulating NB behavior and larval development. In a proliferative state, NB receive iron from glial via ferr to fulfill energy requirements for proliferation and self-renew. Iron required by NB is stored in ferritin glial cells and allocated as needed. Bicellular homeostasis makes glial the pool for ferr production, relieving NB from producing ferr and transferring risk of iron-induced oxidative stress to glial cells.

Glial cells clear oxidative stress through lipid droplets, ensuring NB normal function during development. The study explores whether bicellular homeostasis exists in other stem cells and niches. Normal NB converted to immortal NB, highly proliferative, need nutrients including iron. Iron is vital for all living organisms, participating in electron transport and cellular respiration supporting ATP production. The size of tumors decreased in larval brains lacking glial ferritin, suggesting glial ferr required for tumor development, a potential target for treatment.
Researchers investigated the relationship between cancer and COVID-19 mortality in the US population during the pandemic. They analyzed death certificate data for six types of cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease, and found that cancer mortality rose by only 3% over the pre-pandemic baseline, resulting in approximately 13,600 excess deaths. Mortality was higher for less deadly cancers (breast, colorectal, and hematological) and lower for cancers with poor survival (lung, pancreatic). In contrast, there was a significant increase in deaths from diabetes (37%) and Alzheimer's (19). To understand these differences, the researchers simulated expected mortality for each condition using COVID-19 rates, life expectancy, population size, and age of individuals with each condition. They found that mortality differences were primarily due to life expectancy, with risk of death from cancer outcompeting risk of death from COVID-19.

The study considered death certificates listing cancer as the underlying cause of death or anywhere on the death certificate to explore potential changes in coding practices during the pandemic. It suggests that lack of excess cancer mortality during COVID-19 reflects competing risk from cancer, especially deadly types, rather than protection from immunosup. The study found modest elevation in cancer mortality during the pandemic in the US, highlighting the importance of considering multiple-cause records to reflect changes in practices with a new pathogen emergence. Diabetes and Alzheimer were used as controls to illustrate associations between chronic conditions and COVID-19 in population-level mortality, with diabetes being a useful comparator due to similar age-at-death and few in nursing home residents.

The researchers identified two factors driving cancer patterns during COVID-19: population size with cancer and life expectancy under diagnosis. These factors operate independently of the relationship between COVID-19 and cancer severity. The same applies to other chronic conditions, such as diabetes or Alzheimer.
Researchers have identified a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loops from eukaryotic genomes. R-loops are formed when a strand of RNA is joined to a strand of DNA during transcription, and can be toxic to cells if not removed. The Smc/6 complex binds to R-lo structures and promotes their degradation by the enzyme RNase H2. This process is important for removing R-lo at highly transcribed genes and telomeres. Yeast mutants lacking the Sm/6 complex and RNase H accumulate high levels of R-lo in their chromosomes, leading to growth defects. The Sm/6 complex also binds to R-lo formed during gene transcription and telomere regulation, and stimulates RNase2 degradation of the RNA component. The Sm/6 complex is involved in the repair of unscheduled R-lo generated by various genomic transactions. It binds to R structures formed during active transcription and promotes RNase2-mediated degradation of the RNA component. The Sm/6 complex acts in two ways: within and between pathways in response to R-loop formation. It contributes to RNase-dependent removal of RNA-DNA from DNA, but its role is not as extensive as RNase enzymes.
Researchers investigated whether older adults' preserved attentional abilities can compensate for age-related hearing loss in sensory acuity, and if this compensation is stable over time. They analyzed electroencephal and behavioral data from 105 individuals aged 39-82 years. Despite a decline in hearing threshold sensory acuity, listening performance remained stable over 2 years. Neural filtering and behavior were correlated within each time point, but not longitudinally. The study found no evidence that neural filtering at time 1 or its 2-year change predicted 2-year behavioral change, even with combined modeling strategies. 

The study aimed to replicate previous findings and test the brain-behavior relationship across time, expecting neural filtering to impact performance independently of age or hearing status. However, in the longitudinal sample, no predictive role of filtering was found despite brain-beh links at each time point. 

Hearing acuity, filtering, and listening change were analyzed across the middle to older lifespan. Linear mixed models tested cross-sectional age effects and longitudinal changes. Measures' test-retest reliability was quantified as T1-T Pearson's correlation. Since neural filtering was independent of age and hearing, no longitudinal change was expected. The stability of the age and hearing-independent effect of filtering on accuracy and response was tested. 

Behavioral outcome, speed and accuracy, involves perceptual and cognitive processes. A neurobiological implementation of attentional filter explained interindividual differences and lifespan.
Researchers investigated the role of chemosensation, the combination of taste and smell, in the use of medicinal plants in ancient Greece and Rome. They found that the intensity and complexity of chemosensory qualities, as well as specific tastes and flavors, predicted the therapeutic uses of drugs. Botanicals with high therapeutic versatility had simple tastes and intense flavors, and 21-22 chemosens qualities predicted at least one therapeutic use. In addition to bitter, musky, sweet, and soapy flavors were associated with versatility. The study suggests that ancient uses of drugs were based on observed physiological effects consistent with modern understanding of chemesthesis and taste pharmacology. 

The researchers hypothesized that chemensation and physiological effects mediated by chemhesis and taste pharmacology explain the diversity of therapeutic uses of botanicals in ancient times. They tested whether tastes and flavors, determined by a modern panel, predict uses recorded in ancient texts. This would be an insight into how chemensation combined with physiological guided human behavior in prehistoric times and conditioned expectations. The theory of humors, underlying Western medicine from ancient to Industrial Age, was discredited, but the study proposes a link to modern medicine through taste and flavor of botanicals. 

The study used phylogenetic methods to assess human behavior and plant properties, showing chemens perception connects ancient knowledge with modern science, despite different etiologies. They tested whether perceived qualities, intensity, and complexity predict therapeutic uses, accounting for confounding effects of shared chemens stimuli from related species.
Researchers have identified that certain bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family, including non-typhoidal Salmonella enterica, Escheria coli, and Citrobacter koser, are attracted to human serum, which can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and bacteremia and sepsis, a leading to death in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases. They used a microfluidics device to simulate GI bleeding and found that femtol volumes of human serum are sufficient to induce bacterial attraction. This attraction is through chemotaxis, a response to the chemoattract L-serine, an amino acid abundant in serum recognized by the chemoreceptor Tsr. The researchers found the crystal structure of Salmonella Typhimium T in complex with L-ser and identified a conserved amino acid motif for L-ser among Tsr orthologues. Tsr is conserved among Enterobacteraceae and WHO priority pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. They also found that Enteracteraceae use serum as a nutrient source for growth and chemaxis and chemore T provide a competitive advantage for migration into hemorrhagic lesions. This behavior is defined as "bacterial vampirism" and may relate to the proclivity of Enteracteraceae for bloodstream infections.
Researchers have identified a common genetic program that defines the identity of male cells across different animal species, which has been conserved over 600 million years of evolution. This program is made up of approximately 10,000 protein-coding genes, with a third being deeply conserved and retained throughout evolution. A set of 79 functional associations between 104 gene regulators represents a core component of the conserved program of metazoan spermatogenesis. Interfering with the acquisition and maintenance of male cell identity uncovered 161 previously unknown sperogenesis genes and three potential causes of human infertility. The findings highlight the importance of evolutionary history on reproductive disease and establish a cross-species pipeline for other cell and pathologies.

The study analyzed the sperocyte transcriptome of vertebrate and inverte species to describe the conserved origin of metazo male cells at the molecular level. They found that despite the testis being a rapidly evolving organ with new genes, conserved genes remain central in the germ cell of evolutionarily distant species. The team explored this increased connectivity to gain insight into the cons molecular basis of metazo spermatogenesis. They observed that both vertebrates and inverte, the germ cell has an evolutionary origin tempered by increased expression of younger genes at developmental stages. The data indicates a sperogenic spanning more 600 years evolution, expanding previous observations in mammalian lineage.

The researchers estimated the functional requirement of metazo male cell to the expression of approximately 10,000 proteinoding genes, the majority being conserved. They propose that the identity of metazo male cells is built around a small network of conserved interactions with functional impact. By functionally interfering cons genes associated with cell, they uncovered unknown sperogenesis and potential causes of human infertility. The study provides insight into the basis of human infertility and establishes a pipeline for other cell and pathologies.
Researchers studied how the single-celled organism Chlamydomonas reinhardtii uses its flagella to swim and steer. This organism employs a unique flagellar beating pattern, where both flagella beat synchronously and modulate their amplitudes to change direction. The study aimed to understand how each flagellum contributes to this coordination. Experiments used a non-invasive technique to selectively load one flagellum and found that the other flagellum's beating responds to the load on the first flagellum, indicating a unilateral coupling between flagella. The results show distinct roles for each flagell in coordination and implications for biflagellate behaviors. 

Calcium has been speculated to facilitate dynamic modulation of flagellar dominance during synchronous beating, which is the basis of C. reinii's motility. Experiments showed that flagella have differential roles in coordination and are coupled to external flow through the cis flagellum. A reduced model was developed to elucidate the mechanisms of asymmetry, representing selective loading and flagellar dominance in coordinated by ϵ≠ϵ and λ≠λ. The model showed that connected flagella adopt the kinematics of the cis-flagellum when beating synchronously, leading to the hypothesis that flagella have differential roles in coordination. Experiments tested this by applying oscillatory flows biased on one flagum and found that selective loading affects flagellar beating. The model expressed ε as a function of fc, t, ϵ, t, λ and λ, and Monte-Carlo simulations clarified the interplay between flows and flagella, reproducing experimental observations.
Researchers investigated the mechanism behind the benefits of intermittent fasting on metabolism and found that it promotes the production of interleukin-22 (IL-22) by a type of immune cell called innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) in the gut. These IL-22 cells then contribute to the formation of "beige" cells in subcutaneous white adipose tissue, which is a type of fat cell that burns energy instead of storing it. Adopting IL-22-producing IL cells from the gut into mice with diet-induced obesity increased the formation of beige cells in their fat tissue. Exogenous IL-22, or IL-22 from outside the body, also increased the formation of beige cells in fat tissue. However, mice lacking the receptor for IL-22, which receives the signal from IL-22, had reduced the formation of beige cells in fat when fasting. Single-cell sequencing of immune cells in the gut showed that fasting increased the activity of a receptor called aryl hydrocarbon in ILCs. Analysis of cell interactions showed that fasting may stimulate ILCs to interact with other immune cells called dendritic and macrophages. These findings suggest that ILCs play a role in fat metabolism and the IL-22/IL-22 axis contributes to the benefits of fasting.
Researchers investigated how animals respond to threats by studying mice in a Pavlovian conditioning paradigm that paired a tone and white noise stimulus with a foot shock. They found that when the stimuli were paired, mice froze during the tone and jumped and darted during the noise. In contrast, when the stimuli were not paired, mice froze less during the tone and rarely jumped or darted during the noise. During extinction, the paired mice's tone-induced freezing decreased and they shifted from jumping to a mix of freezing and darting. The unpaired, unpaired, and shock-only groups displayed tail rattling and darting during the stimuli with minimal freezing and jumping. The paired group did not jump to the noise and tone-evoked freezing was resistant to extinction. The study shows that non-associative factors promote responsiveness but associative factors are needed for cue-induced freezing and high-intensity flight. 

The researchers used a modified Pavlov conditioning paradigm to elicit a range of defensive responses, including freezing and flight. They found distinct ethograms for the paired and unpaired groups in response to the stimuli. Freezing and activity were higher in the paired group compared to the ungroup, highlighting the impact of stimulus-shock on defensive responses. Sensitization and salience intensified freezing to auditory stimuli and increased reactivity to a stimulus after stress. The study highlights the need to understand associative and nonassociative elements of Pavlov fear conditioning that influence defensive behavior.
Researchers have studied how insects navigate their environment and found that they encode direction as a sinusoidal pattern around a ring of neurons in an eight-column structure. However, it's unclear if this sinusoidal encoding is an evolutionary coincidence or offers a functional advantage. To address this, they established the mathematical requirements for direction encoding and showed it can be performed by various circuits with different patterns. Among these patterns, they found that sinusoidal is the most resilient when coupled with sinusoidal connectivity between neurons. They compared the predicted pattern with anatomical data from locust and fruit fly, finding agreement with evidence. Furthermore, they demonstrated the circuit can emerge using Hebbian plasticity, implying connectivity doesn't need to be encoded genetically but can develop during development. They also showed that the eight-column organisation of direction circuits across insects is not a chance but explained by evolutionary principles.

 Studies have shown that integrating neurons in insects have sinusoidal patterns (Wittmann and Schler, 1995; Vstaff and Paolo,2005; Stone et al,2017). Future work could compare direction encoding in insects with mammals, which encode differently using more neurons. Electrophys and imaging have shown population encoding direction in insects has sinus-shaped pattern (Lab,198;Lab,200;Lo and Hom,200;Pfe et,200;Pfe and Hom,200;Kin,200;Hein,200;Hom,201;El,201;El,201). Heading circuits have been studied with models ranging from conceptual (Witt and Schler,199;C et,201) to sophisticated featuring multiple types (K and Bort,201; et,201; et,201;Pis,202; et,202).

Previous work argued sinus encoding facilitates vector addition (Witt and Schler,199). However, this can't be the only reason as they found a family of circuits enabling vector addition. They compared predicted circuit with locust and fly data, showing agreement. They asked how an insect develops such circuit, finding Hebb rule sufficient.
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Familial cases of PD are often caused by mutations in PTEN kinase 1 (PINK) and the ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which are crucial for maintaining mitochondrial quality control. CIS1, a homodimer mitochondrial iron-sulf-binding protein, is a target of Parkin-mediated ubiquitination. Researchers discovered a heightened propensity of CIS1 to form dimers in PINK mutant flies and dopaminergic neurons from PD patients with PINK mutations. The dimer consists of two monomers covalently linked by a disulfide. In this conformation CIS1 cannot coordinate the ironulf cofactor. Overexpressing CISD, the Drosophila ortholog of CIS1, and a mutant CIS incapable of binding the ironulf cluster in Drosila reduced climbing ability and lifespan. This was more pronounced with CIS and PINK mutant flies. Complete loss of CIS, in contrast, rescued detrimental effects of PINK mutation on climbing ability, posture, dopamine levels, lifespan, and mitochondrial structure.

The study suggests CIS, ironpleted CIS, operates downstream of PINK, shedding light on PD pathophysiology and implicating CIS1 as a therapeutic target. CIS1, a mitochondrial ironulf protein, is downstream of the pathophys cascade initiated by PINK and P loss function in flies and probably in humans. This sheds light on PD pathophysiology and implicates CIS1 as a therapeutic protein. The study identified CIS, its ironpleted form, as a mediator of path effects from PINK and P loss function. Immunoblot revealed increased dimer and presence CIS under conditions. Increased dimer likely represents apo-CIS1, CIS devoid of ironulf cluster, caused by changes in homeostasis.

CISD overexpression was neurotoxic, disrupted morphology, and accumulated phospho-ubitin, which blocks mitagy, resulting in defective mitochondria. The study suggests CIS role in red imbalance and dysreg, implicating ironpleted CIS.
A study investigated the role of the virulence protein SAP54 produced by the parasitic phytoplas in attracting leafhopper vectors. SAP is responsible for inducing leaf-like flowers in phytopma-infected plants, but previous research showed that insects were attracted to leaves and flowers were not required. However, this study found that exposure to leafhopper males is necessary for the attraction, suggesting a response that distinguishes leafopper sex in the presence of SAP. In contrast, phytopma effector alongside leafopper discourages female colonization. SAP suppresses biotic stress pathways in leaves exposed to males. The host MADS transcription factor vegetative phase (SVP) emerges as key in leafopper preference for exposed plants to SAP, with SAP promoting degradation of S. Preference extends to colonization of male-exposed sv null plants over not exposed. The research highlights the dual role of phytopma effector SAP in host alteration and attraction integral to phytoplasm life. SAP acts as a molecular'matchmaker', helping leafoppers locate mates by degrading S-containing leaves. This study provides insights into parasite genes extended phenotypes and how transcription factors regulate plant processes intersect with plant-insect interactions.
Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen that poses a significant threat to human health and has a substantial socio-economic burden. Current antifungal treatments fail, in part, because C. alb can initiate a drug tolerance response that allows some cells to grow at drug concentrations above the minimal inhibitory concentration. Researchers used a nanol droplet-based transcriptomics platform to profile thousands of individual fungal cells and establish subpopulation characteristics in the absence and presence of antif drugs. Profiles of untreated cells exhibit heterogeneous expression that correlates with cell stage and metabolic stress responses. At 2 days post-fluconazole exposure, a time tolerance is measurable, cells bifurcate into two subpopulations: Ribo-domin (Rd) and Stressomin (S) states. The bifcation persists at 3 and 6 days-treatment. The ribosome stress response (RR) is activated in these subpopulations and may facilitate survival.

Researchers used the DROPq system to explore phenotypic heterogeneity in C. alb response to antif drugs. They profiled transcriptomes of thousands of cells from C. alb populations that were untreated or exposed to antif compounds with a focus on fluconazole (FC) across several days. Studies have shown that cell cycle correlates with expression of stress and metabolism-related genes. The researchers investigated C alb response to antif compounds using fungatic FC and fungidal CSP. The mechanisms of antif tolerance differ from bacterial resistance, where a subpopulation grows in bacteridal drugs. This study focuses on antif tolerance to FC, a well fungatic drug. Previous studies characterized aspects of tolerance in C alb.
Researchers have proposed a new method to measure the effectiveness of natural selection in species, called the Codon Adaptation Index of Species (CAIS), which corrects for confounding factors in previous metrics that compare codon bias across species. The CAIS is based on the Kull-Leibler divergence, an information-theory measure that accounts for GC content and amino acid composition. This new metric can be calculated from a complete genome without requiring polymorphism or mutation rate data, reference genes, or demographic history. The researchers used CA and another metric, the Effective Number of Codons (ENC), to show that highly adapted vertebrate species have higher intrinsic disorder in their protein domains. They suggest that highly adapted species have a higher proportion of genes and sites subject to effective codon bias. Codon metrics directly quantify species' adaptation, unlike estimates of effective size based on polymorphism. CA and ENC can be estimated for more species as they don't require polymorphism or mutation data, tRNA copy numbers, and abundances, but a single genome. CA has the advantage of not being confounded with amino frequencies. The researchers tested CA in vertebrates due to abundant data and past findings of limited codon adaptation. They found that the degree of synonymous cod usage driven by preference offers a direct way to assess selection's effectiveness at the molecular level in a species. This can be estimated from a single genome without polym or mutation data.
Severe sepsis causes millions of deaths worldwide and is a global health priority declared by the World Health Organization. Sepsis-related deaths are due to dysregulated immune responses, indicating the need for strategies to target inflammation. A key mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP), released by inflamed host cells and bacteria in a strain-dependent manner. This study investigated mechanisms of bacterial ATP release using Escherichia coli (E. coli) mutants. Results show ATP release is dependent on bacterial ATPase within the inner membrane and impaired outer membrane integrity contributes to release, associated with bacterial death. In a mouse model of abdominal seps, effects of bacterial ATP were analyzed using transformed E. coli with an arabin-inducible periplasmase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abating bacterial release shows ATP suppresses local responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and survival. Additionally, ATP has systemic effects via transport in outer membrane vesicles (OMV). ATP-loaded OM are distributed throughout the body, upregulating genes degranulation in neutils, potentially exacerbating seps severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial release and roles in sepsis pathogenesis.

E. coli, a frequent pathogen in abdominal seps, released highest ATP in a mouse model. Demonstrating seps-associated release, the study questioned how release is dependent on ATP generation. Release is dependent on bacterial, with no differences in counts observed. ATP by bacteria suppresses abdominal responses and worsens survival in seps model. ATP is metabolized in extracellular space, limiting action to immediate vicinity. However, role in non-colonized compartments, such as abdominal or blood, remains unknown. This study investigated if released ATP influences seps outcome. Isolated seis bacteria and measured ATP release. E. coli released more than E. faalis and S. aureus. Species differed in sequences, confirming release is strain-specific. Seps-associated release ATP in growth and strain-dependent manner.

Bacteria release ATP into extracellular space, a conserved mechanism from host defense. Release shown for various bacteria, including seis E. coli, K. pneumonia, E. faalis, and S. aureus.
Researchers investigated the relationship between psychotic-like experiences (PLE) in children and the risk of developing psychosis and other mental disorders, as well as the role of genetic and environmental factors in mediating this relationship. They used a large-scale longitudinal study of 6,602 children from the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development Study to examine the effects of genetic and environmental factors, such as family and neighborhood environment, on intelligence and PLE. The study found that lower intelligence and higher PLE were associated with lower genetic scores for cognitive phenotypes, lower family and neighborhood socioeconomic status, and less supportive environments. Intelligence mediated the effects of these factors on PLE, with positive parenting and school environments showing the strongest impact in reducing PLE. The study highlights the influence of genetic and environmental factors on PLE through their effects on intelligence, suggesting that improving school and family environments and promoting economic development may enhance cognitive and mental health in children.

The study assessed the associations of cognitive phenotype genetic scores, family, and neighborhood, and environment with children's intelligence and longitudinally measured PLE, using statistical and computational approaches to consider potential confounding. It tested the mediating effect of intelligence on the relationship between genetic and environmental and PLE factors. The study employed linear models and structural equation modeling to examine the trajectories of genetic and environmental influences on PLE mediated by intelligence, investigating the mediating role of intelligence within impacts of cognitive phenotypes, family, SES, neighborhood, and environments on PLE.

Results showed that higher genetic scores of cognitive phenotypes correlated with higher intelligence, and lower scores with lower intelligence. The study also tested effects of gene-environment interactions on intelligence and P, adjusting for schizophrenia genetic scores given the association with cognitive deficit in psychosis and at-risk individuals. It demonstrated the integrated effects of genetic and environmental on PLE through intelligence in 9-11-year-old children.
Researchers used human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiP) derived cerebral organoids to investigate the effects of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) signaling on neural development. They found that F8 treatment increased cellular heterogeneity, leading to the formation of distinct telencephalic and mesencephalic domains in multi-regional organoids. Within telencealic regions, F8 affected anterior-posterior and dorsoventral identity of neural progenitors and the balance between GABAergic and glutamatergic neurons, impacting spontaneous network activity. F8 also modulated key regulators of several neurodevelopmental disorders. Transcript analysis revealed F8 induction of ventral telph genes and upregulation of ventral genes such as ASCL, DLX, and PBX, and downregulation of dorsal genes like EMX, NEUROG, SOX, and LHX. F8 treatment resulted in altered identities in 3D organoids compared to controls, with development of multiional organoids with coing brain domains. F8 modulated NR2 and genes associated with brain disorders in FOX1 telph cells, underscoring its role in fine-tuning neurodevelopment and pathogenic pathways. The study highlights F8 effect on regional identity and modulation of N-related targets, including conserved F8-NRF molecular axis. F8 guides developmental trajectories of brain along D and A telph axes.
Researchers studied the development of sleep and feeding patterns in fruit flies (Drosophila) and found that young larvae do not have a daily rhythm, but as they mature, feeding becomes consolidated to the day and sleep to the night. They discovered that a specific neurons, called Dh44, play a crucial role in regulating sleep and feeding behaviors and are sensitive to nutritional changes in the environment. In the second instar larval stage (L2), sleep and feeding are spread across the day, but by the third instar stage (L3), behaviors become organized into daily patterns. Forcing L3 animals to adopt L2 strategies disrupts sleep rhythms and ability to exhibit long-term memory. The development of the Dh44 circuit is also influenced by the larval environment. Dh neurons act through glucose genes to drive daily sleep rhythms. The study suggests that changes in energy demands in developing organisms trigger the formation of sleep-circuits and behaviors.
Researchers studied the energy expenditure of fish when swimming alone and in schools to understand how group movement can be more energy-efficient than individual movement. They measured the aerobic and anaerobic energy of giant danio fish swimming at various speeds and found that schools have a curved metabolism-speed curve with a minimum cost at 1 body length per second. Schools reduced total energy expenditure by up to 56% compared to solitary fish. When swimming at maximum speed, fish in schools had 44% higher aerobic performance and 65% less anaerobic energy than individuals, lowering total energy and transport cost by 53%. Schools also recovered from exercise 43% faster than solitary fish. Anaerobic savings at high speeds improve peak and repeated performance, likely beneficial for evading predators. These savings may explain the prevalence of group movement in fish.

The study used fish swimming in water as a model to understand how group movement can be more energy-efficient than individual movement. By increasing aerobic performance, schools save anaerobic energy and reduce recovery time after swimming. It's expected that conserving energy in air or water resistance should be greater at higher speeds. The hypothesis is that schools can reduce high-speed locomotion cost relative to solitary, reducing anaobic costs and recovery time for swimming at speeds over 50% of capacity. The objective was to determine differences between swimming curves of solitary and school fish. Aerobic and anaobic energy were measured over a range of speeds and compared to solitary performance.

Both solitary and school fish have a curved aerobic rate-speed curve over lower speeds. Aerobic cost at lower speeds showed no difference between fish and schools. Schools at 1 body length consume less energy than slower speeds.
Researchers studied the immune cells called macrophages in the lungs, which play a crucial role in fighting off infections. They found that these cells can change their behavior in response to different signals from the body's immune system. Macrophages in the lungs, called tissue-resident macrophages, were compared to those from the blood, called monocyte-derived macrophages. Both types were exposed to signals from the immune system, called IF-γ and IL-4, to see how they would respond. The results showed that both types of macrophages increased their energy production of energy from sugar, a process called glycolysis, when exposed to IF-γ. However, the lung macroages did not decrease their energy production of energy from oxygen, unlike the blood macrophages, which shifted to a different metabolic process called 'Warburg' metabolism. The lung macrophages produced more cytokines, proteins that help fight infection, when exposed to IFγ, and this was linked to their glycol process. Blocking glycol reduced cytokine production in lung macroages, indicating that glycol is key to their response to IFγ. The study found that lung macroages were more responsive to IFγ and dependent on gly for cytokine production than blood macroages. Lung macro also controlled production of certain proteins on their surface, HLA-DR and CD40, differently than blood macro. These findings suggest that lung macro are functionally plastic and respond to IFγ differently than blood macro. The study provides evidence that lung macro are a potential target for treatments for respiratory diseases.
For the first time, researchers have shown that nocturnal ants use the polarized light pattern produced by the moon for navigation. Unlike the sun, which can be obstructed by clouds or the horizon, the moon can still provide directional information through its polarized light. The sun produces polarized light across the sky as it enters the atmosphere, and polarized light is a known cue for navigating animals. The moon produces a similar pattern, but much dimmer than sunlight. The study shows that polarized moonlight is part of the compass for nocturnal ants. Nocturnal ants leave their nest at twilight and rely on the solar polar pattern to navigate, but return home at night when the sun can't guide them. The ants use polarized moonlight to navigate during the night by rotating the overhead pattern and altering their headings. They can detect this cue throughout the lunar cycle, even under crescent moons when polarized light is lowest. The study also shows the long-term incorporation of moonlight into the ants' path system for homing as sunlight is incorporated during the day.

Researchers have theorized that detecting the dim polar pattern by the moon may be present in nocturnal insects, including bees and crickets, but there is no evidence of its use in goal navigation. The study sought evidence in nocturnal ants, making them an interesting species to characterize lunar and polarized light detection. Comparing solar and moonlight navigation in ants, similarities occur in homing to the nest. Nocturnal ants, such as Myrmia, have species that restrict navigation to evening and morning, and use the polarized light to derive information. Two well-stud nocturnal species, Myrmia pyiform and Myrmia mid, use the polarized pattern visible during twilight to compass. This occurs across the lunar, suggesting polarized moon is detectable throughout the month. Heading due to polar moonlight aligns with polar sunlight as part of the integrator during twilight, indicating polarized moon is integrated into the ant's path for homing.
Pterosaurs were the first vertebrates to achieve powered flight, with early pterosaurs having long, stiff tails with a mobile base that could shift their center of mass, potentially benefiting flight control. These tails ended in a tall, thin tissue vane that would compromise aerodynamic control and efficiency if it fluttered excessively during flight. Maintaining stiffness in the vane was crucial in early pter flight, but how this was achieved was unclear, as vanes were lost in later pterosaurs and absent in birds and bats. Researchers used Laser-Stimulated Fluorescence imaging to reveal a cross-link lattice within the vanes of early pter. The lattice supported a dynamic tension system to maintain vane stiffness, allowing the tail to augment flight control and the v to function as a structure.

Early pterosaurs, non-pteractloids, had long, stiff tails with a mobile base, similar to some dinosaurs like Velocaptor. Many tails ended in a soft tissue vane, which may have contributed to passive stability in flight. The length and stiffness of tails suggest they were important in earlyter for control of mass or inertial control, as in terrestrial theropods with convergent tails. Dynamic control could improve maneuverability and stability, but v flutter would be costly and destabilizing unless v was tensioned under aerodynamic load.

Over 100 pter fossils were examined for well-preserved vanes using ultraviolet. Four exceptional specimens were imaged under Laserim Fluorescence. Three exhibited vanes under light, but one was only visible under SF. Researchers investigated the van's properties, usage, origins, and context for disappearance in later pteractloids.
During adolescence, significant changes occur in behaviors related to reward, social interactions, and decision-making, which are necessary for transitioning into adulthood but also increase vulnerability to various psychiatric disorders. The reorganization of the dopamine system during adolescence is thought to underlie these changes and increased vulnerability. This study used fast cyclic voltammetry and microdialysis to examine differences in dopamine release and mechanisms in the nucleus accumbens (Nac) core of adolescent (28-35) and adult (70) male rats. Baseline differences were found between adult and adolescent-stimulated dopamine release in rats, as well as opposite effects of α nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nACh) on dopamine release. The α-selective blocker α-conotoxin increased dopamine in adolescent rats but decreased dopamine in adult rats. Blockade of GABA and GAB receptors revealed α-mediated increase in adolescent release requires N GABA signaling. The role of αA and G in mediating this effect was confirmed using microial. A multisynaptic mechanism unique to the period of development was found, involving acetylcholine at α-containingA to drive inhibitory GABA on dopamine. 

 The effect is driven by multisaptic regulation of dopamine in adolescent rats through acetyloline atA and GABA. The dopamine system undergoes reorganization during adolescence. One report found antagonizing GAB increased dopamine when β-containingA were antagonized, indicating G and A have complex regulation of release that may be age-dependent. Decreased dopamine release was found in the N core of adolescent rats. The effects of G alone in presence endogenous G are independent of α control explored. Microdial in awake confirmed age differences in dopamine mediated by G involving α-containing in vivo. The mechanism regulating release in adolescent and adult remains unclear. The N core has largest difference in dopamine between adult and adolescent rats. The goal was to understand mechanisms mediating release in this region. Changes in release are implicated in psychiatric disorders, but much is unknown about driving age differences. The study aimed to identify N core dopamine release and mechanism for changes in adolescent and adult rats. Consistent with previous findings, variations in release were found.
Researchers studied individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to understand the underlying causes of the condition. They found that two distinct subtypes, idiopathic and 16p.2 deletion, had similar problems with neural cell growth and migration, despite no shared genetic mutations. To identify the cause, they analyzed protein signaling pathways and found hundreds of shared peptides, including the mTOR pathway. mTOR signaling was altered in both subtypes and was shown to cause developmental defects. Modulating mTOR rescued autism-like phenotypes in control cells. The study suggests distinct subtypes share a common mechanism, mTOR dysregulation, driving neural growth and migration issues. 

The researchers also found the ER/MK and PK pathways were altered, and cellular signaling plays a role in autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The study indicates mTOR is not only dysregulated in autism but drives associated phenotypes. To investigate, they studied neural development and migration in human cells from two autism subtypes, idiopathic and 16p deletion. They found convergence in phenotypes despite no genetic overlap. The most striking finding was consistent mTOR differences across subtypes, not previously described. To determine if mTOR drives abnormalities, gain and loss studies were conducted on both subtypes. Increasing mTOR activity rescued defects, while reducing m activity reproduced autism phenotypes. Decreasing m in high-TOR led to rescue of autism phenotypes. The study suggests early dysregulation may be common in multiple forms of autism. Protein, western, and small molecule analyses identified mTOR as a point of convergence for shared phenotypes.
Researchers have found that the diversity in the structure and function of synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGN) in the cochlea contributes to the diversity of neural responses to sound. The synapses on the pillar side of the IHC activate at lower potentials than those on the modiolar side, which have more presynaptic Ca2 channels. Postsynaptic SGNs differ in their firing rates, thresholds, and operating ranges. A relationship between synaptic heterogeneity and neural diversity is likely, but experimental evidence has been difficult to obtain. To bridge this gap, researchers made paired recordings of murine IHC and postsynaptic S boutons with stimuli mimicking in vivo conditions. Synapses with high spontaneous release (SR) were found on the pillar side of IHC, with larger and more compact EPs, lower thresholds, tighter Ca2 channels, and vesicular sites, shorter latencies, and higher release rates. This indicates synaptic heterogeneity in IHC contributes to diversity of spontaneous and sound-evoked SGN firing.

Researchers used paired I and S bout recordings in acutely explanted organs of Cort from mice with stimuli to mimic in vivo characterization. This controlled I Ca influx and recorded postsyn S response to glutamate at single afferent synapse. The study provides support for presyn hypothesis of S diversity and highlights challenges in bridging gap between hair function and neural encoding. Heterogeneity exists among synapses formed by individual I with 5- S, and is a mechanism for cochlea decomposing acoustic information. Synaptic heter has been found at tonopic positions and is a candidate for how cochlea decomposes information.

The physiology of affer syn with high and low SR was compared using protocols employed in vivo characterization sound by S. Step depolarizations emulated physiological potentials mature I of 'high' cochlea have graded primarily the rectified stimulus. Researchers caution for comparison ex and vivo due to partial disruption and incomplete maturation.
Researchers have been trying to understand how the malaria parasite Plasium falciparum regulates its genes to survive and thrive in the human body. One protein, called MORC, has been found to play a crucial role in this process. MOR is involved in compacting DNA and silencing genes in various organisms, including plants and animals. Scientists used a tool called CRISPR/Cas to edit the parasite's genome and study MOR's function. They found that MOR not only helps maintain the parasite's chromatin structure, but is also essential for its survival. MOR binds to specific regions of the genome, including those involved in antigen variation, which helps the parasite evade the immune system. When MOR is downregulated, the parasite's chromatin structure collapses, leading to its death. These findings confirm MOR's role in gene regulation and make it a potential target for new malaria treatments.
Researchers have found that cancer patients often experience changes in mental health, prompting an investigation into whether tumor-infiltrating nerves contribute to these alterations by impacting brain functions. Using a mouse model of head and neck cancer and neuronal tracing, they show that tumor-infiltrating nerves connect to distinct areas of the brain. Activation of this circuitry altered behaviors such as decreased nesting, increased latency to eat a cookie, and reduced running. Tumor-infiltrating nocicept neurons exhibited heightened activity and brain regions receiving these projections showed increased Fos as well as calcium compared to non-tumor counterparts. The elimination of nociceor neurons decreased F expression and mitigated the alterations induced by the presence of the tumor. While analgesic treatment restored nesting and cookie behaviors, it did not fully restore voluntary running indicating that pain is not the exclusive driver of behavioral shifts.

The study suggests that in addition to pain, tumor-infiltr nerves communicate signals to brain leading to cancer changes in behavior. This occurs independently of pain and cancer-brain drives alterations in tumor-bearing mice. Elimination of TR1-expressing nocor neurons reduces growth and survival, highlighting a potential target for mitigating depressive behaviors in cancer patients. Absence of nocor in tumor animals decreased F and F in P, and F in Sp. Other regions were not impacted. Data suggest tumor-brain communication disrupted in absence nocor. Evaluating effects on cancer-induced changes, general well-being was assessed through nesting behavior.

Findings are significant as they demonstrate tumor-infiltr nerves integrated into established circuit from tumor to T ganglion, connects to Spc, and projects brain influencing in pain-dependent and independent ways. Cancer patients and survivors experienced poor mental health. Connection between tumor and brain, with finding TR1-express nocor within circuit functionally altered might contribute these changes.
Researchers studied the genetic diversity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its impact on the multifunctional nucleocapsid protein. They found that variations in the physicochemical properties of the protein's intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) allow for plasticity, but also have functional constraints similar to other coronaviruses. Experiments with mutated N-protein species showed that point mutations in IDRs can have nonlocal effects on thermodynamic stability, secondary structure, oligomeric state, particle formation, and liquid-liquid separation. In the Omic variant, distant mutations in IDRs have compensatory effects, shifting the balance of interactions controlling protein properties and creating a new protein-protein interface.

The study suggests that properties like charge, phosphorylation, polarity, and hydrophobicity of IDR subregions are biophysical constraints across coronaviruses despite little sequence conservation. However, it's impossible to experimentally characterize all biophysical properties of mutants. Researchers computationally evaluated biophysical traits of SARSV-2 Nprotein domains and IDRs across mutants and related coronuses. The SARS-2 genome allows examining sequence impacts on biophysical properties and constraints for viral viability.

Focusing on SARS-2 Nprotein, researchers studied biophysical phenotypes to understand mechanisms and bi fitness. Experiments with representative mutants from SARS-2 variants characterized thermodynamic, secondary, oligom, energetics, assembly, and LLPS. A large biophysical space is available for Nprotein with mutations modulating overall properties. Mutations in IDRs can have nonlocal effects on protein biophysical traits.
Researchers investigated how skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency change during hibernation in small and large mammal species to optimize energy utilization. They isolated muscle fibers from hibernating animals, including the ground squirrel (Ictomys trcematus) and chipmunk (Eliom quinus), and the black bear (Urs arctos) and American black bear (rs american), and conducted experiments to measure myos dynamics and ATP consumption. Results showed that myos structure was preserved in U. arct and U. american during hibernation, but changed in I. trcematus and E. quinus, leading to higher energy expenditure in type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at 20°C. Repeating experiments at 8°C, near the animals' body temperature, myos consumption in type II fibers was reduced by 77-107% during torpor compared to active periods. My2 hyperphosphorylation was observed in I. trcematus, stabilizing the myos molecule. This may mitigate myos-associated energy increases in muscle during tor in response to cold. Myos is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes in ATP consumption, and altered in response to cold, highlighting its role in muscle thermogenesis.
Researchers studied the formation of chondrocy columns in the growth plates of mouse embryos and postnatal mice using 3D imaging and morphometric analysis. They found that chrocytes in the embryonic plate are not typically arranged in columns, but rather in elongated clusters oriented perpendicular to the growth direction. This is due to incomplete rotation of the division plane during cell division, resulting in non-stacking of cells. In contrast, postnatal plates showed both ordered and disordered columns, and small disorganized clusters at the edges. The study suggests that modulation of division plane rotation determines formation of clusters or columns, a multifunctional mechanism regulating morphogenesis throughout growth. The findings provide new understanding of cellular mechanisms underlying growth and elongation during development.
Proton-coupled oligopeptide transporters (POTs) are of great interest in pharmaceuticals due to their promiscuous binding site, which has been linked to improved bioavailability of several classes of drugs. Members of the POT family are conserved across all phylogen kingdoms and function by coupling peptide to the electrochemical gradient. Recent cryo-EM and alpha-fold models have provided insights into conformation states of mammalian POTs SLC15A1 and SLC2. However, these studies leave questions regarding mechanism of proton and coupling, while providing opportunity to investigate using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study employs unbiased and enhanced-sampling to map SLC2 conformation cycle and thermodynamic forces. Computing conformation free landscapes in proton states and presence or absence of peptide identify sequence proton steps drive inward-directed access. Simulations identify differences extracellular gate mammalian and bacterial POT, validated in cell-based assays. Results from constant-P MD and absolute free energy (ABE) calculations establish mechanistic link between binding and recognition, revealing details secondary active transport POT. This study provides step understanding proton-coupled peptide transport in mammals and integrates knowledge solute biology with drug design to target and bioavailability.

The study uses bacterial and mammalian structures to construct alternating mechanism model. Movement protons drive conformation changes, and conformation-proton events coupled substrate presence. Distinct effects ligand binding conformation changes proton E and E titatable residues. Work provides plausible sequence steps substrate-coupled access mammalian POT. To investigate peptide-proton coupling, simulations included Alahe substrate. Calculated affinity AB in different states. Afinity similar OF and IF, substrate alone does not drive OF to IF. Unbiased approach generates hypotheses testing proton-dependent conformation changes. Enhanced sampling conformation free landscapes proton and substrate conditions. Assumption 2:1 stoichiometry dipeptides, motivated results distinct roles pro conformation cycle. POT belong major facilitator superfamily (M) conserved six-helix functional domain N-C termini cytoplasm.
Researchers investigated the neural responses in the auditory cortex during speech production in humans, a process previously studied in non-human primates. They used intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) recordings from 35 neurosurgical participants to characterize the topography of auditory suppression, which varied across the superior temporal gyrus (ST). The study aimed to determine if suppressed sites were sensitive to auditory feedback, enabling detection of vocal errors. Results showed overlapping sites in ST exhibited both suppression and sensitivity to feedback, with a strong correlation between the two measures, supporting the hypothesis that suppression increases sensitivity to errors. Delaying auditory feedback during speech enhanced responses in ST, with variable sensitivity across sites. A correlation between suppression and sensitivity was found, indicating a shared mechanism between suppression and speech monitoring. When participants produced speech with auditory feedback, posterior ST was selectively activated during an auditory feedback task, suggesting attention modulates sensitivity.
Researchers have conducted a comprehensive analysis of McBC systems, a type of prokaryotic IV restriction systems, and found them to be abundant and diverse in proaryotes, with various genomic associations. They focused on a previously uncharacterized branch, denoted as CoNu, characterized by extensive coiled-coil structures and nucleases. Three types and subtypes of CoNu were identified, each with distinct domain compositions and genomic associations. CoNu domains interact with translation components, such as OB-fold, Hsp homologs, YTH domains, and RNases, suggesting they target RNA. Some CoNu may also target DNA via McC nuclease homologs. CoNu are often found in operons with other restriction systems, such as Type I, RM, BRE, and Type III. These operons are regulated by cyclic nucleotides or RNA fragments with CARF domains. The researchers propose that CoNu, with ancillary factors, employ a defense strategy similar to Type III CRIS-C systems, first eliminating DNA/RNA, then aborting infection via RNA cleavage if it fails.

 CoNu contain domains interacting with translation components, such as SB-like OB-fold, H70 homologs, Y domains, and RNases, suggesting they target RNA. Three types and subtypes of CoNu were identified, differing in domain and genomic associations. RNA capability of Type-III and III can be inferred from similarity to Type-A encoding CD70 proteins. Higher-order associations of II and III CoNu with DNA systems suggest two-prong DNA/RNA strategy. The researchers suspect RNA is an ancestral feature of CoNu. Consistent with this, II and III CoNu likely target RNA, given operons encode HNases, only recognizable in these systems. Association of CDC-like ATPases with III CoNu, encoding tmRNA SP domain supports tmRNA interaction. Structural analysis of bacterin protein in loci indicates inactivated PD/EK fold, potentially nucleic-binding.
Researchers studied the role of calcineur, a calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine/threon protein phosphatase, in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that inhibiting calcine increased the worm's lifespan through multiple pathways. Specifically, they discovered that calcine is required for the rhythmic defecation motor (DMP) program in C. elegans. Inhibiting calcine led to defects in DMP, resulting in intestinal bloating, rapid colonization of the gut by bacteria, and increased susceptibility to infection. They showed that intestinal bloating caused by calcine inhibition mimics the effects of calorie restriction, resulting in enhanced lifespan. The TF ortholog, HL-30, is required for lifespan mediated by calcine inhibition. They also found that the nuclear receptor, NHR-8, is upregulated by calcine inhibition and necessary for increased lifespan. The study reveals a role for calcine in C. elegans DMP and a mechanism for calcine inhibition-mediated longevity.
Researchers investigated how the brain resolves conflicts between task-relevant and irrelevant information to enable goal-directed behavior. Conflicts can arise from various sources, such as sensory or internal representations, and a limited set of cognitive processes can effectively address diverse conflicts remains a challenge. Based on the cognitive theory, conflicts can be parameterized and represented as points in a low-dimensional space, which can be resolved by a set of control processes along dimensions. This leads to the hypothesis that similar conflicts in sources are represented similarly in space. A task with five types of conflicts was designed that could be conceptually parameterized. Human performance and fMRI activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supported that types of conflicts are organized based on similarity, suggesting space as a principle for representing conflicts.

The study aimed to test the geometry of conflict representation in space. It was hypothesized that types of conflicts are represented as points in space. Importantly, the distance between points reflects the geometry of space, with difference in sources of conflicts represented by points. Dimensions in space can be domains, where domain-specific control processes are defined. A type of conflict's location in space can be parameter using limited coordinates, reflecting control needed for domain-specific processes. Space can represent types with low dimensionality (Bad et al, 2021;Mac et al,202). Domains can be conjunct in space to achieve domain control from different sources can be resolved same processes. It was hypothesized that space representing types conflicts may be in frontopetal due its roles in resolution ( et al,202; et,2004). Two solutions resolving types proposed differ based on control mechanisms applied. Domain control posits frontopetal encodes information and flexibly control for types, supported generalizable adjustment.
Researchers conducted the largest study to date on the vaginal immune system's role in preterm birth, a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. They collected vaginal swabs from 739 pregnant women, 281 samples, across gestation, and analyzed 31 immune mediators, including cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides. The study found that the vaginal immunopome, or vaginal immune system, has a homeostatic or balanced profile in uncomplicated pregnancies, but shifts to a pro-inflammatory state in women who experience preterm labor or preterm rupture of membranes. This inflammatory profile includes increased monocyte attractants, cytokines indicative of macrophage and T-cell activation, and reduced antimicrobial peptides. The immunome has predictive value over maternal characteristics for identifying women at risk for early preterm birth. The immunome undergoes changes throughout gestation and deviations from this shift are associated with preterm birth. The immun can be leveraged as a biomarker for early preterm, a subset associated with adverse neonatal outcomes.
Researchers have developed a computational model, called the Hernandez-Hern model, to understand how smooth muscle cells lining the walls of mammalian arteries and arterioles regulate blood flow and blood pressure. The model focuses on electrical and calcium (Ca2+) signaling in myocytes from male and female murine resistance arteries, indicating sex-specific differences. The model suggests fundamental mechanisms underlying membrane potential and intracellular Ca2+ signaling during myogenic tone development in blood vessels. Experimental data show KV.5 currents have similar amplitudes, kinetics, and voltage dependencies in male and female myocytes, but simulations indicate KV.5 is the dominant current regulating potential in male myocytes. Female cells have larger KV2.1 expression and longer activation times than male myocytes, suggesting KV.1 plays a primary role in controlling membrane potential. Voltage-gated K+ and L-type Ca2 channels drive sex differences in intracellular Ca+ and excitability. The model also shows female arterial muscle is more sensitive to Ca2 blockers than male. A new framework is presented to investigate the sex-specific impact of antihypertensive drugs.
Researchers investigated how different sizes of decomposers, such as microorganisms and macrofauna, interact with climate to affect litter decomposition. They placed baskets of different mesh sizes in seven sites along a sharp precipitation gradient, from very dry to wet, and found that decomers responded differently to precipitation based on their size. Microorganisms decomposed more with increasing precipitation in the winter, while macrofauna decomposed more in dry sites during the summer. This led to similar decomposition rates across the gradient, except in very dry sites. Macrofauna richness, abundance, and biomass peaked in dry environments. The study highlights the importance of macrofauna in drylands and suggests considering decomposer size when investigating ecological processes.
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a type of cancer with a poor prognosis and high rates of metastasis and limited treatment options. Research has shown that activation of the KRAS gene in most tumors drives RAC activation, leading to enhanced migratory and proliferative capacity as well as macropocytosis. Macropocytosis is known as a nutrient scavenging mechanism, but its role in trafficking of signaling receptors is not well understood. This study found that CY-B is highly expressed in pancreatic tumors in a mouse model of KRAS and p53-driven pancreatic cancer. Deletion of Cy, the gene encoding CY-B protein, accelerates tumorigenesis, leading to ER and JNK-induced proliferation in precancer lesions, indicating a role as a buffer of RAC activation in early stages. However, as disease progresses, loss of CY-B inhibits metastasis. CY-B depleted tumor cells show reduced chemotactic responses to lysosphatidic acid, a driver of tumor spread, due to impaired macinocytic uptake of lysosphatid acid receptor. The study implicates CY-B as a mediator of growth and signaling in pancreatic cancer, providing insights into pathways controlling metastasis.

Deletion of Cy in pancreas, with expression of KR G and p, led to acceleration of Pan formation and increase in pancreas lesions with phospho-ER and phosph-J, crucial targets of KR and R that drive proliferation and expansion. CY-B was highly expressed in human cancers and correlated with poorer survival. Expression of CY-B in mice suggested this could reveal role in human PDAC. Loss of Cy in K model accelerates Pan formation and progression, likely due to CY-B's capacity to buffer R activation of KR leading to abnormal, combined hyper of ER and J to proliferation. The K model is characterized by metastasis to clinically relevant organs such as liver, diaphragm, and bowel. CY localizes on macinos in cancer lines, suggesting mechanism for CY-B loss affecting progression.
Researchers have identified a group of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) called HERV-HML-2, which includes intact or nearly intact viruses, but no replication-competent H-2 proviruses have been found in humans. However, related proviruses have been found in other primates, including rhes macaques, but the extent and timing of H-2 activity in macques is unclear. The study found 145 H-2-like proviruses inhes macques, including a group of young,hes-specific insertions. The age, open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions suggest recent or ongoing activity in macques. One group of proviruses has a 750 sequence between the env and 3 long terminal repeat (LTR), derived from recombination with a HER-K H-8-related virus. This group is found in Old World monkeys but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OW split. Similar provuses were found in white-cheek gibbons, with insertions within the OW recombinant group, indicating interspecies transmission from OW to gibbons. The LTR of youngest provuses have deletions U, disrupting the Response Element (RE), required for nuclear export of unspliced RNA. The H-8 region functions as a Response-independent constitutive transport (TE), indicating the RE-RE export system was replaced by C mechanism.

The study characterized a group of HER-H2-related ERVs inhes macques and Old World monkeys that include a 750 non-coding region between env and 3 L, derived from recombination a HER-K H-8 retroirus. This suggests the ERV is a young, less than 500,000 years old, andhes macques may harbor or have active H-2 retroviruses. The study found a group of ER inhesques that may serve as a model for viral evolution over time and a model HER-H2 virology and pathogenesis.
Researchers investigated the role of Enterococcus faalis in wound infections, which can lead to delayed or failed healing and significant morbidity. They used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to compare infected and uninfected wounds in a mouse model, examining over 23,000 cells. The study created a comprehensive atlas of the cellular and transcript landscape of wounds, revealing unique transcription and metabolic alterations in infected wounds. The analysis showed distinct molecular changes associated with bacterial infection compared to normal healing, including dysregulated keratinocyte and fibroblast transcriptomes contributing to an anti-inflammatory environment. E. faalis infection prompted premature epithelial-mesymal transition in keratinocytes and modulated M2 macrophage polarization inhibiting pro-inflammatory resolution in vitro and in vivo. The study also discovered macrophage cstalk with neutrophils regulating chemine signaling, promoting anti-inflammatory interactions with endothelial cells.

The findings suggest uninf wounds undergo reparative angiogenesis while E faalis evokes pathologicalization. The analysis underlines M-like macroage-EC interactions as altered cell signaling during bacteria-infected healing. E fa persistence virulence factors, immunomodulatory strategies, and implications in delayed healing remain to be investigated. The study generated a comprehensive atlas of host response to persistent fa infection, observing fa induces immunosup in kerocytes and fibroblasts, delaying response. The insights provide a foundation for future studies investigating factors contributing woundogenesis and underlying delayed healing.

The study compared transcript and cellular profiles uninf and fa-infected full-thickness skin at 4 post-infection. However, lacks a dataset uninf unwounded skin transcript, which would investigate changes induced by wounding alone. fa reaffirmed fibro functions during uninf healing, consistent with lig-receptor interactions. Imm cells play a role in healing by eliminating pathogens, kerocyte andro activity, inflammation, and repair.
Plants that are attacked by herbivores release volatiles, which can enhance defenses in neighboring plants. However, the timing of this phenomenon is not well understood. Researchers used a custom-built system to study the transfer of volatiles between herbivore-attacked and undamaged maize plants. They found that continuous exposure to blends of herbore-induced volat results in a delayed response in neighboring plants, characterized by a terpene burst at the start of the second day. This burst is not due to terene accumulation during the night, but coincides with jasmonate accumulation in receiver plants. The burst occurs independently of day-night transitions and cannot be explained by sender dynamics. Instead, it is the result of stress from volatile exposure during the first day and secondary to bioactive volat on the second. The study shows that prolonged exposure to natural blends of stress volat results in a response that primes and induces a distinct temporal pattern. This answers the question of whether volat induce or prime defenses in neighboring plants, revealing they can do both in sequence.

Experiments show the importance of tracking plant responses in real-time as they perceive the natural blend of herboreatt neighbors. The ecological relevance of the clocked kinetics of activation in neighboring plants is proposed. Responding strongly to cues on the second may avoid energy expenditure. This is the result of volatile priming on the first that yields a clock response to volat perceived the next. Plants respond to herbore volat by increasing their defenses. Activation can happen directly, increasing hormone production and release. To test this, plants were exposed to volat from control or herbore plants for 1.25 hours, then disconnected and exposed to clean air until the next day. Half were then exposed to H as a trigger. H was selected as it showed strongest correlation with terpen.

Maize exposed to volat from herboreatt start releasing terpen. To understand the dynamics, a time-course of terene release by plants exposed to vol from sender under attack by Spoptera caterpillars was conducted.
Researchers have long believed that recursion, a key feature of human language and music, is unique to humans. However, a study of wild orangutans has found evidence of recursive vocal patterns in their calls, suggesting a possible evolutionary precursor to human language and music. The study analyzed the calls of flanged male orangutans in the wild and found rhythmic sequences within rhythmic sequences, consistent with a hierarchical structure. Notably, the lower-level rhythms were not multiples of the higher-level rhythms, indicating a non-parallel, non-hierarchical process. This is the first evidence of recursive vocal combinatorics in a non-human, without syntax, semantics, or music. The finding opens the possibility that recursion was first a feature of proto-musical expression in human ancestors, later adapted for language. Further studies on great ape vocal behaviors could test this idea. A new approach to analyzing primate combics, particularly in the wild, may reveal precursors to recursion in the human family.
Researchers have studied the interaction between viruses and their hosts in lower vertebrates, specifically focusing on the relationship between the MDA receptor and 5'pp-RNA virus in the Miichthys mii fish. They found that the frequent loss of R-I in vertebrates led to the search for alternative immune substitutes, with homology-dependent genetic compensation (HDCR) being the main pathway. Analysis showed that M5 in Miichys and Gallus, the homolog of R-I, can replace R-I in recognizing 5pp-R virus, leading to redundancy of R-I loss from the genome during evolution. As an adversarial strategy, 5-R virus can utilize m6 methylation to degrade M and weaken its antiviral ability, promoting its replication and immune evasion. The study provides a snapshot of the interaction and coevolution between vertebrate and virus, offering perspectives on ecological and evolutionary factors contributing to the diversity of the immune system.

The researchers investigated whether M, structurally similar to R-I, can substitute R-I in recognizing 5-R in vertebrates without R-I. They found that M mediated signaling in response to SC virus and double-stranded poly (C-HM infection. By linking the replacement of M with common R-I loss in vertebrates, they propose a straightforward explanation for this event: M gradually acquired new functionalities to detect 5-R, initially recognized by-I.

In a study, teleost Miichys and chicken, lacking R-I, and 5-R viruses were used to investigate strategies between 5-R virus and host. Results showed that M of Miys and Gallus lacking-I evolved to recognize 5-R. SC virus mainly affects Sinca, lacking-I. Viruses coevolve with hosts. Data suggest verte evolved M with functions to recognize and resist 5-R in absence-I. SC virus can utilize m to degrade M of Mi for evasion. Findings unveil the diversity of antiv activity and a complex race between virus and immunity in vertebrates.
A study investigated the relationship between follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and body composition in men with prostate cancer undergoing androgen therapy (AD). Twenty-nine patients were enrolled in a phase IV study from 2017 to 2019 and received luteizing hormone-releasing antagonist degare. Body fat mass (FBM), lean mass (LBM), and bone density (BMD) were evaluated by dual-energy x-ray absorptometry at baseline and after 12 months of AD. FSH, alkaline phosphatase, and C-terminal peptide of type I collagen were assessed at baseline and after 6 and 12 months. At baseline, a weak, non-significant direct relationship was found between FSH levels and FB in arms and legs. However, a stronger correlation was observed between FSH and total FB, fat in arms, and fat trunk after 12 months. An inverse relationship between serum F and appendicular mass/FBM ratio was observed. This study suggests FSH levels after AD could impact body composition, particularly FB. F could be a marker to monitor risk of sarcopenia and guide clinicians in evaluation of body in patients undergoing AD.
Sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation (VT/VF) is a leading cause of death, but current therapies are limited. Despite extensive research on drugs targeting sarcolem ion channels, none have proven effective in preventing SC. Sarcasmicoplasmic ryanine receptor 2 (Ry2) Ca+ release channels, downstream of sarlem ion channels, are underexplored in this context. Recent evidence implicates reactive species (ROS)-mediated oxidation and hyperactivity of Ry2 in the pathophysiology of SC. Researchers tested the hypothesis that Ry2 inhibition in failing hearts reduces sarcasm Ca+ leak and repolar lability, mitigates VT/SC and improves contract function. A guinea pig model replicates clinical aspects of nonischem HF, such as prolonged interval, high arrhythmic SC, and Ca+ leak via hyperactive Ry2. Animals were randomized to receive drol (DS) or placebo in early HF. The incidence of VT and SC (primary outcome), ECG heart rate and variability, echocardi left ventricular (LV) structure and function, immunisto LV fibrosis, and sarcasm Ry2 oxidation were assessed. DS prevented VT and SC by decreasing dispersion repolar and vent arrhythmias. Compared to placebo, DS lowered heart rate, preserved competency during β-adnergic challenge and improved heart variability and function. Inhibition Ry2 hyperactivity with drol mitigates vicious cycle sarcasm Ca+ leak increases diolic Ca and ROS-mediated Ry2, reducing repolar and protecting VTSC. Moreover, sarcasm Ca+ load improves contract function.
Researchers have studied how cells respond to signals from the transforming growth factor-β (TGF) family, including the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) family, which play a crucial role in development and growth. In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the BMP4 ortholog DB-1 regulates body size through a receptor-Smad signaling cascade. This study identified binding sites for SMA-3/Smad and its transcription partner SMA-9/Schnri using ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis. SMA-3 and SMA-9 have overlapping and unique target genes, with SMA-3 acting as a transcription activator and SMA-9 targeting both activated and repressed genes. Mutations in SMA-9 partially suppressed the small size phenotype of SMA-3, suggesting some level of antagonism between these factors. Functional analysis of target genes revealed a novel role in body size for genes involved in one-carbon metabolism and endoplasmic reticulum secretory pathway, including disulf reductase-11. The findings indicate Smads and SMA-9/Sri have complex interactions regulating secretion of extracellular components like collagen into the cuticle to mediate body regulation.
Researchers have found that a protein called DUX is expressed in about 10-50% of advanced bladder, breast, kidney, prostate, and skin cancers that have spread to other parts of the body. This protein suppresses the immune system's ability to recognize and attack cancer cells, making it harder for treatments like immunotherapy to work. In a study of urothelial cancer patients, DUX expression was linked to the immune system being excluded from the tumor and not responding to a common treatment called PD-1 blockade. DUX was also associated with lower survival rates, even after accounting for other factors like tumor mutations and clinical features. The study suggests DUX could be a marker and target for developing new treatments to overcome resistance to immunotherapy. 

In uroth cancer, DUX was found in 54% of patients, making it a possible that it plays a key role in this type of cancer. The protein's expression in metastatic cancers is linked to reduced anti-tumor immunity, similar to previous findings in primary cancers and cell lines. DUX is thought to induce an immunosuppressive gene program, consistent with its role in inhibiting JAK-STAT signaling in primary cancers. In uro cancers, DUX was associated with transcript signals that exclude CD8 T cells from the tumor.
A study was conducted in Tanzania to investigate the causes and impacts of livestock abortion in pastoral, agro-pastoral, and smallholder systems. Livestock abortion is a significant issue affecting productivity and public health, but little is known about its causes and impacts, and data are not available to inform interventions. The study established a surveillance platform to investigate abortion events reported by farmers to livestock officers, collecting samples and data on determinants, patterns, and cases involving zoonotic pathogens. Between 2017-2019, 215 events in cattle, sheep, and goats were investigated. Attribution was achieved in 19.5% of cases, significantly affected by delays in obtaining samples. Histopath proved less useful than PCR due to sample deterioration. Vaginal swabs provided practical material for pathogen detection.

The study demonstrated the utility, acceptability, and feasibility of livestock abortion as a target for syndromic event surveillance, showing an effective reporting and investigation system operational across settings, including rural areas. The study suggests a possible role for stressful events, including drought and wild attacks, reported in a third of unattributed cases. Non-infect conditions, nutritional, and toxic are likely causes of abortion in Tanzania. The study provides valuable information on causes of disease, reproductive losses, and identifies pathogens not captured through other forms of surveillance. Establishing a system through community-based officers, sample collection, and molecular platforms is feasible.
Cigarette smoking is a well-known risk factor for the development and progression of various diseases, and nicotine (NIC) is a major constituent of cigarette smoke. However, the mechanism of NIC-regulated stem cell functions is limited. This study demonstrates that NIC increases the abundance and proliferative activity of murine intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in vivo and ex vivo. NIC induces Yes-associated protein (YAP) transcriptional coactivator with PD-binding (TAZ) and Notch signaling in ISC via α-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and protein C activation; this effect is not detected in Pan cells. Inhibition of Not signaling by dibenzine (DB) nullifies the effects of NIC on ISC. NIC enhances tumor formation from ISC loss of tumor suppressor APC, DB inhibited NIC-induced growth. This study identifies NIC-triggered pathway regulating stemness and tumorigenicity of ISC and suggests DB as a potential therapeutic for treating intestinal tumors.

The study reveals the pivotal role of NIC as a stimulant of cancer cell proliferation in tumors, explaining colon development in smokers. Development of drugs blocking α-nCh, YAP/TA, and Notch signaling may provide a therapeutic for colon cancers. Extrinsic factors, such as NIC, increase cancer risk by promoting cell division. Data indicate NIC increased abundance of ISC, partly explaining increased intestinal tumors in smokers. NIC enhances ISC via αCh as well as Y/TA and Not signaling. This is consistent with DB-induced suppression of Y/TA and Not in ISC from NIC mice. NIC expands ISC through upregulated αCh and formation of Y/ loop, suggesting factors as therapeutic targets for NIC-induced colon. In the intestine, Y enhances expression of β-caten and transcriptional targets W signaling.

This study contributes to knowledge on how cells respond to NIC, a component of smoke, and a new strategy for treating smoking-related colon. In contrast, analysis affects ISC rather than Pan via Y and Not activated nA by mRNA and sorted ISC or Pan cells ex vivo assays. The between Hipp, Not, and W regulates mammalian homeostasis.
Heat shock protein 70 (Hsp) plays a crucial role in counteracting protein misfolding and aggregation, which is associated with stress, aging, and disease. It solubilizes aggregates and aids refolding through substrate binding and release, regulated by co-chaperones: J-domain proteins (JDPs) and nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs). This study elucidates the collaborative impact of Hsp NEFs and different JDP classes on H70-dependent aggregate processing. Results show that Hsp plays a major role in initial stages of disaggregation, determining its efficacy. NE catalyzes the recruitment of H70 onto aggregate surface, modifying into smaller species processed by chaper. Hsp stimulation by H is stronger with class B than A JDPs, requiring interaction between B and H70 EE motif. Furthermore, H disrupts J-H interaction, destabilizing chone complexes at aggregate, improving disaggregation but inhibiting suboptimal H levels. Interplay between coaper and H70 is critical to unlock disaggreg potential.

 Recent studies showed H70 exhibits different mechanisms with class A and B J coaper (Wysowski et al, 202). To understand interplay within H70 network, addressed H effects H70 members different J classes. Result shows substrate activity not necessary increase S1-S1 binding and NE concentration correlated with affinity H. Larger H-J assemblies surface dependent S1 and interaction EE modify misfold species amenable disag. H-dependent limited initial stages: chaper recruitment and disassembly, not protein folding. Initial loading correlates remelling smaller species, improving H104 recognition. H may release J, unless tethered via interaction, e.g., other J subunit complex aggregate-bound H molecule. Fate displaced established, presumably low levels rebind another site or aggregate-bound chaper. Positive H effect on recovery substantially comprises class J. Theoretically stimulation occur stages - association, polype disentlement, final folding.

 This study highlights the role of H110 in H70-dependent aggregate processing, showing it plays a major role in initial stages of disaggregation, determining efficacy. NE catalyzes recruitment of H70 onto aggregate, modifying smaller species processed by chaper. H stimulation is stronger with class B than A JDP, requiring interaction between B and H EE. Furthermore, H disrupts J-H interaction, destabilizing chone complexes at aggregate, improving disag but inhibiting suboptimal levels. Interplay between coaper and H is critical to unlock disag potential.
Researchers have developed a low-cost digital insole that can analyze gait, or walking patterns, to diagnose and monitor osteoarthritis, a musculoskeletal condition affecting the knee. Traditional gait analysis relies on visual observation, but is subjective and expensive, requiring large facilities and trained staff. The digital insole uses machine learning to analyze force data collected from participants with osteoarthritis and controls, achieving results similar to clinical gait standards. The model was highly predictive of force data from a separate validation set and independent insole dataset, containing controls and osteoarthritis subjects. The insole-derived gait characteristics were comparable to traditional measurements, and a single stride of sensor data was accurately assigned to each subject, allowing individuals to be identified by their gait. This provides a framework for an alternative to clinical gait methods, adds to wearable technology pipelines, and supports at-home assessments, potentially improving ease, frequency, and depth of patient monitoring.

The study aimed to quantify how force data identifies disease-specific gait and if the insole can detect characterizations. Controls and osteoarthritis were differentiated using vertical force data, divided into training and test sets, and a support vector machine model was trained to predict classes. A novel framework was developed based on gold-standard force data for insoles to detect osteoarthritis, and insole-derived outcomes and sensor signals identified disease-specific patterns. Clinical application of insoles for g analysis is limited by lack of validation, including criterion and construct, such as comparison to laboratory references. The insole model performed similarly on insole and force data as on hold-out plate data, a benefit being more variables can be derived, enabling comprehensive assessment.

The model was applied to an independent dataset from insole on individuals with osteoarthritis and controls, assuming OA and injury represented by force curves. The insole can measure vertical force similarly to a plate, providing a comprehensive assessment.
Researchers have been searching for non-opioid alternatives to manage post-surgical pain due to the severe side effects and risks of opioid analgesics. A recent study found that applying a human amniotic membrane (AM) product, called Clarix (FLO), significantly reduced post-surgical hypersensitivity in mice without opioid side effects. This effect was achieved by inhibiting nociceptive dorsal root ganglion (DR) neurons via CD44 pathways. The researchers purified a major component, heavy-hyaluronic acid/paxin 3 (HA/PT3), from AM, which replicated LO's pain inhibition and had greater purity and solubility. Mechanistically, HA/3 induced cytoskeleton rearrangements inhibited sodium and high-voltage activated calcium currents in nocice DR neurons, making it a key mediator of pain relief. The study highlights the potential of naturally derived biologics from human tissues as non-opoid treatments for posturgical pain and unravels the underlying mechanisms of pain inhibition by LO and HA/3.
Researchers studied the relationship between the color and function of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells by analyzing human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived R cells (iPSC-R). They used a new imaging system to photograph and analyze the gene expression of individual cells, categorizing them into four groups based on gene expression. However, the color of the cells did not match any specific gene profile, suggesting that color may not directly indicate the level of pigmentation. The study found that the degree of pigmentation is dynamically regulated in each cell, with a time lag between mRNA production of enzymes and melanin synthesis. The color of iSC-R cells did not correlate with expression of R markers, so the researchers looked for other factors influencing pigmentation. They found a weak correlation between pigmentation and genes related to retin recycling, which supplies photoreceptors with retinal, with coefficients of 0.25, 0.20, 0.16, 0.12, and 0.11. Evidence suggests that in vitro pigmentation of R cells may not reflect functional maturity, such as bone marrow-derived R cells becoming pigmented after transplantation, and iPSC-R cells becoming pigmented after engraftment.
Researchers in the field of neuroscience have increasingly recognized the importance of studying animal behaviors in their natural environments to gain a deeper understanding of ethologically relevant processes and neural mechanisms. The common marmet (Callithrix jacch) has emerged as a pivotal model for this effort due to its small size, prosocial nature, and genetic proximity to humans. However, traditional research methods often fail to capture the nuances of marmet social interactions and cooperative behaviors. To address this gap, a novel apparatus, the Marmet Apparatus for Automated Pulling (MAAP), was developed to study cooperative behaviors in commonmets. MAAP enables high-throughput, detailed outputs that can be integrated with video and audio recordings, allowing for more comprehensive analysis in naturalistic settings. It also accommodates a wide range of behaviors and individual capabilities, and provides a platform for investigations of neural activity underlying social behaviors. MAAP is a versatile tool advancing understanding primate behavior and cognitive processes, bridging the gap between ethologically relevant animal studies and neural investigations.

A new task was developed to capture nuances of cooperative behaviors and collect high-resolution data, making it suitable for investigating underlying mechanisms in primates. An innovative method for studying cooperative commonmets using an automated apparatus and task was introduced. With increased trials through MAAP, the possibility of examining neural dynamics inmets was supported. The apparatus and paradigm represent an advancement, bridging traditional behavior studies and precise investigations of neural activity. Behavioral metrics from video and audio with mets' pulling and reward delivery provide a comprehensive understanding of behavior, communication, and interactions in this species using an automated task.

MAAP and associated paradigms offer rich data and flexibility for various tasks, creating an avenue for simultaneous recordings while mets are engaged in tasks by MA. MA significantly increases trials for analysis, ensuring power investigating relationship between activity and behaviors.
Researchers studied the effects of moderate alcohol consumption during pregnancy on the developing fetus using a mouse model that mimics human drinking patterns. They found that moderate alcohol exposure affected DNA methylation, a process that regulates gene expression, in newborns without causing noticeable behavioral changes in adult offspring. Whole-genome sequencing of newborn brain and liver revealed tissue-specific effects, with some changes occurring as early as gastrulation. Methylation differences were found in non-coding regions, suggesting broad effects on gene regulation. Replication in human studies with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders showed similar effects on genes linked to traits like facial features, intelligence, education, and autism. A diet rich in folate and choline protected against some damage in mice. The study shows moderate exposure can affect the fetus's genome without visible changes and highlights the importance of maternal dietary interventions.

The researchers identified sensitive regions to alcohol exposure were replicated in human studies. They compared exposed and unexposed mice to assess DNA methylation, and added a diet with high folate and choline. Whole-genome bisulf sequencing was used to assess Cp DNA methylation in brain and liver, organs affected by ethanol. Candidate testing was done on regions sensitive to moderate exposure. The study covered pre-conception to first trimester, typical human drinking. Outcomes were DNA methylation and behavioral deficits in neurodevelopment relevant to fetal alcohol spectrum disorder.

In a validation, DNA methylation data from 147 newborns with moderate exposure and controls were compared. No differential methylation was found at 189 Cp sites. In mice, effects were tissue-specific, with two regions and genes affected in both liver and brain. Changes may have occurred before gastrulation and maintained in differentiating tissues.
Researchers have found that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is effective in silencing a wide variety of genes in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, but the loss of some regulators of RNA interference (RNAi) can selectively impair the silencing of certain genes. They discovered that this selectivity can be explained by an intersecting network of regulators acting on genes with differences in their metabolism. In this network, the Mael domain protein RDE-10, the intrinsically disordered protein MUT-16, and Argona proteinDE-3 work together, where two are required for silencing one gene, but each singly required for silencing another. The requirement for DE-3 can be overcome by enhanced RNA processing. Models and simulations showed that changing regulatory elements of the gene can reduce dependence on DE-3, animals can recover from silencing in non-dividing cells, and cleavage and tailing of mRNAs with U dinucleotides, which are templates for amplifying RNAs, are enriched in 'UG' zones matching dsRNA.

Extensive characterization of RNAi in C elegans makes it suitable to examine how differences between genes and reliance on regulators contribute to efficacy and resistance. A pathway required for silencing in response to dsRNA has been worked out in C elegans. Requirement for DE- but not MUT or R- can be bypassed by enhancing processing ds, suggesting DE has least impact on efficiency. A model of RNA during silencing by ds reveals criteria for efficient silencing. Two of MUT, DE, and R- structurally functionally different proteins are required for silencing suggests each could contribute to any RNA target. Mechanisms could generate other RN independent R- (Yang et al, 2012; Zhang et al 201). Studies needed to test each model. RNA widely applied for silencing in plants, insects, humans, like C elegans, plants (San-Mra et 202) and some insects (Pinon et al).
Researchers investigated the genetic factors contributing to mortality and morbidity in tuberculous meningitis (TBM), a severe infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. They analyzed blood samples from 281 adults with TBM, 295 with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and 30 healthy controls to identify genes and pathways associated with TBM severity and mortality. Weighted gene expression analysis revealed distinct patterns between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals, with increased neutrophil activation and decreased T cell activation linked to TBM mortality. In HIV-positive individuals, mortality was associated with angiogenesis, while HIV-negative exhibited TNF signaling and impaired extracellular organization. Four genes (MMP1, N2, Z, C, and CD) were strong predictors of TBM mortality. The study found a systemic inflammatory response in TBM similar to PT, highlighting potential therapeutic targets and a four-gene biomarker for outcomes.

The researchers identified differences in gene expression between HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals, with increased angiogenesis in HIV adults and TNF signaling in HIV-negative. A four-gene signature was a potential biomarker for mortality regardless of HIV status. Multivariate Cox regression selected predictors for HIV-negative TBM included common genes, HIV-specific genes, and clinical markers age, T severity, and CSF lymphocyte count. The study aimed to identify baseline signatures predicting death or survival from TBM, selecting genes from common and HIV-specific hubs. Three clinical factors (age, M grade, and CSF lymphocyte) were used for predictor selection.

Transcription profiles associated with T mortality stratified by HIV showed 786 genes differentially expressed in HIV-negative and 1628 in HIV-positive. The researchers hypothesized host signatures differ according to HIV status.
Researchers have assessed the performance of 614 commercial antibodies targeting 65 human proteins in neuroscience, using a standardized approach to evaluate specificity in three common laboratory applications: Western blot, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence. The study found that more than 50% of antibodies failed in one or more applications, but around 50-75% of proteins were covered by at least one high-performing antibody, suggesting significant coverage by commercial antibodies. Recombinant antibodies outperformed monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Hundreds of underperforming antibodies were used in published studies, prompting manufacturers to reassess and alter usage or remove some from market. This study demonstrates the scale of the specificity problem and proposes a strategy to achieve proteome coverage using the existing repertoire and inform new generation. 

The researchers developed protocols to assess specificity in Western blot, immunoprecitation, and immunofluorescence and tested 614 antibodies against 65 targets chosen by funders to cover the mammalian proteome. The study provides an unbiased framework for representation and comparison of performance, coverage of proteins by high-performing antibodies, value of common characterization methods, and a strategy to identify renewable antibodies for all proteins. Approximately two-thirds of the protein set was covered by at least one high-performing antibody and half by at least high-performing recombinant antibody, indicating significant coverage by high-per antibodies. 

A dataset of commercial antibodies is presented as an assessment of performance and step toward a standardized validation ecosystem. 614 antibodies against 65 human were evaluated side-by in Western, immunrecipitation, and immunofluorescence. All data are available on https://ZODO.org/communitieschar/ and participating manufacturers' websites.
Researchers have developed a new tools to control gene expression in two different tissues in the same animal, which is crucial for studying how organs communicate with each other. They combined the GAL4/UAS system with another binary system, such as LexA or Q, to achieve this. They created a set of reagents to use these systems in Drosophila, focusing on genes with well-characterized GAL expression patterns. Over 40 LexA and Q insertions were made by CRISPR knock-in and verified for tissue specificity in larvae. Vectors were built to encode Q2 and Lex-G transcription factors in one vector. These were integrated into fly genome and FLP recombination used to isolate lines that express only Q2 or Lex-G. New shRNA vectors were used to evaluate Lex and Q systems for gene knockdown, creating a library of RNAi lines as resource. These tools will allow researchers to activate or repress two genes orthogonally in same animal.

A vector was made to generate driver that expresses Q2 and Lex-G, which can be excised with FLP to express only Q or Lex-G. Both Q and Lex systems were tested for gene knockdown and a library of shRNA lines created. A plasmid was synthesized for CRPR HDR and cloning of T2-Lex-G, T-Q, or T-Lex-G-T-Q fragments to produce donor plasmid. Genes with tissue-specific expression were selected, including major fly organs (Table 1). Most were fluorescent reporter genes, not genetic reagents like shRNA. Lack of fly reagents slowed studies requiring two binary systems, custom made by groups. Established methods generated drivers with tissue-specific patterns. Genes with GAL insertion and specificity were selected, evidence from RNAseq, in situ, and immunohisto. Donors were cloned into Cas-express embryos for CRPR HDR of T2-Lex-G or T-Q. A set of stocks, vectors, and protocols were made to expand Dophila researchers to modulate expression multiple tissues.
A transcription factor B11 (B11) has been linked to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with synaptic dysfunction. B11 is highly expressed in dentate gyrus granule neurons and is required for the structural and functional integrity of mossy-CA synapses. The molecular mechanisms, however, remained unclear. Researchers show that synaptic molecule C1 (C1) is a direct target of B11 that regulates vesicle recruitment and long-term potentiation at moss-CA synapses in vivo and vitro. Furthermore, C exerts its functions through interaction with specific neurexin-3 (N) variant N(25+. Interruption C-N interaction by expression non-binding C mutant or deletion N in dentate gyrus neurons recapitulates major B and C phenotypes. This study identifies novel C-N dependent pathway which B controls moss synapse function. Findings contribute mechanistic understanding neurodevelopment disorders by synaptic dysfunction.

B11 is involved in pathogenesis neurodevelopment and neuropsych disorders with synaptic dysfunction. Previous work demonstrated B11 essential synapse moss fiber adult hippocampus. Molecular mechanisms downstream B, however, elusive. B plays role development hippocamp moss fiber, adult hippoc neurogenesis, and learning. In mature hippocampus, B critical structural functional moss synapses, connections D and pyramidal neurons. Study identifies novel B/C dependent mechanism essential control synapse function. Genetic suggested components associated neurodevelopment neuropsych disorders synaptic dysfunction. Data demonstrate interconnected regulatory pathway.

Conditional ablation B in adult hippocampus leads structural functional changes syn characterized reduction, loss bouton, misdistribution, and loss. Reintroduction synaptic protein C, direct target B and downregulated B mutant, study first identifies B dependent pathway control synapse properties. Analysis regulatory mice provide insights pathogenesis neurodevelopment neuropsych disorders.
Researchers have investigated the role of the zinc finger protein S1 (S1) in regulating gene expression, specifically focusing on its ability to control the transcription of genes related to cell proliferation. They found that S1 can regulate transcription by binding to the promoter regions of genes, similar to known transcription activators, or by binding to the transcribed regions (gene bodies) where RNA polymerase II (Pol) is active. The study focused on the latter mode of S1 activity and found that after binding to the promoter, S1 binds to gene bodies and affects Pol configuration, causing dissociation or conformation change of its Rpb subunit and increased backtracking. Surprisingly, S1 binds to a subset of mRNAs during transcription and stabilizes them. The interaction between S1 and mRNAs is controlled by their promoters and coincides with S1 dissociation from chromatin. Intrigly, S dissociation from chromatin correlates with extent of backtracked Pol. They propose that after recruitment, S accompanies Pol and regulates backtracking. The back Pol is compatible with S relocation to nascent, where S accompanies mRN to cytoplasm and regulates stability. Thus, S co-transcription imprints mRNA fate, serving as paradigm for cross-talk between synthesis and decay of mRN, and paradigm for dual-role zinc-finger proteins. The interplay between S modes remains to be examined.

S1 impacts mRNA cycle from transcription to degradation. Its effect on elongation is linked to function on stabilization, suggesting functions connected. S possesses two zinc fingers. Correlation found between binding S to bodies and Pol occupancy in genes. Capacity to alter Pol in context R4 and affect back likely underlies widespread effect. Alteration configuration reflected in increased backtracking, indicated by values. Binding to bodies with Pol activity, particularly CR genes. Function in subset target genes extends beyond initiation and encompasses elong, as proposed earlier. Interaction with chrom has effect on Pol elong and mRN, suggesting mechanistic linkage. R4 subunit enhances Pol activity and promotes instability due imprinting. Taking observations, back associated with co-binding to nas. Reassuring, genes exhibit back also imprint, whereas do not. Unexpected, addition to feature, binds subpopulation mRN whose transcription stimulated.
Researchers investigated the connection between programmed cell death during plant development (PCD) and fungal accommodation in Arabidopsis thalian roots, focusing on the root-specific transcription factor ANAC/SMB and senescence-associated nuclease B1. Mutations in both PC regulators increased colonization by the beneficial fungus Serendita, primarily in the differentiation zone. The smb-3 mutants exhibited hypercolonization around the merematic zone and delayed S-induced root growth promotion. This suggests that root PC and post-mortem clearance of cellular corpses represent a defense mechanism restricting microbial invasion of the root. Reporter and transcriptional analysis revealed B1 expression downregulation during S colonization in mature epidermal cells, indicating a transcriptional control facilitating beneficial microbes in roots.

The study found that impaired PC in Arabidopsis smb- and b1 mutants increased colonization by the endophyte S. The smb-3 mutants displayed hypercolonization along the primary root, suggesting extra cell corpses surrounding smb roots provide additional nutrients for fungal colonization. PC protects the meristem from microbial colonization, but some microbes manipulate host PC processes by affecting B1 transcription to facilitate accommodation.

Transcriptome analysis tracking cell death gene expression during colonization showed significant decrease in B1 expression after 6 days post-inoculation in older root parts, independent of fungal colonization. Inoculated B1 reporter lines with S and observed reduction in activity in epider cells in contact with fungus compared to mock-treated roots. B1 expression and localization in cap xylem was not affected by S.
Researchers investigated how large vesicles, called exophers, are produced by stressed neurons in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans and their role in neurodegenerative disease. They found that mechanical force from the uterus potentiates exoph extrusion from stressed neurons. Exoph production peaks at day 2-3, coinciding with the worm's reproductive peak. Disrupting sperm, oocytes, or egg production strongly suppresses exoph from the AL neuron, while restoring egg production increases it. Interventions that promote exoph are associated with longer uterus lengths, while those that suppress it are associated with shorter lengths. Fertilized eggs, oocytes, or fluid in the uterus can enhance exoph production, not just the presence of fertilized eggs. The study suggests mechanical force from the uterus potentiates exoph from stressed neurons, highlighting the importance of mechanobiology in neurodegenerative disease.
Researchers have found evidence that a protein called Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) plays a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). They discovered that K3 is present in the amyloid plaques, which are a hallmark of AD, and investigated its contribution to synapse integrity in healthy and AD brains. The study found that K is upregulated in AD brains and its levels increase early in the disease. In mouse models of AD, extracellular K is increased and accumulates around dystrophic neuronal processes around plaques. Functionally, K triggers loss of excitatory synapses through blockade of Wnt/GSKβ signaling and increase inhibitory syn via W/JNK pathway. In contrast, K knockdown restores synapse and memory in mice.

The study shows that K regulates stability of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus through different pathways. In the AD mouse model, knocking down K ameliorates changes in excitatory and inhibitory synapse in the hippocampus before and after plaque deposition. Loss of syn around amyloid plaques is well described, but in vivo K loss-function ameliorates synaptic defects in mice, supporting that K is a key contributor to synaptic changes in this model. A feature of AD is loss syn around plaques. The study investigated whether K affects syn number plaques in 9-old mice. The impact of K on syn and function, affected by deficient signaling, in AD, remains studied. Investigating K in AD sheds light on mechanisms contribute syn vulnerability in.

Syn loss is the strongest correlate cognitive in AD, but mechanisms trigger changes poorly understood. This work investigated the function of W antagonist K on integrity and memory in healthy AD. Changes syn induced by silencing K unlikely due formation as observed similar changes when plaques absent. Line with view, knock does not affect number or size amyloid pla in the hippocampus. Gain-function demonstrate K directly affects integrity excitatory and inhibitory synapses.
Researchers have been searching for new ways to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and one approach is to find compounds produced by microbes that inhibit competitors. A study found that iron-chelating pyoverdines, produced by Pseudomonas bacteria, have antibacterial properties by withholding iron from pathogens. A screen of 320 Pseudas isolates against 12 human pathogens revealed several pyd with strong antibacterial properties and distinct characteristics. The most potent pyd reduced growth of Acinetobacter baumann, Klei pneumonia, and Staphlococcus aureus in a concentration-dependent manner. Pyd increased survival of infected Galleria mellella larvae showed low toxicity to mammalian cells and erythrocytes. Evolution of pathogens with whole-genome sequencing showed limited resistance to pyd. Pyd from environmental strains have potential to become new antibacterials against human pathogens.

The study investigated pyd produced by Pseudas have antibacterial activities against opportunistic pathogens through iron sequestration. A screen of 320 isolates and 12 pathogen strains revealed top candidates with broad-spectrum activity. Pyd produced by Pseud fluoresens biotype B have extremely high affinity for iron. Researchers propose pyd from non-pathogenic Pseudas reduce growth of opportunistic pathogens by intensifying iron competition. To test, pyd from 320 Pseud strains were screened for activity against 12 human opportunistic bacteria. Most promising candidates had chemical structure elucidated to understand properties for iron competition. The concept of siderore-mediated competition in natural communities was applied to human pathogens. Pyd from non-pathogenic bacteria induce iron starvation and growth arrest in pathogens, focusing on py, a class with high iron affinity produced by Pseudas. Administered to infected G mell larvae, survival rates increased with A baui and K pneumonia, demonstrating py antibacterial activity. Low toxicity and potential for resistance were observed. Overall, pyd from non-path Pseud have antibacterial properties.
Researchers have long known that schizophrenia is linked to disruptions in the prefrontal network, but the exact mechanisms behind these disruptions at the synaptic level are unclear. This gap in understanding hinders the discovery of genetic and environmental factors that contribute to prefrontal network failures in schizophrenia. To address this question, a recurrent spiking network model of prefrontal circuits was developed to explain the link between NMDA receptor synaptic and 0-lag synchrony deficits observed in a pharmacological monkey model of prefront network failure in schizophrenia. The study analyzed the balance between AMP and NMD components of recurrent excitation and GABA in the network's influence on oscillatory spike synchrony and found that reducing NMD synaptic currents prevents the network from shifting to an oscillatory state in response to extrinsic inputs, such as during behavior. These findings parallel the dynamic modulation of 0-l spike synchrony observed between neurons in prefront cortex during behavior and the suppression of 0-l spiking by NMD antagonists. The model provides a plausible link between NMD synaptic and 0ag synchrony deficits in pharmacological monkey prefront failure schizophrenia.

 The study established a theoretical basis for how NMD reduction in schizophrenia leads to desynchronization in prefront recurrent circuits, providing evidence that spiking networks near the boundary between asynchronous and synchronous states can explain various biological observations. Reducing NMD synaptic currents prevents networks from transitioning to oscillatory activity in response to extrinsic inputs, preventing 0ag synchrony. Prior studies addressed the relationship between NMD function and oscillatory prefront networks, but not the topic of how NMD recurrent excitation and external input influence spike timing and oscillatory dynamics in the presence of AMP. This study developed a spiking network to understand the link between NAR malfunction and reduced 0ag spiking observed in biological data.
Researchers have studied the process of angiogenesis, which is the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones in low-oxygen environments. They found that the initial steps of angiogenesis depend on the differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and St cell types, controlled by NOTCH-dependent cell communication. However, the dynamics of spatial patterning of this cell specification are not fully understood. By combining a controlled angiogenesis model with mathematical and computational analysis, they found that Tip-St cell patterning can undergo an order-disorder transition at high levels of pro-angiogenic VEGF. This results in robust but unstable differentiation for most cells, with a subset of Tip cells leading sprouting extensions. Sprouts form in a manner maximizing their distance, consistent with a Turing-like model dependent on fibronectin enrichment. NOT signaling mediates robust differentiation but not instructing subsequent steps in angiogenesis, requiring additional cues and self-organization. 

In the context of angiogenesis, the challenge is enabling vascular morphogenesis through responsive differentiation of endothelial cells into Tip and St states. This is guided by proangi cues like VEG and local organization by paracrine-NOTCH signaling. Recent models need to be tested for causality, but Turing-like mechanisms explain experimental results. Analysis supports a view of angi induction: VEG input induces NOT signaling and Tip cells that behave as sprouts. Inputs can specify fate, for example VEG promoting Tip and NOT St suppressing in same cell. Signaling can result in complex outcomes poorly understood. Based on Tip/St ratio, the model parameters were calibrated for VEG 100/ml matching experimental Tip/St at same VEG. To compare predictions and observations, the spatial patterning of Tip cells in angiogenesis was quantified.
Researchers investigated the role of the locus coeruleus (LC) in learning and memory, specifically its projections to the hippocampus, during fear conditioning in mice. The LC is known to modulate neural activity through norepinephrine release, but recent studies suggest it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other regions. The study found that LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli, and optogenetic stimulation enhances long-term memory formation. LC activity increases both norephrine and dopamine in the hippocampus, with dopamine release timing similar to LC activity. The study shows hippocampal dopamine is important for fear memory, while norephrine is not. 

 LC projections to the hippocampus are activated by salient learning events, enhancing long-term memory formation, but unclear which neurotransmitter is released during these responses. The LC is known as primary noreph source in the brain. Based on this and learning-related LC-HPC activity, dopamine release may be responsible, but direct manipulation is needed to confirm. The study shows LC increases dopamine and nph in the hippocampus, with dopamine required for fear memory and nph not. The LC and hippocampus are critical for memory formation, but temporal dynamics of LC-HC activity during learning are poorly understood due to spatial tasks.
